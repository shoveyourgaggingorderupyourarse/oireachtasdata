I am outside my usual habitat.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and committee members for their invitation to meet with the committee today.  I extend my best wishes to the committee, and, indeed, the new D&aacute;il, in its important work.<\/p> <p>  Just under 17 weeks ago, on 22 January, the World Health Organization, WHO, announced that there was evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus, Covid-19, in Wuhan, China.  Since then, the Department of Health, the HSE, the wider health sector and colleagues across the civil and public service and community and voluntary sectors have put in place an unprecedented response to an unprecedented emergency.  I am deeply proud of the way in which people in my own organisation have risen to the challenge, at great personal cost.  We must particularly express our deepest gratitude to the staff of our front-line health service who have met this challenge head-on with what has been the most supreme determination.<\/p> <p>  In the period since we first learned of Covid-19, there have been more than 4.7 million cases confirmed worldwide and at least 315,000 people have died.  In Ireland we have had more than 24,200 confirmed cases - that is the figure as of last night - and unfortunately, 1,547 deaths have been notified, each of them deeply mourned.<\/p> <p>  All crises come in phases.  This public health crisis has a particularly prolonged acute phase.  We have made definite progress in getting virus levels back down through stringent public health restrictions but the social and economic costs of Covid-19 have been huge and will be with us for some time.  Yesterday saw the first easing of these measures under the roadmap.  The bedrock of this progress has been the tremendous commitment on the part of citizens and communities to the behaviours necessary to reduce transmission.  The progress is such that we can now collectively take some calculated risks in extending the range of activities it is permitted to undertake but we need to be aware that we will continue to be in the acute emergency phase of this crisis for some time, with further waves an ever-present danger.  This is not a one, two or even three-day storm, after which we move to the recovery phase.  The acute phase of this crisis will definitely be measured in months and, most probably, years rather than days.<\/p> <p>  Our health service has been tested to the limits but not overwhelmed, as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and many of us feared.  None of us has seen anything like this before &ndash; the scale of the challenge is unprecedented but so, too, has been the response.  There has been a focus on moving quickly to utilise all available resources, recognising that our healthcare capacity is challenged even in normal times.  For example, we have introduced payments to GPs for telehealth so as to avoid unnecessary visits to surgeries.  The HSE has developed 29 community assessment hubs to avoid unnecessary hospitalisations.  Private hospital facilities have been secured in preparation for the surge and they are now helping with the non-Covid care that has been displaced from our major public hospitals.  The HSE, voluntary hospitals and other health agencies have worked with private nursing homes to support them in preventing or managing infection and continuing to care for our older people.<\/p> <p>  The health service has also been engaged in a massive effort to scale up our Covid-19 testing capacity.  Covid-19 is a new virus.  Four months ago there was no test for the virus, much less commercial supply of such tests and the infrastructure necessary to undertake testing at scale.  The HSE has striven each week to increase testing capacity with the opening of 47 testing centres, commissioning 40 additional labs for the testing of Covid-19, and procuring supplies against a backdrop of global shortages, and also implementing IT systems to manage referrals and automating processes.<\/p> <p>  The plane has been in flight while all this necessary work to improve its efficiency and range has been undertaken.  The issues that have been encountered along the way are well documented but, despite these, Ireland is positioned towards the top of the international testing league table.  Ireland is fourth highest in the EU in terms of tests completed in population terms.  To date, more than 280,000 tests have been conducted.  There is much more work to do, in particular, in improving test turnaround times, but this week the HSE is on target to have a testing capacity of 15,000 tests per day with an average turnaround time from swab to result of between one and three days.<\/p> <p>  The scale up of contact tracing by the HSE has also taken place.<\/p><p>The median turnaround time for giving someone a positive result and commencing contact tracing is just over one day.  There are outliers, and further improvements are planned and will be necessary to continue to improve turnaround and support any increase in contact tracing requirements associated with the greater circulation of people.<\/p><p> Congregated settings, by virtue of their physical nature and the susceptibility of those living there, are recognised by the World Health Organization, WHO, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, as involving higher risk of infection.  The deaths we have experienced in our long-term care facilities are the most difficult aspect of our experience with Covid-19 so far.  The testimony of those who lost loved ones and cannot say goodbye in the normal way is truly heartbreaking.  The international experience involving similar or in some cases worse problems than our own has been highlighted by WHO and ECDC, which made specific recommendations for this sector in the latter half of March.  Our commitment to testing and recording of all deaths, wherever they occur, means our figures are much more representative and accurate than in many countries.  We have also undertaken a comprehensive survey of deaths in long-term residential care to ensure that we are fully and transparently capturing the actual position.  Since the outset of this emergency there has been a high level of alertness to the vulnerability of older people in general and those in long term-care in particular.<\/p><p> Important new and international information has emerged-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt, but I would ask Mr. Breslin to conclude so that we have enough time for questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#H00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1589842800,"counter":47,"content":"<p>We must be frank in acknowledging that the crisis is continuing and our conclusions must be tentative and preliminary.

As of today there have been more than 4.5 million cases worldwide, with 24,200 of these in Ireland.  Sadly, 1,547 people in Ireland have lost their lives.  We are acutely conscious of the grief that people have experienced over the past three months.  I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest condolences to all those who have lost loved ones.<\/p> <p>  We first heard reports of a novel coronavirus infection during the second week in January.  Immediately, senior public health people in this country began to confer, monitor and collaborate with colleagues internationally.  It became clear from an early stage that this would become a significant challenge for the world.  It is equally true that the world's experience with this virus is still unfolding, with tragic consequences for many countries, irrespective of levels of preparedness, wealth or development.<\/p> <p>  While we had high levels of preparedness arising from our experience with pandemic influenza and other public health challenges, it was quickly clear to us that this virus was very different.  The ease of its transmission and its severity, particularly for those who are vulnerable, combined with the fact that there is no natural immunity to this virus, no medicines available for its specific treatment and no vaccines, has presented an unprecedented global public health challenge.<\/p> <p>  To that end, on 30 January the WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern.  The NPHET, which has been at the centre of our public health response, held its first meeting on 27 January 2020 and has held 31 meetings to date.  Its role has been to provide clear advice to members of the public on how to protect themselves, their families and their communities, and when necessary to provide advice to the Government through the Minister for Health regarding wider societal public health measures.<\/p> <p>  By the middle of March it became evident that unprecedented action was needed to prevent the spread of infection, high rates of hospitalisation and intensive care unit admissions and significant mortality.  Our collective actions have suppressed this infection, protected the health of people in this country and undoubtedly saved lives.<\/p> <p>  The cornerstone of the response in this country has been based on a public health evaluation of risk and public health-informed recommendations to Government as to what measures can be taken at each point to minimise the impact of this disease.<\/p><p>However, there is no certainty that we can keep this virus suppressed.  The advice of NPHET is that we now ease restrictions in a phased risk-based manner, while maintaining close vigilance of the spread and impact of this virus to ensure that we can safely recommence work, social engagement, education and the day-to-day operation of the health service.<\/p><p> NPHET will continue to advise the Government, through the Minister for Health, to ensure that the decisions the Government takes are informed by public health considerations, while recognising that the Government will also need to take into account wider economic, social and other considerations as part of the phased unwinding of restrictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Holohan for being so precise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#J00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Breslin and Dr. Holohan to the Chamber and thank them both for the work they have been doing.  I know they have been working flat out for several months and it is greatly appreciated.  I wish them the very best with their ongoing efforts.  As Mr. Breslin said, we are still very much in the emergency or acute phase.<\/p> <p>  We have ten minutes.  I have five questions and I might ask both witnesses those questions, which should give them time to answer and if there is sufficient time we can go back and forth.  I will start with testing and tracing.  At last week's briefing, the health spokespersons from the HSE said that the median turnaround time from referral to getting a result back was five days.  We heard from the Minister in the Chamber last week that the target time is three days, which still feels quite long.  Mr. Breslin stated that in some instances this is now down to between one and three days.  What is the current position and what is the target?  Is it that we want to get a 24-hour turnaround across the board or for high-risk groups like healthcare workers, elderly people and so forth?<\/p> <p>  The second question I have is on the impact on the health system.  Before the Covid virus arrived, the health system was struggling.  The Covid virus has been catastrophic for healthcare facilities and ongoing work, but just as worrying are the medium-term impacts.  Mr. Breslin said we could be dealing with this for months and potentially years.  My understanding is that HSE hospitals used to have a bed occupancy rate of 95% but in the Covid world it will have to be no more than 80% in order that we can guard against a surge.  Doctors have told me that the number of patients that can be operated on in a given theatre list is down by about half because of all the Covid hygiene and cleaning requirements.  I believe it was discussed here last week, and other consultants have stated, that the number of patients that can now be seen by any given doctor and his or her team in an outpatient clinic session could be down by between 30% and 50%.  On top of that, Paul Reid said an additional &euro;1 billion would probably be required for PPE on an ongoing basis.  Has an analysis been done on how diminished the HSE's healthcare capacity will be, how long is it believed that will be the case and what can be done about this extremely challenging situation?<\/p> <p>  My third question relates to private hospitals.  The reason for taking over these hospitals made a lot of sense and it was a brave thing to do.  We all saw the awful scenes from Italy and other places where patients who were critically ill were being treated in car parks.  Clearly, the situation is not working at the moment.  There seems to be a 30% occupancy rate and figures being collected by doctors suggest it has fallen since last week.  Many of the operating theatres and diagnostic machines are not working as they could.  About half the private consultants have signed up.  It seems, at the same time, that we will use public healthcare money to treat private patients in private hospitals.  This is money that would usually be provided by the insurance companies.  The intention is noble on all sides in that we are trying to procure more healthcare capacity for public patients at this time, but it is clearly not working in terms of using the healthcare assets we have, nor in terms of public money.  We are told the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, has identified about 5,000 public patients who could be treated in private hospitals, whereas &euro;50 million in the pre-Covid world procured approximately 21,000 procedures.<\/p><p>I know a review is under way but, given that we are spending &euro;115 million or more a month and that the assets are clearly not being used while men, women and children around the country are suffering, deteriorating and, in some cases, may lose their lives or be permanently damaged because this capacity is not being used, is it now time to quickly decide to cancel the contract while retaining an option for surge capacity in the future and to redeploy the money involved to the NTPF?  This would mean that insurance companies would continue to pay for the private patients to be treated in private hospitals and that we could supercharge the NTPF, allowing us to make serious inroads into public patient waiting lists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#J00300","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":54,"content":"<p>The Deputy has used almost five minutes.

What is the medium to longer-term strategy?  Some people are saying we need to crush the curve as was done in Australia and New Zealand, allowing these countries to open up more widely.  South Korea has taken a different approach that consists of very comprehensive testing, tracing and isolation.  Sweden took a different approach, which was broadly to stay open.  It has approximately the same fatality rate as Ireland.  Has a strategy been decided on?

The target, which I believe we will achieve, is to reduce this to three days for 70% of all tests.  There will be further improvements in this regard.  One such improvement is to text people whose results are negative.  This automation will speed things up.  We want to continue to improve in this area.  The system was patched together but it now needs to be redesigned end to end.  The HSE is doing this and is working on its information systems and processing systems to get testing as close to real time as possible.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the impact on health services, on 5 May, NPHET advised that we could restart non-essential care within the health services.  We are in the process of ramping up and planning for that in what will be a very different environment.  It will undoubtedly take longer to do many procedures.  To take endoscopy as an example, a single endoscopy is usually very quick to do.  One will now have to put PPE on, do the procedure, take the PPE off again, decontaminate the area, and then bring someone back in.  It will take longer and will cost more so there is a good chance we will end up doing less over this period.  The way to buffer that is with innovation such as using technology, including telehealth and so on.  The healthcare environment, however, will be very challenged for the foreseeable future.<\/p> <p>  On private hospitals, it is relevant that non-essential care was not taking place in either public or private hospitals up until the start of this month.  We are, therefore, also in a ramping-up phase in private hospitals.  A good deal more than half of consultants have signed up.  We have made good progress in recent days.  The Deputy is right however.  Before the end of this month we need to stand back and review the situation in its entirety.  One of the mandates we had in conducting negotiations was to prevent a situation in which, during the course of a pandemic, private patients could be in private hospitals because they had private health insurance while their care was paid for by the taxpayer.  This would have undercut solidarity in our national effort.  That was the motivation behind the arrangements we have put in place.  It is important to acknowledge that a further wave or surge could happen at any stage and, in that case, we would need that capacity.  The health system is not well-endowed with capacity.  <\/p> <p>  I may return to the question of the medium to longer-term strategy as answering would eat into Dr. Holohan's time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1589842800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>In the interests of time, I will not supplement Mr. Breslin's answers too much but I will say that testing and tracing should not be seen in isolation; it should be seen as part of a set of public health advice.  Individual members of the public can help shorten the time to diagnosis by coming earlier.  In addition to the enhancements that have been made to testing and tracing, we are advising individuals who are experiencing cold and flu-like symptoms not to put off the phone call to the doctor to see how they are until tomorrow but to make contact early.  That gives us a greater chance, as do the improvements Mr. Breslin has outlined.<\/p> <p>  I could speak about the overall strategy at some length but I am conscious of the committee's time.  Comparisons have been made to a number of different countries.  With regard to New Zealand, western Europe has been the epicentre of this infection; New Zealand is on the other side of the world.<\/p><p>It is 2,500 miles from the nearest landmass.  It is not part of a political, economic legal, social, cultural union with a number of other countries, like Ireland is.  Direct comparisons - I am not suggesting the Deputy is making them - that others have made are not entirely valid.  The spread of infection to that part of the world was a much later event and much smaller.  They did take decisive action as I believe we did in this country.  However, we were very close to the epicentre of this infection in a way that New Zealand simply is not.<\/p><p> Regarding Sweden, much has been said about mortality.  I do not want to point unduly at comparisons between different countries, but we have to be sure we are counting the same things.  We think in terms of direct comparisons.  Admissions to intensive care are probably a more reliable measure of the burden of infection.  Sweden has had a much bigger challenge than this country on that measure.  When I checked yesterday it had almost 400 people in intensive care.  If we adjusted for population that would be the equivalent of almost 200 people in intensive care here; we have 50.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and witnesses for staying in the time allocated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#L00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I thank both witnesses for their evidence and for being here.

I will ask my questions and if we have time for an interaction, that is fine.<\/p> <p>  Yesterday we began the reopening of the economy.  I am conscious that 100,000 construction workers are going back to work, which will pose a challenge for them in their workplaces and for their families when they go home.  It will also pose a broader public health challenge.  We are aware that specific guidelines for the operation of construction sites are in place.  Later we will have a conversation with people about how they will be enforced.  Is there a specific plan to test and trace those people who are now going back to work?  I am sure the witnesses will agree testing and tracing are much easier when the country is on pause or shut down.  Now as the economy begins to reopen, is a specific plan in place to cater for the numbers of people who will now be moving around and who previously had not been doing that?<\/p> <p>  We note the specific plan in place for construction workers.  Is there similar guidance and advice for transport workers, postal workers and other people who will now be going to work and will have more work to do.  Transport workers will be bringing people to and from work.  It has struck me that - maybe it is necessarily so - some of the measures have been reactive rather than proactive.  I would have thought the officials would have used the time on pause to make preparations for reopening the economy.  I ask the witnesses to outline those specific preparations, in line with protecting the health, safety and welfare of those workers who will be returning to work out of necessity in the coming days.  Indeed, some were back at work yesterday.<\/p> <p>  With regard to healthcare workers, the latest figure I had heard was an infection rate of around 25% to 30% among our healthcare workers.  That is very concerning and I am sure the witnesses are also very concerned about that.  I ask them to comment on how they think that happened, because it is not in line.  I have heard members of the Government and others make comparisons between us and South Korea and other countries.  We can make all the comparisons we like, but as far as I am aware nowhere else is that figure as high.  I ask the witnesses to comment on how it got so high among our healthcare workers and what specific measures are in place.  Is it due to the chronic understaffing we had as we came into this?  Is that a factor?<\/p> <p>  I will not go over the reported tensions between the Department and the HSE.  All those have been well ventilated in the public domain.

Are the witnesses finding them useful?  Are they minuted and if so, can they be published so we can all be up-to-date on it?<\/p> <p>  I have a question on nursing homes.  According to the Minister for Health, on 19 February Paul Reid met the director of Nursing Homes Ireland.  What actions were taken?  It strikes me that some time was lost and that the measures put in place in the nursing home sector were, as I have previously described, reactive rather than proactive.

The figure is slightly over 30% - it is 31.5% as of yesterday - which is a high percentage.  It should be borne in mind that we have prioritised healthcare workers for testing and, unlike many countries, we have completed a significant testing programme in residential care facilities.  The staff in those settings were both tested and identified as positives and will be part of that figure.  We have been proactive on this but there is no question that it has been a challenge.  It reflects the fact that healthcare workers are in the front line.  They are at risk of picking up this infection by virtue of the work they do.  There is also the challenge that healthcare workers, when they are infected, are a source of potential infection both for the people they serve and the communities in which they live and are part of.  That is a particular challenge and continuing cause for concern to address that.

I have one question and I ask the witnesses to respond as they wish.  First, I congratulate them on their excellent professionalism, their work and their credibility.  I want to tell all the health workers who have given so much to all of us, and all the essential workers in the country, how much we respect them for what they have done.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask a question about all of those people who, sadly, have passed away in our nursing homes.  I know it is not just in Ireland that this is happening but all over the world.  If we want to benchmark the state of our nursing homes, public and private, the most recently published data, which are from August 2019, show there were 31,000 residents in 581 homes.  Only 123 of those 581 homes were fully compliant with the HIQA regulations.  Compliance was down from 27% in 2017 to 23% in 2018.  Compliance with regulation 27, which deals specifically with infection control, was inspected by HIQA in only 215 of those 581 homes in 2018.  Of those, 37 were found to be non-compliant.  As such, non-compliance in providing very basic protection for residents in terms of infection control stood at 18%.<\/p> <p> The HIQA report also found rates of non-compliance in the areas of governance management, fire precautions, residents' rights, risk management, and training and staff development of 32%, 34%, 27%, 22% and 19%, respectively.  Were the witnesses aware of this or did HIQA advise them of it?  What benchmark were they were given for the fight they had to fight, given that their hands were clearly tied by virtue of the fact that this was a new virus the world had never seen before?  As they acknowledge, we knew that nursing homes were the most vulnerable.  We knew from the evidence that this would be the case.  My question is very clear.  Can the witnesses give an absolute and categorical assurance to me now that all nursing homes, public and private, in this State are fully compliant in terms of infection control?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#N00900","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Who does the Deputy wish to answer that question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#N01000","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1589842800,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I am happy to kick off.  I thank the Deputy for the congratulations.  What we have been engaged in is providing advice on an overall framework.  All of the progress made has been made by the Irish people.  There is no one actor in this.  There has been cross-party support for it.  Every sector has given support to it but, ultimately, it is down to the behaviour change that we have made and that we will have to sustain into the future.<\/p> <p>  In regard to nursing homes, undoubtedly, anybody who has observed, as I have, nursing homes over an extended period will have seen the development of that sector.  The Deputy mentioned the regulation of the sector by HIQA and the introduction of new standards and infection control guidance, which are particularly relevant in this situation.  We have infection control standards in place.  I believe the current version of the standards is from 2018.<\/p><p>That would be very consciously part of the responsibilities of the people in charge of those nursing homes, whether these are private or public.   HIQA plays a very important role in reinforcing that responsibility.  It has done so throughout the Covid-19 crisis.  It is currently engaged in an assessment process on Covid-19.  However, right from the start HIQA reached out and issued guidance and notices to providers about their responsibilities.<\/p><p> That is not to say that this is easy.  The CMO can talk on that but this is a much more infectious virus than the typical flu that we experience and is much more severe in its impact and yet it is hard to keep flu out of a nursing home during the winter period.<\/p><p> Much work has gone into this sector.  I will not say that all of it has been perfectly executed nor will I say that there has not been learning in this.  There has been a great deal of learning.  The CMO has talked about the fact that the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, have updated their guidance on this.  There is no doubt that this is and continues to be an absolute focus of the overall public health effort as is the importance of ensuring that everybody who is running a nursing home is very clear on what his or her responsibilities are, on what good practice is, and has the support to do that in every instance.   That will be to the fore as to how we continue to manage the virus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#N01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Breslin and now call Deputy Ossian Smyth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#O00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I will start with Mr.  Breslin.

When are they going to get treatment or are any of them getting treatment at the moment or is there an alternative path for them?  People have been coming to me to say that they have no idea when this is going to happen.  Is there a date when we will be returning to treating at least non-elective patients who require treatment?  I presume that some of these people will die and that this will be seen in the mortality statistics at the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  Our hospital system is often at 100% capacity, not just our emergency departments but our acute hospitals also.  In the future we will have reduced capacity.  Due to social distancing we will be down to 60% to 70%.  How are we going to cope in that situation?  It seems that we need the excess capacity from the private hospitals but we need to obtain it in a different way.  Deputy Donnelly referred to this.  Is there a way that we can use a less crude method done than just sequestering the entire empty private hospital?

We have more than 280 private hospital consultants on board.  More are finalising their position with us, which is the majority of the cohort.  The private hospitals are happy with the sign up that they have at this stage and that it can work within their hospitals and that we have the manpower to do so.<\/p> <p>  On the continuity of care issues that the Deputy has referred to, that is dependent on the consultant under whose care the person is being treated.  If that consultant signs up to the arrangements, all of his or her patients move across with him or her at the very point in treatment that they are at.  They do not go back to the start of the queue or back to a GP.  They stay with that consultant based on the point that they are at on the care spectrum.  The one distinction is that they do not pay a fee to that hospital consultant nor does the health insurer.

If patient moves across, he or she moves either to another private hospital consultant who has signed up, or to a consultant assigned from within the public system.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the point about how much activity that there can be in this period.  We are organising and re-organising all of the activity, so many things that were happening in public hospitals have now moved lock, stock, and barrel into private hospitals.  We want to keep it away from an area that might have Covid, and run it in the private hospital, and run it in a facility that is purpose-built for that.  The private hospital facility makes an important contribution to how we meet healthcare needs at this stage.  What we will have to review is the extent to which we continue with that.  The point that I wish to make, and I made it earlier, is that the mandate that we started from was not to have a dual system of public funds going into a private hospital and then fee income coming in at the same time.  We may change that, but the question that presents in that situation is whether there are different incentives for treating private patients in that situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":97,"content":"<p>If 280 consultants have signed up, how many consultants have not?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#P00300","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1589842800,"counter":98,"content":"<p>There are about 450.

I have three questions for him.  They concern the basis and rationale for decision-making and the need to be much more transparent about decision-making, not least to keep the public and everybody else with him.  We are quite different from other countries in that we do not release much of the data, make the data open source or explain as we go along.  For example, when the decision was taken to open schools in Denmark, a full risk assessment was done and the outcome published, so everybody knew that the R-nought number was likely to go up a small bit, as it did before coming back down again.  Everybody bought in to the decision to reopen Danish schools.  I am not specifically talking about schools but the need for very robust risk assessment and to be very open and transparent about it.  What expertise and tools are available to NPHET to risk assess all of the major decisions that are being made?<\/p> <p>  The R-nought number currently stands at around 0.5.  That is very hard to understand given the profile of the people who have been tested in recent times.  In the main, they are people who had a lot of contacts and therefore, presumably, there was a lot of transmission.  On what is the R-nought number based?  Is it based on a theoretical model and, if so, can the model be published?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Holohan has talked a great deal about the need to understand the behaviour of the virus.  What is his current estimate of the prevalence of the virus in the community?  It is very hard to understand that.  Last night, the figure for new cases was 88.  It is fantastic that it has fallen so low.  If 88 cases represent a 3% positive testing rate, the total number of people whose results we got yesterday was less than 3,000.  That figure does not sit logically with the approach of needing to do 15,000 tests per day.

Nobody has doubts about that.  Dr. Holohan said he has a concern about health workers.  The infection rate among healthcare workers is very high - Dr. Holohan said it is 31%.  Why is it so much higher among Irish healthcare workers than it is in other jurisdictions?  It is one of the highest.  Why is that the case?  What advice did the HSE get on healthcare workers?  I have been asking about this since the second week of March.  According to the NPHET minutes the team got advice twice from the expert advisory group, on 7 March and 10 March, relating to healthcare workers.  On 16 March I asked what those advices were and I still have not received an answer.  I have asked repeatedly to see the advice, recommendations and minutes from the expert advisory group.  This is terribly important given the high level of infection among our healthcare workers.<\/p> <p>  To bring Dr. Holohan up to speed on the position, and I do not understand this, an agency nurse who was recruited by a Dublin hospital two weeks ago has tested positive for the coronavirus in recent days.  She was not tested when entering that hospital, where there are many elderly people.<\/p><p>I do not understand this.  I would like to see the advice that was given by the expert advisory group in March about healthcare workers and I would like an explanation on why we have such a high infection rate among healthcare workers.  How on earth can we have a situation where healthcare workers are coming in to work with vulnerable people two months into this crisis when we know there is a problem with healthcare workers' infection rate and that they are not being tested before they start work with elderly people?  We then discover it two weeks later.  Are healthcare workers who go to visit the elderly in their homes being tested before they do that work?  Are there regular tests of healthcare workers when they are working to make sure they are not infected?  I would appreciate answers to those questions.

I cannot answer about the specifics of why an individual nurse is not tested, as the Deputy will appreciate.<\/p> <p>  We have had a significant programme of testing throughout the residential and community sector, including in nursing homes.  Staff and patients in all settings have been tested.  A public health-led set of decisions has determined who gets tested and when.

The next meeting of NPHET was due to be this morning, and will consider the question of prioritisation, with regard to the next categories that we think are important for testing.

Who is responsible for managing positive tests and the negative tests?  Deputy Naughten brought in information during the week about meat factories.  We have had contact occurring with management in meat factories but not directly with the patients, to say that patients had tested positive.  On the other hand, negative test results have taken more than two weeks to come back.  There are significant issues which Mr. Breslin might address.<\/p> <p>  Some 45% of our population has private health insurance and is, at present, excluded from accessing general consultants' work and any opportunity to have treatment.  Mr. Breslin said that a significant number of doctors have signed up to the type A contract.  How many surgeons have signed up to the type A contract?  It is my understanding that in private hospitals, where much elective work is done, that if there is no surgeon to do it, there is not much point in having the other consultants on board.  Some &euro;115 million is going out per month to secure the hospital contract.  I see in data from 18 May that only 30% of beds in private hospitals are taken up.  Many of these are long-stay patients from public hospitals who have been moved out.

The private hospitals are open to the whole community at this stage.  It is a clinical judgment as to who gets admitted.  That will not be decided on somebody's insurance.

However, I would not expect the type of huge bias that the Deputy is inferring.  Surgeons need hospitals.  In order to practise, they would want to have access to private hospitals.

It is important for questions that the public has and for which we need to have answers.<\/p> <p>  On testing, many samples have been sent to Germany at a massive cost.  I understand a new plane was required to fly them in and out of the country.  I have spoken to labs here about testing that could have been done in Ireland.  Animal Health Laboratories Limited is testing for Covid-19.  Tests go into the lab in the morning and the results come back in the evening.  This company felt that if it had a few more resources, it could have done anything up to 5,000 plus tests a week.  While it has been considered by private hospitals, it has not been considered by the HSE.  Why did we go to the massive expense of flying our samples to Germany, waiting up to three weeks?  I have had cancer patients contacting me who cannot have cancer treatment because they are waiting three weeks for results.  We find out that this kind of test could have been done in Ireland and created jobs locally.  It could be looked at going forward.<\/p><p>I am not trying to point fingers here because the witnesses have done some tremendous work and I do not want to be seen to be critical in any way.  However, that is the point that I would really appreciate an answer on.  The HSE has taken over the 19 private hospitals at a cost of &euro;115 million per month.  It is completely understandable that a deal had to be done initially to secure capacity in respect of Covid-19.  No one knew where this would go initially and the HSE had to do so, but the light switch for medical care for all other patients has been turned off.  There are now 2.2 million citizens with private healthcare who will have had no option but to join the public waiting list as of 30 April.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, recorded 770,000 people in hospitals and clinics.  Other countries have had to do something similar and they have reverted.  I am asking the same thing.  Are we considering the gradual reopening of private hospitals to people with private health insurance?  It is important and there is fierce worry out there that people with serious health issues need to be seen.  They are paying for private healthcare but that is not available at the present.<\/p><p> Did the HSE, in its consultations, remove elderly and sick people from hospitals and put them into nursing homes and community hospitals without testing them?  There are other questions but I would prefer to have those answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#T01000","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1589842800,"counter":156,"content":"<p>On the German lab, I can say it is not more expensive than Irish labs, including some of those that we have introduced more recently.  The number of labs that are now testing in the National Virus Reference Laboratory, NVRL, has gone from one to 41, so we have taken account of capacity where we have been able to find it.  With reference to lengths of time, a backlog of tests went to Germany and therefore by the time those people got their result there was a delay.  However, the results coming back from Germany are very much within the next day, so there is not that length of time.  The HSE will always look commercially at where best to do this and have regard to the turnaround time.  That will be a dynamic situation which we will keep under review as we go along.  We have added significant private sector labs in Ireland.  One of our biggest labs now is a private sector lab, so there is an openness in the HSE to try to secure turnaround and cost effectiveness, but also the quality that we need, which would be foremost.<\/p> <p>  I have said what I have said on private hospitals.  I do not envisage that people will have to go right back to the start of a waiting list.  That is not what the policy says.  There will be a review before the end of the month.  We will take everything into account, but one of those things will be the World Health Organization's advice that the most likely scenario here is for recurring waves.  The idea that we had our experience and now we can move on is absolutely not the case.  We could be subject to a further wave, in which case we would be back to looking at a modest amount of ICU capacity within our public health service and wondering if we will be able to cope in that situation.

I want to comment on one particular aspect regarding the private hospitals and private health insurance.  Is it effectively irrelevant for people to have private health insurance now?  If one takes the position outlined by Mr. Breslin, which is that the Department wishes to retain private hospitals under its control for the duration of the risk of the Covid-19 pandemic, which by his statement will be years, then effectively there is no private healthcare in Ireland and for most people that means an end to private health insurance.  There is no logic in paying for private health insurance.  Indeed, there is even a questionable logic in continuing to pay for this year's private health insurance.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Breslin said that someone who is in the system will obviously maintain his or her place in the system.  Am I correct in understanding that for somebody with a new complaint there is now no such thing as private healthcare?  Does that position have Government or departmental endorsement?

I will touch on some aspects of it but not maybe all of it.  It is all on the record, obviously placed before the committee.  I am grateful for the invitation to appear before the Special Committee on Covid-19.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, chief operations officer for the HSE, and Dr Colm Henry, our chief clinical officer.<\/p> <p>  I am aware that the special committee wishes to discuss three matters: testing and tracing; congregated settings; and the reopening of the economy.  The first two items are obviously specifically relevant to the HSE.  I will make a few opening remarks before focusing on those two issues.<\/p> <p>  Members will already be aware that the health services have faced the worst pandemic in living memory.  Since we became aware of the pandemic, the HSE has worked tirelessly to build our defences to protect the public from this potentially deadly virus.  My first message today is that while we have collectively managed to significantly reduce the transmission rate of Covid-19, the HSE remains resolute in its work to combat the virus.  However, we are still dealing with the virus and its potential impacts as we are here today, and we will be contending with COVID-19 for some considerable time to come.<\/p> <p>  Working with the board of the HSE, my primary focus as CEO is to continue the good work that has been completed to date in dealing with the impact of the virus and to ensure that we prepare for future potential surges.  The public would accept nothing less of us.<\/p> <p>  It is important to cast our minds back to late February and early March 2020 and recall the worrying scenes that were witnessed from Italy and many other countries in Europe with intensive care units and hospitals becoming overwhelmed with the dreadful virus.<\/p> <p>  Having worked for 30 years in the private sector and for now nine years in the public service, I have never seen such significant and important change undertaken and implemented by so many dedicated people in such a short timeframe.  I am extremely proud of how the healthcare system has responded in such difficult and worrying circumstances.  I pay particular tribute to our front-line workers.  I also recognise the contribution of the voluntary sector and many within the private healthcare sector who have collaborated with us in the national effort.  This has been with the support of major Departments and State agencies.  I also thank the political system overall for giving us its support throughout, particularly in the early phases of this pandemic.<\/p> <p>  I will reference some of the achievements we have managed to put in place in recent weeks to protect the public.  We have strengthened our ICU capacity from a base of 225 beds to an operable capacity of just over 400 beds, putting in place a surge plan with the support of the purchase of extra ventilators.  We have secured a large and sustainable supply of PPE and other equipment in a highly volatile global market.  This has been achieved with the support of major State agencies, particularly IDA Ireland and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.<\/p> <p>  We have put in place agreements with over 3,500 GPs across the country to support us on new pathways of care.  We have had the mobilisation of the National Ambulance Service in a way that has never been done before.  We have 47 swab testing centres across the country.  We have moved from having one laboratory supporting testing to having 41 laboratories now involved.  Some 1,800 staff have been trained in contact tracing.  We have provided a wide range of supports to long-term residential care facilities.  We have put in place innovative ways to support vulnerable groups.  We have the use of telehealth, with new technologies deployed over a very short space of time.<\/p> <p>  This has all been achieved in a very short time and I thank all the agencies and Departments which have worked with us throughout this.  I pay particular thanks to our front-line workers who have pioneered many new ways of working and have shown an agility and resilience that has been truly extraordinary.  Many lives have been saved because of their skill, innovation and commitment.  I am, however, deeply conscious that many have lost loved ones during the Covid-19 pandemic, including healthcare workers.  I again extend my sincere condolences to all of those families.<\/p> <p>  Testing and tracing have represented a very significant mobilisation for the HSE overall.  Last week, we published our change management plan to give us the capacity to process 100,000 tests per week.  This involved 41 laboratories now for Covid testing, the availability of 47 swabbing centres across the country, and the deployment of new systems and supports to improve automation and turnaround times.<\/p><p>Along with the increased capacity we have recently introduced some innovations.  These include a GP service called &ldquo;Find my Test&rdquo; for tests which go beyond the committed time frames; a 14-day active management of contacts of a confirmed case; automatic texting of confirmed negative cases, speeding up receipt of this result; automatic testing for contacts of a confirmed case; automated scheduling of appointments to reduce waiting times; automatic test referral for contacts of confirmed cases; improved notification of complex cases to our public health teams; and an automated IT solution that now transfers test results to our contact tracing teams in 90 minutes where previously it was 24 hours.<\/p><p> I am pleased to report significant progress which has put us in a much stronger position to achieve our capacity on targets for the coming weeks.  Our focus now is to improve turnaround times significantly.  We have committed to an average turnaround time from swabbing to test result-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#OO00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Reid to sum up if he can as he has gone over his five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#PP00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1589842800,"counter":277,"content":"<p>Okay, I appreciate that.

I would also like to thank the public for their tremendous support to date and for what they have sacrificed, which has been very significant.

I thank them for their work to date and the response of the healthcare sector.  I have four or five questions which I will put them to all three witnesses and whoever wishes to respond may do so.<\/p> <p>  This awful pandemic has borne down heaviest on older people, in particular those in nursing homes and residential facilities.  Latest figures indicate that 62% of those who died were in such settings.  I welcome that testing has been ramped up in nursing homes in recent weeks and all have been tested, staff and residents alike, but such testing should be carried out on a consistent basis.  Regular testing in nursing homes will provide some reassurance for residents, their carers and families.  Some felt badly let down at the outset.  Is there a plan to roll out regular testing on a monthly or two-monthly basis in residential settings?<\/p> <p>  Nursing homes closed their doors to visitors on 6 March to protect residents and staff.  How many patients were transferred from acute hospitals to step-down facilities - residential homes or nursing homes - during the month of March?  Were they tested for Covid prior to their transfer?  Of those transferred, do we know which patients subsequently contracted Covid and how many have passed away?<\/p> <p>  Deaths are highly concentrated in the three age groups over 65 years, which account for 93% of all deaths from Covid-19.  Was this the expectation of the witnesses at the beginning?  If so, why was the response very slow on personal protection equipment, PPE, and staff support in the nursing and residential home sector?  While there were significant issues around sourcing PPE initially, the level of deaths among those over 65 years suggests the response was slow at the outset.<\/p> <p>  The restoration of BreastCheck and CervicalCheck are vital for the health of women.  A clear plan needs to be put in place to address the backlog that has built up during the Covid pandemic, when, understandably, the screening services were suspended.  The time has come to supercharge screening as a priority.  Routinely, 34,000 tests are taken monthly.  Figures published last week showed that no mammograms were carried out in April and that samples sent to CervicalCheck labs decreased by 93%.<\/p><p>In terms of my question, when can we see a resumption of those services and what plans will be put in place to deal with the backlog?<\/p><p> I turn now to the homecare sector and the wearing of face masks.  Recently, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, issued guidance for immediate implementation that surgical masks should be worn by healthcare workers when providing care within two m. of a patient, irrespective of the Covid-19 status of the patient.  Most people receiving home care will be older or more likely to have an underlying health condition and are obviously more vulnerable to the virus.  Can Mr. Reid provide any clarity on that?  Are face masks mandatory for a homecare worker who may be entering six or seven different homes on any given day?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#PP00500","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Reid to reply to those questions.

I will reply to some of the questions and then call on some of my colleagues.  I will be brief going through them to allow my colleagues make some comments also.  First, in terms of nursing homes, I will make some general comments.  We have said repeatedly that this is a novel virus and as it has spread across Europe, every country is learning about it.  We, too, have been learning in terms of how it can spread, particularly in a congregated setting and among a vulnerable group.  While we have been aware previously of symptomatic patients, what we have seen in the past few weeks of this pandemic in Ireland is that many in the more vulnerable and elderly population can be asymptomatic, thereby allowing the virus to spread within nursing home settings.  We have had to learn from very different symptoms and, in some cases, no symptoms being shown.<\/p> <p>  On the specific question about testing and nursing homes, we have completed a very significant testing process throughout all of the long-term residential care areas.  We have completed all of the nursing homes, both public and private, the mental health facilities and we are well advanced in the disability sector also.  A very significant programme has been undertaken by our community and national ambulance services.<\/p> <p>  We are currently getting some guidance from our public health lead in the country who is developing a strategy that will be recommended to NPHET shortly.  That will set out our entire testing process looking ahead to the coming weeks, both in terms of long-term residential care settings and other vulnerable groups and areas of people we would proactively test.  That will be part of the recommendations that will go to NPHET.  I might ask Dr. Colm Henry to make a couple of comments on that issue.<\/p> <p>  The second question related to the transfer of elderly patients from acute settings to nursing home settings.  As I said in my opening statement, we should cast our minds back to the start of this pandemic.  The experience, particularly across Europe, was that a massive surge had impacted hospital and acute settings.  Where we needed to provide massive supports also was in acute settings.  We would have had an ongoing process of what we would call delayed transfers of care where people are deemed clinically fit and not suitable to be in an acute hospital setting for the transfer of those patients, and in most cases elderly patients, out of that care.  That is a process we would have done, and that was the right thing to do at the point in time of doing it.<\/p> <p>  Third, on the PPE and supply generally to nursing homes overall, as we said a couple of times, this is a very different way for the HSE to work completely with the private nursing homes to the way and extent we have done in the past few weeks.  The supports we have put in have ranged from, in some cases, a very significant number of staff.  More than 450 staff are now redeployed across long-term residential care settings, including private nursing homes.  We have another range of supports in terms of clinical specialists including geriatricians who would go in.  Generally, we have multidisciplinary teams who would go in and give advice around infection control.  Where outbreaks have taken place, our public health teams have gone in directly to those locations, including private nursing homes, and obviously the State-funded support scheme for private nursing homes has been part of that.  We would have put in a range of supports, including PPE.  I would make the point briefly that in the past few weeks the vast majority of our PPE has been distributed not to our acute settings but to long-term care settings, primarily nursing homes and, increasingly, home supports.<\/p><p>I will make two brief comments and I will then ask my colleague, Dr. Colm Henry, to comment on screening services.  We are anxious to get back to non-Covid levels of service in many of our services, in particular screening services.  This will be a very difficult period because we have to restore some of our services in a way that protects the public.  Nobody will thank us if we restore services in a way that means we see public health outbreaks of the virus.  It is a big challenge to get back to previous levels of services, particularly in cancer treatment.  I repeat that if people have symptoms or feel they have symptoms, the clinical pathway is to definitely go back to their GP.  Referrals are still taking place for support for people with symptoms.  Restoring screening services is one area that Dr. Colm Henry is leading on with my colleague, Ms Anne O'Connor.  They will come back with recommendations on how we can restore the range of services in a way that is safe for the public. <\/p><p> I will ask Ms O'Connor to comment on masks but I will make a brief comment to give some context.  The NPHET definition on the wearing of masks by homecare workers has changed.  During this pandemic, we have been distributing approximately 200,000 masks per week to healthcare workers.  Now that the definition has been extended to all healthcare workers, that figure has gone up and we are now distributing 1.2 million masks per week to healthcare workers across a range of settings, extending far beyond the HSE.  I will ask Dr. Colm Henry to comment on screening and Ms O'Connor to speak briefly as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#QQ00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1589842800,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Butler.  Screening involves bringing large numbers of healthy people into a healthcare setting to have a test done to see whether they may have had some changes, whether to the breast, colon or cervix, that may lead to precancerous or cancerous changes.  On 27 March, we had a directive from NPHET to stop all non-essential services in this country.  Across the world - in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand - we see that screening services have been stopped because of the risk of bringing healthy people into a congregated setting and thereby running the risk of an outbreak.<\/p> <p>  In normal times, any screening programme has both benefits and risks.  Currently, bringing people into a congregated setting, whether it is a van for breast screening or a waiting room, is something that we cannot do.  We cannot go back to business as usual.  We have to consider everything.  For example, in the case of breast screening, a van could normally accommodate between 40 and 50 cases a day, but this number could certainly not be done based on Covid principles.  With good prevention and control principles, one could not do more than ten cases per day.  The same applies to the waiting room.  A mammogram requires close contact between a radiographer and a patient and will require a new way of working.  Our screening programmes are focusing on symptomatic patients, as are other programmes internationally.  To give an example, in the case of suspected breast cancer this would include a new symptom that might suggest cancer.  We are supporting the symptomatic services in their endeavours to get back up and running in a Covid environment. <\/p> <p>  As to when we will restore screening services to the way we knew them, it is far too early to say, not just for this country but also internationally.  This is because the principle of screening involves large numbers of people being available for testing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#RR00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":285,"content":"<p>My apologies to Dr. Henry, but I have to impose brutal time restrictions because we cannot be here for more than two hours and all members need to be able to ask their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#RR00300","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":286,"content":"<p>On that point, if we are to stick exactly to the time frames, I ask the witnesses to use their phones to time each ten minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#RR00400","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I am working to ensure the witnesses can see the time but until then, the Deputy's suggestion is a reasonable one.

Second, has the HSE prioritised where there are no isolation facilities available if an outbreak occurs in one of the facilities?

What action is being taken to reduce the risk to healthcare professionals, be they care assistants, nurses or doctors?

We have been working on the de-congregation of disability settings for a number of years, but we still have mental health facilities and disability settings where we have a small congregated setting of six or more and sometimes up to ten and 12 people in a house.

Is there a real impact on the delivery of services if the figure for testing capacity shifts?  Is there a knock-on impact on what can be delivered if the capacity has to go up to 120,000 or is reduced to 80,000?

On the first question, the reason that I communicated with the Secretary General on communications and capacity specifically related to the agreement that we had all been working to and have recently delivered, namely a pathway that gets us to 100,000 tests to be completed within a week.  Specifically, the engagement that I had over that weekend related to communications where that was announced as we were still in dialogue about our pathway to get there.  That was the nature of the engagement and communications that I had, and members will have seen the letter which is publicly available.  There will be many different engagements between myself and the Secretary General on a range of issues, but I felt that we needed to clarify this one.  Subsequently, as members will be aware, we have engaged significantly and collaboratively on the change management plan that I launched last Thursday,14 May, which is the outcome of those discussions over the past few weeks.  The issue was never about how we could get to the capacity for 100,000.  The issue was our pathway and the process that we were engaged in to get there, and which we did finish out on.  Thankfully, we have a good and agreed shared plan.  That specifically is what I wrote about at that stage.<\/p> <p>  The second question was on whether other services will be impacted by testing and tracing.  It is the very nature of what we are going to have to live with, definitely for the next year ahead but who knows, it may be longer.  I cannot predict, but we are going to have to have the capacity for the testing and tracing process, while at the same time, as other Deputies have also asked, migrating back to non-Covid services.  Unfortunately, it cannot be an either-or scenario for us.  We cannot turn the dial down on one, because much of our workforce are workers that we have in the healthcare system engaged in swabbing centres, for example.  It is an extra demand on us, but we will have to meet that demand while migrating back to a level of safe non-Covid services.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the non-Covid deaths, before I finish I will ask Dr. Colm Henry to come in because that is an issue that NPHET is looking through in order to assess the non-Covid deaths that have happened.  Are these incremental or is it different?  That is a process that the data is still being compiled on.<\/p> <p>  The provisional supports for healthcare workers is something that I am hugely committed to.  We have put in a range of supports during this period which have, thankfully, been well taken up by our support workers.  That can be in terms of support helplines, engagement sessions that they have, collectively or individually, through our employee assistance programme, or dedicated mental health and stress lines that we have put in place for our staff that have been significantly taken up.  We are happy to share with members some numbers on that take-up.  Who knows about after it, but certainly throughout this crisis I want to maintain and provide the wide range of supports for our staff that they quite rightly deserve.<\/p> <p>  In terms of concerns regarding non-reporting of symptoms, this week we launched a public media campaign on national and local radio to strongly encourage people to come back for care where they have symptoms that they believe need clinical care, whether that is back through our GP, hospital or community systems.

What does Mr. Reid believe is the main challenge to not achieving that figure in the event that the demand arises for that number?<\/p><p>What might prevent that being reached?  Specifically, can Mr. Reid comment on the reliability of the source of the reagents?<\/p><p> Second, regarding the data the HSE is producing, it is quite frustrating and does not help confidence when we do not get regular data updates.  I ask him to commit to publishing the number of tests undertaken on a daily basis, with a breakdown of where those cases are, whether in the community, congregated settings, among healthcare workers, and so on.  It would be helpful and would help bring the public along if the HSE did that.<\/p><p> My third question relates to the comment Mr. Reid made a few weeks ago when he stated that we would need to spend approximately &euro;1 billion per year on PPE.  That is a vast sum which has huge implications for the health budget and the economy in general.  To what extent has he, or anyone else at any level in the HSE, given consideration to sourcing that PPE in Ireland?  That would entail setting up a whole new manufacturing operation, but surely given the scale of the cost involved, it would make sense to do that.  Have any moves been made in that regard?<\/p><p> My final question relates to high-risk groups such as older people, those with certain conditions, people in congregated settings, meat packers and construction workers, for example.  What system is in place to identify those high-risk groups and respond accordingly?  We all accept there were unfortunate delays in respect of nursing home residents, but how can we ensure we do not have similar delays in tackling other high-risk groups? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#XX00500","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1589842800,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I will try to take the Deputy's first three questions together.

As I said to Deputy Carthy earlier, as we are dealing with a low positivity rate and a high negativity rate, the vast majority of those tests will now be automated and completed in less than two days because they are negative and texts are sent out automatically.  Where we deal with more complex cases, such as testing in congregated settings and among vulnerable groups, the completion of that process and contacting that person and their contacts takes more time.  Sometimes we are dealing with people in a congregated setting, an ICU or a non English-speaking community.  More complex cases take more time, so as that positivity rate changes, we will deal with more complex cases.<\/p> <p>  The second part of the Deputy's question related to the availability of reagents, which have largely come from a few suppliers.  Roche and Abbott are the two major global suppliers based in Ireland and we have made agreements with them.  We have also established a supply line from overseas in China, which now supplies our 41 labs with a steady supply of reagents.  That has put us in a much stronger position.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about data and reporting.  I accept her frustration with this issue because she has been diligent with her questioning of us on it.  We are in a much stronger position now and we publish an operational report every day that sets out the number of ICU beds, trends, positive cases, and so on.  We are now including a dashboard in that report, which shows the numbers of tests done throughout the week, the referral times - that is, the time it takes from someone feeling symptoms to being referred by a doctor - and the time it takes from swab test to lab test, and we will have the complete end-to-end time shortly as well.<\/p><p>That dashboard went live last night and we will be building it further as we go along.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#YY00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Reid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1589842800,"counter":359,"content":"<p>The significant cost of PPE is largely driven by the volume that we are supplying, the price on the global market and the reach that is required because the equipment needs to be provided beyond the HSE sector.

We all praise our heroic healthcare workers.  How does that correctly given praise tally with the decision to recruit healthcare workers and nurses who volunteered to answer the call from Ireland through temporary agency contracts provided by for-profit groups such as CPL Resources?  Those contracts are the worst of all possible contracts.  Under them, the company will not make any payment for a day on which an employee does not attend for work.  This appears in these contracts under the heading \"Sick pay\".  I mentioned earlier a nurse who, two weeks ago, was recruited, via CPL, to a Dublin hospital.  She has since tested positive for Covid-19 and will not be paid under her contract.  Is that how to treat our heroic nurses, particularly when we need permanent increases in healthcare worker, nurse and staff capacity?  Who made the decision to recruit people via temporary agency contracts rather than directly through the HSE?  The nurse to whom I refer has to self-isolate in City West.  When she asked how to get to City West, she was told to get a taxi.  When she asked if the taxi driver would have PPE, and know that his or her passenger was Covid-19 positive, she received no real response.  That is not how we need to treat our healthcare workers.<\/p> <p>  What I am saying has important ramifications when we consider that the number of people on trolleys has risen to 114.  We have been talking here about people being in the same room for two hours.  There are 114 people in hospitals today who are in close proximity to each other and who will be waiting for hours for healthcare to be provided to them.  Is it not the case that this is contrary to public health guidance and that there should be zero tolerance for people on trolleys in emergency departments?  The only way to address that is by rapidly increasing the level of permanent staffing within and other capacities of our health service, and not via temporary agency contracts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#ZZ00400","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1589842800,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I obviously cannot comment on the specific case the Deputy mentioned.  I will give an idea of the scale of the recruitment that has been happening in the past few weeks in permanent full-time employment in the HSE.  A range of contracts have been put in place.  A total of 2,367 positions have been filled across the HSE.  Approximately 1,200 of the people who filled those positions were recruited directly by our HSE teams on permanent, full-time contracts.  The Deputy will be familiar with the situation in nursing.  Our student nurses in years one to three have been given healthcare assistant contracts for the duration of this period.  There are almost 1,200 such contracts.  Almost 1,100 others have been recruited through the Be on call for Ireland initiative, albeit just over 120 of those have started.  Approximately 1,000 more are to come in as part of the initiative and they will be given contracts.<\/p> <p>  I have no doubt that some people have been recruited on contracts of a temporary nature because as we went into this crisis, we always expected a massive surge for three months and that after that period we may not need to retain the full numbers we had recruited.  Some people are on contracts of a temporary duration and that will be reviewed.  We are now, obviously, looking at a very different scenario and a review will take place in that context.  To reassure Deputy Boyd Barrett, the vast majority of people who have been recruited over the past while have come in through direct contracts with the HSE and others have been recruited through various agencies and sources such as that mentioned by the Deputy.  That recruitment took place on the basis that we were dealing with a temporary crisis that now looks as if it will last longer.

In terms of public policy communications, I have had representation from Conradh na Gaeilge asking that the HSE look to do some Irish messaging across the English radio and television channels and examine postering to make sure there is a representation of the messaging in Irish.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the policy on nursing homes.  We know that the elderly are most at risk with respect to Covid.  Has the HSE thought about any type of asymptomatic testing of staff in nursing homes?  In other words, is it trying to find some way to carry out randomised testing of healthcare professionals to ensure they are not going to work as vectors of the disease?  We have to go into the centres where people are most challenged.  <\/p> <p>  The Chief Medical Officer was not able to give me a response to an earlier question.  I ask Dr. Henry whether NPHET or any of the other medics are looking at the use of hydroxychloroquine, which has been used by a number of medics as a prophylactic.  In terms of getting Covid, there is a lot of evidence building about supplemental vitamins, in particular vitamin D and zinc, for the elderly in respect of trying to stave off infection, and whether this should be a policy we consider.  I believe Abbott has what may be an antibody test.  An Israeli company has, I believe, developed a new generation saliva test.  Do we have any information on those tests and when they might become available to us in Ireland?<\/p> <p>  Could the witnesses describe the difference between at risk and vulnerable in terms of our healthcare personnel?  I know of a nurse who has diabetes and uses an insulin pump, and was described as at risk rather than vulnerable.  She works in a setting where a patient tested positive.  She had not treated the patient for 24 hours and, therefore, was told that she could not isolate and if she did she could do so using her holiday time.  She was then asked to swab a patient who had a high temperature, which she did while wearing PPE, but she then had to wait a number of days for a test result to come back which was, happily, negative.  She, like a lot of people, is confused about who is at risk and who is vulnerable. <\/p> <p>  There is a direct provision centre in the south west of the country where refugees have been placed in the past month.  They have been largely isolating and have now come into the community.  There is a lot of angst in the community that some of the refugees might harbour Covid and no testing regime has been implemented.  Could we have some proactive testing in direct provision centres so that those living in them can mix without any issues of racism or anything else arising?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#AAA00400","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1589842800,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

A vast exercise was carried out on all residents and staff in nursing home settings.  We know from the report presented to NPHET last week by Dr. Lorraine Doherty, clinical director of health protection, that there was a very low positive result for healthcare workers, in the order of 3% or 4%.  It is likely that when there is a focus on healthcare workers in terms of protecting them, as well as staff, we will consider a range of measures, including infection prevention and control, hygiene, PPE and the screening of healthcare workers going into nursing homes.  Testing will form one part of that.  My assessment is based on the advice from Dr. Doherty.  Testing will be focused rather than blanket, because blanket point-in-time testing yielded very little information apart from telling us that there was a very low prevalence of the virus at that point in time.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's second question was regarding hydroxychloroquine, a drug used for other conditions.  There have been some small studies done which to date do not show any direct benefit.<\/p><p>The current advice from the expert advisory group, in line with that in other countries, is that more research is needed before we demonstrate this is of any benefit in either the prevention or treatment of Covid-19.  It is a drug that is not without side-effects, particularly cardiac side-effects.  As such, we would not recommend it for prevention of Covid-19.<\/p><p> The third question the Deputy asked was on the salivary test.  The current test we use for Covid-19 is a polymerase chain reaction, PCR, test which detects viral ribonucleic acid, RNA, in real time.  It is very sensitive, not only to those who are actively sick but even those who are in a presymptomatic phase of two days.  It picks up pieces of the viral RNA and obviously it correlates with their degree of infectivity.  Other tests proposed include serological tests which look for antibodies.  These are not so sensitive in the acute phase and tell us nothing about people's infectivity.  We will carry out some so-called zero prevalence studies in this country where we will detect antibodies in two populations.  We will, hopefully, get that study done in June.  It will tell us something about the exposure of the Irish population in two random populations to the virus throughout this pandemic.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked about a direct provision centre.  I will enunciate the same principles that I have enunciated, namely, that outbreak management is a function of public health and each situation is different.  Our public health departments are trained and have experience in going into these settings, looking at the layout, congregation, isolation facilities and number of positive tests and giving specific advice along a given set of principles which do not apply in any blanket way across all healthcare settings.  With regard to direct provision centres, in some centres there has been testing of everyone in the setting based on the layout of the particular centre and the number of positive tests.  In others, not everyone has been tested, either because there has not been an outbreak or there has been a very small number of positive cases.  We leave it to the public health departments which are managing these outbreaks to make those judgments on an individual basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#AAA00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Henry.

Community hospitals were meant to be brought up to a standard, as some were, of having up to 80% single-bed occupancy.  At some stage, the HSE believed this target could not be delivered.  It was a HIQA standard and the 80% figure was later reduced.  Unfortunately, as I have seen in west Cork - it is probably the case throughout the country - this standard was not delivered.  It is to be delivered going forward.  Why were the standards announced initially not applied?  Deadlines for bringing hostels up to standard were missed.  Has this cost lives, especially in settings where there are multiple people in single rooms?<\/p> <p>  Was it necessary to remove home help from clients who were receiving only bare essential hours?  In recent years, we have been fighting for greater investment in home help.  It is proven that people who can stay at home longer are much healthier.  Many people are very upset that they have lost their home help service and are trying to have it restored.  That issue needs to be focused on.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned in an earlier discussion the budget available to the HSE.  I note it has acquired a PC-12 aircraft to fly swabs to Germany for testing, which is very important.  We realise now that these tests could have been carried out in laboratories here.  As I said, Animal Health Laboratories Limited in west Cork has stated that, with a little investment, it could have carried out thousands of tests and the company has asked why we spent large amounts on having testing done elsewhere.

We have also been signposting people to the voluntary sector and ensuring that we have telephone contact with them.

I wish to acknowledge that many lives have been saved as a consequence of that work.  However, it would be remiss of me if I did not shed light on what my constituents regard as shortcomings within that service.  My constituents believe that actions or inaction in recent weeks have resulted in the loss of lives.  I refer to a direct provision centre at the Skellig Star Hotel in Cahirsiveen, County Kerry.  I wish to pose some questions about this particular facility and about direct provision centres.  I ask the witnesses to answer and I will then have two further points to make.<\/p> <p>  I note that the Department of Justice and Equality claims unequivocally that the HSE failed to inform its officials of a positive case of Covid-19 at a Travelodge hotel in Dublin on 8 March.  This Travelodge was home to a large group of asylum seekers.  Is it true that the HSE failed to inform the Department of Justice and Equality?  The Department of Justice and Equality also claims that the HSE signed off at national level on the movement of people from that same Travelodge to the Skellig Star Hotel in Cahirsiveen, a five-hour bus journey, without testing the group prior to leaving Dublin or on arrival in Cahirsiveen.  Is this true?<\/p> <p>  Is Mr. Reid aware that the HSE Cork Kerry local health office expressed serious concern and misgivings about the movement of a large group of people during a pandemic, and that it expressed grave reservations about the suitability of Cahirsiveen as a location for a direct provision centre due to a lack of primary care facilities in the area?  Clearly, these concerns were overruled.  I would like to ask Mr. Reid exactly who overruled them.  Was it the HSE or was it the Department of Justice and Equality?<\/p> <p>  There is evidence of what I consider to be not best practice at this direct provision centre, at which there are now 26 or more confirmed cases of Covid-19.  Residents who are not blood relatives continue to share rooms, although this is not best practice.  Given the size of the premises, there is absolutely no social distancing.  There is a shared laundry room, small public spaces, a shared lift, etc.<\/p><p>Equally, there was absolutely no professional deep cleansing of this facility at any stage following the confirmation of the 26 cases, and residents continue to live there.  Could Mr. Reid explain also, as the body charged with public health, how from the first diagnosis of Covid-19, it took the HSE 39 days to have a public health presence on the campus of the Skellig Star?  I will allow him to answer those questions and then, with your indulgence, Chairman, I have two further points to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#CCC00400","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1589842800,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I will make a few comments and then I may call on one of my colleagues.

I am sure they have heard them.<\/p> <p>  Second, regarding the Skellig Star in Cahersiveen, we have been working very co-operatively with the Department of Justice and Equality in recent weeks, specifically on the location the Deputy mentioned.  It has been the subject of joint engagements between the public health teams, the local community teams and with officials from the Department of Justice and Equality on a national level.  It has also been the subject of discussions between me and the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is true that there has been a lot of engagement and collaboration in terms of working with us to try to address the issues.<\/p> <p>  Specifically in relation to our role in that regard, we give public health advice very clearly and such advice is very well publicised.  There is an obligation on the operators of direct provision centres to implement the advice.  On many occasions we go into centres.  In that specific case, our public health teams would have gone in and given specific advice on the location, both advice for staff and residents of the direct provision centres.  There would have been a lot of engagement in recent weeks.  I have been engaged locally with the teams down there as well.  As I understand it, there has been significant engagement by the HSE.<\/p> <p>  I cannot comment on the particular positive case and the testing the Deputy mentioned.  I do not know the detail of the case but I am happy to get back to her about it.  Our Cork-Kerry community-based teams and the public health teams put significant supports in place there, not just in terms of advice.  The implementation of public health advice is the responsibility of centres themselves.  We will go in and support them in terms of what they need to do, but there is an obligation on the centres to implement the advice.<\/p> <p>  Separately, in terms of clinical care for anybody, we have been providing that pathway through our own public health teams as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#DDD00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":378,"content":"<p>Could I just conclude?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#DDD00300","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":379,"content":"<p>The Deputy can ask one very brief question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#DDD00400","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":380,"content":"<p>Yes, just on brief question.

I well remember politicians and commentators long bemoaning the fact that staff were the biggest obstacle to change in the health service.  I think we have successfully busted that myth now and I sincerely hope nobody ever goes back to it because we saw staff stepping up to the plate in a way that has taken our breath away.  They have been absolutely outstanding.  Mr. Reid confirmed that.<\/p> <p>  This morning, I asked the CMO about the specific guidelines in place for construction workers and I asked if similar guidelines were in place for other workers.  We now find out that we in this Chamber have very specific guidelines in place for health and safety reasons, which is important.

In all my comments I refer not only to HSE staff but to healthcare workers in general across the country, including GPs.  All our healthcare workers have done a phenomenal job with us, for us, and for the public.<\/p> <p>  With specific regard to the public health advice, I will say two things.  The first is that the advice on the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, website is public health advice for all workforces and all organisations.  As Dr. Henry said with regard to how that advice is applied, managed, monitored and implemented, our public health teams provide significant amounts of advice - particularly in recent weeks and again this week - to different sectors that contact us about opening arrangements.  Our teams provide them with a level of advice separate to what is available on the site.  The Health and Safety Authority, HSA, is playing a lead role and takes a big lead from our public health advice.  It is directly engaged, even today, with our teams with regard to the application of public health advice.  There are a number of significant working groups led by the HSA and our own teams which inspect sites for other reasons.  For example, our environmental health officers may be carrying out particular inspections and, while doing so, they may take cognisance of the wider public health advice.  All of that is being worked through with the HSA.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's questions with regard to healthcare workers, we are concerned about any positivity rates across the healthcare system and about how the infection may transmit further.  Earlier I mentioned that hospitalisation rates and rates of admission to ICU were falling as a result of a number of actions we have taken, particularly some of the actions taken in congregated settings and nursing homes.  In some cases agency workers may work between a number of different settings over a period of a week or, in some cases, a day.  We took very early actions so that employers and agencies would ensure that staff were assigned to dedicated locations so that they would not have the opportunity to transmit the disease to other locations.  That was one action.  <\/p> <p>  A second action relates to accommodation.  Significant numbers of staff and healthcare workers, both HSE and non-HSE, were provided with accommodation.  Ms. O'Connor will provide details on this in a few minutes.  Healthcare workers who shared accommodation with other healthcare workers were put into other locations to reduce the risk of the virus spreading between healthcare workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#EEE00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I asked Mr. Reid whether he was worried about the rate of 31.4%.  That does not seem to be in line with the rate in other jurisdictions.  I also have other questions.  I am well aware of the measures that are in place, although it seems they are not enough if the rate of infection is 31.4%.  We are very constrained on time, for very good reasons.<\/p> <p>  I will switch to the issue of nursing homes.  People in my constituency and elsewhere have expressed to me the view that it was at the very start, when hospitals were cleared and people were transferred into nursing homes, that the virus was brought into those nursing homes.  What specific actions were taken arising out of Mr. Reid's meeting with representatives of Nursing Homes Ireland on 19 February?

I think it would be misleading to say that that is where one can track back transmission in these in nursing homes to.  It would be unfortunate that that would be perceived because there is no evidence.  In fact, the evidence in terms of where the transmission within nursing homes can be identified or tracked back to is still something that NPHET is working through and trying to get a better level of understanding.  It is not just us in Ireland.  Just today the ECDC published a report on transmission of the disease in congregated settings.  It too is learning.

I know they put considerable work into preparing to appear before the committee and it is really appreciated.<\/p><p>As we are beginning to learn how to live with Covid and doing so safely as we reopen our economy, we must try to establish confidence in the economy and also in healthcare settings and so on.  Bearing that in mind, can Mr. Reid be clear about how many health-acquired infections there have been, that is, people who were in acute hospitals and acquired Covid?  Can Mr. Reid break those figures down into those who recovered or died as a consequence?  There is one very sad case in my own area.  It is a matter of confidence over time.  I imagine, subject to Mr. Reid correcting me, that the incidence rate will decrease over time as the reaction, use of PPE and management practice, improves.  It will be important for the public to have clarity on if we are asking them to return to hospital settings for treatment of non-Covid illnesses.<\/p><p> On reopening healthcare settings more generally, I refer to paediatric care and clinics.  On reopening hospitals, care applies to everyone but it is particularly difficult with children, in relation to social and physical distancing but also often diagnostics.  I am particularly concerned about the opening of standard clinics, including diabetes clinics.  Picture the management of the standard outpatient clinic in Crumlin hospital on a Tuesday or Thursday afternoon.  How will that be managed?  I cannot see a way where it returns to its previous form at any time in the future.  Is this an opportunity to break that into something that is easier for parents generally to manage, where they might turn up at a specified time with a likelihood of having the appointment within that time.  That is an important opportunity that might come from this.<\/p><p> On nursing home testing, Dr. Holohan referred to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, technical report which was published today.  I do not wish to catch Mr. Reid on the hoof on this but it focuses on the rapidity of testing.  Will Mr. Reid confirm two things?  There was an ongoing concern on nursing homes in my area about their ability to test patients and staff rather than waiting for a scheduled test, either waiting for GP referral or for a public health authority to come and test or to schedule a test.  Nursing homes are capable of doing it and some are beginning to do it but as recently as last week, nursing homes in my area have raised this with me.  Linked to that is where those tests go.  There was concern that the batch of testing went to more than one laboratory resulting in staggered results back to the nursing home.  That creates operational difficulties when one is trying to operate isolation in a confined congregated setting such as a nursing home.  Will Mr. Reid confirm that he expects this will happen or that it is already happening, where nursing homes are entitled to do that testing themselves where there is a suspected patient and that any batches will be tested in the same laboratory to accelerate the process?<\/p><p> The ECDC report goes through European countries, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the UK.  All but two have data from as recently as 11 May.  Anyone reading it will notice that our data relating to long-term care facilities is from 13 April.  I want to flag that with Mr. Reid.  There may be a reason for this and I would be delighted if he could provide that to me.  If that is not possible now, he might do so later.<\/p><p> Returning to normalisation, the decision to take over private hospitals had to be made at the time it was made, in the expectation of a surge and the pressure on intensive care units.  It is incredibly welcome that it has not been needed as expected.  It would have been unforgivable not to make those decisions at that time.  However, now that we have overcome that first really dangerous period and it looks as though we will experience a series of waves, as described earlier, does Mr. Reid have in mind an appropriate proportion of space that must be retained over time in private hospitals in order to account for those waves?  Will he give the committee some information on that?  That is enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#FFF03100","speaker":"1480","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":427,"content":"<p>That is a lot of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#GGG00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1589842800,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I will try to be brief going through the questions.  My colleague, Dr. Henry, might mention one of them.  The first question related to transmission in healthcare settings; I think it mentioned hospitals and transmission of the disease.  The learning from the early phases and the work NPHET has been doing over the past while demonstrates that certainly the early transmission of the disease was happening within the community.  That was where the major transmission of the disease took place.  Obviously, the work and protections we put in with regard to our own healthcare workers were geared towards stopping the transmission of the disease, particularly in hospitals, and then in nursing homes also.<\/p> <p>  The second point, and I will answer briefly, was on the opening of outpatient departments, and the Deputy gave some examples.  The chief clinical officer and the chief operations officer, who are both here with me today, are working through a plan on how we get back to non-Covid-19 services in a very safe way.  The Deputy gave an example of an outpatients waiting room, which cannot be the case any more.  We cannot have the numbers of people waiting for the various patient services they would come forward for congregated together.  We have to go back to this in a very different way.  It may not be the most efficient way but we have to go back to it in a very safe way.  That is the work we are doing now.  What would be the priorities about the services we would restore, and we spoke earlier about screening services and other services?  What are the risks we have to manage for each of those services?  What are the equity issues we need to put in place and the various risks?  That plan is currently being finalised by my two colleagues who are with me here today.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, report.  I briefly went through that this morning.  The Deputy is correct.  It does reference the various countries, approaches to it and the data collection.  I cannot comment specifically on the issue the Deputy referenced at the end of her contribution about the data for our own long-term care settings but I can come back to that.<\/p> <p>  On private hospitals, and I might ask my colleague to come back on the nursing homes, the Deputy is correct.  I want to say again that it was procured for a particular reason.  Thankfully, we have got through that.  The biggest caution we have to put in place, and this is WHO guidance, is that a healthcare system needs to keep 80% capacity levels.  We all know that, traditionally, the Irish health system operates at 95% on a normal day.  We cannot go back to the way we were so we have to keep extra capacity.  The thought process now is that: first, if we meet another surge we still have to keep capacity; second, even as we head into a winter we have to head into it knowing that we have to create capacity; and, third, what mechanism or way would we create that capacity in the future?  That has to be part of the consideration being given to the current usage of the agreement we have with the private hospitals.  Would we keep that for a further period as part of the agreement?  Would we only keep some of it for a period of the agreement or would we go into something in a very different way?  Ultimately, that is a decision for our policymakers in government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#HHH00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Reid.

That could have been done differently, it could have been done better and it could be modified now.  Who is giving us a look-back on how this contract has worked up to the point of its extension, if it happens, at the end of the three months?  A consultant radiologist, for example, tells me that they would normally read 200 patient scans a day and that has gone down to zero.  Is that true?  Is that a fact of this arrangement the HSE has with the private hospitals?  Is that a consequence of it?<\/p> <p>  Another consultant informs me that a significant number of private hospital appointments have been cancelled.  Does Mr. Reid know how many have been cancelled for the months of May and June?  Another consultant says that because three months of normal service has been lost, the projection of 1,800 extra cancer deaths is now a figure that is known to the Department.  I want to know where that figure came from, does it stand up, and if Mr. Reid has any comment on it?<\/p> <p>  The other issue is the contract itself.  Mr. Reid offers contract A.  I want to know if there was a greater saving to be made or a greater use of the time of consultants in terms of contracts B and C.<\/p><p> Is it true that someone informed the State Claims Agency to contact pathologists to say that the cancer biopsies from private hospitals from consultants who had not signed contract A were not to be read?  was that a means of forcing those consultants to sign contract A?<\/p><p> The other issue is also referred to in a consultant's letter IN which he states that there are no pathways for him to look after public patients or for the consultant&rsquo;s patients to be added to public waiting lists.  That would seem to contradict what the HSE said earlier.  The witnesses cannot ignore the feedback from the consultants in these cases who are pointing to failures within the system and to a lack of governance in the spending of taxpayers' money.  Will the HSE tell us how many tests are undertaken in each of the 47 test centres?  Do they run on a seven-day basis, how many tests are carried out in each centre, and what are the costs involved?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#HHH00300","speaker":"1496","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1589842800,"counter":432,"content":"<p>On the issue of consultants and private hospitals, the decision was taken to go with an A-type contract.

For private consultants who have patients already, they can continue to see them.  For us, the important bit is that we get to see the sickest people who may have had their treatment deferred or cancelled as a result of the work that we had to do to be able to cope with the potential surge.<\/p> <p>  We are looking at all of that and at the level of activity in the private hospitals.  We know that from an inpatient perspective, that is at about 44-45%, but the day case occupancy is now up to over 80%.  We are seeing a higher level of activity.  We, along with the Department of Health, did engage and will continue to engage with the consultant bodies as part of this process.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the activity that we need to continue, it is going to be very important for us that we maintain a flow.

I want to back up Deputy McGuinness in what he has said.  The fact is that there is a person in my constituency who has cancer and who had a procedure cancelled two weeks ago.  He and his consultant are both at home and there is nobody in the operating theatre where this procedure could have been done.  That is not acceptable.  It is hugely important that, whatever else we do, we ensure that people who had operations and procedures booked and were expecting them to take place have those proceeded with.<\/p> <p>  The other point I want to ask the HSE, and I want to say very clearly that there is great support for the fantastic work that it has done, is regarding the concerns for the future if Covid-19 comes back.  What additional actions can or will the HSE carry out to ensure that the nursing home deaths are not as high as they currently are?  While I accept and I said earlier that we know that older people are very vulnerable, particularly people in nursing homes, a nightmare scenario happened in a nursing home in my own constituency of County Louth, where there were more than 80 patients and there have been 22-23 deaths now.<\/p><p>Some 60% of the staff were sick and could not come in.  Where there were 24 nurses at one stage, there were later just six trying to look after all the patients.  It is an impossible task.<\/p><p> When did Mr. Reid first decide to intervene in the nursing home sector?  I would like to know.  I am not being critical or negative.  We need to know when the requests came in for PPE from around the country.  What was going on at the HSE's senior administrative level?  When did it make the decision to intervene?  I want to repeat publicly that the head of primary care in CHO 8 was exceptionally helpful when I made the case to him about the home to which I refer.  There was a significant and immediate intervention.  I do not know what went on with the complaints which we read in the national press about PPE not being supplied to private nursing homes.  It was on Facebook pages.  I received questions about why a nursing home was not getting PPE.  The HSE told me clearly that if a request was made, nursing homes would get PPE immediately.  There is a significant amount that we do not know, and we need to know more.  The best way forward is to plan for the future as \"Team Ireland\", with the HSE, Nursing Homes Ireland and all the other agencies working together on a plan for the winter.  We can only base that on the knowledge of what happened in the past, when the HSE knew and when it acted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#JJJ00700","speaker":"1598","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1589842800,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. Colm Henry to take the question on cancer services and private consultants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#KKK00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1589842800,"counter":440,"content":"<p>On the issue of nursing homes, this is a novel virus and evolving information is coming through week by week.

The most important lessons as we garner knowledge about this virus are the atypical presentations in older people and the importance of asymptomatic transmission.  Even though that mass testing exercise has been reassuring in that it showed quite low levels of the virus among patients and staff, today's ECDC report had new guidance for residential care facilities, including a more aggressive testing strategy, bearing in mind that there is asymptomatic transmission and atypical presentation.

ICTU based its submission on the principle that the safety, health and well-being of every person is paramount, and therefore supersedes all others.  We also took the view that all public health advice should be adhered to without exception.  During the course of our interactions in the LEEF process, we advocated a mandatory national protocol be developed which would encompass a set of directive actions to which every employer, worker, contractor, customer and client had an absolute duty to strictly adhere in order to maintain safe workplaces.<br\/><br\/>We set out a number of key principles which we believed were crucial to the delivery of a mandatory protocol capable of ensuring safe workplaces upon a return to work.  Those principles included worker representation; training; negotiated or agreed changes to work practices; mandatory compliance with all the listed health and safety provisions with no opt-outs; and the assignment to the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, of the responsibility to oversee the implementation of all aspects of the national protocol, including the use of its powers to inspect and order the closure of workplaces where appropriate.<br\/><br\/>On workplace representation, we submitted that a workplace worker representative infrastructure be put in place across all sectors and in every workplace.  The primary purpose of this measure was to ensure that workers could be confident that their voice would be heard, that the provisions of the protocol would be strictly adhered to, as well as allowing such a representative or representatives to liaise directly with the HSA inspectorate.  This measure was essential given that, outside of Statutory Instrument 146, which deals with some individual representative trade union rights, there are no provisions in Irish law which specify the right of workers to be represented.  Section 25 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 sets out the provisions relating to such workplace representatives.  However, it confers no obligation for the appointment of such representatives.  It should also be noted that in SI 291\/2013, Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2013, section 23(1)(<i>b<\/i>) provides that &quot;the project supervisor for the construction stage shall facilitate ... where more than 20 persons are normally employed at any one time on a construction site at any stage of the project, the appointment of a site safety representative from among the employees of the contractor or contractors undertaking the project in accordance with the procedure outlined in Schedule 6.&quot;  The national protocol now commits to each workplace having such a role.  The inclusion of provisions for induction training for all workers and training of workplace representatives on their role and function, together with specialised training in the proper use of cleaning, storing and disposal of personal protective equipment, PPE, are in our view critical to the operation of the protocol.<br\/><br\/>It is agreed within the protocol terms that any changes to workplace policies or work patterns will be agreed through negotiations with trade unions or worker representatives.  The protocol is intended to be universal but does not replace existing obligations under current health and safety legislation, nor does it prevent the development of further specific measures in a particular sector, industries or companies, provided they reflect the principles of the protocol.<br\/><br\/>The document outlines in a detailed way all of the safety measures required to be put in place and implemented.  This virus is very active and can cause serious personal injury to a worker who may contract it.  These measures, therefore, seek to mitigate the risk to workers and are vital to maintaining safe workplaces.<\/p><p>This not a set of discretionary guidelines but a suite of mandatory directive actions with no exceptions or opt-outs.  <\/p><p> Chairman, it is not my intention to refer in detail to the health and safety provisions set out in the document, as I am sure the committee is very familiar with them.  However, I am satisfied that all of the necessary expert advice from the relevant State agencies was sought and utilised in the final output.  ICTU advocated strongly that all of the necessary measures, under each safety heading, should be specified in the interests of clarity and compliance.<\/p><p> On the matter of compliance and enforcement, the HSA, which is the statutory body charged with ensuring the safety, health and welfare of workers is protected in the workplace, has been assigned responsibility for the implementation of all aspects of this national protocol, including being available to advise and train worker representatives.  It will also have the powers to inspect workplaces and order their closure when appropriate.  This is reflected in the broad range of functions assigned to the authority by section 34 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, including functions to encompass the prevention of danger to workers from the spread of infectious disease.  Section 35(1) of the Act empowers the Minister to confer additional functions on the authority, which are connected with the functions prescribed in section 34 of the Act.  For the avoidance of doubt, in our view the Minister should exercise her power under section 35(1) to expressly assign to the authority a function to promote, foster and enforce compliance with the provisions of this protocol.  We hope the committee will consider making a recommendation in this regard.<\/p><p> Inspectors of the authority have extensive powers of enforcement, including the power to serve-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#SSS00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I thank Ms King and ask her to conclude.

I am the CEO of the HSA.<br\/><br\/>The Return to Work Safely Protocol was developed by all those who have an interest and role in ensuring workers are kept safe, businesses can operate and the public health measures around Covid-19 can be met.  In this regard I acknowledge the support of all the stakeholders involved, including ICTU and CIF that are here today as well as IBEC, Chambers Ireland, the HSE, the Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Health and the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.<br\/><br\/>Covid-19 has challenged us all.  The authority recognises that there are particular challenges in the workplace.  We have the worker who has fears and anxieties about returning to work.  We also have employers and businesses that are looking to reopen, regain their markets and plan for a future that may seem uncertain.  The key to a safe return to work over the next number of weeks is shared collaboration, communication and compliance with and enforcement of the measures outlined in the protocol, which sets out in detail the steps businesses, employers and workers need to implement in order to reduce the risk from Covid-19 in the workplace.  By following the protocol, employers and workers will be able to meet these challenges and ensure a safe working and business environment.<br\/><br\/>The authority will be involved in ensuring compliance, in line with occupational health and safety requirements.  Through the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 the authority has the powers to advise, monitor, inspect and enforce adherence to the protocol.  We will provide advice and support to employers, employees and workers on how they are implementing the Covid-19 measures as set out in the protocol through our helpline, website and during site inspections.  A range of checklists and templates has been developed and is available on our website for use by employers, workers and worker representatives.  Further material is being developed.<br\/><br\/>During a site inspection a range of enforcement actions can arise.  For example, the inspector can address and advise on any shortcomings in relation to the measures through a report of inspection, which is left with the employer at the end of the visit and can include timelines and follow-ups that are needed.  We can also take an appropriate action under the 2005 Act, including an improvement notice and a prohibition notice.  Furthermore, if, following an inspection, the inspector forms the opinion that the risk to the safety, health and welfare of persons is so serious that the use of a place of work should be restricted or immediately prohibited, an application can be made <i>ex parte<\/i>to the High Court for an order restricting or prohibiting the use of the place of work or part thereof.<br\/><br\/>The authority has been Ireland's regulator of occupational health and safety since 1989.  In normal circumstances, we implement a risk-based occupational health and safety inspection programme across all sectors covering some 10,000 inspections and investigations in any given year.  The programme is based on both proactive and reactive inspections with the latter often arising from complaints, reports of serious incidents and fatalities.<br\/><br\/>Our inspection programme has been refocused now to oversee compliance with the protocol.  In the first instance, the prioritisation of inspections will be focused on those sectors that are scheduled to open in line with the road map and based on any complaints received.<\/p><p> Any worker or employer can submit a query or a complaint to the authority&rsquo;s helpline, the workplace contact unit, WCU, with the attached details.  This helpline is confidential and every contact, whether a query or a complaint, is acknowledged and receives a reference number for tracking.  Each complaint is initially followed up with the relevant company or employer by the WCU, our helpline, and if there is no response, or if the response is not satisfactory or in the event of receipt of multiple complaints, etc., we will follow up with the employer through an inspector.  The inspector may then decide to do an unannounced inspection or, indeed, a pre-arranged inspection if warranted.<\/p><p> As a general rule, our inspections are unannounced.  However, due to the fact that workplaces may have different working arrangements in place to protect against Covid-19, we recognise that in a number of cases, and we expect very few cases, that we will need to arrange a suitable time to visit.  Once on site, we will ensure compliance against the protocol and where there is a breach of a statutory obligation the inspector, based on his or her evidence and expert opinion, will determine what enforcement action may be needed.<\/p><p> In terms of staff numbers, the authority has a full staff complement of 182 which is made up of staff in administration and inspector grades.  The inspector grades comprise of grade I, which are senior inspectors who run teams, as well as grade II and grade III field inspectors.  Generally, our inspectors cover field inspections across all our mandates.  We have occupational health and safety, chemicals, and market surveillance of products.  Inspectors can be involved in general or specialist inspection, or policy implementation at national, European, and international levels.  Of the 109 inspectors currently in the authority across all three grades, we have 67 field inspectors fully assigned to inspect on foot of the protocol.  These include both general and specialist, as well as policy inspectors reassigned to field inspection.<\/p><p> A cohort of inspectors must be retained to ensure our other legal mandate.  As Ms King said, the general rules on health and safety continue to apply.  We continue to have that role in terms of reactive and proactive inspections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#TTT00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sharon McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":475,"content":"<p>Thank you very much Dr. McGuinness.

Workers returned to sites and jobs that are utterly changed due to Covid-19 and the new measures that have been put in place to protect them, their families and our communities.  They are literally building the new normal the Government said we will enter in the coming months.<\/p> <p>  Since the Government shut down our industry on 28 March, construction companies and workers have been preparing to return to work safely.  In terms of safety, our industry is recognised as one that is well-developed.  That other countries facing similar lock-downs did not include construction is a recognition of the safety culture baked into modern construction.  In Ireland, our preparation has involved extensive consultation with unions, Government, and international experts.  The CIF's standard operating procedure, SOP, translates the latest HSE, WHO and medical advice into a construction context.  The SOP fits into the national protocol agreed between Government, industry and unions and enforced by the Health and Safety Authority, HSA.  Today just over 130,000 out of a total of 147,000 employees have completed the SOP&rsquo;s online safety induction in advance of returning to work.  Not all of these are traditional on-site construction workers, it includes office-based professionals, engineers, design teams, architect, etc.<\/p> <p>  I would like to commend the industry&rsquo;s companies and its employees for their commitment to safety.  These workers are rebuilding our economy while they are building.  Homes, roads, hospitals, schools, and other essential construction has begun again.  Our industry is also well placed to contribute to economic recovery as we enable other sectors to operate.  We are able to recommence work without major State support and 100,000 of our employees can now gradually be taken off the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS.<\/p> <p>  I want to assure people that companies are being sensible and practical in returning to work.  There was no big bang return to work yesterday.  Larger contractors allowed a reduced workforce on site yesterday to assess sites, test new measures, and embed new protocols in safety culture.  It will take months for the industry to reach previous output levels.<\/p> <p>  Covid-19 compliance officers have been appointed and are monitoring progress.  Under the national protocol agreed with the Government and Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, workers representatives are also being appointed.  The important message we have all been sending to workers is that if they are unsure about safety they can inform these representatives so any issue can be addressed.<\/p><p>All the SOPs and national protocols are important guidance and can help shape behaviours but I am confident our workers will also step up and operate safely.<\/p><p> The SOP provides guidance, based on the HSA advice, not just on site but on the way to site and on the way home.  For example, we have provided best-in-class guidance on travelling in vans on the way to work.  We are asking that PPE is taken off and left on site.  Larger companies are putting in place one-way walking systems and have reduced headcount on site.  We have very clear isolation protocols for anyone reporting symptoms and we will now keep logs of work to assist contact tracing. <\/p><p> Those companies that have been able to operate over the past month working on essential services have been operating new safety measures.  Reports are positive but implementation of the SOP is challenging and companies are reporting a significant drop in productivity. <\/p><p> It is understandable that the public is afraid.  The pandemic has shut down our society but it has also paralysed us.  We now know that we must restart our economy in a manner that prevents the spread of the virus or we face horrific long-term economic, social, and psychological consequences.  I want to assure the public that we are taking the responsibility that falls on the construction industry very seriously.  Our workers want to work but want to contribute to stopping the spread. <\/p><p> They are also building a sustainable and safe future for Ireland, helping us recover from the impact of this pandemic.  I would appeal to members of the public, the media and our politicians to support us and our workers as we take these first steps towards reopening our economy and society for everyone.

I regularly talk to my colleagues across Europe and their view, and that represents the entire industry across Europe, is that the extra costs will be between 5% and 10%.  I spoke this morning to a very substantial house builder in Ireland and he reckons that the cost per house that he is turning out at the moment will be increased by between &euro;10,000 and 15,000.  He expects that the cost in respect of apartments, which are obviously more intense and where it is more difficult to practice physical distancing, could be as much as &euro;20,000 extra.  He tells me that the programme for building a house currently is about 15 weeks and he estimates that with new physical distancing and so on that will go to 25 weeks.  There are some more intense sites that could be substantially more than that.<\/p> <p>  Currently, the Office of Government Procurement is examining that.  It issued a guidance note last week.  We in the CIF were disappointed to find that it only applied to the extra expenses that we have to incur in terms of coping with the new national protocol but we are expecting a new note, maybe this week, that is going to look at how the extra costs are going to be dealt with in the public sector.

Social distancing is hugely important to ensuring that we are part of the defence against the virus.  There are exceptional cases of what is described as \"close working\".  In those circumstances PPE must be in place.  Close working cannot happen otherwise.  That is very clearly stated in the protocol.  Members might notice that the protocol uses the word \"must\" - not \"should\" or anything else - and that is for a very good reason.<\/p><p>The second point is that the worker representation infrastructure on the ground is more than the health and safety representatives.  They will play a role as well, but the idea behind it is that there would be a worker representative, alongside a management representative every day.  They should be easily identifiable and they should be known to be the anti-Covid person.  Their job is to go around and ensure that all the measures are being implemented, and they must do that two, three or four times a day if that is required.  They should have regular audits, daily if necessary, but certainly twice weekly with senior management to ensure that people are satisfied that this is happening on the ground.  The representatives must be afforded the respect and support of the employers and workers because they have a very key role.  That is the point that I had in mind when we suggested this should happen.  If that infrastructure is respected and it works, then we have a much better chance of ensuring that all those measures are in place on the ground.  That was the overall objective of putting the system in place.<\/p><p> It is not just about having the stripes on the ground and the queueing pieces and so on; it is making sure the infrastructure is respected and works all day, every day to make sure that we give every workplace a chance to be safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#AAAA00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1589842800,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I do not find myself agreeing with ICTU very often, but I certainly agree in this case.

The direction is that if there is a need for closer working that one should seek every opportunity to do it differently.  That may be with the help of mechanical aids or by whatever other means but, as ICTU has said, if one must do that it is necessary to work while using the proper PPE.<\/p> <p>  Yesterday, both the Trade Union Federation and the Construction Industry Federation reached an agreement that will be signed tomorrow.

I received a letter from the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, on 13 May, which said there had been 200 complaints about non-adherence to Covid-19 public health guidelines in work and there had been zero physical inspections by the HSA of any of those complaints.  I found it astounding that there were over 200 complaints.  I take Dr. McGuinness's point that the HSA addressed them but I know that two of those complaints came from me and I was not told anything of what had happened on foot of them.

Some of those contractors are now saying they need to know what is happening before they open up again.  The ball is in the court of the Office of Government Procurement, which is part of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Government has been extremely supportive of the construction industry because a massive number of construction employees have taken part in the subsidised employment scheme and that has allowed them to go back to work.  Many are on the pandemic unemployment payment as well.  That is an issue and a major challenge for the current Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the future Government to deal with, but the cost is just a fact of life.

The infrastructure would mean that the representative on the ground would be the eyes and ears in a workplace.  The workers should feel confident about being able to liaise with that person and say something is not happening or is not happening correctly or often enough, such as cleaning, hygiene or whatever.  Under this protocol, that representative is supposed to be able to liaise with the management representative during the course of the day and have a conversation about what needs to happen.  If something does not happen, the representative has a number of options.  If he or she is in a trade union, he or she can go to a trade union official.

That is all reactive.  The protocol also states that we need to have a proactive approach.<\/p><p>One of the ways of being proactive is to have boots on the ground and to go out checking so that employers know this will be checked.  The second point is that something like on-the-spot fines, which is what we are suggesting the committee should consider, brings with it an alertness that brings a deterrent value.  From that point of view, that also will boost and bolster.  When those things are in operation, workers become confident that their place of work will be kept safe.  In the first instance, ICTU put forward the proposals on the protocol.  The objective of that was to gain the confidence of workers that going back to work can be safe.<\/p><p> Finally, a feature of this pandemic across the labour market is that the lowest paid workers are much more exposed.  They are the people in the essential services, aside from the health service.  I am leaving aside the health service for obvious reasons because there is a combination of pay grades, etc., delivering that service.  This is a global feature.  This is the same in Australia, in America and in Ireland.  If one sets the health service aside, these are the same people who do not have a significant representative infrastructure, who are not recognised and who suffer, and have for years, lots of resistance to issues they would raise within the workplace.  We are seeing some of that in the meat factories.  We saw an incident today where tests were not even given to the individuals who should have had them.  Their individuality was not even being respected.  From that point of view, this should bring about, as I think Deputy O'Reilly suggests in her question, some form of major reform.

Much work has been done behind the scenes over the past few weeks in preparing for this.<\/p> <p>  My main question is to Mr. Parlon and it relates to the set-up in the construction industry.  As I understand it, there is quite a high labour input in the construction industry in Ireland.  Will this force or bring about changes in how we approach the construction industry?  For instance, I was speaking to someone recently in the UK, where they are doing a lot of modular building in relation to apartments.<\/p><p>It is difficult to do that here because of a certain regulation that does not allow it.  Are we going to see a change in the whole construction industry and how we approach building projects?  We have to ensure health and safety at all times.  Coming from a legal background, I have dealt with several cases where I have seen major tragedies on building sites which should not have occurred.  They occurred because the necessary support was not there for the employee when the accident happened.  We are trying to strike a balance between having enough people on site to do the work and making sure nobody is put in danger of Covid-19.  From their experience in representing the industry, do the witnesses think there will be change?  How can we protect jobs if that change does come?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#LLLL01500","speaker":"1523","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1589842800,"counter":651,"content":"<p>Before the pandemic we faced a challenge in getting people to work in the construction industry because we were competing with all the other sectors.  We were just about to embark on a careers campaign funded by our members.  That pressure is now off because there are forecasts of 300,000 people in long-term unemployment, so we have a pool of people to call on.  The Deputy mentioned the move to off-site and modular work.  That is a global shift which we are certainly reflecting.  Strangely, several members of the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, provide modular buildings to the UK because we do not have sufficient scope in Ireland.  If we were to embark on a very substantial social housing or apartment building programme, that would allow our operators to get into modular work.  There is no question that it is the way forward.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to some tragedies in construction.  We have a very strong culture of health and safety.  My colleague who is present here, Mr. Dermot Carey, is director for safety and training.  Massive investment is made by all and sundry into health and safety.  Complying with those requirements is a very big cost.  We were able to get our standard operating procedure together so quickly, ahead of most other players, because we have that good culture.  The move to off-site and modular construction is inevitable.  It will probably mean that people will be working in enclosed factories, putting modular pieces together, rather than on sites.  It will protect people from the worst of the weather but it will still involve a substantial amount of labour.

There will be a green agenda regardless of who forms the Government.  That will be highly labour-intensive.  If the physical distancing requirements continue, retrofitting will be a challenge.

I thank the witnesses.  I would like some clarification.  Does each construction site have sufficient personal protective equipment, PPE?<\/p><p>This question is for Dr. McGuinness.  Are the guidelines sufficiently clear?  It is important that there is good communication with workers.  Is there guidance in place to help those whose first language is not English?<\/p><p> It is important that the HSA be better resourced.  That is an issue that has been raised today and it is one of my concerns.  I believe there will be a cross-body approach with the WRC, environmental health and the Garda all pitching in.  Will all of the information be in a database setting out what will happen?  What will be the outcome from everyone pitching in together?  That would be good, but I would like clarification on that.<\/p><p> What happens when a site, factory or shop is found to be in breach of safety standards?  I heard the steps that were set out, but what is the reality?  The Covid-19 protocol is a living document and it can change.  Is there room for manoeuvre before a written warning is issued or a site shut down and healthy workers are put out of work?  What can we do to help ensure total compliance on sites so that they are not shut down?  That question is also for Dr. McGuinness.<\/p><p> My next question is for Ms King.  I agree that workers need a statutory right to representation.  However, I believe there is a missing link in workers' rights in Ireland, namely, the right to raise concerns without penalisation.  While the emergency legislation and the protocols provide workers with the ability to raise issues of health and safety without suffering, that is not the reality on the ground.  In the meantime, we need to put a statutory framework in place.  I agree that something definitely must be done in that regard.<\/p><p> Does Ms King think there is fairness in the system whereby a worker is put in charge of his or her employment location safety rules?  It is well established in the construction industry, but it might be new to a hardware store or garden centre.  Are workers consulted on who the person should be?  It is very important that the representative should be fair, trusted and look after the needs of workers.<\/p><p> The following question is for Mr. Parlon.  The CIF designed a standard operating protocol for the return to work process.  As part of that, it created an online safety induction programme for workers returning to work.  I was informed by the federation that more than 130,000 workers employed in the industry have completed the induction and are continuing to complete the programme and receiving digital cards so that they can return to sites.  I wonder whether oversight is robust.  How does anyone know if the workers are fully engaged with this process?  I would like to think it is not just a box-ticking exercise and that during the inspections, Mr. Parlon's organisation will check that workers understand the protocol and that there are no language or computer literacy issues, which are major concerns.  We must support workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#MMMM00600","speaker":"1511","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1589842800,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I will try to take the Deputy's questions in the order she asked them.  There is already a requirement on employers in all workplaces to provide PPE if it is required.  It is provided in accordance with the hazard facing the worker and the worker must be trained in how to use it properly and how to remove it.  That is a general health and safety requirement.  It is up to the employer in each workplace to ensure adequate supplies of PPE are available, as required.<\/p> <p>  The language issue has been raised in certain areas.  It is something we have addressed in the past and it is something that could be considered.  That is something we could bring back to the consultative forum, which will meet later this week.  The forum's resources and its cross-body nature are fundamental, as we need such a cross-body effort.  We will bring all of the findings together.  The consultative forum will not only take account of any changing health measures but also anything we find on the ground, including if particular sectors are at issue or we feel some of the advice needs to be modified.  All those issues will be raised and taken into account at the consultative forum.  We get an input from the various bodies that are involved in inspections.<\/p> <p>  In terms of a breach of safety, as I stated, we have improvement notices and prohibition notices.  The latter, in particular, stops work activity, which is a deterrent.  It can also stop part of a work activity so it may not close down an entire site.  There are different steps involved.  In general, the steps in any inspection very much involve advice and support and ensuring people can comply and know how to bring about compliance.  We can give advice in written form following an inspection and give general guidance on when issues need to be addressed.<\/p><p>That needs to be done.  Improvement and prohibition notices have more legal basis and can be followed up appropriately within a legal context.  As I have said, these should allow employers to put measures in place to rectify matters as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#NNNN00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sharon McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1589842800,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I live in a town that produces a lot of cement.  We have a cement factory in the town and we are delighted that business is beginning again and that people are getting back to work.  Seeing more lorries and people involved in construction on the road down here and back is very welcome.  I accept and acknowledge that this will only work properly if the unions, workers and employers can work together and reach sensible consensus on issues.  Where the HSA has to get involved, it will have to have a defining role with regard to safety, which must be paramount.<\/p> <p>  The State has provided many subsidies to get businesses going again, in addition to wage and income supports.  While I accept that costs are increasing, the headline run by one of our national papers - and I appreciate the Mr. Parlon did not say this - that there could be a 40% increase in the cost of the national children's hospital is an appalling vista.  It is entirely unacceptable, particularly to the taxpayer.  I am very unhappy with that.  <\/p> <p>  I accept that costs are increasing but I am not happy about the implications for our construction industry and for people who need housing, including social housing.  Mr. Parlon will obviously want to give his arguments but I believe it is wrong that the first point of departure today is that everything is going up.  I am particularly concerned for young people.  I know many young couples who want to buy their own houses.  They were expecting a stabilisation, if not a fall, in house prices.  It is not good enough that they would face a 15% to 20% increase.  <\/p> <p>  What alternatives are there?  Deputy Burke spoke about a different type of construction and different ways of doing things.  Why do people always have to pay more and why do they have to pay more to the builder?  Why does the taxpayer have to pay more for all of these hospitals and other construction projects?  It is a mantra that we must challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#OOOO00400","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1589842800,"counter":662,"content":"<p>To clarify, I did not make that suggestion with regard to the children's hospital.  That will be subject to many negotiations.  The Deputy mentioned the hospital but I referred to complex sites that will involve a great deal of fitting out.  I am sure the children's hospital will fit into that category.  Some of our industry professionals have suggested the increase in cost for such projects could be as high as 40%.  I am sure that is negotiable.  That will all be worked out.

It is going to be a challenge.  There is no question about it.  Under the rules laid out under the protocol, finishing off complex sites such as the children's hospital, data centres or the new pharmaceutical plants will be a major challenge.  A two-year programme could well end up being a four or five-year programme, which is bound to have cost implications.  I do not suggest for a minute that it is a good idea, but it is the factual situation at the moment.  We all appreciate that if house prices come under pressure, the potential buyers of those houses will have fewer resources and less chance of getting a house.  That is something with which we will have to deal.  While the industry has to work to the letter of the law in meeting the protocol, we will have to find innovative ways of doing so more cheaply.  It is to be hoped that some of the restrictions under the protocol can be loosened over time as we make progress with the pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#OOOO00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Parlon"},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":665,"content":"<p>Mr. Parlon is correct to put on the record that there will be substantial increases to existing contracts, and the delivery of houses and other major projects.  It is no harm to mention the children's hospital because of its size.  The Government needs to understand the major implications for cost.  There is also an issue with insurance, which Mr. Parlon did not cover adequately.  Most of the insurance companies are running from anything to do with Covid-19 claims and will do anything not to pay those who are insured.<\/p> <p>  I also ask him about the collapse in funds relative to US or other international funders of the massive projects being undertaken across Dublin and other centres.  That must also be a concern.  If that happens, we will be left with major problems for the employees on those sites and for reopening those sites and avoiding an economic crash relative to the sites.<\/p> <p>  I would like the committee to recommend a Government-led forum or a place where issues like this can be worked out without it going to court.  From what Mr. Parlon has said and based on the reality on the ground, it seems that there will be major legal issues with insurance claims for the sites themselves.  The costs will need to be dealt with in that kind of forum.  I ask him to press these measures so that we do not end up being confronted with this overnight.  Now is the time to plan for it.<\/p> <p>  The point I was making about small contractors was that they need support and encouragement; I was not saying that they were less diligent.  I was saying that they are very diligent, but they are coping with an entirely new scenario now.  Rather than just looking at the big contractor, we need to embrace all those smaller contractors who are giving fair employment and doing their best.  This is something that has not been dealt with by them previously.<\/p> <p>  I say this to Dr. McGuinness on the meat factories and so on.  Someone fell down on that job.  Ms King referred to employers who are responsible, acknowledge the workforce and so on.  They were not and that is why they got into trouble.  While we expect so much from them, greater vigilance on the part of the HSA and other Government agencies needs to be put in place.  I encourage the committee to look at the alarming figure of 40% and other issues relating to insurance and funding on these major sites.  We need to deal with it and plan ahead for what will be a serious legal quagmire.  The D&aacute;il needs to confront that at an early stage, otherwise the taxpayer will pay substantially more in costs, and court appearances and challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020051900002#PPPP00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1589842800,"counter":666,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McGuinness.
