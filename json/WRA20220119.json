The aim of the new Farm Safety Action Plan is to reduce fatalities, serious injuries and ill health in the agriculture sector. Five critical areas\u00a0have been identified for attention - Behaviour, Education and Training; Health and Vulnerable Persons; Tractor; High Risk Machinery; Livestock Handling and Buildings, Work at Height.<\/p><p>The HSA, through its Agricultural Policy Unit, provides practical assistance and support to achieve the goals and objectives contained within the Farm Safety Action Plan. The Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee, which is an advisory committee to the Board of the HSA, will monitor the implementation of the action plan over its term.<\/p><p>In November 2021, legislation was introduced (Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) (Amendment No 2) Regulations 2021 (S.I. No 619 of 2021)) to make use of PPE and undergoing training mandatory for use of All Terrain Vehicles (ATV&rsquo;s) in the workplace. This was introduced as a result of the number of accidents involving these vehicles, resulting in fatalities and life changing injuries in recent years, particularly in farm settings. These Regulations will come into effect from November 2023 to ensure the necessary training and equipment requirements have been put in place.<\/p><p>In addition to the actions being undertaken by the HSA, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) under the guidance of Minister of State Martin Heydon has a range of measures\u00a0in place and in the process of being put in place to incentivise and promote the issue of farm safety. <\/p><p>A key element of the DAFM approach is the on-going Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) II scheme. Under the suite of seven TAMS measures, there is a wide range of farm safety-related investments available for grant-aid. As part of the TAMS II schemes, &lsquo;Health and Safety&rsquo; guidelines are included in all &lsquo;Building Specifications,&rsquo; drawn up by DAFM for the construction of agricultural buildings and structures. Additionally, it is a requirement for all applicants under the TAMS II schemes to complete a half day of farm safety training.<\/p><p>DAFM supports the AgriAware Farm Safe Schools initiative for 2022 which is on a mission to Engage, Educate and Empower children to be farm safety ambassadors.<\/p><p>A further initiative being taken by DAFM, in conjunction with the Department of Finance, is the Accelerated Capital Allowance Scheme for Farm Safety and Disabilities Adaptation Equipment.

The Irish State&rsquo;s general policy is to promote the sourcing of labour and skills needs from within the workforce of the European Union and other EEA states. However, where specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA, an employment permit may be sought in respect of a non-EEA national who possess those skills.<\/p>  <p>  All Employment Permit applications are processed in line with the Employment Permits Act 2006, as amended and are dependent on a job offer from an Irish registered Employer for an eligible occupation.

The CSO has provided the most recent data available. Total outsourced R&amp;amp;D in Ireland was &euro;17.104 billion in 2019, of which &euro;1.899 billion was performed in Ireland and &euro;15.206 billion was performed abroad.

It is the National Competent Authority in respect of <i>Regulation (EU) 2021\/821 of the European Parliament and of the Council setting up a Union regime for the control of exports, brokering, technical assistance, transit and transfer of dual-use items<\/i>. The Department operates the highest standards of Export Controls, in accordance with EU law and international best practice.<\/p><p>&lsquo;Dual-use&rsquo; items are products and components, including software and technology, that can be used for both civil and military applications. The list of &lsquo;Dual-use&rsquo; items subject to Export Control is set out in Annex 1 to <i>Regulation (EU) 2021\/821<\/i>. The bulk of &lsquo;Dual-use&rsquo; exports from Ireland are mainstream business ICT products, both hardware and software, (networking, data storage, cybersecurity etc). They are categorised as &lsquo;Dual-use&rsquo; items as a consequence of fact that they make use of strong encryption for data protection purposes.<\/p><p>My Department is also the National Competent Authority in respect of the <i>Trade<\/i>elements of EU Restrictive Measures i.e. trade sanctions.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government contains a clear commitment to the promotion of Human Rights through business practices and in particular, to rigorously scrutinise all applications for export licences for Dual-use items and Military equipment. <\/p><p>My Department administers controls on the export of Military equipment from Ireland, in accordance with the <i>European Council Common Position 2008\/944\/CFSP defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment<\/i>. The list of Military equipment subject to these controls is set out in the <i>Common Military List of the European Union<\/i>.<\/p><p>In keeping with the commitment in the Programme for Government, all applications for export licences are rigorously scrutinised by my officials, on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the relevant legislation.  Each application is reviewed against the eight assessment criteria set out in <i>Council Common Position 2008\/944\/CFSP. <\/i>Applications also reviewed against any EU Restrictive Measures, such as trade sanctions or arms embargoes, that may be in place in respect of the destination country.<\/p><p>The Department of Foreign Affairs has responsibility for Ireland&rsquo;s international relations and global human rights. In this context, my officials seek the views of the Department of Foreign Affairs on all applications for &lsquo;Dual-use&rsquo; and Military export licences.<\/p><p>Where appropriate, the Department also consults with Competent Authorities in other Member States.<\/p><p>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners may refer pending exports to the Department for a number of reasons: to clarify the details of an export licence presented with the goods as part of the export documentation; to verify that a licence has been properly authorised; or to confirm that a licence is not required.<\/p><p>The classification codes for &lsquo;Dual-use&rsquo; items in the EU Regulation do not translate well to the Combined Nomenclature (CN) classification for goods, which underpins the operation of the harmonised Customs Union. A single CN code can apply to both controlled and uncontrolled goods. This can give rise to uncertainty as to whether goods presented at the point of departure from the Customs Union fall within the scope of Export Controls.<\/p><p>Revenue may also refer exports to known sensitive third countries for confirmation that the exports would not be in breach of EU trade sanctions.<\/p><p>In 2020 the Department received 165 referrals from Revenue with respect to exports to the following countries: Belarus, Russia, Zimbabwe, Libya, South Korea, United States, Syria, Myanmar, Yemen, Brazil, Pakistan, Sudan, Singapore, Zambia, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, Turkey &amp;amp; Canada. After investigation, all shipments were released. It is the long-standing policy of the Department not to release exporters&rsquo; details in order to respect exporters' commercial confidentiality and protect their security.<\/p><p>The purpose of a site inspection is to assess an exporter&rsquo;s implementation of an Internal Compliance Programme (ICP). That is, its internal policies and procedures to ensure compliance with export controls and with the terms and conditions of licences. The assessment is carried out having regard to <i>Commission Recommendation (EU) 2019\/1318 on internal compliance programmes for dual-use trade controls<\/i>This Recommendation identifies and sets out the core elements essential for an effective ICP.<\/p><p>EU Regulations require that exporters seeking an export authorisation implement an ICP in most circumstances. However, the Regulations do not provide for the certification of ICPs by Member States&rsquo; competent authorities, but rather require them to take into consideration the implementation of an ICP by the exporter when assessing licence applications. Therefore, the Department&rsquo;s assessment of an exporter&rsquo;s ICP during an inspection will inform the risk assessment for subsequent licence application by the exporter.<\/p><p>Virtual visits are conducted using industry standard, secure remote conferencing systems, which incorporate encryption and other security measures.<\/p><p>In 2020 Authorised Officers of the Department conducted 20 physical site visits and 25 virtual ones. Authorised Officers of the Department also conducted 35 outreach engagements in 2020.<\/p><p>The Department issues a range of export licences, pursuant to EU Regulations and the Control of Exports Act 2008. Licenses are issued subject to a set of Terms and Conditions regarding exports made under the licence. In 2020, the Department initiated a review the Terms and Conditions to ensure that they remain fit for purpose and are appropriate for the prevailing global security and human rights situation, and current business models (supply-chains, distribution channels etc). Following this review, in 2021 the Department introduced a new Global &lsquo;Dual-use&rsquo; Licence with strengthened Terms and Conditions.<\/p><p>Work is underway within the Department to give the Terms and Conditions statutory footing and will bring forward legislation this year to provide an overarching legal framework for the introduction and revision of Terms and Conditions, along with robust powers of enforcement. The drafting of the Bill by the OPC is well advanced and it is my intention that the Bill will be published in Q1 2022, and my hope that it will be enacted before the end of 2022. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900069#WRD05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":115,"content":"<p>Question No. 81 answered with Question No. 80.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":116,"content":"<p>Question No. 82 answered with Question No. 80.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":117,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900069#WRD05400"},{"type":"question","counter":118,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[63448\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900069#WRD05500","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 203 of 21 April 2021, the status of the review of the eligibility for the insolvency payment scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>As previously advised, responsibility for the legislation governing the Insolvency Payments Scheme transferred to the Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp;amp; Employment from the Department of Social Protection in October 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are continuing to work on developing a mechanism through which a competent authority may determine that a state of insolvency arises, without requiring a formal wind-up process, and that monies due to employees may be claimed by them from the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate there are complex cross-cutting issues involved and legislative amendments will be necessary.

This report is available on the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs website, www.egfsn.ie. <\/p>  <p>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) is the independent body tasked with advising the Government on the current and future skills needs of the Irish economy. Its Secretariat is based in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its 2021 work programme, the EGFSN undertook a study on the nature and quantity of skills required between now and 2030 to deliver on some of the key enabling measures in the Climate Action Plan.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  These are the targeting of 5GW of offshore renewable wind energy, an increase in onshore wind energy of up to 8.2GW, and the generation of up to 1.5GW of grid scale solar energy; the energy efficient retrofit of 500,000 residential homes to a minimum B2 Building Energy Rating; and the target of having 840,000 electric cars, as well as 95,000 commercial vehicles, on Irish roads.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The resulting study,\u00a0Skills for Zero Carbon: The Demand for Renewable Energy, Residential Retrofit and Electric Vehicle Deployment Skills to 2030,\u00a0was published by the EGFSN on 24th November, and the Government has committed to acting on its findings in both\u00a0Housing for All- A New Housing Plan for Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Climate Action Plan 2021- Securing our Future,\u00a0through a range of upskilling, reskilling and apprenticeship supports.<\/p>  <p>  According to the EGFSN's analysis, in order to\u00a0deliver on the\u00a0Climate Action Plan's\u00a02030 targets, employment in wind and solar energy generation will have to quickly increase to 8,000, from a 3,000 baseline in 2020, within a number of years, and ultimately stand at 9,000 by 2030. This will mainly consist of workers in roles including Construction and Installation, Technicians and Technical Professionals, Engineering, Transport and Logistics, and Legal and Professional Services.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0workforce engaged in residential retrofit and heat pump installation will similarly have to ramp up quickly and increase more than fourfold (from c.4,000), to stand at over 17,000 for the remainder of the decade. These roles will mainly be concentrated in Insulation and Airtightness, Cosmetic and Repair, Lighting and Electrics, Engineering and Support, and Heating.<\/p>  <p>  The existing motor mechanic workforce of c.15,000 will meanwhile need to be transitioned to work on Electric Vehicles as EV uptake increases.<\/p>  <p>  The full details of these forecasts, including the occupational breakdowns, can be read in chapter 6 of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs report, which is available on\u00a0www.egfsn.ie.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900070#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":127,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900070#WRE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":128,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[1133\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900070#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he will engage with a company (details supplied) regarding a Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland future growth loan, given the company refuse to engage with the business making the loan application.","asker":"1467","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":129,"content":"<p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme (FGLS) first launched in 2019 to provide an option for SMEs and small mid-caps to access appropriate finance for investment purposes.

Recruitment of additional permanent and temporary staff. \u00a0This is an increase of 69% on our permanent capacity and 125% to include temporary staff to deal with the backlog.<\/p>  <p>  - Temporary reassignment of staff from other areas of the Department with relevant skills.<\/p>  <p>  - Increased overtime.<\/p>  <p>  As the Plan is implemented and begins to take effect, we expect to see rapid improvements from end-January, with the backlog considerably reduced by the end of Q1 and substantially reduced by the end of Q2 2022.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, further systemic changes have also been introduced.\u00a0 My Department has worked with the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Justice to streamline and extend the time period for General Employment Permits (GEP) issued to doctors. \u00a0A new two-year multi-site GEP for Medical Doctors in Public hospitals and Public health facilities was introduced in respect of the January 2022 Doctors rotation.\u00a0 This will result in significant benefits for applicants, as well as major efficiencies for the Employment Permits Section, by eliminating the necessity to apply for additional employment permits when moving to a different Public hospital or Public health facility within this two year period.<\/p>  <p>  The Department provides regular updates on its website in relation to processing times and engages directly with key stakeholders including the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, AmCham, IBEC, representative groups and individual companies, as required.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Management Board of my Department is overseeing the implementation of the Action Plan and its impact on the backlog and waiting times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900070#WRE05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff","counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900070#WRE05200"},{"type":"question","counter":175,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[2345\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900070#WRE05300","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the number of public sector workers under his remit by sectors (details supplied) in each of the local electoral areas in County Clare in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1519","askee":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":176,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[2360\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900070#WRE05400","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the number of public sector workers under his remit in each of the local electoral areas in County Clare in each of the years 2016 to 2021, in tabular form under headings (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1520","askee":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":177,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[2383\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900070#WRE05500","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the number of public sector workers under his remit in each of the local electoral areas in County Clare in each of the years 2016 to 2021, in tabular form under headings (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1518","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":178,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102, 103 and 104 together.<\/p><p>In relation to public sector staff under the remit of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise.

The termination of these capacity contracts was taken into account in EirGrid's Generation Capacity Statement and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities' programme of actions to address electricity security of supply which were both published in September 2021. <\/p>  <p>  Where market participants or others have concerns in relation to the operation of the electricity market in Ireland, the appropriate body to raise matters with is the Commission for Regulation of Utilities which has processes and procedures to deal with and examine any issues raised. The Commission for Regulation of Utilities is independent of me as Minister and\u00a0my Department. It is solely accountable to a Committee of the Oireachtas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900072#WRG04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":286,"content":"<p>Question No. 139 answered with Question No. 138.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reviews","counter":287,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900072#WRG04300"},{"type":"question","counter":288,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[1551\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900072#WRG04400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the current number of live studies, reviews and research undertaken or commissioned by him in tabular form; and the date by which each study, review and research is scheduled to be completed.","asker":"1466","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":289,"content":"<p>My Department administers a very diverse, complex and technical brief across critical and strategic sectors of the Irish economy.Studies, reviews and research are currently being undertaken by my Department which contribute to project delivery and informed, robust and evidence-based policy making.

In the period since 8 December, the following offshore renewable energy related milestones, which are necessary to facilitate realisation of the 5 GW of installed offshore wind by 2030 objective set out in the Climate Action Plan 2021, have been achieved by Government:    - The Maritime Area Planning Act, 2021, was signed into law by the President on the 23 December 2021. The Act represents the biggest reform of marine governance since the foundation of the State and establishes in law a new planning regime for the maritime area. The new consenting regime under the Act will be a key enabler of decarbonisation of Ireland&rsquo;s energy sources and the development of offshore energy.<\/p>  <p>  - Government has committed to the establishment of the new agency, the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, by Q1 2023. This agency will inter alia be responsible for assessing applications for Maritime Area Consents by prospective renewable energy projects, which will be a first step that is required for development within Ireland&rsquo;s maritime area. <\/p>  <p>  - A public consultation on the draft terms and conditions for the first offshore wind auction has been completed. Following assessment of the many consultation responses received, I\u00a0will seek Government approval on the final terms and conditions later this year.\u00a0The draft terms and conditions include\u00a0a mandated community benefit contribution level of &euro;2\/MWh, with these obligations to accrue to hosting communities prior to project construction.

This will not only reduce emissions from electricity but will also facilitate the electrification of heating and transport and reduce emissions in these sectors as well. Detailed modelling was undertaken in support of the development of CAP 2021.    In terms of electricity network modelling, ESB Networks (ESBN) concluded a range of system studies and modelling in 2019. These sought to identify the requirements to achieving the electric vehicle and heat-pump electrification targets in the 2019 CAP and the National Development Plan. This included a specifically commissioned study that modelled the cost of the electricity distribution network reinforcement from 2020 to Net-Zero carbon emissions.

The Single Electricity Market Committee consists of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, their Northern Ireland counterparts and an independent member. The market operates independently from me as Minister with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities being solely accountable to a Committee of the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the regulatory authorities have a number of measures in place in the Single Electricity Market to mitigate market power. These include controls on generators&rsquo; bidding under certain circumstances,\u00a0an obligation on ESB to sell a proportion of its generation output forward based on prices and volumes set by the regulatory authorities and ring-fencing, which is a regulatory measure that is used to separate generation and supply activities within certain vertically integrated companies that have the potential capability to exert market power. While my Department does not monitor the activity of market participants, I understand that the\u00a0Commission for Regulation of Utilities, through a Market Monitoring Unit monitors the behaviour of market participants in the Single Electricity Market to ensure open and transparent competition. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities has\u00a0processes and procedures\u00a0in place that allows issues or complaints to be raised.\u00a0 Any such issues would be investigated and, if breaches of competition rules were established, appropriate actions would be taken as set out in the licence terms and conditions which\u00a0could include financial penalties.\u00a0While such investigations are confidential, if any enforcement actions were taken, these would be\u00a0made public.<\/p>  <p>  Within the\u00a0Single Electricity Market there are markets for energy, generation capacity and system services. The energy market includes day ahead and intraday markets. Generators bid into these markets based on market rules, a number of which the Deputy has referenced. The market price is determined by these market rules as the marginal cost of generation capacity required in each half hour of the day. The day ahead market made up 86% of the overall energy market in the last three months of 2021 &ndash; down from 93% the previous year &ndash; and thus provides a key wholesale electricity price benchmark.<\/p>  <p>  The market price is reduced when there are greater levels of lower cost generation in the market. During periods when there are large amounts of renewable generation &ndash; such as on windy days &ndash; the market price reduces. Combined-cycle gas turbines are the most efficient fossil fuel power stations and so generally have a lower operating cost than other less efficient power stations. As a result, they are generally operating ahead of other power stations which may have higher operating costs. ESB owns and operates four of the ten combined cycle gas turbines currently in the Single Electricity Market. Continued reliable and safe operation of existing, and the development of new, generation capacity is vital to ensure security of electricity supply and provide value for money to consumers.<\/p>  <p>  The high electricity prices being seen in Ireland and across Europe are a direct result of the significant increases in natural gas prices.

Despite the unprecedented challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, National Broadband Ireland has made steady progress on delivery of the new high speed fibre broadband network under the National Broadband Plan with over 290,000 premises surveyed or with survey underway across all counties and 154,000 premises constructed or under construction. NBI has also advised that\u00a054,000 premises are available to order and pre-order across 21 counties as of 7 January 2022. <\/p>  <p>  NBI&rsquo;s fibre network architecture is centred around existing Openeir exchanges and\u00a0the State owned Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs). This strategy is based on engineering design principles that allows every premises to be passed as quickly and as efficiently as possible. The fibre network is divided up into 227 Deployment Areas (DA). Each Deployment Area is centred around existing Regional or Local Exchanges. NBI\u00a0commenced the rollout in the 33 Deployment Areas across Ireland (at least 1 per county where possible) that have regional exchanges as these exchanges already have an established connection back to existing data centres. Regional exchanges are mostly located near urban areas. Once\u00a0NBI install their equipment in the regional exchange and from there to\u00a0the data centres, they can\u00a0then install their equipment in the neighbouring local exchanges and connect them back to the regional exchange.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of County Clare, the regional exchanges are located in the Limerick and Gort Deployment Areas with local exchanges in Kilkishen, Feakle, Ogonnelloe, Corfin, Tiermaclane, Labasheeda, Kilrush, Milltown Malbay, Lisdoonvarna and Behagh. In line with the rollout of the regional exchanges, NBI started works in the Limerick Deployment Area and Gort Deployment Area and these exchanges are enabled supporting the first Premises to be passed in County Clare. Work is ongoing on the Kilkishen Deployment Area and the local exchange is due to be enabled in H2 2022. To date, NBI has surveyed more than 7,900 premises and over 1,500 premises can either order or pre-order today. <\/p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Clare through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.<\/p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 7 January, 449 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed in County Clare at Loop Head Lighthouse, Caherconnell Stone Fort, Obair Family Centre, Loughraney Kids Playschool, Michael Cusack Visitor Centre and Cree Community Centre. Further details can be found at nbi.ie\/bcp-locations\/. <\/p>  <p>  Kilmurry McMahon National School, Shragh National School, Ennistymon National School, Saint John The Baptist National School, Furraglaun Primary School, Moneen National School, Clooney National School and Stonehall National School have been installed by NBI for educational access.\u00a0 My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December 2020 with an ambition to connect some 679 schools to high speed broadband by the end of 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframes across the NBP fibre program. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie\/primary-schools-list.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900074#WRJ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1479"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Areas of Conservation","counter":388,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900074#WRJ03700"},{"type":"question","counter":389,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[2431\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900074#WRJ03800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the reason his Department is supporting the Pike Conservation Bye-Law No. 809 of 2006 and the Coarse Fish Conservation Bye-Law No. 806 of 2006 on the Lough Corrib special area of conservation given that no appropriate assessment screenings were conducted on these two bye-laws in 2006 to assess their potential impact on the conservation objectives of Lough Corrib as required under Article 6 of the EU Habitats Directive and given that prospective legislation for special area of conservation waters must be subjected to the appropriate assessment process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":390,"content":"<p>The Bye-laws referred to by the Deputy have been in place for some 16 years.

Analysis carried out in 2016 for the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty found that 28% of households in Ireland could be in energy poverty on the basis\u00a0of needing to spend more than 10% of their income on their energy needs. Good progress has been made since the launch of the Strategy as evidenced by\u00a0ESRI\u00a0analysis of the number of households at risk of experiencing energy poverty in 2019 and\u00a02020. This showed that the share of households needing to spend more than 10% of their income on their energy needs was 17.5% in 2020. The Survey on Income and Living Conditions supports this, indicating that the proportion of people who report that they are unable to afford to keep the home adequately warm, has fallen from 9% in 2015 to 3.4% in 2020.    Government policy to alleviate energy poverty for a number of years has focused on supplementing lower income households through the Fuel Allowance and other payments, as well as providing free energy efficiency upgrades through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland schemes and the Social Housing retrofitting programme. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 has allocated &euro;202 million for SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes. Over half of this (&euro;109 million) will be used to provide free energy efficiency upgrades to households that are in, or at risk of, energy poverty. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will invest a further &euro;85 million as part of the Social Housing Retrofit Programme this year. Overall, this represents an allocation of &euro;194 million to retrofitting homes of those most at risk of energy poverty - an increase of &euro;20 million on the 2021 allocation. Budget 2022 also provided for a &euro;5 increase to the Fuel Allowance to &euro;33 per week, or &euro;924 per year, as well as an extension of the eligibility criteria for the payment, by the Minister for Social Protection. <\/p>  <p>  In addition a\u00a0scheme to credit all domestic electricity account holders with up to &euro;100 in 2022 was approved by Government in\u00a0December 2021. This payment is one of a suite of measures to mitigate the effects of the recent\u00a0significant rises in electricity prices, which includes support through the social protection system. Approximately 2.1 million domestic electricity account holders will benefit from the scheme for a one-off, exceptional payment to their electricity accounts. The scheme will apply to all domestic accounts, including pay as you go customers.<\/p>  <p>  Protections are also in place for customers falling into arrears on their energy bills. Under the supplier led voluntary Energy Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them. Suppliers must also provide every opportunity to customers to avoid disconnection and must identify customers at risk of disconnection and encourage them to\u00a0engage as early as possible.<\/p>  <p>  A review of the implementation of the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty will be completed in Q1 2022 and will inform next steps in relation to the development of a new strategy. Measures to support those least able to afford to retrofit their homes have also been included in the new National Retrofit Plan, published as part of the Climate Action Plan last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900074#WRJ04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":402,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900074#WRJ05100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","counter":401,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900074#WRJ05000"},{"type":"question","counter":402,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[2246\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900074#WRJ05100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of cycling officers employed by local authorities 2020 and 2021, as committed to in the Programme for Government by county in tabular form.","asker":"1495","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":403,"content":"<p>The\u00a0Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future\u00a0commits to an expansion and enhancement of dedicated expertise on active travel across our local authority system, including the Regional Design Offices, as well as the appointment of suitably qualified Cycling Officers with clear powers and roles.<\/p>  <p>The designation of\u00a0 &ldquo;Cycling Officer&rdquo; is a matter for each Local Authority.\u00a0 My Department has sought this information from the local authorities and will provide a further update to the Deputy once received.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900074#WRJ05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cycling Policy","counter":404,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900074#WRJ05300"},{"type":"question","counter":405,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[2248\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900074#WRJ05400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of children that have availed of cycling training through the ramped up Cycle Right Programme as committed to in the Programme for Government by county in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1495","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":406,"content":"<p>As\u00a0Minister\u00a0for\u00a0Transport, I have\u00a0responsibility\u00a0for\u00a0policy\u00a0and overall\u00a0funding\u00a0in relation to public and sustainable transport generally.

More specifically, the statutory power to levy tolls, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into agreements with private investors are vested in TII under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended). <\/p>  <p>  Noting the above position, I shall request that TII provide you with details of audits carried out on each toll operator since 2010.

While recent months saw a welcome return of demand, with the National Transport Authority (NTA) reporting 86% of drivers back working in October, the recent increase in infection rates late last year gave rise to the necessary reintroduction of a number of Covid related restrictions. Conscious of the potential impact of such restrictions on affected sectors and society in general, the Government has sought to ensure that any restrictions are targeted and appropriate and is continuing to closely monitor the situation as it develops.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, I can confirm that the vast majority of measures that we have taken to support the taxi industry from the start of the pandemic remain in place and, as such, I do not consider that there is a need to introduce new or additional supports.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that as many as 70% of SPSV drivers availed of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment at the height of the pandemic. As the Deputy may be aware, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) has been reopened for a limited time to support people who lose their employment as a result of the new COVID public health restrictions from Tuesday 7 December 2021. Self-employed SPSV operators can continue to claim the PUP and earn up to &euro;960 in a given 8-week period, net of expenses.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In addition, support for SPSV operators continues to be available through a series of specific measures designed to support the sector, with a view to addressing statutory costs faced by operators which cannot be deferred. Standard licence renewal fees for SPSVs were waived in 2021 and are being waived again in 2022 at an estimated cost of &euro;3 million. The NTA has put in place schemes to refund the Motor Tax paid by SPSV operators in the period 1 September 2021 to 31 August 2022 and to waive NCT fees for the same period. Further details on these schemes are available on the NTA website.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The NTA has also waived standard age limits for taxis and hackneys through to the end of 2022, thereby ensuring no operator exits the industry simply because of the need to replace a vehicle.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Many of the major costs faced by SPSV operators, such as insurance and dispatch operator fees, can be deferred or cancelled during a period of inactivity.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Recognising that the replacement of a vehicle is the single largest cost faced by any SPSV operator, and in view of my commitment to support the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero\/low-emission vehicles, we have confirmed that there will be a further reiteration of the current eSPSV Grant Scheme this year, following the allocation of funding as part of the Budget 2022 process.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There was an exceptionally high take up rate for the eSPSV grant scheme in 2021: it received a total of 1,488 applications, and, at the beginning of November, approximately &euro;8.5 million had been paid to applicants with the remainder of funding allocated to applicants with current provisional grant offers.\u00a0 In addition, Microfinance Ireland announced on 9 September that a loan finance up to &euro;25,000\u00a0was available to support applicants to the Scheme, as many SPSV owners were finding it difficult to secure finance from banks and other commercial lending providers. \u00a0Further information on this facility is available from Microfinance Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900079#WRO03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":688,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900079#WRO04000"},{"type":"question","counter":689,"qnumday":283,"qnumall":"[2417\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900079#WRO04100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of persons who are waiting for a driving test and a theory test in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1518","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":690,"content":"<p>Under legislation, the Road Safety Authority (RSA) is the body responsible for the operation of the Theory Test and Driving Test.

This Office is an important element of the Government's ambitious insurance reform programme to help to enhance competition, reduce costs and increase the availability of cover.<\/p>  <p>  Since its establishment, the Office has held over 60 meetings with a wide range of stakeholders including insurance companies, representative bodies, civil society groups and state regulators on issues surrounding competition. \u00a0Minister Fleming also recently met with the CEOs of the major insurance providers in Ireland to discuss a variety of issues with them, including expanding their risk appetite in underserved areas, such as those raised by the Deputy. Furthermore he has also met with niche providers who are seeking to expand their cover here.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, the Office is also working closely with the IDA to bring, where possible,\u00a0new entrants into the Irish insurance market and to improve the market's overall competitiveness. Officials are seeking to leverage the ongoing reform work for potential new market entrants and are identifying targets to engage with. This will, in the first instance, seek out providers who offer insurance in areas which have been identified as &lsquo;pinch-points&rsquo; in the Irish market where some customers are encountering difficulties. <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, this Government is committed to securing a more sustainable and competitive market through seeking to deepen and widen the supply of insurance in Ireland. In this regard, it is my intention to work with colleagues across Government departments to ensure the timely implementation of the Action Plan as the best means of helping deliver this, including for community centres as outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900080#WRP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":725,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900080#WRP01100"},{"type":"question","counter":726,"qnumday":295,"qnumall":"[63061\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900080#WRP01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider introducing tax relief for those in the hospitality sector who wish to purchase food waste biodigesters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":727,"content":"<p>Section 284 Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 makes provision for a person carrying on a trade, who incurs capital expenditure on the provision of machinery or plant for the purposes of the trade, to claim capital allowances in respect of that expenditure. \u00a0Capital allowances allow the wear and tear of plant and machinery be taken into account as a deduction for tax purposes.

The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 crisis. It is an economy-wide scheme that operates across all sectors.<\/p>  <p>  In money terms, the overall support provided to-date (13th January) by EWSS is over &euro;7 billion comprising direct subsidy payments of  &euro;6.12 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;956 million to 51,900 employers in respect of over 706,700 employees.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, as announced on 9th December the enhanced rates of EWSS subsidy would apply for a further two months, December 2021 and January 2022. This will give certainty to businesses when they need it most.<\/p>  <p>  The Government and I have been clear that there will be no cliff edge to supports for employers but we have also been clear that the EWSS cannot run indefinitely, nor is it sustainable to continue with the enhanced rates for a prolonged period of time given the very substantial costs to the Exchequer.<\/p>  <p>  As such, from 1 February 2022, the original two-rate structure of &euro;203 per week and &euro;151.50 per week will apply; for March and April 2022 the flat rate subsidy of &euro;100 per week will apply and the scheme will end on 30 April 2022.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question, the Government further announced on the 21 December 2021, that the EWSS will reopen for certain businesses who would otherwise not be eligible and that such businesses can continue to be supported until the expiry of the scheme on 30 April 2022. The new arrangements for EWSS will provide employers who have previously availed of EWSS but who are no longer eligible, with the opportunity to re-qualify for the scheme where they meet certain conditions. Broadly, to re-qualify the business must experience a 30% reduction in turnover, or customer orders during a particular reference period.

This Office is an important element of the Government's ambitious insurance reform programme to help to enhance competition, reduce costs and increase the availability of cover.<\/p>  <p>  Since its establishment, the Office has held over 60 meetings with a wide range of stakeholders including insurance companies, representative bodies, civil society groups and state regulators on issues surrounding competition. \u00a0Minister Fleming also recently met with the CEOs of the major insurance providers in Ireland to discuss a variety of issues with them, including expanding their risk appetite in underserved areas, such as those raised by the Deputy.

The EWSS remains in operation until 30 April 2022. <\/p>  <p>  The key eligibility criteria for the TWSS were that the business was suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic, the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before 1 April 2020, at the latest.<\/p>  <p>  As regards eligibility for the EWSS, an employer must be able to demonstrate that its business has experienced a 30% reduction in turnover or orders between 1 January and 31 December 2021, by reference to the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of business disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the employer must have a tax clearance certificate to be eligible to join the EWSS and must continue to meet the requirements for tax clearance throughout the scheme.\u00a0 Where an eligible employer makes a payment of wages, within prescribed limits, to a qualifying employee during the scheme, the employer can claim an EWSS subsidy in respect of that employee. <\/p>  <p>  As I have said previously, the primary purpose of the COVID wage subsidy schemes is to ensure, as much as possible, that employers keep employees in employment, thereby maintaining the employer\/employee relationship, so that normal operations can quickly restart once the restrictions are lifted, rather than making them redundant and eligible for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). These emergency support schemes were developed to deal with a situation where businesses were restricted from trading due to public health guidelines and not because of any economic or other trading conditions. It was considered that the best metric to determine the impact of the public health restrictions was a decline in turnover. At the outset of the restrictions nobody could anticipate how long or what impact the restrictions would have or how businesses or customers would react. \u00a0Qualification for TWSS, and subsequently EWSS, was based on projections of the business.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation enacted by the Oireachtas places the administration of the subsidy schemes under the care and management of Revenue, which includes ensuring that this very significant investment of public funds is properly allocated to eligible employers and businesses in line with the legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria for the wage subsidy schemes, as provided for in legislation, do not include any conditions related to the payment by a company of a dividend or dividends to its shareholders. Thus, there is no impediment to employers paying dividends to its shareholders and this is a business decision for a company to take based on its financial circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners is statutorily independent in how it conducts its activities so it would not be appropriate for me to request Revenue to conduct an examination of companies who have paid out dividends, while also receiving State supports.\u00a0 In any event, the fact that the legislation does not prohibit the practice would seem to make such an examination inappropriate.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the Deputy&rsquo;s second question on whether I propose to introduce new conditions on employers in relation to the use of and access to the EWSS, it should be noted that the overwhelming majority of companies that have participated in the wage subsidy schemes did so because they genuinely believed they would need support at that point based on the effect of the pandemic on their business. The experience both Revenue and I have had is that employers participating in the scheme are doing so in good faith. <\/p>  <p>  I would also note that the schemes are characterised by a high degree of compliance by beneficiary firms. I set out details of the comprehensive compliance and assurance programmes carried out by Revenue in relation to the wage subsidy schemes separately in response to other questions raised by the Deputy.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that a number of companies have returned the TWSS or EWSS payments to Revenue either because they voluntarily withdrew from either scheme, found they were ineligible or their business performance was better than they expected when they entered the schemes.\u00a0 In that regard 860 employers have refunded &euro;10.9 million in TWSS payments.\u00a0 In addition, 16 employers advised Revenue they were voluntarily removing themselves from the EWSS, 9 of whom fully withdrew and repaid nearly &euro;21 million and 7 partially withdrew and repaid just over &euro;4.5 million.<\/p>  <p>  A total of 402 employers have repaid in full all subsidies claimed since the EWSS began, totalling approximately &euro;52 million with an additional 3,331 making partial repayments totalling approximately &euro;54 million.<\/p>  <p>  To date, the EWSS has helped almost 52,000 employers to keep over 700,000 employees in employment since the scheme began in September 2020.\u00a0 It is highly likely that the vast majority of employers who have claimed COVID-19 wage supports have not had the wherewithal to pay dividends during the period of the pandemic.\u00a0 It is not readily apparent to me what impact an outright ban on dividend payments, or indeed a cap on such payments, would have had on the employment prospects of those 700,000 employees whose employers have been supported by EWSS payments.<\/p>  <p>  However, I have said previously that I will keep this matter under review and assess if it would be appropriate to introduce any further conditionality into the scheme. This issue requires careful consideration to ensure that businesses that may well be profitable, but are far less profitable than they were in the past, are not precluded from participating in the scheme in the future. Such firms may still require this\u00a0support to have a viable and successful future. It would be important that any changes are proportionate and would not undermine the overarching policy rationale underpinning the scheme, which is to maintain employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900081#WRQ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":814,"content":"<p>Question No. 324 answered with Question No. 323.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":816,"qnumday":325,"qnumall":"[1222\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900081#WRQ03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding the inability by a company (details supplied) to secure Covid restrictions support scheme support owing to loss of earnings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1618","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":817,"qnumday":352,"qnumall":"[2106\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900081#WRQ04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if further changes will be made to the Covid restrictions support scheme to include new businesses which have been set up in the past three to six months that have been impacted by the recent public health restrictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":818,"qnumday":354,"qnumall":"[2169\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900081#WRQ04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to introduce a modified Covid restrictions support scheme for retail businesses that anticipate that their income will be subjected to a substantial loss in the first quarter of 2022 due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic; if such a modified scheme will be examined for retail businesses that can provide evidence that their income is down 30% or more at the start of 2022 compared to their last full year of trading accounts pre-pandemic; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1609","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":819,"qnumday":356,"qnumall":"[2271\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900081#WRQ04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will introduce a 10% turnover grant for new and existing businesses that had reduced opening hours due to public health restrictions and will not meet turnover requirements to qualify for the Covid restrictions support scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":820,"qnumday":359,"qnumall":"[2293\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900081#WRQ04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider extending the eligibility for the Covid restrictions support scheme to businesses that began trading after 26 July 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":821,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 325, 352, 354, 356 and 359 together.<\/p>  <p>  Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) was introduced by Section 11 of the Finance Act 2020. The scheme is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits of which are chargeable to tax under Case 1 of Schedule D, from a business premises that is subject to restrictions that prohibit or considerably restrict customer access.<\/p>  <p>  From 20 December 2021, the Government introduced certain restrictive measures for businesses within the hospitality and indoor entertainment sectors. As part of these measures, an 8pm closing time has been imposed from 20 December 2021 to 31 January 2022. Businesses operating within these sectors, who would ordinarily operate evening and night-time trading hours, will be considered to be significantly restricted from operating for the purposes of the CRSS and will be eligible for support under the scheme where they meet the eligibility conditions.\u00a0 The Government have also agreed that the turnover reduction criteria will be increased from no more that 25% of 2019 turnover to no more that 40% of 2019 turnover.<\/p>  <p>  It is not sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19, or by public health guidance generally in force. The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or significantly restrict access to its business premises.<\/p>  <p>  To qualify for the CRSS, a business must have tax clearance and have been established prior to 26 July 2021. Any business established after 26 July 2021 is not eligible for the scheme. Revenue has advised me that the business referred to in question (1222\/21) was established in September 2021 and, as such, does not qualify for the CRSS. <\/p>  <p>  Under the existing scheme any business established after 12 October 2020 was not eligible for CRSS. The Government have decided that new businesses established between 13 October 2020 and 26 July 2021 will now be eligible to apply for the scheme.\u00a0 \u00a0In addition to the amendment of the turnover criteria, this is a significant extension of the CRSS. The CRSS is intended as a support for existing businesses and I have no plans to further modify the eligibility criteria of the CRSS.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation provides businesses with the entitlement to appeal Revenue&rsquo;s decision on CRSS eligibility to the independent Tax Appeals Commission (TAC), where they dispute the interpretation applied.\u00a0 If a business\u00a0wishes to appeal Revenue&rsquo;s decision that it is not entitled to the CRSS, it should do so within 30 days of the refusal notification. <\/p>  <p>  The CRSS is just one of the Government supports to assist businesses impacted by COVID-19. Businesses not falling within the scope of the CRSS may be entitled to support under other measures put in place by Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).\u00a0EWSS is an economy-wide scheme that operates across all sectors.\u00a0 As the Deputy may be aware, as announced on 9 December, it was decided that the enhanced rates of support which were due to end on 30 November 2021 would be extended for a further two months until end-January 2022. On 21 December, it was decided on foot of the restrictions I have outlined above, that the EWSS would reopen for certain businesses who would otherwise not be eligible for the support. Businesses that previously registered for EWSS and received a payment in compliance with the scheme have the opportunity to re-qualify for the scheme where they meet certain conditions. Broadly, the business must experience a 30% reduction in turnover, or customer orders during a particular reference period and have tax clearance.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is my intention that the legislative aspects associated with the revised arrangements for CRSS and EWSS, outlined above, will be addressed by primary legislation in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the Revenue Commissioners are operating the revised arrangements on an administrative basis pending the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900081#WRQ04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services","counter":822,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900081#WRQ04500"},{"type":"question","counter":823,"qnumday":326,"qnumall":"[1257\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900081#WRQ04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the acquirer of a regulated entity authorised under section 10 of the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995 must notify the Central Bank.","asker":"1595","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":824,"content":"<p>The Central Bank of Ireland is designated as the supervisory authority with respect to the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995 ('the IIA').<\/p>  <p>  Section 39(1) of the IIA sets out that any person proposing to make an \"acquiring transaction\" (as defined in section 38(2) of the IIA) of an authorised investment business firm shall notify the supervisory authority in writing of the proposal and include with the notification specified information concerning the proposed acquiring transaction. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, Section 40 of the Act sets out that the acquiring transaction cannot proceed without the supervisory authority informing the authorised investment business firm and the party making the acquiring transaction in writing that it approves of the acquiring transaction or until three months have elapsed during which the supervisory authority\u00a0has not refused to approve of the acquiring transaction, whichever first occurs.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900081#WRQ04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":825,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900081#WRQ04800"},{"type":"question","counter":826,"qnumday":327,"qnumall":"[1260\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900081#WRQ04900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the options that are available to an applicant to the help-to-buy scheme who disputes the valuation provided by the lender; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":827,"content":"<p>The Help to Buy (HTB) incentive, is a scheme to assist first-time purchasers with the deposit they need to buy or build a new house or apartment.

This is an EU requirement across all Member States and is necessary to protect public health, to ensure food safety and product standards and to protect EU businesses from unfair international competition thus preserving jobs for European workers, including Irish workers. The information required for the importation of non-Union goods is specified in the UCC and includes the commodity (TARIC) code of the items within the gift. I am advised by Revenue that the data contained within the import declaration, serves not only to allow for the calculation of the taxes and duties which may be owed, but also facilitates the risk analysis of the goods in order to ensure the provenance of goods imported into the EU and to protect EU citizens from goods which may pose a danger to the health and well-being of citizens and enables Revenue to target and disrupt illegal trade, and confront non-compliance. <\/p><p>While data may be supplied on the physical parcel \/ package, this does not remove the obligation for an electronic import declaration which is required to facilitate the completion of an electronic risk assessment and calculation of tax and duty owed. Consignments from outside the EU cannot be delivered without a valid electronic Customs import declaration. While tax and duty are not usually payable on gifts valued at less than &euro;45, an electronic import declaration including the TARIC code is still required for every gift. <\/p><p>I am also advised by Revenue that in the context of parcels and packages, while Customs declarations are often submitted by the courier business or postal operator on behalf of the recipient (importer) in Ireland, the information required to complete the declaration is generally supplied by the exporting party although the importer (the recipient in Ireland) may also provide information to the courier business or postal operator that is needed to complete the declaration. Where the courier business or postal operator does not have the necessary information, it may contact the exporting party or the importer to gather the necessary information to enable them to complete the declaration. Alternatively, where sufficient information to complete the Customs declaration in not available, the courier business or postal operator may choose to return the goods to the sender. It is a matter for the relevant courier business or postal operator to determine, based on its business model, how to deal with instances where they do not have the data needed to complete the necessary Customs declaration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900082#WRR00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":844,"content":"<p>Question No. 333 answered with Question No. 332.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reviews","counter":845,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900082#WRR00700"},{"type":"question","counter":846,"qnumday":334,"qnumall":"[1552\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900082#WRR00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the current number of live studies, reviews and research undertaken or commissioned by him in tabular form; and the date by which each study, review and research is scheduled to be completed.","asker":"1466","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":847,"content":"<p>There is\u00a0continued monitoring of\u00a0tax related issues by\u00a0my Department.

At the outset, it is important to note that such deductions may\u00a0arise\u00a0in accordance with\u00a0the principle of indemnity, under which an insured party who has suffered a loss is restored, in so far as possible, to the same financial position that they were in immediately prior to this event. In addition, this practice must be considered on a case-by-case basis, as individual policy wordings could provide a contractual basis for making such deductions.<\/p>  <p>  My officials have considered various options to address this issue. As recently noted by Minister of State Fleming at the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach, any retrospective recoupment of amounts deducted by insurers would be difficult to implement from a legal perspective. Separately, it is my understanding\u00a0 that the issue of Government grants is expected to be addressed as part of a ruling on quantum in the ongoing business interruption test case, which remains before the Courts, and on which it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.<\/p>  <p>  In light of these considerations, it was decided that the appropriate way to address this issue is to increase the transparency around the deduction of State supports from claims settlements. The Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is currently being drafted, will make amendments to existing legislation to enable the Central Bank to collect data on such deductions by insurers through the National Claims Information Database (NCID). This will greatly enhance policymakers&rsquo; understanding of the prevalence of this practice, and will provide an important evidence-base for taking any further action in this area, if necessary, in order to protect taxpayers&rsquo; interests. In addition, the Bill will create a new requirement on insurers to notify consumers about any such deductions made to claims settlements. <\/p>  <p>  I believe that this is a proportionate and appropriate response to this issue, which will avoid unintended consequences and will not pre-empt any legal ruling on the matter. I expect the draft Bill to be published early within this quarter, and I look forward to working with colleagues to progress it through the Oireachtas\u00a0to complement\u00a0the Government&rsquo;s ongoing work on insurance reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900082#WRR01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":857,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900082#WRR01900"},{"type":"question","counter":858,"qnumday":338,"qnumall":"[1755\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900082#WRR02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of appeals received by the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal in 2019; the number granted and refused on appeal in 2019; the corresponding figures for 2017, 2018, 2020 and 2021; the number of suitably qualified applications received for appointment to the new board of appeal; when he expects it to be operational; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":859,"content":"<p>The Disabled Drivers &amp;amp; Disabled Passengers Scheme (DDS) provides relief from VRT and VAT on the purchase and use of an adapted car, as well as an exemption from motor tax and an annual fuel grant.<\/p><p>The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons who also meet one of six specified medical criteria, as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations.

In money terms, the overall support provided to-date\u00a0(as at 13 January) by EWSS is over &euro;7 billion, comprising of direct subsidy payments of &euro;6.12 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;956 million to 51,900 employers, in respect of over 706,700 employees.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There are, however, certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit to consumers.\u00a0 For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a Central Bank regulated mortgage lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The CMCAR further provides that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.\u00a0 The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are\u00a0necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on regulated lenders.\u00a0 Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. <\/p>  <p>  The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.\u00a0 Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an\u00a0application for mortgage credit remains a commercial matter for the individual lender and the fact\u00a0that\u00a0EWSS legislation enacted by the Oireachtas placed\u00a0the administration of the scheme under the care and management of Revenue does not change or impact on that position.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that\u00a0the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 Therefore, if a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for credit or the drawn down of credit, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant\u00a0is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she\u00a0can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Matters in relation to\u00a0policy and the administration of mortgages provided by local authorities are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900082#WRR03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":872,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900082#WRR03400"},{"type":"question","counter":873,"qnumday":343,"qnumall":"[1841\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900082#WRR03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the issues raised by an association (details supplied) in relation to the new interpretation of VAT in relation to dental services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":874,"content":"<p>The VAT treatment of the supply of goods and services is subject to the requirements of the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.

The final consumer in this fee sharing arrangement is not a patient availing of a supply of dental services to which the exemption applies.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has been clear at all times regarding the VAT treatment of dental fee sharing arrangements and has outlined its position in correspondence and meetings with the Irish Dental Association.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900082#WRR03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":875,"content":"<p>Question No. 344 answered with Question No. 311.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":876,"content":"<p>Question No. 345 answered with Question No. 311.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":877,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900082#WRR03900"},{"type":"question","counter":878,"qnumday":346,"qnumall":"[1900\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900082#WRR04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total tax take on a pint of beer retailing at &euro;6 and a bottle of wine retailing at &euro;12.50.","asker":"1507","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":879,"content":"<p>Alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine are subject to an excise duty in the form of Alcohol Products Tax (APT) and are also subject to Value-Added Tax (VAT). <\/p>  <p>  Council Directive 92\/83\/EEC lays down a harmonised approach for the application of excise duties to alcohol and alcoholic beverages in the EU. It includes provisions defining categories of alcohol and alcoholic beverages and sets out the basis on which excise duties on such products are to be established. Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the Finance Act 2003 transposes Council Directive 92\/83\/EEC and the rates of APT for the various categories of alcoholic beverages are provided for in Schedule 2 of that Act.\u00a0 The rate of APT applying to a particular alcoholic beverage depends on the category it falls within and its alcohol content which is expressed as a percentage of volume.<\/p>  <p>  The VAT rating of goods is subject to the requirements of the EU VAT Directive with which Irish VAT law must comply.\u00a0 In accordance with the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010, VAT is chargeable on beer and wine at the standard rate, currently 23% in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The rate of APT on beer with an alcohol content exceeding 2.8% volume is currently &euro;22.55 per hectolitre per cent of alcohol in the beer. For a pint of beer with, for example, 4.2% alcohol content, APT would be &euro;0.54. \u00a0VAT at 23% on a pint of beer retailing at &euro;6 would be &euro;1.12.

The report put forward options for further consideration, rather than recommendations, and any further consideration would require the participation of several Departments and organisations, including my own Department.\u00a0The ten options are split into short, medium and long-term options. Five potential short-term options were identified as measures which could potentially be implemented within 18 months, i.e. within Budgets 2018 and 2019.<\/p><p>One short-term option was to increase the mortgage interest deduction available to landlords.\u00a0 In this context, it should be noted that in Budget 2017, a phased unwinding of the restriction on interest deductibility over five years for all residential landlords was initiated. The second step, an increase from 80% to 85% deductibility, took effect from 1 January 2018.\u00a0 Budget 2019 accelerated progress in this area and, from 1 January 2019, the restoration of full mortgage interest deductibility for landlords of residential property has been in place.\u00a0<\/p><p>A further option was to consider introducing Local Property Tax (LPT) deductibility for landlords. The\u00a0Report noted\u00a0that LPT is a relatively small expense and therefore is unlikely to make a significant difference to the position of any individual landlord in cash terms and so may not be regarded by landlords as a sufficient measure to encourage them to stay in or enter the rental market. The Report also found that the measure would also have a deadweight cost in respect of landlords who do not intend to leave the rental market and would create a more favourable position for landlords of property compared to owner-occupiers, as owner-occupiers cannot claim a tax deduction for LPT. <\/p><p>In Budget 2018 I introduced another of the short-term options: deductibility for pre-letting expenditure for previously vacant properties. This measure applies to residential premises which have been vacant for at least 12 months and which are then let after the date of the passing of the Finance Act 2017, i.e. after 25 December 2017. The expenditure is allowed as a deduction against rental income from that premises. It applies to expenses that would be allowable if they had been incurred while the property was let, such as the cost of repairs, insurance, maintenance and management of the property.\u00a0\u00a0Certain limitations are in place regarding this measure, for example the expenditure must have been incurred in the 12 months before the premises is let as a residential premises. \u00a0The total deduction allowed is capped at &euro;5,000 per vacant premises and the deduction will be clawed-back if the property ceases to be let as a residential premises within four years of the first letting. I prioritised this option as it was specifically designed to encourage an overall increase in housing supply by bringing currently vacant property back into residential use. As the Deputy may be aware, I extended this measure in Budget 2022.<\/p><p>The final short-term option was to improve the collection and sharing of data on the rental accommodation sector.\u00a0 A significant issue that hampered the progress of the Working Group was a lack of robust data on various elements of the housing market, due to the differing metrics used by the various agencies. With\u00a0a view to address\u00a0this issue, a Data Group was convened after the publication of the Housing for All Strategy to ensure the plan is underpinned by a robust data strategy. The group reports to the Housing for All Delivery Group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and my Department participates in the bi-weekly meetings of this group.<\/p><p>Five of the options put forward in the report were medium-term and long-term options. Medium-term options are measures which work with the current tax system but might take longer to develop and implement, and as such would require a longer lead-in period. The long-term options look at the potential for more fundamental changes to the tax system, and so would require significantly greater resource commitments to progress.\u00a0 <\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government through which to boost rental and overall housing supply and that, in line with the Tax Expenditure Guidelines, consideration of whether a tax measure is the most appropriate policy tool for a given purpose would be required. Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in the housing sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance when considering intervention in the rental sector. There are many competing priorities which must be considered when deciding which policy measures to introduce and the rental sector is just one of many other sectors that may require assistance and intervention.<\/p><p>Finally, the following tables summarise the options set out in the report. <table>    <tr>       <th>Short-term options<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Accelerated restoration of full mortgage interest deductibility for\u00a0landlords of residential property <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Introducing Local Property Tax deductibility for landlords <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Enhancing loss relief for landlords (or a sub-set of landlords), to allow relief for rental losses against other income sources in the same year <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Introducing deductibility for pre-letting expenditure for previously vacant properties <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Improvements in the collection and sharing of data on the rental accommodation sector <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table>  <table>    <tr>       <th>Medium-term options<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Allowing a deduction against rental income for an element of the capital cost of the rental property in the initial years of ownership, with a corresponding reduction in the base cost of the property for Capital Gains Tax purposes on a future disposal <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Capital Gains Tax relief for properties acquired and retained as rental accommodation <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Incentive to attract investment capital into the construction of property, in areas of need, to be let at social \/ affordable rents. <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table>  <table>    <tr>       <th>Long-term options<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Review of provisions for the holding of rental property via pension vehicles <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Consideration of developing a separate method of taxing rental income, for example, a flat tax or a separate rate of tax, as a policy lever to support the sector as a whole or specific sub-sectors (for example, affordable housing\/urban housing) <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> p. 6 'The Report of the Working Group on the Tax and Fiscal Treatment of Accommodation Providers', available at www.gov.ie\/en\/collection\/51d1c-budget-2018\/\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900082#WRR04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":886,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900082#WRR04800"},{"type":"question","counter":887,"qnumday":349,"qnumall":"[2041\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900082#WRR04900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount his Department estimates it received in overpaid taxes in 2020 and 2021; his plans to make taxpayers aware of their overpayments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1482","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":888,"content":"<p>Following engagement with the Deputy&rsquo;s Office, I am advised that the Deputy&rsquo;s Question specifically relates to PAYE taxpayers.<\/p>  <p>  On that basis, it should be noted that PAYE taxpayers can claim a range of additional tax credits and reliefs in respect of various expenses incurred during a tax year.\u00a0 The most common of which are health expenses, nursing home fees, tuition fees, remote working relief and stay and spend credit.

Depending on the particular circumstances of the business in question, the re-opening of EWSS may be relevant to certain businesses who previously didn&rsquo;t qualify for EWSS as at 31 December 2021. <\/p>  <p>  Further details of the qualifying conditions can be located on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link- <\/p>  <p>www.gov.ie\/en\/press-release\/bf5d1-government-announces-significant-expansion-of-supports-for-businesses-affected-by-the-latest-public-health-restrictions\/.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS) remains in place to support businesses who are required to close or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises, and who meet the qualifying criteria.\u00a0 Under the relevant legislation, the CRSS was due to end on 31 December 2021 but it was extended to the end of January 2022. <\/p>  <p>  The Tax Debt Warehousing Scheme remains available to support businesses that are experiencing tax payment difficulties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. The scheme applies to VAT debts, PAYE (Employer) debts, certain self-assessed income tax debts and overpayments of both the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and the EWSS. <\/p>  <p>  On 20 December 2021 the Government agreed to extend the tax debt warehousing scheme to extend the period where liabilities arising can be &ldquo;warehoused&rdquo; to the end of Q1 2022 for taxpayers eligible for the COVID-19 support schemes; this means that interest free period for those taxpayers will now be 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023, extending the period by 3 months from 31 December 2022.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It is worth pointing out the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available over the course of the last 18 months or so and are still available, such as the CRSS and the Credit Guarantee Scheme, for businesses with reduced turnover as a result of public health restrictions.\u00a0\u00a0 A full list of the Covid-19 Income Supports Schemes available to businesses can be obtained via the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment&rsquo;s at the following link - <\/p>  <p>  enterprise.gov.ie\/en\/What-We-Do\/Supports-for-SMEs\/COVID-19-supports\/ <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I would also draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s Tourism Business Continuity Scheme 2022, which was launched last week.\u00a0 Further details can be obtained via the following link &ndash; <\/p>  <p>  www.failteireland.ie\/tourism-business-continuity-programme.aspx\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Finally, as has been the case throughout the pandemic, the Government will continue to monitor developments closely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900083#WRS00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":900,"content":"<p>Question No. 354 answered with Question No. 325.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":901,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900083#WRS00700"},{"type":"question","counter":902,"qnumday":355,"qnumall":"[2210\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900083#WRS00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the analysis his Department has carried out into increases in insurance premiums based on age; the analysis his Department has carried out into whether this practice is discriminatory; his plans to address potential discrimination in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":903,"content":"<p>At the outset, it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have any influence over the pricing or provision of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter assessed on a case-by-case basis.\u00a0This position is reinforced by the EU legislative framework for insurance (the\u00a0Solvency II\u00a0Directive). Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level that they should apply to particular categories of individuals.<\/p>  <p>  On a general level, insurance companies consider a number of risks when determining the premium for a proposed insurance policy.\u00a0For example, in the case of motor insurance, I understand that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, such as: the age of the driver; vehicle type; claims record; driving experience; number of drivers; how the car is used; etc.\u00a0Insurers also price in accordance with their specific claims experience and do not use the same combination of rating factors. Accordingly, premium prices vary across the market. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s query about potential discrimination, I would note generally that the Equal Status Acts 2000-2018 prohibit certain kinds of discrimination, including in the provision of services. The legislation protects against discrimination on nine specific grounds, including age. However, in relation to insurance, the legislation also provides that people can be treated differently on any of the grounds (except gender) &ndash; but only if the differences are based on actuarial or statistical data or other relevant underwriting or commercial factors, and are reasonably based.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes that consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it may be useful for the Deputy to know that Insurance Ireland, the representative body for the insurance industry in this country, operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.

However, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.\u00a0 As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks including the interest rates they charge for loans including mortgages.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Despite this, it should also be noted that recent trends indicate that certain mortgage rates have been falling in Ireland. For example, the interest rates on new mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.05% in December 2014 to 2.71% in November 2021.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The weighted average interest rate on new fixed rate mortgage agreements stood at 2.59% in November 2021, down from a series high of 4.11% in December 2014. There has also been a reduction in the interest rates charged on loans to SMEs and consumers over the same period.<\/p>  <p>  However, Irish mortgage and other loans\u00a0can have different characteristics from those offered in other countries.\u00a0For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers, which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Also Irish mortgages are\u00a0generally not subject to upfront fees which are typically charged by banks in some other EU jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  There are also\u00a0a number of important factors which will likely influence\u00a0the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages. These include for example operational costs, certain structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect: <\/p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;<\/p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks (as provisioning and capital requirements are higher for these loans to reflect their higher risk and this in turn results in higher credit and capital costs for the Irish banks); and<\/p>  <p>  - higher cost-to-income\u00a0ratios which has\u00a0been a characteristic of the Irish banking sector in recent years. <\/p>  <p>  Separately the Central Bank introduced a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in\u00a02017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's (CCPC) mortgage switching tool.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in\u00a02019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. Consumers can reduce average pricing in the mortgage market by availing of switching options to ensure that recent and potential future price reductions through increased competition pass through to the greatest number of customers possible. Indeed a Central Bank\u00a0study estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remaining term. <\/p>  <p>  To conclude I appreciate that greater sustainable competition\u00a0in the credit market will be of benefit to consumers and other borrowers.\u00a0 Accordingly,\u00a0the review of the retail banking market which is now underway in my Department will consider\u00a0how the banking system can best support economic activity,\u00a0assess\u00a0competition and consumer choice in the market for banking services and consider\u00a0options to further develop the mortgage market.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900083#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Consultations","counter":908,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900083#WRS01400"},{"type":"question","counter":909,"qnumday":358,"qnumall":"[2287\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900083#WRS01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide an update on the expected commencement date for the retail banking review public consultation process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":910,"content":"<p>On 23<sup>rd<\/sup>November last, I announced the Terms of Reference for the Retail Banking Review.

The main purpose of a pension fund is to provide a secure income in retirement for the pension beneficiary. The purpose of providing tax relief for pension contributions is to encourage saving - by employers, employees and the self-employed - towards retirement income. Any drawdown permitted would reduce the pension savings from which individuals could provide for their retirement, with smaller pension schemes losing a larger proportion of their overall savings.<\/p>  <p>  As an exceptional measure, with a view of relieving hardship during the financial crisis, early drawdown from pension funds was permitted. However, it was only available from one type of pension product (additional voluntary contributions (AVCs)) and it was introduced for a limited period of time. Section 782A Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provided members of occupational pension schemes with a three-year period, from 27 March 2013 to 26 March 2016, during which they could draw down, on a once-off basis, up to 30% of the accumulated value of their AVCs. The amount drawn down was subject to income tax under Schedule E, PRSI and USC, which was collected under the PAYE system.<\/p>  <p>  The maximum amount that could be drawn down under this provision was 30% of the accumulated value of AVCs made by the individual. This meant that draw down was not available to anyone who had not made AVCs. Furthermore, it was not possible to make a drawdown from AVCs paid by an employer; from any AVCs which were part of a scheme member&rsquo;s &ldquo;normal&rdquo; contributions; from any contributions to a Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA); or from contributions by the employer or the individual to an occupational pension scheme.<\/p>  <p>  While leaving employment or changing professions before retirement may have implications for the individual and could potentially bring financial hardship, it is not the intended purpose of a pension fund to provide income for an individual during this time.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland operates what is described as an &ldquo;Exempt &ndash; Exempt &ndash; Taxed&rdquo; or &ldquo;EET&rdquo; pension regime. Contributions to a pension fund are relieved from tax (first &ldquo;E&rdquo;) and growth in these funds are also accumulated on a tax-free basis (second &ldquo;E&rdquo;). Payments out of the fund during retirement are then subject to income tax (&ldquo;T&rdquo;) and USC and PRSI where applicable. The introduction of a scheme to allow early drawdown of pension funds could undermine the integrity of the &ldquo;EET&rdquo; regime.

In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other qualifying criteria apply in relation to the vehicle, in particular that it must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.

The Regulator has advised that there are protocols in place to ensure that rigorous testing of equipment takes place before each and every Lotto draw and that each step of the draw process is strictly adhered to. The Regulator has also confirmed that the Lotto game has operated in line with the game rules and that there are no regulatory issues<\/p>  <p>  The current extended period without a jackpot win, preceded by three jackpot wins in three weeks, is unusual in the history of the game. However, statistically unlikely events are part of the nature of games of chance and of lotteries. Following a request from the Operator for a &ldquo;Will be Won&rdquo; change to the Lotto Game and to bring the extended roll-over to an end, the Regulator has approved this new feature of the game.<\/p>  <p>  This new feature sees the full Lotto jackpot roll down to a winner or winners in the next winning prize tier if not won by a Match 6 ticket within five draws of the jackpot reaching its &euro;19m cap. The request for this new feature was submitted by the Operator on 7th December 2021. The Regulator and her officials have prioritised the regulatory checks in place to ensure that any changes to Lotto game rules were in the interest of players, that the National Lottery continues to be run with all due propriety and, subject to these, that returns to Good Causes are maximised.  The Regulator requested further essential information, tests, and assurances from the Operator on its proposal and is satisfied that the &ldquo;Will Be Won&rdquo; feature meets all regulatory requirements.  <\/p>  <p>The first &ldquo;Will Be Won&rdquo; draw held on Saturday 15th   January 2022 was won by a single ticket holder. I am pleased that the long running roll over of the lottery jackpot has come to a conclusion, that the Lotto Jackpot was capped at &euro;19m in October and note that lotto prizes have been boosted by an additional &euro;23.9m as a result of this measure. The introduction of arrangements that ensure that this situation will not be repeated with the new &ldquo;Will be Won&rdquo; arrangements is also welcome. I would also note that an unprecedented &euro;289m has been generated for Good Causes from the National Lottery in 2021, a 14% increase over 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The Regulator has informed me in relation to the Deputies queries regarding ticket sales, prizes and advertising costs, that Clause 20.6 of the the lottery licence requires that the Regulator shall not disclose or divulge any of the Licensee&rsquo;s confidential information without the prior written permission of the Licensee (except where compelled to by law), which has not been forthcoming.  With regard to cyber-attacks, it is the view of the Regulator that it is not good practice to reveal whether there have or have not been any cyber-attacks and that confirming or denying such attacks could encourage such attacks in the first instance and create unnecessary and misplaced concern about the National Lottery&rsquo;s security systems.<\/p>  <p>  I do not, in the circumstances, consider it necessary or beneficial to review the operation of the National Lottery. I have however commenced a review of the transparency and effectiveness of how Lottery funding is distributed, to ensure that it is best targeted in support of Good Causes.  In noting that some &euro;6 billion has been raised for Good Causes since the National Lottery commenced in 1987 it is appropriate that members of the public and those who play the National Lottery are fully aware of how lottery funding is accessed and distributed to the benefit of communities nationally. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900083#WRS05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff","counter":946,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900083#WRS05200"},{"type":"question","counter":947,"qnumday":371,"qnumall":"[63190\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900083#WRS05300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if his attention has been drawn to Office of Public Works guides' limiting pension entitlements and prospects of career progression within the wider public service due to their employment classification of non-established industrial; if this issue will be reviewed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1512","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":948,"content":"<p>The OPW employs approximately 2500 staff across a wide range of craft, technical, administrative, and management disciplines.\u00a0 All staff have important roles to play that bring great value to those availing of OPW services.\u00a0\u00a0 While there are many different grades and classifications of employee involved, the OPW values all of its staff equally and works hard to minimise the impact of the historical differences in Terms and Conditions that apply between the employment categories involved so that the organisation is one team &ndash; one OPW.<\/p>  <p>  Guides in the Office of Public Works are technically classified as &ldquo;industrial employees&rdquo; and are recruited to the OPW in a non-established capacity.

A Steering Group, comprising of representatives from the Office of Public Works and Cavan County Council, is now in place and is progressing this Scheme.Following a competitive procurement process, it is expected that Engineering and Environmental Consultants will be appointed in the coming weeks to progress this scheme.

Under the Act, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) is the independent regulator for sound broadcasting content in the State. My officials have been engaging with the BAI regarding the actions they are taking to promote equality, diversity and inclusion in the broadcasting sector in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The BAI is currently undertaking a review of its Gender Action Plan which was launched in 2018. The 2018 Gender Action Plan set out its objectives under four key pillars: data collection and publication; research, encouraging gender initiatives, and accountability. Work on the review is on-going and BAI anticipate its completion in 2022. The findings of the BAI Gender Action Plan review, once complete, will contribute to the development of a BAI Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of funding for audio and audiovisual content for Irish audiences, the BAI now consider the number of women in key creative roles as a criterion in assessing applications for the Sound &amp;amp; Vision Scheme as a measure to support and encourage greater gender equality in the industry.<\/p>  <p>  The BAI provide funding for sectoral learning and development with the aim of challenging and supporting the Irish broadcasting sector to remain relevant and to deliver for the audience. Initiatives funded through sectoral learning and development include Women on Air, Women in Film and Television and Learning Waves. Women on Air&rsquo;s Board members and speakers volunteer their time to ensure a greater diversity of voices on the airwaves. A Womenonair.ie database for media of women who are ready, willing, and able to contribute to broadcast media opportunities was launched in January 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The BAI established and facilitate the Broadcasting Sustainability Network which aims to foster best practice and to provide support to the Irish broadcasting sector on sustainability based on the United Nation&rsquo;s Sustainability Development Goals including Goal 5: Gender Equality.<\/p>  <p>  In considering any proposals to require the allocation of a proportion of airtime to Irish artists, as set out in the details supplied, I am conscious of the legal and other factors which must be taken into account. The potential benefit to music production in Ireland must be balanced with the rights of broadcasters, subject to their contractual or regulatory obligations, to determine the type of content they wish to broadcast and to ensure commercial revenue particularly in the context of the current media climate. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of any airplay quotas would need to be consistent with EU law, in particular those provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) guaranteeing freedom of establishment and free movement of services and which prohibit discrimination based on nationality. <\/p>  <p>  An example of airplay quotas in the EU can be seen in France. In 1994, France introduced a mandatory quota for 40% airplay of French language music on French radio stations. In 2016, this quota was reduced to 35%.  Any quota for airplay would be considered to restrict free movement of services by placing music meeting certain criteria in a more advantaged position.  However, a quota for airplay of music in a particular language, as is the case in France, can be justified under EU case law, as the preservation and promotion of an official language of a Member State constitutes a general interest objective. <\/p>  <p>  Unlike music in a particular language, a quota system for music produced in a particular place, as suggested in the details supplied, does not appear to have grounds for exemption from the general requirements of EU law.  Therefore, without a similar justification on the grounds of linguistic protection, a quota for music produced in a particular Member State would be considered to restrict free movement of services by placing music produced in other Member States at a disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured however that I will continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders in order to further explore appropriate approaches to support equality, diversity and inclusion on our broadcasting services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900086#WRV01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Funding","counter":1073,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900086#WRV01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1074,"qnumday":418,"qnumall":"[63125\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900086#WRV02000","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the amount of public funding or public support received by a club (details supplied) in 2020; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1482","askee":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":1075,"qnumday":419,"qnumall":"[63126\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900086#WRV02100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the amount of public funding or public support received by League of Ireland clubs in 2020; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1482","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":1076,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 418 and 419 together.<\/p>  <p>Sport Ireland is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, including the allocation of funding under its various programmes.

This requirement applies to persons that are accessing shared swimming pool facilities. Under the regulations in place, such a facility is not obliged to ask for, or check, the immunity status of children under the age of 18 who are accompanied by a vaccinated parent\/guardian. It should be understood however that there is no legal prohibition on the owner\/operator of such premises from asking for, or checking, the immunity status of people entering their own premises, as they see fit to do so. <\/p>  <p>  I should also like to provide additional clarification on the exceptional and special provisions applying to swimming pools. These provisions recognise the particular contribution that swimming pools make to water safety and to people&rsquo;s wellbeing generally, the individual nature of swimming activity and the structural, spatial characteristics of swimming pools. The Government has accordingly decided that the requirement for proof of immunity does not apply for access to them. This is a highly specific accommodation that the Government was keen to extend to swimming pool activity for the reasons just stated. Other non-swimming activities are not covered, even if they are conducted on the same premises or involve the sharing of reception or changing facilities. <\/p>  <p>  It is accepted that these differentiated arrangements pose additional challenges in certain instances but the responsibility rests with the owner\/operator of such premises to make the necessary operational and logistical arrangements to give practical effect to the differing legal obligations to the different settings.

Conserving nature requires a range of strategies to succeed, with designation of conservation areas required under both European (Birds and Habitats Directives)\u00a0and national laws.<\/p><p>There are three main types of designations within Ireland - (i) Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs), (ii) Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), and (iii) Special Protection Areas (SPAs). <\/p><p>NHAs are areas\u00a0protected under the Wildlife Act 1976 (as amended). They are areas considered important at a national level for the habitats present, or which hold species of plants and animals whose habitat needs protection, and where protection of the site will make a significant contribution to the conservation of one or more species or habitats which are considered vulnerable, rare or endangered.<\/p><p>Sites of significance at a European level are known as Natura 2000 sites, and designated for protection under the EU Nature Directives. These sites fall into two categories: Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs) as set out below.<\/p><p>SACs are prime wildlife conservation areas, selected under the EU Habitats Directive which was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011. The Directive lists certain habitats and species that must be protected within SACs.<\/p><p>SPAs are designated for the protection of listed rare and vulnerable bird species, regularly occurring migratory species and wetlands, especially those of international importance. They are selected under the EU Birds Directive. <\/p><p>In all cases, sites are evaluated by scientific staff within the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of\u00a0my Department before being proposed for designation. Sites should be at least large enough to provide the physical and semi-natural conditions for the maintenance of a particular habitat and\/or species.<\/p><p>Designated sites are fully protected from the time of first notification and advertising. Protection for these sites comes in the form of Activities Requiring Consent (ARCs). These activities require the permission of the Minister before they can be carried out and will be considered based on the level of damage or harm to habitats and\/or species that will occur as a result of the activity taking place. Different ARCs apply to each site depending on what habitats and\/or species are present.<\/p><p>Following the decision by the Minister to designate a site, landowners, known to the Department, are notified in writing. Advertisements are placed in National and regional newspapers and notices are broadcast on radio. In addition, notices are displayed in local Government offices, Garda stations and National libraries. Landowners are given three months in which to appeal the designation and\/or to object to the Ministerial Order in relation to ARCs. <\/p><p>Compensation may also be available to landowners in certain circumstances. When the appeals process has been completed, the sites are formally designated by Statutory Instrument.<\/p><p>Certain other forms of protection may be afforded to sites as set out below:<\/p><p><b>Nature Reserves <\/b>- An area of importance to wildlife, which is protected by Ministerial order under the Wildlife Acts. <\/p><p>The Wildlife Act 1976 empowers the Minister to establish or recognise Nature Reserves on state-owned or private land. The criteria for Nature Reserve Status is as follows:<\/p><p>(i) includes the habitat or forms the habitat of part of the habitat of one or more species or community of flora or fauna being a species or community which is of scientific interest, or<\/p><p>(ii) includes or forms an ecosystem which is of scientific interest,<\/p><p>and (iii) that the habitat or ecosystem is likely to benefit if measures are taken for its protection.<\/p><p>Section 15 of the Act refers to the Establishment Order for Reserves on lands owned by the Minister or by the State. Section 16 of the Act refers to the Recognition Order for Reserves on land other than land to which Section 15 applies.\u00a0 The land is managed so as to secure, as best may be, the objective indicated in the establishment\/recognition order having regard to and in accordance with the general protection of the natural environment.\u00a0 In the case of a Nature Reserve on private lands, the owner(s) of the land must commit to managing the land as a nature reserve prior to the issue of a Recognition Order.<\/p><p>For any suitable land to acquire the status of Nature Reserve, it has to be established or recognised as such by the Minister. Any proposal to establish or recognise a Nature Reserve has to be first assessed by the Scientific Unit of the NPWS. The Scientific Unit has to establish that the area in question meets the criteria as listed above. If the criteria mentioned above are met, the designation process may begin.\u00a0 <\/p><p>A Statutory Instrument (S.I.)\u00a0is drafted, and is accompanied by a map of the proposed reserve, the schedule (i.e. scientific description of the site) and ,in the event of a private nature reserve designation (section 16 of the Wildlife Act 1976)\u00a0 a commitment letter from the land owner(s) to manage the land as a nature reserve. Relevant statutory bodies are consulted if required. If no objections are expressed, the S.I. is signed\u00a0 and sealed by the Minister in exercise of the powers conferred on him\/her by section 16 of the Wildlife Act 1976. <\/p><p><b>Refuge for Fauna or Flora<\/b>-\u00a0<\/p><p>Section 17 of the Wildlife Act 1976, provides that where the Minister considers that particular species of fauna or flora should be specially protected on an area of land, the Minister may designate that land as a refuge.\u00a0The land in question should be, or be contiguous to, a habitat of the species requiring special protection. Or, the land may have features of the landscape which are of major importance to those species as they are essential for migration, dispersal and genetic exchange &ndash; for example ponds or small woods that function as stepping stones.\u00a0<\/p><p>The seven refuges designated to date have been to specially protect breeding birds on marine cliffs and small islands.\u00a0One example is, Refuge For Fauna (Bull Rock) Designation Order, 1991.\u00a0The land, the subject of the Order, is designated as a refuge to specially protect the Gannet, Kittiwake, Storm Petrel and Razorbill. The Order places restrictions on when a person may climb the cliff face within the refuge.\u00a0It also prohibits actions such as wilfully disturbing birds for which the land is a refuge; \u00a0carrying on any part of the refuge a firearm or other weapon that could be used to hunt the birds; and dumping or disposing of any deleterious matter which could cause death or injury to the birds. \u00a0<\/p><p>Before designating such a refuge, the Minister must conduct prior consultation with public authorities and notify the owner or occupier of the land and the general public, in order to allow for objections to be made. Compensation may be paid to a person with an interest in or over the land for any decrease in its value following designation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900087#WRW04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1512"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Parks","counter":1160,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900087#WRW04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1161,"qnumday":449,"qnumall":"[63005\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900087#WRW05000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the definition of a national park and a regional park; the statutory protection each covers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1162,"content":"<p>Regional Parks are public parks and are managed and operated by Local Authorities and the Office of Public Works.\u00a0 A National Park is a protected area managed mainly for ecosystem protection, protecting natural biodiversity, promoting education and recreation, and in Ireland, the national parks represent the very best examples of such areas.<\/p>  <p>  State owned and run National Parks are managed as Category II National Parks under the criteria set out by the World Conservation Union (IUCN).

A wide range of stakeholder groups contributed and a series of 26 agreed recommendations was published in 2019. \u00a0Good progress has been made in terms of some of the recommendations but as is the case with challenging conservation issues, further progress could be made in other areas.<\/p>  <p>  To establish how many pairs of Curlew remain breeding in Ireland and where they are, NPWS has completed two national surveys in recent years, the first of which was published in a journal called Wader Study. \u00a0The second survey was completed in 2021 and the data is being currently analysed and compiled.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately &euro;10m in funding has been dedicated to on-the-ground measures for Curlew over the past five years, predominantly through GLAS, which is administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to GLAS, the Curlew Conservation Programme, established in 2017 by NPWS,\u00a0 operates across nine geographical areas. These combined efforts have supported overall productivity levels that should sustain a stable population of Curlew. However, in some of the nine areas productivity levels are still below the critical threshold. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  For the nine areas over the five years to date, a total of approximately &euro;1.5m has been spent. In 2022, with the continued partnership of the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine, a budget of &euro;0.5m has been allocated.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Breeding Curlew European Innovation Partnership operates in two other localities and this is funded by Irish Rural Development Programme, administered by both the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Bird Watch Ireland.\u00a0 The budget for this project is &euro;1.1m.<\/p>  <p>  A Memorandum of Understanding between NPWS and RSPB Northern Ireland was signed in 2021 to progress a feasibility study for curlew headstarting on an all-island basis. This is a necessary step in establishing whether headstarting can be a valuable tool in efforts to reverse the decline in Curlew.<\/p>  <p>  Work by NPWS and UCD is progressing to support the analysis of satellite tracking data for breeding Curlew in Ireland, under a Masters Research Project, to better understand the landscapes that Curlew utilise.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the CAP Strategic Plan up until 2027, NPWS and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are proposing to support Curlew and other breeding waders under a dedicated delivery framework, funded by the CAP and the national exchequer. This will include dedicated survey, nest protection and habitat enhancement across the country in various breeding wader hotspots.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900088#WRX02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1512"},{"type":"question","counter":1190,"qnumday":458,"qnumall":"[63083\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900088#WRX02200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the progress being made with the establishment of the  National Parks and Wildlife Service's working to examine the hunting of birds of conservation concern; the actions that will be considered as part of the working group; the timeline for work to be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":1191,"qnumday":459,"qnumall":"[63084\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900088#WRX02300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the precautionary measures he will put in place as an interim management tool to ensure that sufficient protections are offered to bird species of conservation concern that are currently listed on the National Parks and Wildlife Service's open season order, and in advance of the finalisation of the working group on the hunting of birds of conservation.","asker":"1627","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1192,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 458 and 459 together.<\/p><p>My Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service is establishing a Working Group to build on my commitment to ensure that any hunting of birds of conservation concern is sustainable.

It sets out four key pillars on which our maritime planning system is to be based, namely: forward planning; the establishment of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, or MARA; development consent; and enforcement.<\/p>  <p>  Forward planning happens through the National Marine Planning Framework and comprehensive sub-national planning. Ireland's National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF) was launched on 1 July 2021 and is Ireland&rsquo;s first comprehensive marine spatial planning framework. The NMPF brings together all marine-based human activities for the first time, outlining the Government&rsquo;s vision, objectives and marine planning policies for each marine activity.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of MARA will mean that we will have a new regulatory agency to consider applications for Maritime Area Consent (MAC); licence scheduled maritime usages; ensure compliance and enforcement of MACs, licences and offshore development consents; assume responsibility for the management and enforcement of the existing foreshore portfolio of leases and licences; and provide a nexus for inter-agency cooperation and collaboration.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation provides for consent to development proposals by the Board and local authorities. The Board will examine the merits of projects and will balance their impacts against the relevant environmental objectives. Any project that may give rise to likely significant effects on the environment will need to be accompanied by an appropriate environmental and\/or ecological report.<\/p>  <p>  Comprehensive enforcement provisions are included to copper-fasten these new provisions.<\/p>  <p>  The NMPF will be a key decision-making tool for regulatory authorities and policy makers into the future in a number of ways, including decisions on individual consent applications which will have to have regard to the provisions of the plan in the same way that terrestrial plans form part of the decision-making tool kit in the on-land planning process.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0legislation\u00a0provides for spatial designations for specified areas and uses called Designated Maritime Area Plans, or DMAPs.\u00a0DMAPs are prepared by a designated competent authority, underpinned by a mandatory Public Participation Statement and subject to Ministerial oversight and Oireachtas approval.\u00a0Specific DMAPs may include allowed or restricted usages and mitigating or beneficial measures.\u00a0A\u00a0DMAP\u00a0can be\u00a0used for environmental purposes in order to safeguard certain areas of environmental concern - for example, to promote the safeguarding of fragile habitats.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted, however, that\u00a0this new legislation\u00a0is just one piece in a suite of maritime legislation, coming after the Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2021 and before forthcoming legislation on Marine Protected Areas.\u00a0 Work has commenced on development of a General Scheme of a Bill to allow for designation of Marine Protected Areas and is this Bill is expected to come before the Oireachtas in 2022. This will in due course further underpin this new marine planning system while continuing to protect the State's most important asset, our maritime area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900088#WRX02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wastewater Treatment","counter":1197,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900088#WRX02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1198,"qnumday":461,"qnumall":"[63102\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900088#WRX03000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the reason that the proposed Cooraclare sewerage scheme did not proceed in 2006, as promised (details supplied); the way that this funding was re-allocated; if there are current plans to advance the scheme at Cooraclare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1519","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1199,"content":"<p>I understand that the scheme in question was included in\u00a0the Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009.

Decisions with regard to the optimum work programme of the Valuation Office, including the selection, sequencing and grouping of rating authority areas for revaluation, are a matter for the independent Commissioner, taking into account the extensive valuation work required in each case and in terms of engaging with ratepayers and other stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme. The objective of the programme is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 160 years is completed, as soon as possible, on a phased basis.<\/p>  <p>  Revaluation is a process whereby all rateable properties in a local authority area, rather than in a particular business sector, are valued periodically by reference to a single valuation date. The statutory provisions in the Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as changes in the business environment or infrastructural changes in the vicinity of a property. Each local authority area is a legal entity in its own right for the purposes of carrying out a revaluation. This requires the application of a separate valuation order and the publication of a new valuation list for each local authority area.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Government Act 2001, as amended by the Local Government Reform Act 2014, provides the legislative basis for the local authority budget process. It is a matter for each local authority to determine the total amount of rates to be levied by it in a particular year having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources. The size or aggregate value of rateable properties on a valuation list does not determine the total amount of rates to be collected by a local authority and the sequencing of revaluations does not affect this process.<\/p>  <p>  Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors. The revaluation reflects changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment. The revaluation programme is not designed to benefit any particular business categories.<\/p>  <p>  Once the first revaluation of all areas is completed, the exercise must be repeated on a recurring basis, with revaluations required no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the previous revaluation. Where frequent revaluations occur on a rolling basis, this ensures equity and uniformity of the entire valuation system which underpins commercial rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900088#WRX04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":1213,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900088#WRX04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1214,"qnumday":467,"qnumall":"[63158\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900088#WRX04600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the reason a person who has acquired the necessary funds through alternative means such as inheritance is deemed ineligible to participate in the tenant purchase scheme on the grounds that his or her sole income is from social welfare payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":1215,"qnumday":582,"qnumall":"[2039\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900088#WRX04700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will amend the tenant purchase scheme to allow carers who have given up work to care for loved ones to avail of the amended scheme to ensure that carers are not discriminated against in terms of purchasing their own homes.","asker":"1482","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1216,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 467 and 582 together.<\/p><p>The Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.<\/p><p>Section 30 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 provides that the Minister may set out a minimum income required to purchase under the scheme.

Later in the process, if the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office.

The\u00a0property in question must also meet certain eligibility criteria.\u00a0The concept of the scheme is that a household with an unsustainable mortgage goes from being a homeowner to being a social housing tenant. The borrower surrenders their property to their lender who sells it to a MTR provider which can be either an Approved Housing Body (AHB) or since 2018 a private company, Home for Life.\u00a0 The AHB or local authority (in the case where the property is sold to a private company) becomes the landlord and the borrower remains in the property as a tenant paying a differential rent to the landlord based on his or her income.<\/p><p>To the end of September 2021, 1497 households with unsustainable private mortgages have completed the MTR scheme since its\u00a0introduction nationally in 2013. 951 households had their case completed by an AHB. The Housing Agency publishes, on a quarterly\u00a0basis, detailed statistical information on the operation of the\u00a0MTR scheme including a purchaser status report which shows a breakdown of the number of active, completed, ineligible and terminated cases\u00a0per purchaser, including AHBs.\u00a0This information is available on the Housing Agency's website at the following link: <i>www.housingagency.ie\/housing-information\/mortgage-rent-statistics\u00a0<\/i><\/p><p>The Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) funding is capital support provided to AHBs by local authorities to facilitate the funding of\u00a0construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units, including units acquired through the Mortgage to Rent scheme. My Department can provide CALF funding of up to 40% in the case of the Mortgage to Rent scheme for eligible projects, with the housing units provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements. A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed\u00a0per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount. Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term. At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority. The local authority issues the CALF monies to the AHB and the local authority, in turn, recoups same from the Department. The remainder of the capital cost is sourced by the AHB through other borrowings to which the local authorities are not party.\u00a0 All proposals for CALF are submitted to my Department by AHBs for review, to ensure that\u00a0each project complies with the terms of the CALF and that there are sufficient funds available.<\/p><p>My Department does not hold information on\u00a0the loan agreements under CALF, as the loan agreement, is between the local authority and the relevant AHB.\u00a0 Accordingly, information on the number and value of CALF loans, including the balance owing, is held by the relevant local authorities.\u00a0The value and term of each loan varies by project.<\/p><p>My Department also supports AHBs on MTR projects by providing CALF funding for eligible start-up costs of up to 1.5% of the total capital cost or since March 2018, up to &euro;3,300 (ex.

Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity.<\/p>  <p>  This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions relating to their use in apartments and in educational\/community\/religious buildings.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In light of the need to appropriately address aviation safety concerns arising from the &ldquo;glint and glare&rdquo; impacts of solar panels and the easing of the solar panel planning exemption thresholds, my Department is in the process of commissioning the development of detailed aviation safeguarding maps which will identify and delineate specific but limited areas in the vicinity of airports and aerodromes (referred to as exclusion zones) within which the exemptions will not apply. Project scoping feedback has been received from interested parties through the draft Request for Tender process and has been considered by my Department in the development of the final Request for Tender documentation. My Department intends to publish the call for tender shortly.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Whilst this work is ongoing, my Department has\u00a0advanced interim regulations, adopting a temporary, albeit more stringent, radial approach incorporating initial defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes. These interim regulations, allowing for increased solar panel planning exemptions, will cover the vast majority of the land area of the country, only excluding those limited exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes.<\/p>  <p>  The draft interim regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001\/42\/EC and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. It is anticipated that the formal SEA process will commence, with consultation\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0statutory\u00a0environmental authorities to inform the content of the Environmental Report, following the completion of the screening for Appropriate Assessment by my Department&rsquo;s\u00a0Ecological Assessment Unit. The SEA\u00a0Environmental Report will be published alongside a draft of the interim regulations for a period of public consultation of not less than 4 weeks. This public consultation\u00a0is expected\u00a0to commence shortly. A copy of the draft interim regulations and the Environmental Report will be made available for inspection over this period. Written submissions or observations will be taken into consideration before finalisation of the draft interim regulation.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the process for\u00a0finalising the interim solar panel planning exemptions as referred to above, with interim exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes, is expected to be completed in Q2 2022. As outlined, pending the finalisation of the aforementioned aviation safeguarding maps, these interim regulations will allow for the vast majority of the country to be covered by the proposed new solar panel exemptions apart from those areas in\u00a0close proximity\u00a0to airports and aerodromes.<\/p>  <p>  Work on the development of the aviation safeguarding maps for airports and aerodromes is expected to be completed in the second half of 2022. The final supplementary set of regulations - delineating the final exclusion areas around airports and aerodromes in which the exemptions will not apply - will be prepared thereafter and, subject to environmental reporting considerations, will subsequently be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in a timely manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900091#WRAA04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment","counter":1394,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900091#WRAA04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1395,"qnumday":524,"qnumall":"[1423\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900091#WRAA04300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if persons who received the pandemic unemployment payment pass the test of continuous employment that is required in order to apply for a loan under the local authority home loan scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1396,"content":"<p>In light of the ongoing COVID-19 situation, the requirement that a primary earner must have at least two years continuous employment and the second applicant must have at least one year of continuous employment is relaxed temporarily.

The Regulations also set out the main eligibility condition for leasing a cost rental dwelling, which is that a household&rsquo;s annual income, less income tax, PRSI, USC and superannuation contributions, must not be greater than &euro;53,000. In cases where the number of applicants exceed the number of available homes, an independently-verifiable lottery will be utilised to select applicants. Landlords should ensure that each property is suitably sized to meet a household&rsquo;s needs based on the number of occupants and that the tenants selected in the lottery meet the income eligibility criteria.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Cost Rental Rent Setting Regulations prescribe additional detail and relevant formulae in order to set out how rent reviews under Cost Rental work in practice. Rents can be reviewed annually in line with the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), with formulae set out for how reviews should be undertaken in three specific circumstances: the first rent in any tenancy, the first review of this rent and all subsequent reviews of this rent. All rents calculated are maximum rents, meaning landlords are free to charge the tenant less than this should they so wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900093#WRCC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":1485,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900093#WRCC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1486,"qnumday":557,"qnumall":"[1938\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900093#WRCC01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the State expenditure on housing assistance payment in each of the years 2015 to 2021, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1487,"content":"<p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a flexible and immediate form of social housing support for people with a long-term housing need.

The Maritime Area Planning Act 2021 recently signed into law enables the realisation of these ambitions for ORE by providing the necessary legislative toolset for forward planning, well-regulated development, streamlined consenting, and comprehensive environmental assessment of proposals. \u00a0The Act also provides for the establishment of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, or MARA, a new state agency under the aegis of my Department which will be responsible for consenting and enforcement functions in the maritime area.<\/p><p>I am hopeful the agency will be established and operational within twelve months at which point anyone wishing to undertake development in the maritime area will have to apply for a Maritime Area Consent (MAC) from MARA and, if granted, then apply for development permission from the relevant coastal local authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la. MARA will also be responsible for granting licences for certain activities in the maritime area (including environmental surveys), for ensuring robust compliance through enforcement measures, and for managing the existing State Foreshore portfolio of leases and licences. <\/p><p>The Act also includes specific provisions to enable certain ORE projects (Phase 1 Projects) proceed through the new consenting regime ahead of the establishment of MARA. Recognising that it will take time to establish the new agency, it was decided by Government that the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications should be granted limited powers to invite MAC applications for specific ORE projects for a specified period in advance of establishment. This will ensure the progression of a pipeline of projects under the new regime in order to meet our 2030 climate and energy targets. I understand that work is well advanced within the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to develop robust processes and guidance for these MAC applications. That Department is expecting to open the MAC application window for these projects in April 2022, with decisions on applications taken by Q3 allowing successful projects to\u00a0be eligble\u00a0to apply for development permission.<\/p><p>Until such time as MARA is operational my Department will continue to manage the existing maritime planning system in accordance with the Foreshore Act 1933 and applications for leases and licenses made in accordance with that Act will be accepted and assessed under that legislative structure. <\/p><p>There has been a significant increase in the number and complexity of foreshore licence and lease applications made in recent years as is set out in the table below. The majority of this increased application activity is related to ORE infrastructural development, including potential development site investigation activity, Eirgrid cabling development, and port infrastructure improvement. In addition, power and\u00a0data cable\u00a0application activity has increased from both commercial and state-led projects. In parallel, emerging case law and enhanced requirements arising from various environmental assessment Directives have added to the complexity of the appraisal process. <\/p><p>My Department has more than doubled the staffing resources available within the relevant Unit in\u00a0my Department over the last eighteen months. In addition, a panel of external specialist environmental consultants established to assist in the technical assessment of applications is in operation.

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy and national standards, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding support for equipment and priority infrastructural projects. <\/p>  <p>  The prioritisation of work and effective management of all resources is, in the first instance, a matter for the fire authority, based on its assessment of risk, needs and resources. In relation to the staffing requirements in each local authority, under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, it is the responsibility of each Chief Executive to employ such staff and to make such staffing, funding, recruitment and organisational arrangements as deemed necessary for the purposes of carrying out the functions of their local authority. <\/p>  <p>  Dublin City Council provides fire prevention and fire and rescue services for the four Dublin local authorities: Dublin City, South Dublin, Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire\/Rathdown County Councils. It also provides an emergency ambulance service by arrangement with the National Ambulance Service of the HSE.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to staffing in Dublin Fire Brigade, the current COVID-19 pandemic has presented challenges in respect of delivery of services to the public.  These challenges have included recruitment and training of new staff, resulting in staffing shortages in recent times.  However, recruitment, training and deployment of new recruits have continued in Dublin Fire Brigade, albeit with the additional difficulties imposed by control and safety measures.  I am aware that the most recent fire-fighter recruitment campaign began in September 2019: <\/p>  <p>  - The first class of recruits from that campaign began training in April 2020 and have taken up positions across the brigade. <\/p>  <p>  - A second recruit class began training in June 2021, with recruits recently taking up positions in January 2022.<\/p>  <p>  - A further third recruit class of 45 will begin training early in February 2022, with provision within the Dublin City Council budget for a fourth and final class of the remaining panelled recruit&rsquo;s later in 2022. <\/p>  <p>  In recent weeks, in line with trends among the general population, all public and emergency services have experienced heightened disruptions due to the transmissibility of the COVID-19 Omicron variant and close contact related staff absences. Following a Government mandate in late December 2021, authorising the use of a voluntary derogation exempting Fire services staff from COVID-19 close contact isolation requirements under strict conditions, my Department built the derogation into a broader suite of updated guidance and contingency measures for Fire service management. This was to ensure the ongoing provision of Fire services amid the highest rates of COVID-19 infection since the onset of the pandemic. Thankfully, to date Dublin Fire Brigade management has not needed to implement the derogation owing to careful management of resources and the ongoing commitment and professionalism of Dublin Fire Brigade staff.  <\/p>  <p>  The broader issue of staff shortages is not simply a funding one.  There is an extensive recruitment and training process to follow before suitable candidates are appointed, and this takes time; Dublin Fire Brigade management are following this process and is actively managing staffing in the brigade, on a day-to-day basis, to minimise the effect of the pandemic on delivery of services.   <\/p>  <p>  Local Authority fire services in Ireland is staffed by over three thousand professional, competent and highly committed personnel in the full-time and retained fire services. Local authorities, as the funders and the employers of fire service personnel, have demonstrated their commitment to this service over the past number of years. The number of frontline fire service staff have been maintained at a consistent high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of years, even at a time when staffing numbers were of necessity reduced in other areas of the local authorities. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that Dublin City Council, as the employer, has engaged in an extended process with firefighter representative bodies, F&oacute;rsa and SIPTU at the Workplace Relations Commission.  There has been some progress in a number of areas, some of which would alleviate pressures caused by current staffing arrangements, but no final agreement has been reached. I encourage the parties to re-engage with the established statutory industrial relations machinery in place, to achieve a resolution without delay.  The issues and concerns raised can only be addressed if all sides are speaking to each other.  I strongly urge all parties to re-enter the consultative process and find a common ground, so that we can again focus on the service, and its development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900095#WREE04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":1619,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900095#WREE04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1620,"qnumday":609,"qnumall":"[2427\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900095#WREE04300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the details of the marks awarded under the urban regeneration and development fund assessment process to an organisation (details supplied) in its application in 2020-2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1621,"content":"<p>To date there have been two calls for proposals under the Urban Regeneration Development Fund \u00a0(URDF), the first in July 2018 and the second in January 2020.\u00a0 Galway City Council submitted\u00a0five applications under Call 2 of the URDF,\u00a0three of which were successful, attracting a combined total &euro;53,239,000 in URDF support.\u00a0 This Call 2 URDF funding is in addition to &euro;6,311,500 already\u00a0approved for\u00a0five projects under\u00a0Call 1 bringing total\u00a0URDF support for projects in Galway City Council area to &euro;59,550,500<b><\/b>over both URDF calls.<\/p><p>All applications for URDF support were assessed in terms of their alignment with the intended purpose of the URDF call and also their viability before being considered for approval.<\/p><p>Galway City Council&rsquo;s proposal in respect of\u00a0the Newcastle Community Centre was one of thirty unsuccessful proposals which did not adequately meet the criteria for URDF support under Call 2. <\/p><p>A copy of the detailed assessment of this proposal has been provided to Galway City Council and a feedback meeting on the matter has taken place between officials of the Council and officials of my Department.<\/p><p>Any plan for the further advancement of this proposal is a matter for Galway City Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900095#WREE04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1622,"content":"<p>Question No. 610 answered with Question No. 471.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":1623,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900095#WREE04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1624,"qnumday":611,"qnumall":"[2611\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900095#WREE04700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his views on developing a publicly financed student accommodation building strategy and charter for student tenant rights; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1625,"content":"<p>I am committed to working collaboratively with my colleague the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to improve student accommodation provision through a dedicated working group set up for that purpose.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I believe that Housing for All : A New Housing Plan for Ireland will transform every aspect of our housing including the area of student accommodation.\u00a0The Plan is backed by historic levels of investment with in excess of &euro;20bn through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency (LDA) and the Housing Finance Agency over the next 5 years.

Responsibility for the enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under sections 18A and 18B of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, a housing authority may issue an improvement notice or prohibition notice, respectively, where a property is found to be non-compliant.

My Department will work closely throughout the year with the sector to support the achievement of these targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900096#WRFF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"&Uacute;dar&aacute;is &Aacute;iti&uacute;la","counter":1639,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900096#WRFF00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1640,"qnumday":616,"qnumall":"[2666\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900096#WRFF00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"c&eacute;n freagra at&aacute; aige ar an &eacute;ileamh a rinne pr&iacute;omhfheidhmeannaigh Chomhairle Contae Chorca&iacute;, Chomhairle Contae Chiarra&iacute;, Chomhairle Contae na M&iacute; agus Chomhairle Cathrach agus Contae Phort L&aacute;irge ag cruinni&uacute; de chuid Chomhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus Phobal Labhartha na Gaeilge i m&iacute; na Samhna 2021 inar lorga&iacute;odh soil&eacute;iri&uacute; maidir leis na coinn&iacute;ollacha a bhaineann le  plean&aacute;il forbartha tith&iacute;ochta i gceantair Ghaeltachta.","asker":"1485","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1641,"content":"<p>D&eacute;antar reacht&uacute; do chur i bhfeidhm lean&uacute;nach an phr&oacute;isis phlean&aacute;la teanga in Acht na Gaeltachta, 2012, a bhuntaca&iacute;onn leis an tiomantas do na cusp&oacute;ir&iacute; a leagtar amach sa Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010 go 2030 a bhaint amach.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Is &eacute; Acht 2012, a thagann faoi chuimsi&uacute; shainch&uacute;ram mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an tAire Turas&oacute;ireachta, Eala&iacute;on, Gaeltachta, Sp&oacute;irt agus Me&aacute;n, an phr&iacute;omhionstraim bheartais, ar an &aacute;bhar sin, chun an Ghaeilge a chosaint.\u00a0 Is &eacute; r&oacute;l mo Roinne a chinnti&uacute; go dtaca&iacute;onn an c&oacute;ras plean&aacute;la leis an mbeartas sin ar bhonn oibr&iacute;ocht&uacute;il agus go praitici&uacute;il tr&iacute; chur i bhfeidhm sa ch&oacute;ras plean&aacute;la.

My Department regularly informs the authorities of countries concerned that the prior approval of the Government should be sought in instances where substantive awards are to be conferred on an Irish citizen. <\/p><p>It is noted that rights, privileges or dignities deriving from the award of a title of nobility or honour subsist solely within the jurisdiction conferring it and any other jurisdiction that may recognise rights, privileges or dignities as flowing from it. Under Irish law, such a title has no significance in terms of conferring rights, entitlements or dignities. <table>    <tr>       <th><\/th>       <th>Date of Consideration<\/th>       <th>Country Conferring the Award<\/th>       <th>Title of Award<\/th>       <th>Government Decision<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>1.<\/td>       <td>29\/12\/2000 <\/td>       <td>UK <\/td>       <td>Knighthood (Knight Bachelor)<\/td>       <td>Approved <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2. <\/td>       <td>11\/07\/2001 <\/td>       <td>Malaysia <\/td>       <td>Darhaj Panglima   Jasa Negara, PJN, Kerhormat<\/td>       <td>Approved <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>3. <\/td>       <td>08\/06\/2005 <\/td>       <td>UK <\/td>       <td>Knighthood (Knight Bachelor)<\/td>       <td>Approved <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>4. <\/td>       <td>01\/ 2006<\/td>       <td>UK <\/td>       <td>Knighthood (Knight Bachelor)<\/td>       <td>No decision (no   facility exists for retrospective approval)<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>5. <\/td>       <td>12\/06\/2008 <\/td>       <td>UK <\/td>       <td>Knighthood (Knight Bachelor)<\/td>       <td>Approved <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>6. <\/td>       <td>07\/05\/2013 <\/td>       <td>UK <\/td>       <td>Knighthood (Knight Bachelor)<\/td>       <td>Approved <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>7. <\/td>       <td>30\/12\/2013 <\/td>       <td>UK <\/td>       <td>Damehood (Commander of the Order)<\/td>       <td>Approved <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>8. <\/td>       <td>10\/06\/2014 <\/td>       <td>UK <\/td>       <td>Knighthood (Knight Bachelor)<\/td>       <td>Approved <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>9. <\/td>       <td>10\/06\/2014 <\/td>       <td>UK <\/td>       <td>Knighthood (Knight Bachelor)<\/td>       <td>Approved <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>10. <\/td>       <td>09\/06\/2015 <\/td>       <td>UK <\/td>       <td>Knighthood (Knight Bachelor)<\/td>       <td>Approved <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>11. <\/td>       <td>03\/11\/2015 <\/td>       <td>Grenada <\/td>       <td>Knight Grand   Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of the Nation<\/td>       <td>Approved <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>12. <\/td>       <td>03\/11\/2015 <\/td>       <td>Antigua and   Barbuda<\/td>       <td>Knight Grand   Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of the Nation<\/td>       <td>No decision (no   facility exists for retrospective approval)<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>13. <\/td>       <td>03\/11\/2015 <\/td>       <td>Antigua and   Barbuda<\/td>       <td>Knight Commander   of the Most Distinguished Order of the Nation<\/td>       <td>No decision (no   facility exists for retrospective approval)<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>14. <\/td>       <td>17\/05\/2016 <\/td>       <td>UK <\/td>       <td>Knighthood (Knight Bachelor)<\/td>       <td>Approved <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900097#WRGG02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":1712,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900097#WRGG02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1713,"qnumday":641,"qnumall":"[1063\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900097#WRGG02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if a passport will issue to a person (details supplied).","asker":"1500","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":1714,"qnumday":650,"qnumall":"[1265\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900097#WRGG02500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of an application by a person (details supplied);

At present, a total of 36 full time staff work on Foreign Births Registration. Due to the complex nature of the Foreign Birth Registration process, the large increase in applications received following the Brexit vote in the UK, and the pause in the Service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants should allow approximately 2 years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of Foreign Birth Registration applications at this time. Before this increase in application volumes and Covid-19 restrictions, applications were typically processed within 6-9 months of receipt. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, and the subsequent reassignment of Foreign Birth Registration staff to assist in the provision of essential passport services, the Foreign Birth Registration Service was paused for nearly 15 months across the 2020-2021 period. <\/p>  <p>  There are currently 32,000 applications for which documentation has been received, and which are awaiting processing. In 2020, documents were received for just over 16,000 applications, with 11,000 received in 2021. Of the applications currently on hand, just over 12,000 have been awaiting processing for more than 18 months. <\/p>  <p>  \u200eAs legislative provision for Foreign Birth Registration is made under the 1956 Act, any changes to application requirements would require amendment of the 1956 Act by the Oireachtas. As the Minister for Justice is responsible for citizenship matters, any such amendment would be a matter for the Department for Justice. In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.\u00a0 Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport and Foreign Birth Registration system.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Foreign Birth Registration staff continue to provide an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons.

The\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0maintained operations throughout the pandemic, notwithstanding the fact that the processing of\u00a0passports\u00a0requires physical attendance on site to deliver this\u00a0service. <\/p><p>Despite the disruptions related to the pandemic throughout last year, the Passport Service issued over 634,000 passports in 2021 and 45% of simple adult renewals issued within one business day.\u00a0<\/p><p>My Department has been actively working with the Public Appointments Service to recruit additional permanent and temporary staff for assignment to the Passport Service. This recruitment drive has been underway since the last quarter of 2021 and will double the number of staff in the Passport Service from June 2021 levels. Over 180 additional staff are being assigned to the Passport Service in January alone and further staff will be assigned in February.\u00a0 I am confident that the additional staff currently being assigned to the Passport Service will help to reduce turnaround times and to respond to the current and anticipated high demand for passports in 2022. <\/p><p>The current passport processing times are:<\/p><p>-10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals<\/p><p>-15 working days for Complex or child online renewals<\/p><p>-40 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online<\/p><p>-8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service<\/p><p>The aforementioned passport processing times are based on current average application turnaround times and relate to passport applications submitted to the Passport Service with required supporting documentation. When passport applicants do not provide all of the requisite documentation to the Passport Service, it takes much longer to process the application and issue a passport.\u00a0Passport Service figures show that 45% of current applications are incomplete and the onus is on the applicant to submit the required documents to the Service. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Passport Service continues to experience high demand for first time passports. These first time applications are necessarily complex to process, since they are essentially applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of applicants.\u00a0<\/p><p>In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. Due to the intensive analysis underpinning first time online passport applications, the processing time is 40 working days.<\/p><p>There are currently 29,000 first time child applications on hand with the Passport Service. Of these, almost 12,000 or 40% are incomplete applications that require additional documentation from the applicants&rsquo; guardians in order to complete the application and ensure that the child&rsquo;s passport can be issued. <\/p><p>The Passport Service continually examines how to improve processing times and engagement with applicants. Preparation is currently underway for several system and service improvements that will enhance the customer service experience and will improve processing times. <\/p><p>In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.\u00a0 Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports both at home and abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900097#WRGG04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1737,"content":"<p>Question No. 650 answered with Question No. 641.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1739,"qnumday":651,"qnumall":"[1266\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900097#WRGG05000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of an application by a person (details supplied);

When passport applicants do not provide all of the requisite documentation to the Passport Service, it takes much longer to process the application and issue a passport.\u00a0There are currently 106,000 passport applications on hand with the Passport Service. Of these, over 47,000 or 45% are incomplete applications that require additional documentation from the applicant in order to complete the application and ensure that the passport can be issued. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Passport Service continually examines how to improve processing times and engagement with applicants. Preparation is currently underway for several system and service improvements that will enhance the customer service experience and will improve processing times. <\/p><p>The processing of Foreign Birth Registration has resumed and will be gradually scaling up in line with the recruitment of additional resources. Due to the complex nature of the Foreign Birth Registration process, the large increase in applications received following the Brexit vote in the UK, and the pause in the Service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants should allow approximately 2 years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of Foreign Birth Registration applications at this time. Before this increase in application volumes and Covid-19 restrictions, applications were typically processed within 6-9 months of receipt. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, and the subsequent reassignment of Foreign Birth Registration staff to assist in the provision of essential passport services, the Foreign Birth Registration Service was paused for nearly 15 months across the 2020-2021 period. <\/p><p>There are currently 32,000 applications for which documentation has been received, and which are awaiting processing. Foreign Birth Registration staff continue to provide an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. In 2021, over 7,000 Foreign Birth Registration applications were processed. \u00a0Applicants who require an emergency service may contact the Passport Service directly. My Department is fully committed to the continued allocation of additional resources over the coming period to assist with the processing of the Foreign Birth Registration applications currently on hand and the high volume of new applications anticipated this year. <\/p><p>My Department has been actively working with the Public Appointments Service to recruit additional permanent and temporary staff for assignment to the Passport Service. This recruitment drive has been underway since the last quarter of 2021 and will double the number of staff in the Passport Service from June 2021 levels. Over 180 additional staff are being assigned to the Passport Service in January alone and further staff will be assigned in February.\u00a0 I am confident that the additional staff currently being assigned to the Passport Service will help to reduce turnaround times and to respond to the current and anticipated high demand for passports in 2022. <\/p><p>In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.\u00a0 Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport and Foreign Birth Registration system.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports both at home and abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900098#WRHH04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":1786,"qnumday":670,"qnumall":"[2275\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900098#WRHH04300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if a passport will be issued to a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1787,"content":"<p>With regard to the specific application about which the Deputy has enquired, the Passport Service has issued a passport to the applicant and the documents requested have been returned.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900098#WRHH04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":1789,"qnumday":671,"qnumall":"[2276\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022011900098#WRHH04600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"when a new passport will issue to a person (details supplied) considering that their previous passport was dispatched but not received and attempts to rectify the issue have failed since a previous Parliamentary Question; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1790,"content":"<p>With regard to the specific application about which the Deputy has enquired, the Passport Service regrets that the applicant&rsquo;s application was returned to him in error.

My Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice sets out the ambition and vision of my Department that the promotion of wellbeing will be at the core of the ethos of every school and centre for education in Ireland and that all schools will provide evidence-informed approaches and support, appropriate to need, to promote the wellbeing of their students. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I have announced that my Department is commencing a review of my Department&rsquo;s 2013 Action Plan on Bullying and the 2013 Anti-bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-primary Schools. <\/p>  <p>  The review\u00a0 will reflect the significant developments and relevant research since 2013, specifically in relation to the areas of cyber bullying and gender identity bullying.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The review will also give detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health. The report includes recommendations relating to the establishment of a System for the compilation of data on the incidence of Bullying in Primary and Post-Primary Schools and relating to the expansion of the FUSE\u00a0Programme.<\/p>  <p>  The 2013 Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-primary Schools outline key principles of best practice for both preventing and tackling bullying and require all schools to commit to these principles in their anti-bullying policy. In particular, they emphasise that a cornerstone in the prevention of bullying is a positive school culture and climate. In that regard, the procedures set out the need for schools to encourage and strengthen open dialogue between all school staff and pupils and to ensure that they provide appropriate opportunities for pupils to raise their concerns in an environment that is comfortable for the pupil.<\/p>  <p>  The anti-bullying procedures also include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  All Boards of Management are required to adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy that fully complies with the requirements of the Anti-Bullying Procedures. A template anti-bullying policy which must be used by all schools for this purpose is included in the procedures.<\/p>  <p>  The procedures for schools put in place important oversight arrangements at school level that involve the school principal reporting regularly to the Board of Management and a requirement for the Board to undertake an annual review of the school's anti- bullying policy and its implementation. Confirmation that the annual review has been completed must be provided to the Parents' Association and published on the school website.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate, in the course of their inspection work, gathers information about how schools deal with bullying in a number of ways through:<\/p>  <p>  - Review of relevant\u00a0school\u00a0documentation, including the school&rsquo;s Code of Behaviour and\u00a0 Anti-Bullying\u00a0policy;<\/p>  <p>  - Meetings with parents and\u00a0\u00a0student representatives at which there is an opportunity for parents and\u00a0 students\u00a0to raise issues where relevant and;<\/p>  <p>  - The inclusion, in\u00a0Inspectorate surveys of parents and students, of items relating to\u00a0bullying.<\/p>  <p>  During this school year this work has been extended, with my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate prioritising monitoring and gathering information about the implementation of anti-bullying measures in schools across all its inspection types. As part of this work, the Inspectorate will also identify and report on examples of effective practice in relation to preventing and tacking bullying in schools. This will help provide evidence of the type of bullying that is occurring in our schools and examples of approaches that can be successful in dealing with it. An important part of the Inspectorate&rsquo;s work is a focus on the priority actions of schools in relation to promoting a positive school culture and climate.<\/p>  <p>  Between September and November 2021, the Inspectorate conducted a programme of incidental inspections in primary schools, special schools and post-primary schools.
