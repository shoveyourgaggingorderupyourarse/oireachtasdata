As we learned quickly and anyone with a busy constituency office would know, the scheme was extremely difficult to process, with many hurdles put in front of people and many delays.  Far from four to six weeks, the process went on for months in many cases.  At the time the Minister announced that a second fund would be created very quickly that would be demand-driven, given the overall state of the mortgage market, at a figure of &euro;99 billion.  He said it would be a demand-led scheme that would progress.<\/p>  <p>  We learned this morning from Louise Byrne on the RT&Eacute; \"Morning Ireland\" programme that in a briefing note to the Minister's press office the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government stated it had been advised no further approvals should issue for now, that the Department was undertaking a review of the scheme and that the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance were engaging on it.  That was on 31 January this year and notwithstanding that Deputy Darragh O'Brien had tabled parliamentary questions about the issue and that Deputy O'Dea had been told in December by the Minister that he was progressing reforms to ensure the loan scheme could work for more people and more quickly.  One month later he is advising his press office that no further approvals should issue.  <\/p>  <p>  I do not know what planet the Minister is living on, but the question I ask the Taoiseach is why was the scheme not extended.  Why was there no public announcement to that effect?<\/p><p>If the Taoiseach tells his press office, surely the public deserves to know.  Why was the D&aacute;il not told in an upfront and honest way?  Why is there this continuing lack of respect for the House in terms of being open, upfront and honest about what is going on with schemes of this kind?  People are still applying, but no one save for the press office has been told that no further approvals will issue, according to RT&Eacute; this morning following a freedom of information request.  Why can the Government not just be honest with the people about these issues?  Will the Taoiseach bring clarity to this situation?  When will the scheme be extended and to what degree?  The original limit was &euro;200 million and the Minister alleged that 1,000 houses were to be accommodated.  Approximately 1,550 applications, if not more, have been accepted.  Will those people who have been approved be in a position to draw down their loans?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551794700,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Its findings are an indictment of the Government's record on poverty prevention and alleviation among single parent families, many of whom are at work.  The report finds that one in 11 working lone parents were living below the poverty line in 2012 but that number had jumped to one in five in 2017.  The high cost of housing and childcare combined with low levels of income are making it impossible for families to make ends meet.  The report finds that the living standards of lone parents in this State are among the worst in Europe.  We have the second highest rate of income poverty, persistent poverty and severe deprivation among 15 other EU states.  That is shocking.  What is most shocking, however, is that the majority of one-parent families, the vast majority of whom are headed by women, are in work.  These families are like others.  They are people who get up at the crack of dawn but who still struggle and fail to meet their own and their families' basic needs.  Our cost of living crisis is leaving hundreds of thousands of people struggling and living in fear of any extra financial burden like a car breaking down or a washing machine packing it in.  These are people who work hard to provide for their families.  They have a modest aspiration for a decent, happy life but they cannot plan for their future.  How can they plan when they cannot make ends meet in the here and now?<\/p>  <p>  Low pay, especially in the context of the soaring cost of living, is the real problem.  Workers on low wages, in many cases in insecure employment, are being asked to find money to pay for extortionate rents, crazy insurance premia and crushing childcare costs.  It is not good enough to brush all of this aside, as the Taoiseach does frequently, with the promise of a meagre tax relief at an ill-defined point in the future.  These families do not need a handout but a hand up in the here and now.  These are people who work and who want to continue working to give their families and their children a better life.  What does the Taoiseach propose to do in the here and now to address the cost of living crisis that is crippling these families?  When will he introduce a living wage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500005#C03500","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1551795900,"counter":56,"content":"<p>At the best of times being a parent is an enormous challenge in having to provide for oneself and one's kids.  It is particularly difficult for lone parents who do so without the support of a partner, without a second income and without someone to share in the burden, cost and time taken by childcare.<\/p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's question, we are helping all parents, but especially lone parents, to improve their living conditions by creating jobs.  The number of lone parents who are working has increased.  The rate of unemployment is down by almost two thirds and the Deputy will know that it is down again today.  We are increasing welfare payments that had been cut back in the past.  They are being restored with an increase kicking in to the one-parent family payment and the jobseeker's transition payment in a few weeks' time.  We have introduced the working family payment to replace the family income supplement, which allows lone parents who are working to keep more of the money they earn and to have their income topped up so they can avoid poverty. <\/p>  <p>  We have reduced the costs of childcare and we will further enhance that with the introduction of the affordable childcare scheme later in the year.<\/p>  <p>  We are increasing pay.  The minimum wage has increased and pay has been restored for people who are public servants.  It is also increasing across the private sector.  We are reducing the costs of medicines and prescription charges are being reduced.  General practitioner, GP, visits, which are already free to all children under the age of six, will be extended to a further 100,000 people from April onwards.  Those are the measures we are taking to reduce the costs of living, to assist lone parents into work and to ensure they have more money in their pockets.<\/p>  <p>  We are also focusing very much on education.  We have, for example, restored the costs of education grant, and as a result record numbers of people from non-traditional backgrounds are now participating in higher education.<\/p>  <p>  I have immense respect for the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and have worked with it on many occasions; especially when I was the Minister for Social Protection, but I do not believe the report that was issued today tells the full picture.  This morning I asked for the statistics from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, which collects the official statistics on poverty in Ireland.  The CSO figures show that the consistent poverty rate - the official measure of poverty in Ireland  - jumped from 18.4% in 2012 to 26.3% in 2013.  Since 2013, however, for each of the past four years, consistent poverty and deprivation among lone parents has actually gone down.  It fell to 23.1 % in 2014, there was a slight increase to 23.2% after that and then 20.7% in 2017.  The most recent figures we have are for 2017 and they are less than those for 2013.  This demonstrates that the policies we have implemented in helping people get back to work, helping them into education, improving welfare and reducing the costs of childcare are working.  I predict that when we see the 2018 figures they will have improved again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500006#D00100","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1551795900,"counter":57,"content":"<p>The tone of the Taoiseach's response is not unexpected but it is almost depressing.

One of the articles compared the standard of living of a mother of two from the midlands with an appropriate counterpart living in another jurisdiction.  The article made for incredible reading.  The woman concerned is at work.  Such are her struggles to ensure her family can get by that she rations the number of times the kids are allowed to boil the kettle.  Can one imagine having to count the number of times that a family can boil a kettle in its house?  I put it to the Taoiseach that this is how tight things are.

She is the now 16 year old Swedish school student who started a worldwide movement of school student strikes and protests demanding action on climate change.  At the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, conference in Poland, she stated:<\/p><blockquote>For 25 years, countless people have come to the UN climate conferences begging our world leaders to stop emissions and clearly that has not worked as emissions continue to rise.  So I will not beg the world leaders to care for our future.  I will instead let them know change is coming whether they like it or not.<\/blockquote><p>That urgency for action, that recognition that we cannot rely on convincing those in power to do what is necessary is absolutely correct.  It is perhaps the reason the European Parliament groups to which Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il belong have blocked her from speaking to that assembly this week.  The latest IPCC report warns that we have 12 years to avoid global warming growing over 1.5&deg;C.  After that, a further 0.5&deg;C would have devastating consequences.  Sea level rises would affect 10 million people, 99% of coral would be destroyed and many insects would be wiped out.  The current level of commitments, which are not even being honoured, would still mean a rise in temperature of 3&deg;C.  In fact, given what is actually happening, we are heading towards a 4&deg;C to 5&deg;C increase in temperature, which will make large parts of the Earth uninhabitable.  That is why young people have taken the lead.  More than 300 cities have seen strikes by schoolchildren, while hundreds of thousands have come out on the streets in Belgium, the Netherlands, Australia, Sweden, Germany and elsewhere.<\/p><p>I note that 15 March has been named as the date for a global school student strike action.  School students in Ireland will, hopefully, join that in large numbers.  The contrast of those young people with the inaction of the world's leaders could not be starker.  The contrast is stark not only with climate change deniers like Trump, but with those like the Taoiseach, who acknowledge that climate change exists and the role of human society in it but who do not want to do anything about it.  As a result, Ireland is the second worst in the EU at meeting climate change targets.  According to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, today, Ireland is third worst in the EU at meeting renewable energy targets.  The reason for this inaction is clear.  Establishment politicians represent big business, including the 90 corporations responsible for 63% of cumulative global emissions and the oil, gas and big agribusiness companies pursuing the maximisation of profit.  A mass movement on climate change is needed and the school students should be joined by others, in particular the trade unions, to demand investment in green jobs and a centrally-based eco-socialist programme to take control of the economy out of the hands of the polluters and profiteers and to place it under the democratic control of the public to enable the rapid just transition we need.<\/p><p>I have two questions for the Taoiseach.  First, will he listen to school students when they strike on 15 March?  Second, given that transport is the second largest emitting sector of the economy, will he agree that radical action is needed to get people out of cars, that the State should invest in properly funded public transport services and, furthermore, should make public transport free, as has happened in Estonia, Luxembourg and 100 cities around the world?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500007#E01200","speaker":"1433","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551797100,"counter":75,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500008#F00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1551797100,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the important issue of climate change.

The consequences of not changing our model of care are plain to see.  Fine Gael has been in power for eight years and this Government has been in power for the past three years.  In those past three years, we have seen little or no health reform.  In fact, the situation has deteriorated.  The Taoiseach talks about health reform but he fails to implement what is glaringly obvious.  Time is not in our side as demand for our health service continues to grow with our ageing population.<\/p>  <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare is now two years old.  It still awaits transitional funding to trigger meaningful roll-out and delivery of better care to our patients.  Sl&aacute;intecare is stranded in the doldrums of inertia.  There is much talk about implementation but no implementation.  We cannot reform the health service from current spend.  It is not possible.  Specific independent, targeted funding is needed.  Without this, Sl&aacute;intecare will be just another report.  Transitional funding is needed to shift the balance of care towards community care while at the same time delivering on unmet need.  New models of data gathering, digital healthcare records and individual patient identifiers are essential so that we can gather data which will make meaningful progress in informing how we reform our health service.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE service plan for 2019 indicates the HSE will struggle to maintain services at 2018 levels, which in themselves were inadequate, and will not deliver services as we require them in 2019.  We still do not have multi-annual budgets.  Without this, long-term planning is impossible.  Unmet need will continue to grow as elective care will be limited by necessity.  We will be providing only essential and urgent care in our hospitals.  The expected increase in emergency admissions this year will diminish the ability to provide elective care.<\/p>  <p>  Meeting current and future challenges within our service as it is currently designed is not sustainable.  The service is facing extraordinary challenges and will need an extraordinary response.  The capacity of our service is at maximum, with ever-increasing unmet need.  Our hospitals are operating at 100% capacity which, internationally, is recognised as unsafe.  We have a shortage of intensive care unit, ICU, beds, which limits elective care.  We need 8,000 extra beds over the next ten years unless we engage in extraordinary health reform.  Opening 200 beds this year is wholly inadequate.  We educate our graduate nurses, doctors, consultants and general practitioners, GPs, for export.  This feeds into inadequate quality in the services that we provide.  The affect of this on our population is clear, with 100,000 people on trolleys, 70,000 awaiting elective care and 500,000 on waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  Will this be the legacy that this Government leaves behind?

I think that the Deputy's recommendation is a mistake because it is too fast.  I do not think the capacity to increase free GP care as quickly as he advocates, that is, an extra 1 million in two years and an extra 2 million in four years, exists in our GP surgeries.

As a result, three new national hospitals are under construction, with one to go to tender quite soon.<\/p>  <p>  There is investment in ICT.  The medical laboratory information system, MedLIS, is now available almost across the board, allowing people to see blood results all over the place.  There is also the picture archiving and communication system, PACS, and what replaced it in radiology, and there is the maternal health record, where women who attend maternity hospital now have electronic records which they did not in the past.  We are introducing reforms such as a commissioning model, where the National Treatment Purchase Fund is used to commission operations and procedures, which is why the waiting times for those waiting more than three months for an operation or procedure has fallen for months.<\/p>  <p>  We are increasing bed capacity, by 200 last year and approximately another 200 this year.  I visited Clonmel the other day, where there is a new 40-bed unit under construction, while the Minister for Health recently gave approval for an extra 60 beds in Limerick.  As a result, the number of patients on trolleys thus far this year, while still far too high, is at its lowest in four years, and let us hope that will continue.<\/p>  <p>  The next large step is contractual reforms for GPs and we are in negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation, having concluded talks with the nurses on a new contract for them.  We are keen to get that done to provide additional resources for general practice, that is, not just additional money for doing the same things but rather for change, embracing medicines management and ICT, giving information that we need to plan our health services and providing new services, particularly in the field of chronic care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500010#H00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1551798300,"counter":105,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach referred to his and my discipline of general practice in respect of Sl&aacute;intecare.  As he will know, the continuation of financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, has devastated general practice and it will take years for general practice to recover.  He referred to the expansion of primary care, which is an essential component of Sl&aacute;intecare, and he was quite right that we cannot expand eligibility or services unless there is the manpower to do so.  That is the very issue: we do not have the manpower in general practice to underpin Sl&aacute;intecare.  We do not have the capacity in general practice to supply the increased eligibility that the Taoiseach proposes and to expand the range of services if GPs are not available.  We are losing GPs from our urban practices, not to mention from our rural practices, and we cannot recruit GPs to supply the extra services.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has put the cart before the horse.  If our health service is to be reformed, manpower in general practice needs to be expanded, which is the underpinning of Sl&aacute;intecare.

I am broadly a supporter of multi-annual budgets, not just in the health service but across the board.  Before there can be multi-annual budgets, however, one must demonstrate that one is able to keep within annual budgets.  We already have a multi-annual budget in health, namely, a ten-year envelope for capital, but have the HSE and the health service managed to keep within that budget?  Is there anyone in the House who believes that if there was multi-annual budgeting for current spending, the HSE, which has gone over budget every year for any number of years, would not also go over budget on its multi-annual budget?<\/p><p>I believe it would.  It may burn up the money quicker than it does now and we have to take those concerns into account.  We are training more general practitioners, GPs, have increased the number of training places and, thankfully, those training places are being filled.  We are in negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, to restore funding for general practice and to link that to important reforms, including extending eligibility, moving to greater chronic care, medicines management and use of IT.  Where I disagree with Deputy Harty in his strong advocacy for Sl&aacute;intecare is that it is pretty unequivocal that it wants, as well as the 1 million people who already have free GP care, to have an extra 500,000 next year and 500,000 more after that.  I think the Deputy is mistaken on that and that we need to do the other thing first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500010#H00500","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An tOrd Gn\u00f3 - Order of Business","time":1551798900,"counter":108,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500011#J00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1551798900,"counter":109,"content":"<p>The business this week shall be as set out in the first revised report of the Business Committee, dated 5 March 2019.

The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government published a report in January 2018 with 26 recommendations to tackle the issue of latent defects, including the establishment of a redress scheme to assist homeowners.

Today, unfortunately, certain politicians are looking for us to relax standards once again and to remove layers of oversight when it comes to building, but we will not do that.  In 2014 the controls and regulations on building designing, architectural works, planning and the actual completion of works were greatly improved to protect people who were buying homes under this new control regime.  The difficulty we have is that there is a significant risk to the taxpayer if the Government accepts liability for individual buildings or for works that were not completed in the appropriate way, while at the same time potentially letting off builders who are responsible in this matter.<\/p>  <p>  Of course we want to find a pathway to help these people, but it is difficult to see one that does not take on this enormous open-ended liability on every other taxpayer in the State that the State simply could not meet.<\/p>  <p>  On the second part of the Deputy's question, at the time of last year's budget agreement in principle was reached for a scheme for people in Donegal and Mayo where pyrite, pyritic heave and mica have been damaging internally the concrete blocks of buildings that were built.

Time and again Deputies were come into the House to say that it is not working.  Today we see clearly and know that it is working so well that it is working better than anticipated, because the additional &euro;200 million of funding was a tranche that was meant to be there for three years, but only a year and a month into the operation of the scheme we have already seen hundreds of people approved and drawing down and hundreds more waiting to draw down their loans.<\/p>  <p>  We have dual applications because people are applying to different local authorities depending on where they intend to buy their homes.  We also have cases where some loans are approved but not drawn down.  That happens for many reasons.  The lag between an approval and a drawdown is not necessarily on the local authority's side.  Once one get's approval for a mortgage it takes time to find a home, to complete the sale and to do all the things that one has to do when someone is buying a home.  In those circumstances, that is where a delay can arise and that is often the case.  Sometimes a loan is not drawn down at all because the circumstances or the choice of the individual changes.  I indicated to the D&aacute;il that we would need to look for a second tranche when the first tranche did expire.  Only half of the first tranche has been drawn down to date.  That is why at the moment I am in negotiations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about a further tranche to ensure we can continue with the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.

A comprehensive set of Government structures has been put in place to ensure that all Departments and their agencies are engaged in detailed preparedness and contingency activities.  Since well before the referendum in the UK, Brexit has been the subject of detailed contingency planning across all relevant Departments.  Staff across several divisions in my Department contribute to the work on Brexit, including the international, European Union and Northern Ireland divisions, as well as the economic division.  To augment this ongoing work, my Department also has a dedicated unit on Brexit preparedness and contingency planning.  The unit, working closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, focuses on cross-Government co-ordination, planning and programme management.  The unit provides assistance to a Secretaries General group, chaired by the Secretary General to the Government, which meets weekly to oversee ongoing work on national Brexit preparedness and contingency planning.  <\/p><p>The unit also assists an assistant secretaries group on no-deal Brexit planning which meets on a regular basis.  This group is wholly focused on planning for a no-deal scenario based on the Government&rsquo;s contingency action plan published last December.  That plan provides detailed sectoral analyses and approaches to mitigate the impacts of a no-deal Brexit.  On 30 January, an update to the contingency action plan was published, setting out how preparations for a no-deal scenario have intensified since December.  <\/p><p>Our preparedness and contingency planning takes full account of and complements the steps under way at EU level to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal, notably as regards the implementation of the European Commission&rsquo;s contingency action plan.  There is ongoing engagement between Irish officials and their European Commission counterparts.  The unit, in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, also assists a senior officials group on Brexit-related legislation, which also meets on a regular basis.  The group is overseeing the necessary primary and secondary legislation required for a no-deal Brexit.  This has involved a painstaking, whole-of-Government screening of our laws to determine what changes will be needed if the UK becomes a third country overnight.<\/p><p>  On 22 February, the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019, known as the Brexit omnibus Bill or BOB, was published.  This landmark legislation crosses the remit of nine Ministers and is made up of 15 parts, all of which are designed to prepare Ireland for a no-deal Brexit.  The senior officials group on legislation will continue to work on the omnibus Bill as it progresses through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Work is continuing in parallel on complementary and necessary secondary legislation.  The Government will continue to work very closely with Opposition parties in the Oireachtas and all members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad to ensure that this necessary legislation will be in place by 29 March 2019 in the event of a no-deal Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500018#R00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1551802200,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Since the beginning of the year I have been asking the Taoiseach on every sitting day to outline what will happen if there is a no-deal scenario in the coming months.  Every time, the Taoiseach has replied that he is not contemplating or planning for a hard border but he has steadfastly refused to actually answer the specific question.  Even for him, this has been a remarkable display of ignoring what one has been asked.  It may very well be that Brexit will not be happening on 29 March due to an extension, as yet not agreed, but the Taoiseach has repeatedly said that we have to be ready for any eventuality.  He has also said that the United Kingdom leaving without a deal has major implications for the Border.  He is saying that we have to be ready and that something will happen but, with 24 days to go, he refuses to say what exactly will happen.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach not realise that there are orders already under production that will be delivered after 29 March?  Why is Ireland the only member of the EU that has not said what will happen on its borders in a no-deal scenario?  Today it is being reported that armed units of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are being sent to the Border in anticipation of a no-deal Brexit.  Are these reports false or are they confirmation that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, was correct and the T&aacute;naiste was wrong when the former claimed that there were \"immediate security implications\"?  Last week Dublin Port confirmed that it will have enough custom checkpoints available on 29 March but that there will not be enough customs officials to staff them.

I understand that the British have abandoned the notion of altering the withdrawal agreement itself.  It has been the very clear position of the EU from the start that the agreement will not be altered.  I asked previously if the assurance might take the shape of an amendment to the political declaration.  While I understand that this is still a possibility, it will not constitute a legally binding commitment as far as the British are concerned.  What is the Taoiseach's understanding of the nature of the discussions now taking place in terms of what will give the British the guarantee they are seeking?  Will it be a European Council declaration that could be interpreted as legally binding?  Could it be, as was suggested this morning on the national airwaves, some sort of new arbitration system?  The latter hardly gives the British the guarantees they need.  I ask the Taoiseach to provide clarity to this House so that Members here are at least as well briefed as our British counterparts on what exactly is being negotiated to give the British the guarantee they require.

The Taoiseach says publicly that the Government has done nothing to prepare for the possibility of a hard border between the North and South and yet we are hearing a constant drip, drip of commentary and reports which suggest that behind the scenes, the Government may be considering installing a physical border.  The latest of such reports, emblazoned on the front page of today's national newspapers, suggests that hundreds of garda&iacute; are being sent to the Border counties.  At Davos, the Taoiseach talked about the possibility of the Army being deployed along the Border and we have heard leading figures in the EU saying that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, measures would be needed to protect the integrity of the Single Market.  To say that there is a lack of clarity and certainty about the Government's intention to absolutely prevent, under all circumstances, a hard border between North and South would be putting it mildly.  Can the Taoiseach shed any light on this?  As the clock ticks down, there has to be a real fear that, unthinkable as it, such a border is being planned for, either by the Irish Government or the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500018#R01000","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1551802200,"counter":230,"content":"<p>At this stage, with just 24 days to go, I ask the Taoiseach to confirm to the Oireachtas that he has not given any undertaking or intimation to any negotiating party that his Government or the Irish State will be in any way resiling from the backstop or Irish protocol, as it is currently drafted.  It is important that he makes that clear.  We may speculate as to what the British Government might seek to negotiate but important though that is, it is outside of our control.  We need a clear understanding of the resolve of the Taoiseach and his Government to remain steady and firm in a position for the backstop.<\/p><p>Will the Taoiseach simply place it on the record of the House that this is the position of the Government and that it will remain the position of the Government, irrespective of overtures from London or anywhere else?<\/p> <p> Will the Taoiseach confirm or deny the news of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being sent to the Border?

I cannot predict with absolute certainty or absolute clarity what will happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  I do not believe that anybody can.  All we can do is plan for different scenarios.  I will say - and I am happy to say again - that we as a Government have made no plans for physical infrastructure, checks or controls on the land Border between Northern Ireland and Ireland under any scenario.  If we end up with no deal in a few weeks, we will have to have difficult discussions involving the European Commission and the UK Government on how we can protect the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union while avoiding the emergence of a hard border on the island.  The only workable solution we have come up with so far is what is written in the Irish protocol and the backstop, which is a system of regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and the European Union, and also to an extent between the United Kingdom and the European Union.  People talk about alternative arrangements but the only thing we have written down, that we know works in law and in reality, is what is contained in the backstop.<\/p><p>On staffing, we had a memo to Cabinet today about no-deal Brexit planning.  We will be in a position to have some 400 Revenue and Customs people in place at the end of the month.  There also will be between 50 and 60 officials from the Department of Health and between 150 and 200 inspectors from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We are confident that the IT systems will be in place and that we will be able to implement the <i>acquis <\/i>at the ports and airports.<\/p><p>With regard to Border policing, I did not have a chance to read the story in today's newspapers, but my note says that there was an article in today's edition of the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>stating &quot;Armed support units will shortly be deployed around the clock in the Border region, under plans being finalised by Garda chiefs&quot;.  Anybody will appreciate there is a difference between the Border and the Border region.  The Border region is what other people would call the northern division of the Garda.  I have been informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that in 2018, a cross-Border threat assessment was prepared jointly by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI.  This assessment estimated that some 43% of organised crime gangs in Northern Ireland have a cross-Border dimension.  Likewise mobile, organised crime groups responsible for multiple serious incidences of domestic burglary operate on an all-island basis.  There are also increasing incidences of borderless crimes such as cyberfraud and international terrorism.  This is the context in which the Garda Commissioner made an operational decision to establish another regional armed support unit, which will be based in County Cavan.  Members will appreciate that the detail on the number of garda&iacute; and resources allocated to this armed support unit is deemed to be operationally sensitive and cannot be disclosed for security reasons.  The Cavan Garda district armed support unit, ASU, is expected to become operational in the near future.  The Commissioner has now established armed support units in each of the six Garda regions to provide an armed response capacity and capability on a regional basis to support and supplement the national emergency response unit.  In the northern region ASUs are currently based in Ballyshannon and Dundalk Garda stations serving all Garda divisions comprising the northern region.  The unit based in Cavan will augment that.<\/p><p>A further 200 Garda recruits will attest later this week.  I understand that a further 49 newly attested garda&iacute; will be assigned to the northern region, which comprises the Border counties, but not the actual physical Border itself, which of course does not exist.<\/p><p>There is close and ongoing co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI.  This measure consists of additional garda&iacute; and an additional armed support unit for what are the Border counties, but not the Border <i>per se<\/i>.  I believe this will be welcomed by people, in particular by those who have been subjected to burglaries, in that region.<\/p><p>Discussions are ongoing between the EU and the UK.  I do not have clarity on the content or form of any further guarantees that may be made around the backstop.  The ongoing work is focused on what guarantees could be given regarding the backstop that underline once again its temporary nature, and to give the appropriate legal assurances on both sides.  Prime Minister May has acknowledged the EU's position that the withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated and that we cannot agree to anything that changes the meaning of the backstop therein.<\/p><p>We are open to providing further assurances on the temporary nature of the backstop but these can in no way contradict, change or undermine the legal operability thereof.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500019#S00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"All-Island Civic Dialogue","time":1551802800,"counter":233,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500019#S00300"},{"type":"question","time":1551802800,"counter":234,"qnumday":6,"qnumall":"[8465\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500019#S00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the all-island civic dialogue held on 15 February 2019..

Many businesses have told me about how slow everything has been to move from calling on people to be prepared and actually delivering substantive aid at the level of individual companies.  One and a half years after aid for the agrifood sector was announced, the loans are only beginning to be approved now.  Since last summer we have been seeking an update from Government on the preparedness data, which were formerly being prepared on a six-monthly basis.  For some reason the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and the Government have decided to discontinue this research series.  Will the Taoiseach explain why the Government has not published any recent data on the level of business preparedness?  We have lots of data on the number of companies seeking basic information, but the more important information on the impact of Brexit and preparedness levels has disappeared.<\/p>  <p>  Last December the Taoiseach stated that the Government's intention was to ensure that every business which needs to be ready will be ready by 29 March.

One of the aspects that impacted on that confidence over the last weekend was the sudden blowing up of the <i>voisinage<\/i>dispute when a Northern Ireland-registered vessel was arrested in Irish territorial waters.  I am aware there was immediate contact between the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il to fast-track legislation that has been stalled for some time.  What exactly is the Taoiseach's legislative solution?  There are concerns around finding a solution - which is important for all of us - but not one that does not address the issues that caused the court case to be taken in the first instance.  The case was taken by a number of fishermen who were very concerned about the impact of mussel dredging by Northern registered boats.<\/p><p>The concern is that one cannot restrict the impact to Northern boats only, as all UK-registered boats could avail of this gentleman's agreement, as it has been constituted to date.  Can the Taoiseach indicate, on foot of his deep involvement with this over the weekend, what exactly he understands the dispute to be and what specific legislative measures he wants to fast-track to address the matter into the future?

It is particularly an issue for small businesses, of which there are many on both sides of the Border.  Most hauliers in Ireland are small to medium-sized businesses and the average fleet size is approximately five trucks.  No matter what happens, there will be a significant increase in the volume of documentation that will have to accompany imports and exports.  That means massive costs in time, administration and money for most medium-sized businesses.  I heard on the fringe of the meeting people voicing their concern that very little has been made explicit to them.  I understand that because the Taoiseach does not know exactly what is going to happen, he does not want to frighten people.  On the other hand, people need to undertake a great deal more preparation than we have seen.  There has not been enough outreach.  For instance, works on the former customs building in Dundalk are the talk of that town, notwithstanding claims that nothing is going to happen.  Clearly, however, documentation will have to increase with any change in the UK's status.

I am interested to know what his future plans for the dialogue are.  Does he foresee it becoming a forum for exchanges on Ireland post Brexit?  Whatever way this lands and whether it is hard or soft, Brexit will have huge implications for the entire island.  We need to work to involve unionism in this format.  I note that the Taoiseach spoke at the Alliance Party conference at the weekend, which was extremely positive.  More unionist opinion needs to be engaged, whether that is through political parties or more generally across society, or civic unionism, if I can use that term.  The forum needs to be a space for those views to be articulated.  Can the Taoiseach share with the House what he sees as the future of the dialogue?<\/p>  <p>  On the last occasion we met, in addition to issues around business, commerce and trade, huge issues were raised around citizens' rights.  Famously, the Taoiseach assured Northern citizens that they would never again be left behind.  The truth, however, is that they are being left behind.  Even in the best-case scenario now, where the backstop or protocol is honoured and delivered, there nevertheless will be a significant move away from the initial promise to Irish and EU citizens that they would be free to exercise and enjoy their rights where they resided.  That is now not the case, which is a very serious matter and one people are very seized of at this moment.  It is a pity the Taoiseach did not avail of the opportunity to afford the two additional European Parliament seats to the people of the North.  It could and should have been done.  The Taoiseach should have put his money where his mouth was as regards not leaving people behind and allowed people right across society in the North to return two representatives to the European Parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500020#T00300","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1551803400,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I also attended the dialogue and while dialogue is, of course, important in this current situation of Brexit, it is not much good if some of those involved are not in full possession of the real story.

It is astonishing that he has not read the report.  If I understood his reply correctly, the Taoiseach said the deployment had nothing to do with Brexit and the possibility of a hard border.  It is simply a coincidence and involves a more general concern about organised crime.  Can the Taoiseach clarify that is what he is actually saying in order that the House understands?  Most people reading the newspapers today will have considered the report to have something to do with preparations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the possibility of a hard border.  That anxiety and fear will have been fuelled by comments the Taoiseach made in Davos referring to the deployment of the Army.<\/p>  <p>  Another important item of information I seek in this regard is whether the Taoiseach has had any discussions with EU Commissioners, Barnier, Juncker or leaders like Macron and Merkel about what they mean when they talk about the need to protect the integrity of the Single Market in the event that there is no deal.  What are they expecting?  I am fearful that there will be pressure from that quarter on the Taoiseach in the event that there is no deal.

There are more garda&iacute;, more armed support units, more vehicles and more investments and, as such, it should surprise no one that the Border region, or the northern division as the Garda calls it, should see increased deployment of garda&iacute; and armed support units.  It is happening everywhere in the country, which is the context in which it is happening there.  I am happy to clarify that it would be happening, Brexit or no Brexit, due, unfortunately, to the level of crime people experience in Ireland, not least on foot of armed burglaries in rural areas on which we are determined to crack down, not only in Cavan, Donegal and Louth, but everywhere in the country.<\/p><p>Deputy Burton asked about customs declarations.  At the meeting, figures were released on the number of customs declarations which will increase from approximately 1 million to 20 million.  That is a roughly 20-fold increase in the level of information and documentary obligations falling on business, which would impose considerable costs in time and administration.  We are trying to make the process, if it happens, as simple as possible through the use of ICT that did not exist 20 or 30 years ago and training is also on offer for businesses that want it.<\/p><p>The Government's policy on <i>voisinage<\/i>is to restore the situation to the <i>status quo ante<\/i>, which means going back to what we thought the law was before the Supreme Court struck it down in 2016.  That situation involves a reciprocal arrangement to allow vessels from Northern Ireland to enter our six-mile limit just as vessels from Ireland can now enter the six-mile limit in Northern Ireland.  It is quite an unfair situation currently as vessels from south of the Border can enter the Northern Ireland six-mile limit waters whereas vessels from Northern Ireland cannot enter ours.  We want to correct that situation.  While there were complications previously around large vessels, large vessels are all now banned from the six-mile limit and I hope we can, therefore, get cross-party support to get the relevant legislation through.  The Bill has been published and passed on Second Stage in the Seanad and I hope it can be enacted by Easter.  It would help if the UK Government clarified its intention not to withdraw Northern Ireland from the London convention, but we are not going to make that a precondition.<\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p> With regard to European Parliament representation, it is not possible to have a constituency for the European Parliament that is outside the European Union and only EU citizens can vote in European elections.  That is in the treaties.  It would not be possible to have a constituency of Northern Ireland.  Even if it was possible, only EU and Irish citizens would be allowed to vote.  One would have to forbid UK citizens from voting and that would be a problem.  However, in voting for Mr. Mark Durkan in the European elections people will have an opportunity to ensure there is somebody living in Derry who can represent all of the Ireland in the European Parliament.  We will look at other mechanisms that might work.  Accession countries can elect observers to the European Parliament and perhaps we might do something similar for Northern Ireland, but I cannot promise that at this stage.<\/p> <p> Regarding citizens' rights, people living in Northern Ireland who hold Irish citizenship and, therefore, EU citizenship will continue to have citizens' rights.  They include the right to work, study and travel anywhere within the European Union without the need for a visa, permit or the like.

Given the pickle the Government has been in because of the extraordinary cost of the national children's hospital, did it occur to the Taoiseach to obtain some friendly advice from another European country on how to manage costs?  The issue was underlined again this morning in one of the newspapers which reported that HSE internal documents from the estates department showed that as far back as last May the head of estates in the HSE had made it clear that the budget figures for the children's hospital would have to be available for inputting into the budget last October.  That would be the normal practice with which I am familiar.  Big capital budgets must be considered in the context of the overall budget.  This makes a nonsense of what the Minister for Health has asserted, that the children's hospital budget had no bearing on the overall budget announced last autumn.

There are major parallels, historically and socially, between Portugal and Ireland in the sense that Portugal developed a big problem with illicit drugs at a similar time to this country in the 1980s.  It was an enormous problem, with high rates of HIV, drug related crime, addiction and so forth.  Portugal made the brave decision in 2001 to decriminalise the possession and consumption of all illicit drugs and it has been a spectacular success.  HIV and drug related crime rates have plummeted.  The levels of addiction have not disappeared completely, but they have reduced dramatically and stabilised.

It is essential at this juncture that the Government does not blink and that it is not distracted or unnerved on any level.  The backstop is the absolute bare minimum.  Whereas legal assurances and words of comfort are one thing and might be entertained, nothing that in any way compromises what are the absolute bottom line requirements as per the current Irish protocol should be entertained for a second.

The informal meeting in Lisbon with Prime Minister, Ant&oacute;nio Costa, was exactly that.  We got to know each other a little over the years and I was there on a personal visit.  I told him I was there and he invited me over to his residence for a glass of wine and a chat.  I brought the ambassador with me and he brought one of his officials with him.  That was about the size of it.  I do not think there is any need for conspiracy theories on this one.<\/p>  <p>  We did not have a chance to discuss hospital construction.  I imagine construction costs are lower in Portugal.  I imagine labour costs are lower as well and professional fees are less.  I do not know if material costs are lower but they may well be.  Generally, Governments and Government agencies examine capital programmes in other countries and try to learn from what they do well and what they do badly and vice versa.  A lot of people examine our programmes too.  By and large for the past ten years we have been successful in delivering a capital programme on time and on budget.  This is true for the massive Irish Water investment programme, the school programme, which is really big, the primary care centres, the &euro;300 million Luas cross-city project and the &euro;500 million projects such as the M17 and M18 and Enniscorthy-New Ross.  The vast majority of projects have come in broadly on time and on budget in the past ten years, the children's hospital being the notable exception.<\/p>  <p>  There are examples of how it has gone wrong in other countries.  Karolinksa hospital in Sweden will probably cost somewhere around &euro;6 billion by the time it is finished.  It is easily the most expensive hospital project in the world.  We all know the problems that have arisen in Australia as well in terms of the parliamentary inquiries into the cost of the new hospital in Perth and the problems that have arisen in Adelaide.  Those of us who are interested in aviation will know about Brandenburg Airport, a new airport for Berlin completed five years and not yet open.  There is a lot to be learned from what other countries get right and what they get wrong.  Unfortunately, big capital projects go wrong in all countries.  We need to ensure, particularly when it comes to the new children's hospital, that we do not run into the problems around commissioning that other countries have had.  We need to prepare now for that.  I have seen examples of other children's hospitals built, which it took three years to commission when construction had finished.  We cannot allow that to happen in Ireland.  We need to plan for that now.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the Brexit negotiations, briefings are, of course, available to Opposition Leaders.  We are happy to provide them.  The position as of today is that we have no texts or draft texts to consider or get legal advice on.

The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, under the Chairmanship of the now Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, did an interesting report on the issue.  There is no doubt in my mind that the Portuguese model has been successful in terms of harm reduction and not imposing criminal convictions on people for minor possession, thus keeping people who were found to be in possession of minor amounts of narcotics out of the criminal justice system and dealing with them in the health system, thereby ensuring that these people, who are mainly young people, do not get a criminal conviction which then causes problems for them for the rest of their lives in terms of getting employment, visas and so on.  That seems to me to be a humane approach, although it is evident that drugs and narcotics are very available in Lisbon.  They are sold openly on the streets and squares.  People will probably tell me that is true of Dublin too but they seem to be more available there than they are in our cities so we would have to bear that in mind as part of any model that we may wish to consider.  The issue of decriminalisation is being examined by a group headed up by Mr. Justice Garrett Sheehan and I look forward to seeing the report when it is done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500022#V00600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna ar Sonra\u00edodh Uain D\u00f3ibh - Priority Questions","time":1551804600,"counter":274,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500022#V00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1551804600,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Deputy Michael McGrath has permission to take Question No. 39 in the absence of Deputy Cowen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500022#V00800","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Service Pay Commission Reports","time":1551804600,"counter":276,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500022#V00900"},{"type":"question","time":1551804600,"counter":277,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[10568\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500022#V01000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"when the Public Service Pay Commission will report on recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1551804600,"counter":278,"content":"<p>This question relates to the work of the Public Service Pay Commission on the issue of recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces.

These include transparency, equal treatment and non-discrimination, proportionality and mutual recognition.  The European Union directives set out the legal framework for the award of contracts that exceed the specified monetary threshold for supplies, services and works.  Under Article 69 of Directive 2014\/24\/EU, the EU directive governing public procurement, contracting authorities are obliged to require tenderers to explain the price or costs in a tender where tenders appear to be abnormally low in relation to the works, supplies or services.  Contracting authorities must assess the response from the tenderer before coming to a decision as to whether they will admit the tender or reject it on the basis that it is abnormally low.  Where the explanation provided by a tenderer does not satisfactorily account for the low level of price or costs, having taken into account the circumstances outlined in the procurement directives, the contracting authority may reject the tender, although it is not obliged to do so.  When investigating what may appear to be an abnormally low tender, contracting authorities must take into consideration the possibility that the tenderer may be obtaining more favourable terms from suppliers and subcontractors than rival tenderers.<\/p>  <p>  There is little scope for manoeuvre on labour rates since contractors are required by law to pay workers covered by the sectoral employment orders, SEOs, in accordance with the terms of the applicable SEO.  More efficient methods, however, of working to reduce labour costs cannot be ruled out in assessing a tender.  Notwithstanding this, there is nothing to prevent an entity from performing a contract at a loss, subject to it being compliant with labour, social and environmental regulations.  Where the contracting authority discovers that the price is abnormally low because the tenderer is not meeting its obligations in the field of social, labour or environmental law, the tender must be rejected.  Where works contracts are concerned, specific reference to unbalanced tenders and abnormally low tenders is made in section 8 of the standard template instructions to tenderers published under the capital works management framework.  These documents, which constitute the rules under which a tender competition is run, must be used in all public works contracts and have been published since 2008.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500023#W00900","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1551805200,"counter":288,"content":"<p>In fairness, I know the law.

I have said that the way in which this issue developed, particularly the latter phase of it, needs to change in the future and will change.  The Deputy will never acknowledge that we get the majority of projects right.  We will deliver three major transport projects on time and on track this year.  We will deliver major projects like primary schools and primary care centres all over this country in the way the taxpayer wants.  I am not looking to minimise in any way the anger and concern caused by the national children's hospital project.

As the Deputy may be aware, it falls outside the statutory remit of the Office of the Regulator of the National Lottery.  I am aware of the issues in question.  The topic has been raised in general discussions as part of the normal engagement my officials and I have with the regulator's office on matters pertaining to governance.  We receive general updates on the regulator's activities in exercising her functions, as set out in the National Lottery Act 2013.  In a recent meeting, the regulator expressed concern about the potential future impact of online lottery betting in Ireland.  The context for the operation of the national lottery has changed significantly since its original establishment in 1986.  The national lottery remains an important asset.  The level of moneys raised for use by good causes has increased steadily in recent years.  It increased by 28% between 2014 and 2018.  As set out in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2019, this year's estimated total expenditure of &euro;333 million for good causes will be part funded by approximately &euro;225 million from the national lottery, with the remainder being funded by the Exchequer.  While this is a dynamic and rapidly evolving market, the national lottery continues to deliver strong results.  The most recent reports and financial statements of the current operator, Premier Lotteries Ireland, show that gross ticket sales rose by 6.1% in 2017.  Against this background, there does not appear to be any evidence of a significant impact on the national lottery arising from online lottery betting at present.  My officials will continue to engage with the regulator and Premier Lotteries Ireland to review the impact of online lottery betting websites on the national lottery and the good causes fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500026#Z00800","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1551807000,"counter":324,"content":"<p>Does the Minister expect to receive an opinion from the regulator of the national lottery regarding the threat posed by online offshore operators that allow people to bet on the outcome of lottery draws?  I think he has conceded that it is a threat.  It would have a negative impact on the good causes fund.  As he indicated in his answer, the Minister appreciates the &euro;225 million that goes to a wide range of community, sporting, cultural and other events throughout Ireland.  Other countries have taken action to reduce the risk to their national lotteries from these unregulated offshore lotteries to ensure funds are held for good causes.  Why does the Minister sound so reluctant to intervene in this case?  Most people who are aware that gambling is a serious problem know that this kind of online gambling is becoming more prevalent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500026#Z00900","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1551807000,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I would like to put on the record of the D&aacute;il some figures regarding the transfers that the national lottery has made to the Exchequer in recent years.

The contribution the national lottery is making had increased in recent years, but it may have stabilised or plateaued, depending on one's perspective, between 2017 and 2018.  The Deputy asked about the engagement of my office and my Department with the regulator on this matter.  My understanding of the view of the regulator is based on an extract from the last engagement with our regulator that has been shared with me.  The regulator knows that this could be a long-term issue.  At the moment, the type of gambling under way here that could present a difficulty to the lottery is small in scale.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, will bring a report to the Government shortly in relation to the regulation of the gambling sector.

The facts and figures indicate that the current contribution made by the national lottery to good causes has not yet been materially affected by other developments within the lotteries here in terms of online or electronic lotteries.  The contribution that the Exchequer has received from the national lottery attests to that.  I do acknowledge that although currently the competition is small, it can grow quickly.  Were it to grow quickly, it could in turn affect the contribution the national lottery can make to good causes.  We have to look at all this from a regulatory perspective.

As Deputy Michael McGrath will be aware, public servants who reached the compulsory retirement age of 65 before the new legislation was enacted were required to retire in accordance with the statutory compulsory retirement age in effect at the time.  Those who availed of the interim arrangements did so in the knowledge that the contract was for one year only, until they reached the age of 66.

I launched the current framework for public service innovation and development, Our Public Service 2020, in December 2017.  This plan is a whole-of-public service initiative that has been designed to build on the success of previous reforms, while also expanding the scope of reform to enable more collaboration, innovation and evaluation.<\/p>  <p>  Ensuring equity and consistency in the application of reform across the entire public service is central to the framework.  I expect this to be achieved through a robust and innovative governance structure, namely, the public service leadership board, PSLB, and the development of key indicators and metrics that are designed to track performance across our entire public service.<\/p>  <p>  The PSLB was established to lead the delivery of Our Public Service 2020.  For the first time ever, civil and wider public service leaders will share ownership and work jointly to drive the reform programme.  This governance structure provides a platform for officials at the most senior level and from across the gamut of public services that we provide to ensure the even and consistent application of reform.  Furthermore, Our Public Service 2020 contains an added focus on evaluation and the importance of building an evaluation culture.  This will be achieved in part by developing indicators that support a focus on outcomes.  For this reason, my Department established a reform evaluation unit to monitor and evaluate the reform outcomes and to create greater links between expenditure and reform.<\/p>  <p>  Our Public Service 2020 seeks to deliver better outcomes for the public by ensuring that the citizen is at the centre of all policies and services that we deliver.  There are always ways to do things better when it comes to the delivery of public services, but I am confident that my Department and those involved in the delivery of public services look to find ways to improve continually.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500031#EE01000","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1551810000,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

This is the first time that we have brought leaders from across the entire public service together with a view to seeing what they can learn from one another.  In the delivery of, for example, IT projects, there is a far greater sharing of knowledge and services across Departments than was the case previously.

They refer specifically to the need for the Minister for Health to seek the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, should he or she wish to make any order or regulation.  Section 75A relates to the sitting Minister for Health being able to make arrangements.  It reads:<\/p><blockquote>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, make such order or orders as he or she considers necessary to continue in being or carry out any reciprocal or other arrangements in relation to health services which were in operation between the State and the United Kingdom immediately before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from membership of the European Union.<\/blockquote><p>Section 75B essentially says the same thing with regard to regulations.<\/p><p>Obviously there is a relatively complex and important set of relationships between Ireland and the United Kingdom in the realm of health care, whether that be using Altnagelvin Area Hospital in Derry or ambulance services moving north and south of the Border.  In fact, the vast majority of cross-Border ambulance traffic comprises ambulances from Northern Ireland responding to emergency calls in the South and bringing citizens of the Republic to hospital.  We also have the cross-border directive and the treatment abroad scheme.  The relationship is very complex and the issues involved are very important.  There are many people throughout this country who are waiting to have surgery carried out in one of the larger UK hospitals or waiting for UK doctors to come here to provide, for example, some very specialised paediatric services.  Highly specialised surgeons and their teams regularly come from UK hospitals and spend a day or more in Irish hospitals, operating on patients.<\/p><p>My concern is that the sitting Minister for Health may need to be able to make quick decisions.  Let us say a surgeon and his or her team are coming over to Crumlin hospital for two days of operations but something pops up.  We will be living in a world of unintended consequences and complexities, not all of which we are able to foresee.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Some order is required from the sitting Minister for Health to make sure the team can come in, that the insurance policies are covered, to make sure the drugs they use are sanctioned and so on: it is a complex legal field.  The way that 75A and 75B are written provide that any order, arrangement or regulation from the Minister for Health all require the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, currently held as one post, but after a reshuffle or a general election the roles could quite easily be back to two different posts.<\/p> <p> I have two concerns.  The first is that it slows things down and it does not allow the Minister for Health of the day make the decisions that he or she is entrusted by the Taoiseach to make.  My second concern is on a democratic point.  I do not believe it is appropriate that a Cabinet Minister should seek consent of the Minister for Finance.<\/p> <p> I have tabled three amendments that say, very specifically, consent is required from the Minister for Finance when the issue relates to taxation, and that consent is required from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform where there is an expenditure implication of the order.  For taxation and expenditure it would be yes, but for everything else I do not believe it would be appropriate for a Minister for Finance to have that authority.  It is not what they are doing day to day: they are not immersed in the world of healthcare.<\/p> <p> I hope the Minister will accept the amendments.  They are modest but important in making sure the Minister for Health of the day can move with the necessary speed.  Sometimes these situations can move very fast.  A surgeon and his or her team could be sitting in an airport ready to come to Ireland, or on arriving in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin they may need support from the sitting Minister.  There is no reason why any Ministers for Finance or Public Expenditure and Reform should be involved, unless there are taxation or expenditure issues, in which case the amendments cover both of those.

Sinn F&eacute;in suggests that the D&aacute;il could give consent.

While we give the consent now all of this is being done on the basis that there may be a hard crash.  While nobody wants to see a hard crash most of the provisions are on the basis of a no-deal Brexit and a hard crash scenario.  In that case, if these provisions were to come into effect - the T&aacute;naiste has quite rightly said that nobody wants the majority of these provisions ever to come into effect - we would believe it is important to have proper oversight and that the D&aacute;il would have a say at that time.

It cures a deficiency that in my Second Stage contribution I had asked to be addressed.  In his response to our concerns at the end of Second Stage the T&aacute;naiste will be aware that he said our concerns, which I had set out in my Second Stage contribution, had been addressed.  The T&aacute;naiste said:<\/p><blockquote>Deputies have noted the range of measures in the Bill to facilitate in an operational way the shift to the UK being a third country.  Deputy Howlin made two points relating to Parts 2 and 6.  I reassure the Deputy that the Bill and all its Parts has been prepared in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and on the basis of legal advice from that office.  I am sure the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, can address the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns in more detail, if necessary.<\/blockquote><p>Saying that the Attorney General has looked at it is hardly a comprehensive response to the constitutional issue I raised.  I would like to hear what his views were and why it is constitutional in the way it is asserted, which is obviously very important.  The amendment suggested by Deputy Cullinane would cure that in as much as it would have to have the consent of the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>Labour&rsquo;s concerns cannot be easily put into an amendment to cure that infirmity - I was trying to think of an amendment myself - on the legality of the section from a constitutional perspective.  The relevant concern is that Labour believes there is a constitutional problem with Part 2 of the Bill.  I had simply sought very clear advice to assuage those concerns.<\/p><p>The UK Brexit legislation has relied heavily on so-called Henry VIII clauses, which in the British system, with no written Constitution, allow ministerial orders to amend Acts of Parliament and these by-pass the legislature.  I have looked at a number of other countries in this regard and new powers are being devolved to Ministers to act by decree in many jurisdictions because we do not know exactly what problems might arise.  I can understand the administrative attraction of such a power that the Minister may act by decree without reference to primary legislation.  We, however, have very clearly set out restrictions on the powers of Ministers to act without the consent of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>Several judgments of the courts make it clear that such clauses are constitutionally prohibited, except where necessitated by EU membership, which has already been permitted by referendum of the people.  In this section the Department of Health is seeking to create a Henry VIII type clause as part of our own Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019.  In Part 2, the Government has proposed to give the Minister for Health power to &ldquo;make such adaptations and modifications to the <i>Health Acts 1947 <\/i>to <i>2019 <\/i>or any regulations made under those Acts as the Minister considers necessary for the purpose of bringing those Acts or regulations into conformity with this Part.&rdquo;  I believe this would clearly involve the Minister for Health changing primary legislation without the direct authority for that change being brought before the D&aacute;il and provided by the D&aacute;il.  My legal advice is that this is not constitutional.  The specific section where the power is described is in section 4, which proposes to insert section 75B(2)(c) into the Health Act 1970.<\/p><p>Under Article 15 of the Constitution, the &ldquo;sole and exclusive&rdquo; law-making power of the State is vested in the Oireachtas.  As a result, regulations that modify primary legislation are necessarily beyond the power of any individual Minister and cannot be vested in any individual Minister.  I read some of the legal judgments into the record during my Second Stage contribution so I will not revisit it here.  In essence, this is a matter of substance.  It is not a trivial matter.  We need to have very clear assurances from the Minister that what he is doing is constitutional.  We do not want a situation where the health co-operation between this jurisdiction and Northern Ireland becomes one of the most fundamental causes of concern.  A person contacted me this week who was due to have a serious operation in April under the cross-Border health initiative.  This person asked me if it was safe and would it go ahead.  I do not want there to be any legal doubt about any authority that might vest in the Minister to make changes that could be challenged constitutionally or which could be infirm.  I would welcome a very clear statement on the advice and considerations of the Attorney General on why he and the Government believe that vesting in the Minister for Health - what on the face of it is an unconstitutional power - is in fact constitutional.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500033#GG00400","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1551811800,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I follow on from Deputy Howlin's point about seeking an assurance from the Minister for Health.  The T&aacute;naiste who is also in the House will recall attending a meeting of the working group of committee Chairmen a couple of weeks ago.  The general scheme of the Bill was published on 24 January.  In that regard, I speak as a former health spokesperson for 14 years and a Border Deputy.  As the T&aacute;naiste will recall very well, at the meeting I referred to a quick perusal on my first sighting of the pledged intent in the withdrawal legislation in respect of health services.  On publication of the Bill, however, I see that none of the detail in the area of health has transferred from the general scheme.  This is not the case in respect of the commitments related to other Departments.  The Ceann Comhairle will say I cannot address some of the amendments I proposed.  Of course, in that regard, I would have argued for the inclusion of the word \"shall\", rather than \"will\".  However, if the Minister is giving Deputy Howlin an assurance, I will ask for one also.  Will he give me and those I represent an assurance on the critical commitments contained in the general scheme of the Bill?  At the meeting of committee Chairmen I indicated to the T&aacute;naiste that there were other things to which I could probably point, but in the listing the critical significant areas were covered, which I welcomed and the T&aacute;naiste will confirm as much.  I ask the Minister to confirm something for those cross-frontier workers who qualify for a full medical card under the current arrangements.  I only use this as an example and do not intend to take up any more time than is necessary.  It was the very first matter, but I could add a number of others that I have identified in the period since.  We were able to secure some of them in our work at the Joint Committee on Health and Children, as it was then known.  I ask the Minister for an assurance that the language now employed does not offer a way to resile from them and reserve a right to say \"No\".  Our hope is the current situation that obtains in health services and healthcare entitlements on a North-South basis will continue under this legislation as the guarantee in the worst case Brexit scenario.

Deputy Howlin is right to point out that healthcare is an issue citizens in the North and the Republic are watching very carefully.  While a great deal of the conversation about Brexit pertains to issues related to trade, economic well-being and growth, all of which are terribly important, health will, on a human and practical level, be the sort of matter on which, as Deputies Howlin and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in articulate so clearly, people will want to know whether the <i>status quo<\/i>can continue post Brexit, regardless of how it ends up being composed.  I assure not only the House but the people that it is the very clear intention of the Irish and British Governments to continue to provide health services between the jurisdictions on the North-South and east-west basis that obtains today.  Only today the Cabinet approved the signing by the T&aacute;naiste of a detailed memorandum of understanding with the UK Government to enable issues related to the common travel area to be addressed.  I also met the HSE recently as part of our own Brexit preparations and was informed by it, to answer Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question directly, that there was no cross-Border health service available which would not be available post Brexit.  That is an absolute tribute to the incredible individuals in the health services in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland who have worked so hard to ensure that is the reality.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in will know better than many Members, owing to his geographical location and representation of a Border county, the links between the health services and our peoples run very deep and have done so for a very long time.  The commitment of all to maintain these links has been extraordinarily helpful.  I provide the assurance for which Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asks and I am pleased to be able to do so.<\/p><p>Deputy Howlin asked a very specific question and I accept his sincerity and bona fides in raising it.  He wants to know that this is the right way to go and me to assure the House that our legal advices are robust in that regard.  I assure him that we have received advice from the Office of the Attorney General and liaised with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  All of the legal advice available to the Government is that this is an appropriate way to proceed and, in fact, is the most straightforward approach considering that it is emergency legislation.  While it is legislation we hope we will never have to implement, we want to have it on the Statute Book should we end up in a crash-out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500034#HH00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1551811800,"counter":449,"content":"<p>How is that constitutional?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500034#HH00300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1551811800,"counter":450,"content":"<p>The advice of the Attorney General is that it is constitutional.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500034#HH00400","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1551811800,"counter":451,"content":"<p>How?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500034#HH00500","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1551811800,"counter":452,"content":"<p>We rely on the advice of the Attorney General who has assured me that it is constitutional.

We should remind ourselves why we are doing this.  We intend to do no more than maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>and ensure the Minister of the day will be able to continue that which is in place today.

On the other hand, I also accept the sincerity of Deputy Cullinane who suggests for good reasons that it might be better to create more stringent provisions in providing an oversight role for the D&aacute;il.

In that way it could be an unintentional obstacle.  The purpose of the provisions is to enable the Minister of the day to facilitate the continued provision of the services already in place on a reciprocal basis.  It is no more and no less than that.<\/p>  <p>  I refer specifically to the amendments in the name of Deputy Donnelly, namely, amendments Nos. 5, 9, 20 which is consequential and 21.  Section 75 will enable the Minister for Health, with the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, to make the order or orders necessary to continue in being the reciprocal or other healthcare arrangements in place with the United Kingdom prior to its withdrawal from the European Union.  Such an order or orders may specify the categories of persons and the health services to which they should apply.  The current wording of the section reflects the exercise of discretion involved in the making of such orders by the Minister and will allow the Minister to make such orders, as required.  I took to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel specifically the point made by Deputy Donnelly about this construct.  As constructed, the section refers specifically to the consent required from the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and was drafted on foot of the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel which informed me that this was the conventional and established approach.  The advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel confirms that the appropriate legislative approach required to ensure there will be a comprehensive governance framework to underpin the regulations making power of the Minister for Health is in place.  The office further advises me and I advise the House that adopting the approach proposed in the amendment would have the unintended potential to dilute the robust consent arrangements currently in place in this section of the Bill.  In addition, the consequences of adopting the proposed approach outlined in amendments Nos. 5, 9 and 20 are unknown.  It may impose unintended obligations on the Department of Health and possibly the Government generally in the general legislative process.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides that the healthcare arrangements currently in place will be maintained to the greatest extent possible following the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  As the Bill seeks to maintain the existing reimbursement arrangements, it is not considered that additional expenditure implications arise.  Accordingly, the policy decision has been taken that the making of the orders will require the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>In keeping with the constructive approach everybody is taking to the Bill I sought legal guidance on Deputy Donnelly's amendments and the view I received from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel was that the current wording was the conventional constructed wording and to do anything else would dilute it.  That is the advice I wish to convey to Deputy Donnelly.<br\/><br\/>The consequence of adopting the approach outlined in amendments Nos. 8 and 21 would be to impose an additional obligation on the Minister for Health to lay such orders before the D&aacute;il having already received that consent.  Such an approach would introduce an additional layer of complexity to the legislative process which is not considered necessary or to be required considering what we are trying to do, which is just to maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>.  In addition, the requirement for a positive resolution of the D&aacute;il in the manner proposed would have the potential to act as a barrier and a delaying mechanism to the timely approval of the necessary legislation, for example, during times when the Oireachtas might not be sitting.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons I have outlined and taking into account the urgent and emergency nature of the legislation and the extremely limited timeframe for its enactment, I must decline to accept the amendments in this group owing to the legal advice available to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500034#HH00800","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551812400,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Before responding to the Minister, I have a question on the order for this session.

The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, stated unequivocally that the current healthcare arrangements between the United Kingdom and Ireland would remain in place no matter what.  That is what I heard and he is nodding in confirmation.  I hope that is true, but it is a very brave thing to say.  For example, the treatment abroad scheme is not an Ireland-UK arrangement but an EU programme.  Can it not be the case that there is a Brexit in which the United Kingdom is no longer in the EU programme?  How can we guarantee that whatever agreements are in place based on an EU programme that many Irish citizens use, under no circumstances will they not be available in the future?  If that is the level of insight and foresight the Minister has, that is fantastic, but I would be very surprised if that was the case.<\/p><p>It is entirely possible that the United Kingdom will change regulations post Brexit.  In fact, its parliament has stated repeatedly that it will be changing regulations in a variety of areas.  If the United Kingdom were to change regulations on product safety for pharmaceutical and medical products, procedures and protocols for procedures, import and export protocols and professional qualifications, be it for consultants, nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, radiographers and the gamut of healthcare professionals, it is possible and quite likely that some combinations of qualifications, medicines, procedures, protocols, check backs, audits and so forth implemented in the United Kingdom would no longer be recognised by the European Union.  Regardless of what happens or what changes the United Kingdom makes to its regulations, procedures, training, qualifications and so forth and even where the European Union states it no longer accepts a procedure or particular professional qualification and that while a particular drug is regulated for use for a certain purpose in the United Kingdom, the European Medicines Agency has not signed off on it and it is not useable here, the Minister has made a definitive statement that post Brexit no services will be impacted on in any way.  That is great if it is true, but it does not sound right.  He did not give a caveat in any way.  Is there a caveat in that statement?  If it is true, that is fantastic, but I do not see how the Minister can make such statements at this point.<\/p><p>The Minister has stated the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform will be needed is the legal advice he received.  Of course, there is nothing conventional or established about the legislation we are considering.  Putting aside the constitutional question about the D&aacute;il which is an important one to be resolved, if the sitting Minister for Health must make a decision on a change to regulations for the training of radiographers in Northern Ireland, for example, or the de-listing of a particular anaesthetic used in the NHS, why would that Minister ever need to ask the Minister for Finance for permission?  To me, that sounds as if the Minister should also ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport or the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The Minister for Finance has no role in dealing with such detailed regulatory issues.  Why would the Minister need consent from the Minister for Finance before making any change to arrangements or regulations in maintaining the <i>status quo<\/i>in healthcare?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500035#JJ01600","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1551812400,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500035#JJ01700","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1551812400,"counter":472,"content":"<p>Will the Minister answer that question first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500035#JJ01800","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1551812400,"counter":473,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500035#JJ01900","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1551812400,"counter":474,"content":"<p>You want me to ask my question first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500035#JJ02000","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1551812400,"counter":475,"content":"<p>It is up to the Deputy what she wants to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500035#JJ02100","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1551812400,"counter":476,"content":"<p>The previous Deputy said it was a brave thing to say, but I accept it.

That is an important issue.<\/p>  <p>  I have a question about the new information the Minister for Health has given to the House that today the Cabinet approved the memorandum of understanding on the common travel area arrangements between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.  The CTA is about far more than common travel arrangements.  For the first time in the memorandum of understanding there is a codified body of reciprocal rights which in many instances amount to joint citizenship.  They will allow Irish people to work, live, draw social welfare payments, receive full health benefits and vote in the United Kingdom.  There will be the same rights for United Kingdom citizens living here.<\/p><p>It is the anchoring document.  When will we have sight of it?  Now that it has been approved, when will it be signed by the British and Irish Governments and when we will have an opportunity to forensically examine it to see what precisely will be enduring rights for Irish and UK citizens post Brexit? <br\/><br\/>An important point was raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in in regard to the rights to medical cards that arise from EU membership.  I refer in this regard to, for example, seafarers working out of Rosslare Europort.  I take it from what the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has said that on the basis of the memorandum of understanding or on some other basis, UK citizens will continue to be able to access Irish medical cards if they are resident in the Republic of Ireland.  In other words, the <i>status quo<\/i>will continue.<br\/><br\/>I will return to the point I made about the constitutionality of the section in terms of the devolution of powers to the Minister for Health to alter law without reference to the D&aacute;il.  When I made my Second Stage contribution I was assured by the T&aacute;naiste that I would get an explanation in that regard.  I regret I got no explanation from the T&aacute;naiste in his closing comments, other than, as I have already put on the record of the House, that the Attorney General is satisfied.  I have been privileged to serve in a number of Governments.  I remember being told by one Attorney General that something could not happen and being told by a successor Attorney General that it could.  The opinion of a law officer of the State is just an opinion and it is challengeable.  I want to ensure that what we are doing is robust.<br\/><br\/>I take more comfort in the final comment made by the Minister for Health, which, if expanded on, might provide me with more security.  Am I correct that the Minister for Health is stating he is not seeking to make any primary law but, rather, that he is seeking to preserve what has already been determined by the Oireachtas, which is the <i>status quo<\/i>?  If that is the explanation, it is a more robust explanation.  It also is a limiting power.  In changed circumstances, it would not be replicating the <i>status quo<\/i>.  How do we deal in the future with changes that did not transpose what is happening now but were making something new, because of new circumstances?  I believe Deputy Donnelly circled around this issue.  If the constitutionality is explained as preserving what is already passed by the Oireachtas, then nothing new in changed circumstances could be done by the Minister for Health without reference to the House.  Am I correct in my understanding in this regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500035#JJ02700","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551813000,"counter":483,"content":"<p>Following on from the questions put by colleagues, I have a couple of specific questions for the Minister, Deputy Harris.  Access to healthcare across the Border in Northern Ireland or in Britain is seamless at present because we are all  members of the European Union and there are common travel area rights in regard to healthcare.  My understanding is that these rights apply to only Irish and UK citizens.  There are many EU citizens living here who are married to Irish citizens.  Will they be able to avail of the common travel area healthcare provisions of which they can currently avail?  What is the situation in regard to posted workers?  This is another area that needs clarification.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Harris, said in regard to the treatment abroad scheme, the European health insurance card scheme and the cross-Border health care directive that there will be a seamless transition beyond 29 March.  Will he clarify that this remains the position and that it applies not only to Irish and British citizens but to all people legally resident here and EU citizens?  Will he also clarify what the position will be on 1 January 2021, which is just 21 months away?  I ask the latter question on behalf of people who are currently accessing healthcare in the UK for whom ongoing treatment will be required.  For example, a young person receiving treatment in the UK for scoliosis will be returning to the UK for a number of years to access that service, well beyond 31 December 2020.  People currently engaged with the health service in the UK need reassurance that they can continue to access that service beyond 31 December 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  My final question is related to the cross-Border health directive in terms of liability to the HSE and the treatment abroad scheme in terms of liability to Irish and EU citizens resident here.  Currently, the HSE reimburses the health service in the UK for the cost of surgery under the cross-Border health directive.  It also reimburses EU citizens legally resident here in respect of treatment in Northern Ireland or the UK under the treatment abroad scheme.  These costs are based on the public system in the UK.  As we are all citizens from within the European Union, the billing is based on the public cost of the service, as it would be for a British citizen.  Post Brexit on 29 March 2019 or 31 December 2020, this might no longer be the position.  Will those hospitals continue to bill Irish and EU citizens resident in Ireland as they currently do, which is on the public hospital system basis, or will they charge them as overseas citizens?  If so, the cost would be prohibitive.  In practical terms, it would mean that people would no longer be able to access those services because they would not be able to make up the differential in terms of financial cost.  It would put a huge financial burden on the HSE in regard to the cross-Border health directive as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500036#KK00200","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1551813000,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I would like to respond to Deputy Howlin because he did ask me the question directly, following which I sought clarity on it.  I will set out my understanding as to why this is not the issue the Deputy thinks it may be, legally.  The proposed new section states:<\/p><blockquote>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, make such order or orders as he or she considers necessary to continue in being [which is the same as they are today] or carry out any reciprocal or other arrangements in relation to health services which were in operation between the State and the United Kingdom immediately before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from membership of the European Union.<\/blockquote><p>The powers in the provision relate to continuing into being beyond Brexit or maintaining services that were in place before the UK left the European Union.  The distinction that we need to make is that it is about a Minister for Health introducing orders to maintain existing services beyond Brexit, not to add new powers or extra services beyond what is in place on the day that the UK leaves, which is why I do not think there is a constitutional issue.  My understanding, based on the Attorney General's advice I received when I asked about the matter after the Deputy raised it, is that the purpose is to maintain existing services and pass the orders necessary to do that in a post-Brexit environment, where there is no deal and, therefore, no arrangements to facilitate the existing services to remain intact.<br\/><br\/>That is my understanding of the basis of the Attorney General's advice and I hope it gives the Deputy some reassurance.  I can understand why maintaining the <i>status quo <\/i>does not involve any precedent, such as Henry VIII clauses or whatever.  We are not introducing new laws to provide new services without going through the normal procedure to pass legislation.  Rather, we are giving the Minister the power to introduce orders to maintain existing services in a no-deal, chaotic Brexit situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500036#KK00300","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551813600,"counter":486,"content":"<p>That is also my understanding.

Although I take the Deputy's point, some of the examples that he used are probably not issues for the Minister of the day.  For example, the delisting of a drug would be a matter for the Health Products Regulatory Authority, while the changes of qualifications would be a matter for the independent regulatory bodies.  The issues that I or any of my successors will deal with will be issues that will ultimately result in various charges on the State or the issue of reimbursement, hence the involvement of the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform.  While I note the Deputy's concern about the wording of the Bill, I am reluctant to deviate in the light of the legal advice.<\/p><p>On Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's question about abortion and women from Northern Ireland, it was not my decision not to discuss the issue in the House but rather the amendment was ruled out of order.  I have frequently discussed the matter on the floor of the House, usually with Deputy O'Reilly, and I am happy to do so again.  Separate to the Bill, I am seeking the advice of the Attorney General as to how we might address the matter.  I have certainly not given up on addressing the matter in any manner or means but, according to the House, this Bill is not the best vehicle for pursuing it. <\/p><p>My colleague, the T&aacute;naiste answered Deputy Howlin's question.  The Bill is about the Minister of the day having the powers to preserve the <i>status quo<\/i>rather than making new and future arrangements above and beyond that.  The extract from the Bill which the T&aacute;naiste read into the record is clear in that regard.<\/p><p>To respond to the reaction to what I said about cross-Border services continuing, I made the comments because I have listened carefully to many members of the public calling radio programmes and commenting in the media.  In particular, I remember two parents living in Northern Ireland, whose son had his first life-saving heart operation in Crumlin hospital and is due to have another shortly, ask on the radio whether their son will be able to have the operation post Brexit.  I also have heard people from County Donegal ask whether they will be able to go Altnagelvin hospital for their radiotherapy.  I want our patients and citizens to know that the answer is &quot;Yes&quot;.  When I met representatives from the HSE and asked whether they were aware of any cross-Border service in place today that will not be in place post Brexit, their answer was &quot;No&quot;.  That is very different from suggesting that things may not be done in a different way or, as Deputy Donnelly has rightly pointed out, that the reciprocal arrangements we put in place may be different in their modality but the same in their impact on our patients, which is what we are trying to achieve in the Bill.  Where there is an existing service, whether it is in place due to the common travel area or due to European law, the question is how can we ensure that service continues to be provided.  My comments were based on the idea that services provided today will be able to be provided post Brexit.  I do not mean to speak for the British Government but it is its clear and publically articulated position; it is certainly the position of the Irish Government and I know it is the position of all Deputies.  <\/p><p>On Deputy Naughten's questions, the legislation should be seen through the prism of being emergency measures in the context of a no-deal Brexit.  Based on Brexit discussions, one would presume that we will find ourselves in a place where we are having a discussion about future relationships and how the UK interacts with the EU and so on post Brexit.  How future relationships will continue to evolve, therefore, is a question for another day, but these are emergency measures in place to fill any such gap.  The Deputy asked an important question about the cost for the health service of treating a patient, and the answer is that he or she would be treated as though it was the cost for a UK citizen.  We will recognise each other as though we were from the other country, which is an important development.  On the issue of the cross-Border directive and any successors in that regard, I am informed by my officials that it is not done on the basis of citizenship but rather it depends on whether one works in that state or receives a pension in that state.  The Deputy used an example of a Polish person living in Northern Ireland.  If he or she works in Northern Ireland or in the Republic of Ireland, or if he or she is in receipt of a pension in Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland, he or she will qualify.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500037#LL00400","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1551813600,"counter":489,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste helpfully quoted from the new section 75A(1) in Part 2 of the Bill, which, as he noted, concerns maintaining the <i>status quo<\/i>.

In my earlier contribution I flagged my concerns about people who were receiving ongoing treatment for particular conditions.  I referred to the example of a child with scoliosis who was required to go back on a number of occasions to the United Kingdom under the cross-border directive or the treatment abroad scheme.  People need reassurance on the treatment that will take place between now and 31 December 2020.  They need a commitment that they will be able to continue that treatment in the same hospital or medical facility after 1 January 2021.  If we do not provide such certainty, we will undermine the principle behind the Bill.  This emergency legislation is being enacted to ensure that in the event that there is a hard Brexit on 29 March, people will continue to be able to avail of medical services of which they can avail today in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.

As he has said, this is emergency legislation, but I think it is reasonable for him to be required to present a report to the House within three months to clarify the position and ensure continued treatment and support and access to the medical profession in the United Kingdom will be provided in cases which involve ongoing medical procedures which were first accessed in advance of 31 December 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500040#OO01200","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1551814800,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their amendments.  The spirit in which I am approaching this section involves not disagreeing with what they are requesting, while arguing that it should perhaps not be included in the legislation.  With my Government colleagues, I am happy to give a commitment on the floor of the D&aacute;il to provide such important information for it, the health committee or any other appropriate forum within the Oireachtas.  As Deputy Naughten acknowledged, the amendments provided for in the Bill are contingency steps that seek to minimise any disruption to current healthcare arrangements between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Obviously, the post-Brexit relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union will be negotiated beyond these contingency steps.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 22 to 24, inclusive, to which Deputy O'Reilly spoke, impose an obligation on the Minister of the day to publish a review of the effectiveness of the health services one year after the UK has left the European Union.  Although, without wishing to be pedantic, we have a legal concern with words like &quot;effectiveness&quot; in terms of their legal meaning and place in the legislation, I have no difficulty in providing the Deputy with what she is looking for.  I fully agree with the Deputy that it makes sense that we would be providing reports and updates to this House through the appropriate committee as well.  I should reiterate that the objective of the current Bill is the maintenance of existing arrangements in respect of health services currently in operation between the State and the UK rather than an assessment of their effectiveness.  All we are trying to do here, on which I think we are in agreement, is maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>as opposed to analysing the effectiveness of the <i>status quo<\/i>or indeed providing for new measures which we may decide, as an Oireachtas, are desirable to put in place in the future but which would not be covered under this Bill.  This Bill is about preserving the <i>status quo<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Amendment No. 25 from Deputy Naughten seeks to impose an obligation on the Minister to present a report on the continued provision of healthcare services in the UK from 1 January 2021.  It should be noted, however, that if legislation is brought into force, there will be many opportunities for the arrangements provided for under the legislation to be reviewed.  In addition, any arrangements between Ireland and the UK in respect of continued reciprocal access to health services after December 2020 will be subject to ongoing consultation and engagement between those two states once the UK leaves the European Union.  Amendments of this nature can be considered further in that context.  In terms of the review proposed, I can confirm that I am willing to attend the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health.  Deputies know that I enjoy attending it regularly.  I am also willing to arrange for relevant officials to provide briefings at regular intervals and to attend and report as necessary.  I fully agree with the spirit of the amendment although I am not in a position to accept it in this legislation.  I will give a commitment to the House that the Government will provide such reports and information to Deputies at the opportune moments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500040#OO01300","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551815400,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I do not think the amendment I am proposing is too onerous.  It provides for a report to be made to the House.  I am specifically looking at medical conditions that require ongoing treatment.  The objective behind section 8 is to protect the rights people have today to access health services in the UK after the UK leaves the European Union on 29 March.  If the UK leaves the European Union on 29 March, we are providing assurance to people right up to 31 December 2020.  I accept that in the vast majority of cases, that level of clarity will be sufficient.  I accept the Minister's assurances in that respect.  However, where there are particular procedures that will require further surgery down the road, people need reassurance now that access will be continued beyond 31 December 2020 to allow them to access that service next month or the month after.  Clarity needs to be provided.  Otherwise the legislation will undermine its specific objective of providing people with cross-border access in the United Kingdom after 29 March this year.  As a Member of Parliament, I could not advise any family that a child with scoliosis who wants to avail of services in the United Kingdom should avail of those services.  If they require further surgery down the road, they might have to transfer to another jurisdiction.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that the Minister cannot provide this clarity today.  That is why the amendment contains the very flexible provision that the Minister present a report to this House on a specific cohort of conditions and that, if the treatment has started before 31 December 2020, there be an ongoing commitment in respect of the treatment beyond that date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500041#PP00200","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1551815400,"counter":513,"content":"<p>The Minister says he agrees in principle with what I am saying because, clearly, it makes sense.

I am admitting that curtailment in this amendment and giving the Minister 90 days to provide clarity to us.  I do not think it is acceptable for clarity not to be provided within those three months, nor is it acceptable that is it not set out in the legislation that this must be presented to the House so that we can report.  I should be in a position to reassure an individual, or their family, who is availing of a medical procedure in the UK that will require continual ongoing care for more than 22 months that they will be able to avail of it.

The only difference in principle between the two amendments is that I am tabling this on the basis that the report will be presented 90 days after the passage of this legislation, whereas I believe the Sinn F&eacute;in amendments proposes that it is presented after the enactment of the legislation.  Of course, we hope that this legislation is never enacted.  My amendment is different because I believe these supports are urgent and necessary for businesses that are not receiving supports at the minute.  I accept that the Government has done a lot of work in engaging with businesses throughout the country.  I know that is very challenging work.  I have tried to do that myself to encourage businesses to be aware of the impact of Brexit.  I am not talking about those which are directly affected by Brexit but those which might be indirectly affected.  I made the point last week in this House that a company with ten employees or fewer will be supported by the local enterprise board.  However, a company that has ten or more employees which is not exporting and does not have the potential to export has no State mechanism available to support it.  Those types of companies are the bedrock of the business and economic activity in many smaller provincial towns in rural areas.  I can think of quite a number of such companies.  They may be providing services within that local community or providing services throughout the country.  Brexit may indirectly impact upon those companies, yet there is no mechanism in place to support them at the moment.<\/p><p>I am sure the Minister will come back and say that the Government will not support this amendment, even though it is a valid point.  I believe we must accept this amendment.  It is imperative that we take action now, because regardless of whether the 29 March deadline leads to a hard Brexit, we are going to have Brexit within the next 21 months.  These companies need to be prepared for that now.  I accept that the focus until now has been on companies that are trading and that are directly impacted upon by Brexit.  However, the focus must shift urgently to these companies which are the bedrock of rural communities in many parts of the country.  They need a support mechanism.  It is imperative that the Minister tells the House how these businesses will be supported.  I have suggested that the local enterprise boards could have their criteria altered so that they could help and assist those companies.<\/p><p>Another urgently needed support required by local enterprise offices, LEOs, is a specific Brexit support.  Enterprise Ireland has a support mechanism available to help exporting companies.  InterTradeIreland has a support to help businesses which is specifically targeted at Brexit.  However, the LEOs at the minute can offer no support for those companies that may require it in the context of Brexit.  It is not just those companies that are exporting or trading with the UK.  It might be a company that is supporting a business trading with the UK that will be indirectly affected by Brexit.  I do not expect the Minister to be able to provide details on that today, but providing him with 90 days in which to come back to the House to outline how we can support these companies is a very fair and reasonable proposal to put forward.<\/p><p>We urgently need to review the criteria of Enterprise Ireland.  At the moment it is involved in encouraging exporting and supporting businesses that export already or that have the potential to export.  We also need to look at import substitution, especially when our nearest trading partner is going to be outside the European Union.  If we do not look at that, there might be additional costs for businesses and on the Irish economy.  There is an opportunity to support domestic business to fill a potential void in imports that will be coming from a third country post Brexit.  The criteria laid down in the legislation for Enterprise Ireland has to be looked at now.  There is little point in looking at this on 1 January 2021.  Now is the time to do it.<\/p><p>I am asking that this House be presented with a report within 90 days which outlines how we are going to protect, support and grow local businesses that to date have fallen through the support nets we have, and that are outside the local enterprise and Enterprise Ireland criteria.  They might be companies servicing the local economy, the regional economy or the national economy.  They might be companies involved in import substitution, particularly from a third country, which may be the United Kingdom after 31 December 2020 at the latest.  It is important that we do not ignore those companies.  They are the bedrock of the provincial towns and rural economies throughout this country, and they have to be supported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500042#QQ01800","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1551816000,"counter":535,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in will support amendment No. 30 as well as tabling its own amendment No. 31.  These amendments concern the Brexit business supports contained in this Bill.  The supports which will come into effect in the event of a hard crash are the absolute bare minimum.  In fact, they do not even represent the bare minimum of what is necessary to support many businesses.  Exporters are suffering as we speak because of currency fluctuations and due to the strength of the euro against the pound at the moment.  There are certain sectors of the economy, including many manufacturing businesses, as well as exporters, which are also suffering as we speak because of the uncertainty of Brexit.<\/p><p>People are concerned about their jobs.  The agrifood sector needs support and yet there is very little in the Bill.  Rather than tinkering around the edges in respect of research and development, existing supports and increasing the thresholds and the percentages for grants, there is not much by way of real practical additional supports that are necessary for many small and medium-sized businesses.<\/p> <p> The Irish economy is the most exposed after Britain if there is a hard crash.  However, the so-called additional supports presented here are not what the stakeholders are looking for.  We have engaged with IBEC, ISME and the British Irish Chamber of Commerce, all of which have called for a suite of practical measures to be put in place.  However, they are not contained in this section.<\/p> <p> When we got the briefings from the Minister's office and we had officials from different Departments, we were astounded that some of the provisions of this section relating to grant supports were increasing the thresholds to allow the State to maximise the current state aid rules.  We were flabbergasted that for many years, the State was not even availing of the state aid rules that apply.  We were not even applying what was allowed in the state aid rules.  This was happening throughout the post-Celtic tiger years when many businesses were in very severe difficulty.  We were flabbergasted that that was the case.<\/p> <p> We had several discussions with the T&aacute;naiste and Taoiseach on state aid rules and the need for greater flexibility from the European Union for Ireland.  Nothing in the Bill gives any flexibility from Brussels.  We can see no additional flexibility in state aid rules to apply to Ireland that do not apply to countries, such as Hungary and Poland, that will not be as affected by Brexit as Ireland will, which is outrageous.  Europe has been very good in supporting Ireland on the backstop but it has not been as good in supporting the Irish economy and the many Irish SMEs that will need a raft of additional supports in the event of a hard Brexit.<\/p> <p> We also argue that the provisions of this Bill and the additional supports, limited as they are, should come into play irrespective of whether there is a hard crash.  In fact, businesses need them now.  Why are we only providing for these additional supports, which are very weak, in the event of a hard crash?  It misses the point of the uncertainty for these businesses, which might continue for months if there is an extension of Article 50.  Why are these supports not being put in place now?  Our amendments to make that happen were ruled out of order possibly because there was a cost to the Exchequer.  However, the point stands that they should be in place irrespective of a soft or a hard Brexit.  We have consistently made the point that there is no good Brexit, hard or soft.  If it is hard and there is a hard crash, the impact on the economy will be more severe.  Whatever Brexit we eventually have to deal with will have a chilling effect on the Irish economy and we need to be prepared.<\/p> <p> The British Government announced a Brexit stabilisation fund.  Our proposals contained a Brexit stabilisation fund that allowed for additional supports in capital investment, and additional supports for business, a job subsidy scheme and a subsidy fund to support the agrifood sector, and yet the Government has not provided for any fund.  We tabled an amendment in this area to allow the Minister to set up a &euro;2 billion Brexit stabilisation fund with the money coming from the rainy day fund - in both last year and this year &euro;500 million has been put into that fund - and from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  That &euro;2 billion could be put to good use to invest in the economy in terms of capital spend and to give practical supports to businesses.<\/p> <p> A small number of multinational companies avail of the existing research and development credit scheme.  Many small and medium-sized businesses cannot get a look in and are not properly supported.  We have called for that scheme to be streamlined but it is not in the Bill as far as I can see.  The provisions for the Brexit loan scheme where there is some additionality is a bit of a joke when many businesses at the moment are not even taking up that scheme.  There are obviously issues with it.  Has the Minister spoken to the stakeholders such as IBEC, ISME and the businesses which need these supports?  We believe that loan scheme needs to be overhauled.  Before we start tinkering with this scheme, we need to examine why many of the businesses the scheme was designed to support have not taken up the scheme.<\/p> <p> We have also called for an employment subsidy scheme for many micro and small businesses.  It is not a provision in the Bill.  It was put in place after the economic crash to support vulnerable sections of the economy, which had a long-term viability but in the short term may have had to lay off staff because of difficulties.  Many businesses will now experience the same because of Brexit.<\/p> <p> The biggest market distortion to affect some sections in the economy in this State will be Brexit.  In whatever form it takes, it will be an enormous market distortion for many businesses.  The State seems to be taking a minimalist approach in providing state supports and aids.  It is almost as if we believe the market will sort out all of these problems.  The market will not sort out problems.  The Minister is shaking her head, but they are not in the Bill.  The provisions in the Bill are very limited and will have little impact on the many businesses that need support.  If the Minister listened to the business organisations and engaged with them as we would, she would have put much more on the table.<\/p> <p> I again make the point that the British Government made a Brexit stabilisation fund available.  The Irish Government made no such fund available.  It introduced this omnibus Bill with very limited supports for businesses that are concerned about the uncertainty of Brexit and the impact it will have on their businesses.  It is not good enough by any means.  We will be supporting the sections of the Bill.  We will not oppose any of the measures the Government is putting in place.  We would support any additional support, but what the Government has proposed is far too little and far too late.<\/p> <p> As I said at the start of my contribution, why are the provisions of the Bill only being introduced in the event of a hard crash?  Many businesses need those, irrespective of which Brexit they face.  I do not see why these measures are contingent on a hard crash.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500042#QQ01900","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551816600,"counter":537,"content":"<p>As Deputy Cullinane has said, we will be supporting amendments Nos. 30 and 31.<\/p>  <p>  Having read the business, enterprise and innovation section of the Bill, I am underwhelmed by the provisions for business.  I have spoken to many business groups in recent weeks and they are not exactly enthusiastic about it either.  Much more remains to be done on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  However, I welcome the provisions to give more power to Enterprise Ireland to assist Irish businesses exposed to the consequences of Brexit.  In the spirit of approaching this Bill on a cross-party basis, we tabled two constructive amendments in the business section.  Unfortunately one has been ruled out of order, like a lot of the others, but I will outline the aim of the other in a few moments.<\/p>  <p>  A large portion of the business, enterprise and innovation section is dedicated to providing new powers for Enterprise Ireland.  I note that many of these were already planned and contained in the proposed industrial development (miscellaneous provisions) Bill 2017.  These changes for Enterprise Ireland will see the jobs agency being given the power to provide loans to client companies, as opposed to the current situation where they can only offer financial support through direct equity stakes or grants for specific purposes.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland will also be authorised to make research and development grants for research that is, in part, carried out abroad if its purpose is to broaden a firm's export market beyond the UK.  I ask the Minister to provide more clarity on this and give examples of how it would operate.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has been an incredibly successful vehicle for supporting and creating jobs across Ireland, and helping many Irish SMEs to take the leap into exporting.  We hope these additional functions will help Enterprise Ireland build on this success and continue to grow our exports to a wide variety of foreign markets.<\/p>  <p>  I note the Bill aims to expand the caps on state aid that can be given to companies.  It seems this is just raising the limits for what is already permitted under EU law.<\/p><p>If this is the case can the Minister outline why this has not been done so far.<\/p> <p> I wish to ask the Minister about the current Brexit business supports.  The latest figures to date are very dismal with just three weeks to go until Brexit.  Just 81 loans with a value of &euro;17.3 million have been given out under the &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme, a tiny 6% of the total pot.  Only 241 market discovery grants have been approved while one while just 156 Be Prepared grants have been sanctioned.  The Minister will have to admit that this is an incredibly poor uptake is of these Government supports.  These supports are of no help to businesses is if they cannot access them.  There is obviously a problem as to why companies are not accessing these supports which the Minister needs to address.  I have asked the Minister on a number of occasions to review these current supports, to cut down on red tape and to widen the criteria where possible.  Has the Minister done any of those things we have asked her to do in the past?  Has the Department and the jobs agencies reviewed their performance of these?  Is there any underlying reason as to why these are not performing? <\/p> <p> I have couple of points also on &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and I appreciate that it does not come under the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, but due to the obvious job-creation role of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in addition to its responsibility for the social cultural development of Gaeltacht regions, the Department must engage with the &uacute;dar&aacute;s extensively.  Jobs in our Gaeltacht areas are incredibly valuable to local communities and we must do all we can to protect current jobs located there and increase the number of businesses setting up in our Gaeltacht regions.  On this basis, can the Minister outline if an examination has been undertaken to explore how exposed &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta client-companies are to Brexit?  Has &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta been contact as to whether it feels it needs any additional powers, such as the new borrowing powers that are being extended to Enterprise Ireland, or additional funds for grants?<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 31, a Sinn F&eacute;in amendment, seeks to instruct the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation to compile a report on the effectiveness of the current Brexit business supports and to present this report to the joint Oireachtas Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  It is clear from the data that the uptake of current Government supports is not working.  Something, as I said earlier, has gone seriously wrong - I mentioned the figures earlier.  This is a shocking and poor uptake of the Government supports.  Business supports may look good in the media and when they are announced at the Minister's press conferences, but they are no help to businesses if they cannot access them.  I have asked the Minister to review the current supports, cut down the red tape and widen criteria where possible.  As far as I am aware this has not happened to date.  If passed, the review mentioned in the amendment would include but not be limited to examining why there has been such a low uptake of these Brexit business supports to date, identify barriers for businesses in accessing these supports and offer solutions on how to make it easier for businesses to benefit from these supports.<\/p> <p> I ask the House to support this amendment which I will press.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500043#RR00200","speaker":"1327","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551817200,"counter":539,"content":"<p>In addressing the amendments, I commissioned a wide-ranging review of the OECD on SME and entrepreneurship policies in March 2018.  Part of this extensive review is examining the provision of supports for indigenous businesses and how they are assisted by Government Departments and agencies to grow.  This report will examine the strategic framework and delivery system for SMEs and entrepreneurship policy in Ireland.  The report will be published, for Deputy Naughten's information, in the third quarter of this year and we will await its findings and recommendations.  I want to reassure the Deputy also that I am focusing on indigenous Irish companies and am very conscious that they also need to be supported on Brexit.<\/p><p>For that reason I take this opportunity to list the supports for non-exporting businesses.  First, there is the Brexit loan scheme which is open to all businesses.  It is a working capital facility that is available at an interest rate of 4%, repayable over three years.  InterTradeIreland has a &euro;2,250 Start to Plan voucher and one does not need to be an exporter to get this, but can be an indigenous Irish company.  Regardless of the number of employees the company has it can apply for it.  Yesterday, I launched the Start to Act voucher which is available through Enterprise Ireland which has a value of &euro;5,650.  InterTradeIreland has also received an additional &euro;1 million from my Department in budget 2019, which was without the need for matching funding from Northern Ireland, because I knew that there was going to be an increased demand for its services in view of Brexit.  For that reason it received an increase of 17% in its budget.  It also has a complete suite of advisory services that are available to everybody, be it a tariff checker, or online customs training for those that are importing which can be availed of from InterTradeIreland which is providing a broad range of services.<\/p><p>The local enterprise offices are also marketing the InterTradeIreland schemes.  This is available across the board, there is customs training, mentoring and business planning.  They give out consultancy grants, with no limit as to employees, to companies of whatever size.  They have lien grants and innovation supports through vouchers etc.  All of the supports are available through local enterprise offices, regardless of the number of employees a company has or as to whether they are exporting or not.For that reason I increased the budget to local enterprise offices by &euro;5 million in budget 2019, a 22% increase, to help them exactly what the Deputy said, namely, indigenous Irish companies.<\/p><p>There is also Microfinance Ireland which has &euro;25,000 available for lending to SMEs and the credit guarantee scheme.  There are a lot of supports available to indigenous Irish SMEs which are not exporting and I want to make them aware of these again and I thank the Deputy for raising this issue because no matter how many times this is said, people may not be aware of the supports that are available.<\/p><p>The Deputy&rsquo;s premise as to the take-up of the Brexit supports is not correct.  In fact, my information is that take up has been quite robust.  The Brexit loan scheme was launched in 2018 and I am pleased to say that there has been a steady stream of applications so far.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, has received 462 applications under the Brexit loan scheme up to 22 February 2019.  Some 413 of those applications have been deemed eligible for a loan under the scheme, and of those, 81 have been progressed to sanction at finance-provider level to a total value of &euro;17.32 million.  It is important to remember that this scheme is not a loan for businesses to carry on as usual.  We are asking businesses to consider carefully what they need to do to address successfully their Brexit challenge through innovating, changing or adapting their business model in some capacity.  These responses may include strengthening their product offerings, developing new markets to diversify their trade footprint, changing their organisational structure or developing new capabilities.  Work continues on the longer-term future growth loan scheme, which will help eligible businesses invest strategically in a post-Brexit environment.  This scheme was announced as part of budget 2019 and is expected to launch very shortly.  In 2018, Enterprise Ireland provided approval for funding of &euro;74 million to 535 Brexit-exposed companies across a range of Brexit financial supports.  In addition, there were Brexit interventions with over 1,000 companies which have significant exports to the UK.  Over 1,000 companies have attended Brexit advisory clinics across the country, and 4,400 companies have completed the Brexit SME scorecard, and almost 1,000 have completed the Enterprise Ireland online customs insights programme since December.  Visits to the<i>prepareforbrexit.ie<\/i>website, which contains information on a range of Enterprise Ireland, local enterprise offices, LEO, and other agency supports, has increased ten-fold over the past 12 weeks and we have reached 90% of the SME audience with our Brexit supports communications.  My Department has also allocated &euro;8 million extra for Brexit staffing and supports across enterprise and regulatory agencies, the roll-out of new customs training through local enterprise offices and Enterprise Ireland, an Enterprise Ireland guide to best practice on managing currency volatility - the Deputy mentioned about customers needing to hedge their currency risk - and &euro;1 million in additional funding for lnterTradelreland.<\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>All of our supports are kept under constant review and we have had no feedback to say there are gaps.  We have dealt with any change that has been requested.  For example, I regularly meet the business representative bodies.  I have met the retailers and food importers to ensure the security of our food supply.  I also meet all departmental agencies.  A request regarding import VAT of 23% was brought to my attention.  I raised the matter with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, who has made changes in this Bill to address the issue of paying VAT at the point of import.  It would have had significant cashflow implications for businesses, but the change will be of major benefit to them.<\/p> <p> It is not necessary to legislate for a review of these supports.  We review them constantly to determine whether there are gaps.<\/p> <p> Regarding the Brexit stabilisation fund, we achieved agreement with the European Commission last week on increasing the rescue and restructuring safety net for SMEs to &euro;200 million.  We have close engagement with the Commissioner.  She is well aware of the challenges facing this country and has assured us that the Commission will do everything it can to assist us.<\/p> <p> I have covered most of the issues raised.  For the reasons outlined, I cannot support these amendments.  It is not necessary to insert in legislation the requirement to carry out a review.  We work with all of the bodies involved and I meet businesses on a daily basis.  For example, I attended an InterTradeIreland event yesterday.  A large number of businesses were there.  They are availing of the many supports that exist.  I encourage people who have not yet engaged to do so.  The Government is here to help and we want to help businesses in preparing for Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500044#SS00200","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551817800,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I ask Deputies to observe the clock.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500045#TT00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1551817800,"counter":542,"content":"<p>The Minister's response was underwhelming.

She stated that 430 companies had applied and 81 had been successful and would benefit.  Only 430 companies have applied.  What about those that have not?  Businesses tell us that they cannot engage with the scheme because it is too cumbersome and needs to be overhauled.  The Government has not dealt with that issue.  Only 81 out of the 430 have progressed to the point of being able to avail of the scheme.  That is not enough.<\/p>  <p>  I can see nothing in this Bill for the agrifood sector apart from what is available for everyone else.  There are no bespoke supports for it.<\/p>  <p>  I am flabbergasted that we have debated supports for the SME sector and there has been no contribution whatsoever from Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is obvious that Fianna F&aacute;il believes that the Government is doing a great job in supporting SMEs and that, if there is a hard crash, everything the Government is putting in place will be enough.  Many SMEs will be disgusted that one of the larger political parties has offered no contribution to this debate on the additional supports that business requires.  It is a dereliction of responsibility by Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  That party might be keeping the Minister in her job, but she is the one responsible for putting in place a suite of measures for businesses.  She has missed the point entirely.  She rattled off the supports that were in place.  I have already conceded that they are in place - we do not believe they are enough or adequate - but the additional supports being sought all have to do with a hard crash.  She is missing that point.  Businesses, in particular exporting SMEs that are most exposed because they have a strong trading relationship with Britain, need these supports now irrespective of a hard crash, yet the Minister is fiddling around the edges of most of these proposals without making substantive changes and is saying that these will only apply if there is a hard crash.  Wake up and smell the reality.  There are businesses that need these additional supports now.<\/p>  <p>  No one wants to see a hard crash and I still believe it is unlikely, but if there is a hard crash, many businesses will be very exposed.  They will be disappointed and sore that this is the best the Government can do.  It is deeply ideological.  It is Fine Gael once again saying that the market should solve these problems and interventions by the State should be as limited as possible.  That is the problem.  The Government does not see that the mammoth challenges facing the economy and businesses need State interventions and supports of a greater scale than the minimalist one it is proposing.<\/p>  <p>  We will press the amendment to a vote and will view it as a vote of no confidence in the Government's support for business, which is what these amendments are concerned with.  Much more needs to be done.  The Minister does not realise that.  If she believes that, by attending an InterTradeIreland event and speaking to a small number of businesses, everything is hunky dory, it is not.  There are businesses that are struggling because of Brexit.  When we meet them, they tell us that the Government is not doing enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500045#TT00700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1551817800,"counter":547,"content":"<p>If I was not sure about pressing amendment No. 31 before, I am sure after the Minister's response.

Just 81 loans with a value of &euro;17.3 million have been given out under the &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme.  That is 6%.  People might be aware that the loan exists, but they are coming away from the events - I have attended a number of them and some have been quite good - still confused and unable to access the loan.

I have outlined to the Minister why we need this amendment.  Local enterprise offices are calling for its provisions.  They have met the Minister.  They want to be able to support businesses of over ten employees.  They want to be able to support companies that do not fall under the Enterprise Ireland criteria.<\/p><p>That is the reality of it.  These businesses will struggle.  At the moment, all of the focus is on a hard Brexit in 24 days and, with all due respect, the Government had to focus on that.  I fully accept that it had to focus on exporters and importers but regardless of whether it is a soft or a hard Brexit, within 21 months we will have Brexit in Ireland.  This will not just impact on importers and exporters but also on small businesses throughout this country.  They are not exporters because they do not have the opportunity to export but they are creating a lot of jobs in provincial towns and rural Ireland.  However, they do not fall under any of the support criteria in place at the moment.  We need to broaden the definition of the supports that are available through the local enterprise offices, LEOs.  The LEOs themselves want to be able to assist these companies.  We also need to broaden the definition of support provided by Enterprise Ireland, not just focusing on exports but also on import substitution, particularly when our nearest neighbour is going to be a third country.  This will open up opportunities for import substitution and will allow Irish companies to fill that void.<\/p> <p> The Minister made reference to a review report in quarter three of this year but to me, that is live horse, and get grass.  These companies cannot wait that length of time.  That is why I have laid out in my amendment that the report would be presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann within 90 days, regardless of whether we have a hard or a soft Brexit.  The report should detail how we can support the non-exporting indigenous local businesses that are the backbone and bedrock of employment throughout this country.  These companies must be supported but there is a gap in the system.  As a State, we must put the mechanisms in place to support those companies in the context of Brexit.  Regardless of whether it is in 24 days or 21 months, Brexit is happening and these companies need support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500045#TT00900","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551818400,"counter":550,"content":"<p>There are many supports available to non-exporting indigenous businesses, some of which I listed.

While it could be argued that the non-exporting indigenous sector may not be immediately impacted by Brexit because it is not exporting, there is no doubt that there could be negative knock-on effects from a slowdown in the economy or a squeeze on credit, for example.  In that context, the proposal by Deputy Naughten has merit.  We are unsure and we must take imaginative steps to assess the potential impacts of Brexit in the time ahead.  The Deputy's provision of a 90-day limit would bring a sense of urgency to the process undertaken by the agency tasked with carrying out the assessment of the non-exporting indigenous sector to see if there are pinch points affecting it.  Credit and cashflow are issues in that regard.  We have consistently said that small and medium businesses have serious difficulties in accessing funding from the pillar banks.  Some companies may need cashflow carry over in terms of inventory, stock and so on, but the banks are very reticent about lending to the SME sector.  In that context, there is a lot of merit in Deputy Naughten's proposal and I urge the Minister to give it serious consideration, especially as it does not do anything materially to undermine the legislation's aim of ensuring that there is a legislative bulwark against a hard Brexit.<\/p><p>Regardless of what type of Brexit transpires, it will have an impact.  As the Taoiseach said, Brexit of whatever type is a lose, lose, lose.  Who gains from Brexit?  Nobody gains and in that context, even the indigenous, non-exporting sector could find itself in real difficulty.  I urge the Minister to give the proposal serious consideration.  Beyond that, there is the fact that Enterprise Ireland is statutorily charged with dealing with companies that are exporting and which have more than a certain number of employees.  There is a gap there in terms of indigenous non-exporting companies that may want to put out feelers <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>international markets.  They may want to take that next step but there is a shortage of policy and supports in that area to enable those in the non-exporting indigenous sector to move into the exporting sector.  It is a daunting task and while I know that toolboxes are available for assessing export markets and so on, it is still a big leap for smaller companies.  This is an area that the Department should keep an eye on, given that these companies are the backbone of our economy.

We are providing nothing that any other member state in the EU cannot provide to its businesses, even though Ireland is deeply exposed as an economy.  Europe needs to step up to the plate.  I welcome the &euro;200 million rescue and restructuring fund but I ask the Minister, please, not to insult businesses by saying that businesses who go to clinics and fill out scorecards are being properly supported.  There is a whole raft of additional supports they need which they are not getting.  These businesses are experiencing real uncertainty and real challenges.  It is not every sector of the economy.  Some sectors are more exposed than others.  I challenge the Minister to read Sinn F&eacute;in's proposals and not just mine.  I suggest she read the proposals submitted to all parties by the British Irish Chamber of Commerce, ISME, and by IBEC.  The Minister should fact-check those proposals and evaluate them against what the Government does.  She will see very quickly that the Government is falling short despite what she is saying, despite her spin and despite the bluster of her responses.  It does not stack up with reality at all.

The EU fluorinated greenhouse gas regulation No. 517\/2014 requires people and companies working on fluorinated greenhouse gases, F gases, equipment to be certified.  The type of equipment involved includes electrical switch machinery, fire suppression, solvents, refrigeration, air conditioning, heat pumps and motor vehicles.  People and companies working on this in a range of areas are required to be certified.  Traditionally, both individuals and companies have been certified in the UK by the competent authorities' certification bodies in the UK.  The reason we are introducing this amendment is that we were advised by the Attorney General that it would be optimal to have primary legislation to provide for the form of recognition for these UK certified individuals and companies rather than leave it to secondary legislation.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 32 inserts the new Chapter 1 into the Bill.  Amendment No. 33 provides the various definitions.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 34 provides that an individual who immediately before the relevant date holds a valid certificate issued by a certification body in the United Kingdom under Article 5 of the Commission regulation of April 2008 in respect of an activity referred to in Article 1, which are the activities I mentioned earlier relating to refrigeration, air conditioning, heat pumps, motor vehicles, electrical switching and so forth, will be deemed to hold an equivalent certificate which is to be recognised in Ireland under that relevant section.  Subsection (2) of that section provides that persons or companies will be given six months during which they can continue to operate with the UK certificate as recognised, but during that six months they will be required within the first four months to apply to the relevant agency, or the Minister in the case of a company, to get Irish certification.  During the six-month period they must apply within four months and the agency, which in this case will be the EPA, will issue a certificate to them validating and providing an Irish certificate within six months.<\/p><p>It is more restricted in the case of a company.  This is in the area of refrigeration and fire suppressants.  In their case the same rules will apply about the equivalency of a certificate from the UK.  The companies will also have six months during which they can continue to operate, and during that period they will have four months within which to apply.  They apply to the Minister for certification.  They will also be required, as is the case under the present arrangement, to seek annual renewal from the Minister each year.  That is the current recognised approach.  The reason the Minister is the person to whom the application is made is that currently this type of vetting of certification is assigned to a private entity.  It is up to the Minister to work out the contractual arrangements with that private entity, which will carry out the necessary vetting of applicants.<\/p><p>This is a legislative measure to get over a gap in mutual recognition.  Currently, there is mutual recognition of certificates within the EU so a UK certificate is valid throughout the EU.  However, if the UK crashes out of the EU and the certificates cease to be recognised under mutual recognition, we must put this provision in place to ensure that people working in these important areas have the necessary certification and that the public have that assurance with regard to those who will be doing that type of work.<\/p><p>I commend the amendments to the

Schedule 1A of Electricity Regulation Act 1999<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>9. <\/b>Schedule 1A to the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 is amended by the insertion of the following new paragraph after paragraph 17:<blockquote>&ldquo;18. The SEM Committee will be cognisant of ensuring regulatory alignment to protect the single electricity market and will report to the Minister on actions taken with relevant bodies in other jurisdictions and aim to maintain the single electricity market.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>The amendment is straightforward and inserts a new paragraph regarding the single electricity market, SEM, committee.  We consider this very important.  It is the only area in the Bill that is truly all-Ireland.  We have discussed many times the benefits of the all-Ireland economy and particularly the single electricity market which was established under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  In a post-Brexit situation it is important that the single electricity market is maintained if the benefits are to continue for householders and businesses North and South and, indeed, for the environment.<\/p><p>The amendment seeks to amend the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  The SEM committee was established under this Act.  It is an all-Ireland body, with representatives from the regulator in Belfast, appointed by the regulator in Belfast, and representatives from the regulator in Dublin, which oversees the functioning of the all-Ireland electricity market that has been in place for over a decade.  Nobody would argue that it has not been a success story.  It has been of great benefit for both the North and the South, but particularly for the North in terms of the supply of electricity.<\/p><p>The amendment provides that, in the event of a hard Brexit, the single electricity market committee, of which three members are appointed by the Minister, will deal with the new regulatory circumstances that will exist and will attempt to ensure regulatory alignment on the island.  The new market rules for the integrated single electricity market, I-SEM, were launched last year.  It is reported that they could cut energy bills for businesses and householders by up to &euro;200 million per annum, which is what we all want to move towards given the economy of scale in terms of serving 6.6 million people.  In order to ensure that we retain the single electricity market and all of the benefits it has brought to people, North and South, east and west, we believe this amendment is necessary.  The Minister may say that this amendment is not necessary because the single electricity market committee comprises three people from the North.  As the Minister will be aware, a lot of legislation is being passed here that is predicated on similar legislation being passed in Britain or by the Assembly, when up and running again, but we believe this needs to happen now in preparation for Brexit.<\/p> <p> The Minister and I recently had a discussion in this Chamber on tariffs.  He assured me then that the British Government would do the same as we proposed to do in regard to regulations relating to tariffs.  Many of the actions we are taking are predicated on Britain taking corresponding actions from a legislative point of view.  The intention of this proposal is to retain, maintain and strengthen the single electricity market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500049#XX01200","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551820500,"counter":588,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the amendment and for raising the issue of the single electricity market.  As he outlined, we had a useful debate on the issue in committee and the House recognised the importance and value of the single electricity market.  It is an all-island market that works satisfactorily.  It has brought significant savings, North and South, and it is a market that will continue in a jointly-operated single market with one transmission system even after a British exit.  The single electricity market has been very valuable.  It was set up with legislation, North and South.  The single electricity market committee comprises the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and the Utility Regulator of the North and it is independent under law.  It does not report to the Minister.  Rather, it reports directly to the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons it is not appropriate to accept this amendment.  In the first instance, I am satisfied that the single electricity market committee has all the powers it needs.  In the case of the CRU, these powers are set out in our Acts and there obviously is legislation underpinning the Utility Regulator in Northern Ireland.  The Oireachtas cannot legislate unilaterally for the operation, North and South.  It is beyond our jurisdiction to be seeking to legislation for the operation of bodies although they participate in the single electricity market committee.  We are confident that it will continue to be jointly operated and that there is great support for it not only the North and the South but in the UK and the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  This amendment is not necessary in the first instance.  It would be inappropriate to seek to have an independent regulator report to the Minister.  Under existing legislation, independent bodies report to the Oireachtas.  It is open to the Oireachtas committee to call in the CRU at any time if it wants assurances about the continuing alignment and operation of the single electricity market.  I am satisfied that the amendment, although tabled with the best of intentions, would not be an appropriate amendment to put into this legislation.  I am also satisfied that if the committee wants to receive reassurances from the CRU as events develop, it will be in a position to report.  We have just passed amendments giving additional powers to the CRU to modify licences in the event of anyone exercising market power that would serve to disrupt the operation of the markets.  This is a purely precautionary power but it is one that the regulators wanted because they did not want to have to wait up to ten months to modify a licence.  This power has been provided but it will be very much restricted in use to respect the operation of this market.  It is a power in reserve for the CRU should it be necessary.<\/p>  <p>  I regret that I am not in a position to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500050#YY00200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1551820500,"counter":589,"content":"<p>I note the reasons the Minister has outlined for not being able to accept the amendment but there are a couple of things I would like to point out to him.  This is essential to the provision of power on this island regardless of what type of Brexit happens, but particularly if it is a hard Brexit.  This is not something that can be left to chance.  On the issue of what way this would go down north of the Border, I do not see anybody there objecting to this because their electricity supply is on a knife edge.  There are times when they do not have sufficient electricity.  My information is that they are dependent on electricity from the Twenty-six Counties.  As we move further away from fossil fuels, their position will be weakened further and they will very dependant on power from the Twenty-six Counties.  I would argue that this is an important all-Ireland measure.<\/p>  <p>  I take on board some of the points made by the Minister but I reiterate that a lot of what we are doing on Brexit is predicated on the British Government or, possibly, a future Northern Ireland Assembly, taking similar legislation actions and putting similar regulations in place.  This is another necessary measure.  If the Minister is concerned about this proposal being overreaching in terms of what can be done north of the Border but he is open to reflecting on and tweaking the amendment to provide for what can be done in this State and to bringing it forward on Committee Stage in the Seanad, that is fair enough.  If not, I will be pressing the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500050#YY00300","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1551820500,"counter":590,"content":"<p>The regulation for the single electricity market is based on legislation, North and South.<\/p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>It is not based unilaterally on legislation provided by the Oireachtas and, therefore, we cannot unilaterally introduce changes to the legislation that underpins this, which is what the Deputy seeks to do.  He wants the Oireachtas to bind the operation of the committee, which has parent legislation both North and South, but that is not in accord with legislation.  I think he knows and recognises that we cannot start legislating in the House for the operation of another jurisdiction and it would be very incorrect for us to seek to do so.<\/p> <p> In the second instance, it is important to emphasise the independence of regulators both North and South who participate in the committee.  They are not answerable to the Minister and, as required under EU legislation, they cannot be answerable to a Minister, which we are very conscious of.  EU Directive 2009\/72\/EC stipulates that member states must guarantee the independence of their national regulatory authorities, which is what we are doing in the Bill.  The provision in the Deputy's amendment, where he seeks to make the single electricity market report to the Minister, is inappropriate and not in accordance with European law.  I reiterate that, as members of the Oireachtas joint committee, Deputy Stanley and other Deputies have the power, correctly exercised, to summon the regulator to assure the committee of the continuing operation of the market.<\/p> <p> We are confident that the regulation of the single electricity market, as overseen by the single electricity market committee, is appropriately structured, has the necessary powers and does not need additional powers.  It can oversee the operation of the market and is determined to do so.  It operates as a single market with a single transmission system and, therefore, it is not a question of cross-Border trading.  It is treated as a single market and is one of the few areas where we have a fully integrated market, operating jointly with joint oversight by regulators North and South.  If the Deputy presses an amendment that is neither legally robust nor adds any protection, it will be inappropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500050#YY00400","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551821100,"counter":592,"content":"<p>Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500051#ZZ00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1551821100,"counter":593,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500051#ZZ00300","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"vote","time":1551821400,"counter":594,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 19; N\u00edl, 74; Staon, 0.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Brian Stanley and Denise Mitchell; N\u00edl, Deputies Se\u00e1n Kyne and Tony McLoughlin.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500052#AAA00050","aye":["1252","1361","1279","1306","1258","1303","1317","1345","1242","1362","1333","1280","1302","1287","1305","1366","1327","1367","1232"],"nay":["1368","1246","1321","1272","1310","1354","1293","1369","1220","1307","1225","1350","1335","1241","1273","1255","1263","1221","1339","1286","1298","1364","1268","1338","1436","1292","1274","1356","1322","1264","1300","1214","1233","1216","1251","1237","1249","1365","1229","1314","1323","1240","1243","1337","1359","1223","1290","1343","1247","1284","1262","1295","1342","1234","1315","1328","1326","1296","1297","1227","1267","1329","1257","1291","1265","1231","1334","1304","1213","1344","1270","1277","1250","1358"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551821400,"counter":595,"content":"<p>Sections 9 to 13, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551822000,"counter":596,"content":"<p>SECTION 14<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1551822000,"counter":597,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 37 to 40, inclusive, are related and will be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500053#BBB00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1551822000,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 37:<\/p><blockquote>In page 21, line 31, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><p>I am speaking to amendment No. 38 which we discussed briefly at the Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  I spoke about it last week when we were discussing Brexit in this Chamber.  The amendment proposes: &quot;That the Minister may establish a specific section within the student support scheme of SUSI to address all potential post Brexit queries from students&quot;.  The reasoning behind this is that if this Bill is intended to deal with a no-deal or crash-out Brexit, which nobody wants to see, it is extremely important that within Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, there is a special branch to deal with all the potential queries.  I foresee many difficulties in this area.  We are being told students are protected, there will be no changes and it will all be okay but I can envisage students telephoning SUSI and maybe getting a different answer.  I mean no disrespect to SUSI but that is the way these things sometimes go.  The amendment would allay many fears.  It is not a very big request and it would be very positive for students and their parents to know that they would have a specific line where they could get all the relevant information. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500053#BBB00300","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1551822000,"counter":599,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 37 proposes to change the word \"may\" to \"shall\".  This would allow the Minister to render people from the North and Britain eligible for the student support scheme, equivalent to EU students.  Our party represents people in the North and people in Britain will be concerned about what level of access they will have to educational services.  Can the Minister for Education and Skills explain why the word \"may\" is in the Bill and not \"shall\"?  We believe this is a reasonable and necessary amendment to ensure guaranteed access.  The Minister, however, might be able to address my concerns about why it is \"may\".  I support Deputy Funchion's amendment No. 38 too because none of us knows exactly what will happen in a hard crash and SUSI already faces challenges with queries and processing grants.  For years there have been delays in processing grants.  We do not want a backlog to develop because of an avalanche of queries from people in the North and Britain.  It makes sense to set up a new administrative office to deal with the queries.  I support amendments Nos. 37 and 38.<\/p>  <p>  Not wishing to be in any way confrontational, the Ministers who have spoken previously have been very helpful - maybe not in supporting amendments - and they have accepted some amendments and the spirit of others.  I could be wrong but my understanding is that the Minister will support Fianna F&aacute;il's amendments Nos. 39 and 40 but will oppose Sinn F&eacute;in's amendments Nos. 37 and 38.  I am not sure if that is an outworking of the confidence and supply agreement or some backroom deal that was done with Fianna F&aacute;il but all amendments should be considered and supported or not on their merits.

I acknowledge that.  The fact that there is uncertainty about the position of the State after that is damaging.  It is saying that our doors are closed.  As Deputy Cullinane said, this is predicated on a no-deal Brexit.  We need to be as certain as possible that, regardless of what happens, the free movement of students, North and South, east and west, continues and that we in this House do what we can to ensure that.  We cannot control everything.  We cannot control what the British are doing but I hope if this amendment is accepted by the House that there would be ongoing reciprocity on this.  Perhaps the Minister could set out what discussions he has had on this issue with his British counterpart and with parties in the North.  <\/p>  <p>  If amendment No. 39 is accepted, I am not sure about amendment No. 40.  I will consider that when I hear what the Minister says.  It is really a belt and braces approach and I do not want to put extra work on civil servants in respect of producing reports, if that is unnecessary.  It is important to give that certainty in legislation and do something practical for students from the North and from Great Britain.  I accept that the details would have to be worked out by the Minister but if this amendment is agreed to at least we can say definitively to students from the North and from Britain that they can come here to study on the same basis as they have always done here.  We have done it in respect of SUSI grants and now we are doing in respect of fees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500053#BBB00500","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1551822000,"counter":601,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis na Teachta&iacute; f&aacute; choinne seans a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an reachta&iacute;ocht seo agus ar son na leasuithe.  I welcome the contribution of my colleagues to this debate and acknowledge the time they have devoted to this.  I have considered the four amendments objectively, as have the officials in the Department, and there is a spirit in amendments.  I know what Deputy Funchion is trying to do in amendment No. 38 and I acknowledge the fact she is looking for equal treatment, which is something I am very conscious of too.  Whether a student is from Ballaghaderreen or Bangor, he or she will be treated equally as far as I am concerned.  I know that the services and help provided by SUSI are available whether the matters are Brexit-related, Northern Ireland-related, Welsh-related, Scottish-related or English-related and that they are all treated as priorities.<\/p><p>The purpose of my proposed amendment to section 14 of the 2011 Act is to allow the Minister to prescribe classes of persons after a detailed evaluation of factors has been assessed.  The proposed new section 14A.(1) will give the Minister the power, where he or she &quot;is satisfied to do so&quot;, to prescribe a class of person after he has &quot;consulted with the Higher Education Authority&quot;, secured &quot;the consent of the Minister for Finance&quot; and considered the policies and principles set out in the proposed new section 14A.(2).  The policies and principles in question include matters such as &quot;whether there are reciprocal arrangements in place with the&quot; third country, &quot;the development of skills .... in sectors of the economy&quot;, &quot;the nature and level of the qualification&quot;, the &quot;resources available&quot; and &quot;any other matters which in the opinion of the Minister are proper .... having regard to the objective of enabling persons to attend courses of higher education&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The use of the word &quot;may&quot; in the proposed new section 14A.(1) is appropriate in this context.  The use of the obligatory word &quot;shall&quot; would require the Minister to prescribe every third country which reaches the threshold provided for in the legislation.  Given the cost-increasing nature of any decision to prescribe a new class of person, it would be inappropriate for the Minister to be required to prescribe this in this way.  It would also mean that the Oireachtas would not have a clear line of sight over the potential implications of what we are enacting and to which countries it could apply.  Finally, there would be a clear conflict between the obligatory term &quot;shall&quot; and the governing policies and principles which the Legislature is using to curb the Minister's powers.  The final decision must be in our interests.  The decision on the class of person must rest with the Minister of the day.  It is important to point out that discussions on the common travel area are at a very advanced stage.  This means the arrangements we have today are the arrangements we will have post Brexit, regardless of whether there is a no-deal Brexit or a deal is reached.  The common travel area will override any of this in that instance.<br\/><br\/>Amendment No. 38, in the name of Deputy Funchion, relates to the operational aspects of processing applications for payments delivered by an awarding authority such as SUSI, which is a business unit of the City of Dublin Education and Training Board.  It is a memorandum of understanding.  It is not underpinned by legislation.  It is a service level agreement.  There is already provision within the Student Support Act 2011 for SUSI to outsource certain functions.  In this regard, the City of Dublin Education and Training Board has engaged the services of an outsourced provider, Abtran, which provides a call centre and document management services for SUSI.  If the need arises, it will be possible to increase the resources provided by this company to meet any potential peak in demand.  In addition, SUSI's staffing model provides a certain degree of flexibility regarding the recruitment of temporary staff to meet peak demands during the grant processing season.  If the need arises, it will be open to SUSI management to reallocate resources to meet its operational needs.<br\/><br\/>I appreciate that the objective of the amendment is to ensure there are resources which must be in place to deliver very clear messages to all applicants for SUSI supports, and specifically for those who are seeking to study in the UK or UK citizens who are seeking to study in Ireland.  I agree fully with this.  I am particularly conscious that any changes in the area of student finance can lead to uncertainty.  Clearly, I want to avoid that.  My Department will continue to consult SUSI to ensure adequate resources are in place to deal effectively with the level of queries that may arise from students who feel they will be affected by Brexit.  As I said earlier, the option remains to adjust resources if required.  If there is any weakness with regard to the equal treatment of the existing arrangements, obviously we have a duty to make sure it does not persist.<br\/><br\/>The Government is very committed to clear and precise communications on all aspects and impacts of Brexit.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade recently updated its content on Brexit, and specifically on the common travel area.  In addition to using its own social media and communications outlets, the Department of Education and Skills will update materials on its website on specific educational issues as they arise.  In seeking to reassure the Deputy, I want to communicate very clearly that Irish students will continue to be eligible for SUSI supports while they study in the UK and in the North, and that Northern and UK students will continue to be eligible for SUSI grants while they study in Irish higher education institutions.  I assure the Deputy that in line with the spirit of the amendment, I take her intervention very seriously.  If there are any weaknesses or shortcomings in this service, or if resources are required to ensure information is provided through a helpline, I have already spoken to my officials and we remain vigilant in that regard.  I have confidence in the services provided by SUSI.  It is already providing a very professional service.  When it was first established - I think it was in 2012 - there were many complications.  Everyone in this House was trying to figure out how it would work.  We are not talking about SUSI as much as we used to because it is providing an absolutely excellent service.  I want to acknowledge it for that.<br\/><br\/>T&aacute; leasuithe Uimh. 39 and 40 curtha chun cinn ag an Teachta Thomas Byrne.  T&aacute; m&eacute; cinnte go mbeidh lean&uacute;nachas i gceist i ndiaidh an common travel area.  Nuair a bheidh an aont&uacute; sin d&eacute;anta, beimid in ann socruithe cinnte maidir leis na blianta i ndiaidh 2020, 2021 agus 2022 a dh&eacute;anamh.

T&aacute; an comhaont&uacute; idir an Bhreatain agus an t&iacute;r seo ar son an common travel area thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach.  T&aacute;imid ag &eacute;ir&iacute; n&iacute;os c&oacute;ngara&iacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.  T&aacute; an comhartha ar deireadh an l&iacute;ne maidir leis an gcomhaont&uacute; foirmi&uacute;il at&aacute; i gceist fosta.<br\/><br\/>I welcome Deputy Thomas Byrne's contribution on leas&uacute; Uimh. 39.  While the SUSI scheme is statutory and is distinct from the free fees initiative, which is an administrative scheme, I acknowledge that the two are inextricably linked and share common eligibility criteria, including residency and nationality criteria.  Amendment No. 39 would have the effect of preserving an entitlement to access the free fees initiative, with UK residency continuing to be counted and UK citizens treated similarly to those in other EEA countries, including Switzerland.  Amendment No. 40 would require the Minister to produce a once-off report at the end of this year on the position of UK or Irish students who are resident in the UK or Northern Ireland regarding the free fees initiative.  Deputy Byrne mentioned the thinking of the officials.  With regard to timing, if it comes at the end of the year, it will be very close to the start of the new academic year in September.  Having said that, it could be argued that neither amendment to the Bill is strictly necessary given that the free fees initiative is administrative in nature.  I recognise that the overriding objective of the amendments is to provide long-term clarity for all concerned.<br\/><br\/>D'ardaigh an Teachta Thomas Byrne an cheist sin sa Teach seo c&uacute;pla m&iacute; &oacute; shin.  Ba mhaith liom c&eacute; chomh tiomanta is at&aacute; s&eacute; i dtaobh an &aacute;bhair seo a aithint.  Nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; i mB&eacute;al Feirste c&uacute;pla m&iacute; &oacute; shin, chas m&eacute; le c&uacute;pla tuismitheoir a bh&iacute; ag iarraidh orm c&eacute;ard a tharl&oacute;idh i m&iacute; Mhe&aacute;n F&oacute;mhair na bliana 2020 n&oacute; 2021.  Glacaim leis go bhfuil lean&uacute;nachas agus cinnteacht thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach.  I have made it clear from the outset that the common travel area will address many of the concerns in the education sector.  This includes the question of SUSI grants and the maintenance of the current EU fees system for Northern Irish and UK students.  Agreements between my Department and the UK Department for Education on these principles, as well as wider policy issues at other levels of education, have been reached.  Discussions are now focusing on framing these agreements within a memorandum of understanding.  I hope that a meeting between the Secretary of State for Education and me will be convened in the next few weeks with a view to signing the memorandum of understanding.  I am also happy to commit to the publication of a report by the end of the year.  Neither amendment is contrary to Government policy.  They reflect our desire to maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>post Brexit.  Given that amendments Nos. 39 and 40 do not conflict with our approach, I intend to propose their acceptance by the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500053#BBB00600","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551822600,"counter":603,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an taca&iacute;ocht &oacute;n Rialtas don d&aacute; leas&uacute; at&aacute; curtha os comhair na D&aacute;la agam.

I am glad that he has done so today and am delighted this will be included in the legislation.  We will support every effort the Minister will make to ensure the continued free flow of students North, South, east and west.  It is something Fianna F&aacute;il has put forward, as have I as education spokesperson.  We would do this anyway and give the commitment.  I felt a longer term commitment was needed on this so that people who are in the UK equivalent of transition year or fifth year now, when they are making their plans, would not be put off coming to this jurisdiction because of this.  I am hoping for and looking forward to hearing of the British reciprocating on this through the Minister's negotiations.  It is very important.<\/p> <p> It is one of the tragedies of Brexit that the young people and students, and those who have been educated, have been denied the exercise of their rights as EU citizens by the Brexit vote.

I take this opportunity to raise the important issue of the insurance green card, which we raised on Second Stage and Committee Stage with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Support, Deputy Ross, and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney.  I understand from a previous response from the Minister that this issue is an EU competency and also that it is a matter for the industry to respond.  The difficulty is that we need assurance that the issue will be addressed for the people affected.  It is not appropriate to simple say it is up to the industry to resolve the matter.  People need to be made aware of the requirements.  What has the Government done to make people aware of them?  We all accept that the insurance green care would be required in the context the UK leaving the EU with a hard crash.  People with motor insurance need to know if their insurance will cover them when they cross the Border into the North or the South.  This is an extremely important issue for people.  While some insurance providers are preparing for this eventuality, are all of them doing so?  We do not want some people to be left high and dry and potentially caught out by this issue.  We need greater clarity.  I am not comforted by the notion that the industry alone should resolve this issue.  While I accept the T&aacute;naiste's assertion that this is an EU competency, there is a responsibility on the State to ensure people are at least made aware of these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500061#KKK00600","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1551826500,"counter":676,"content":"<p>To follow up on the point made by Deputy Cullinane, many people are very angry at the idea that a green card will be required and they will have to hold on their vehicle an international insurance certificate to cross the Lifford Bridge.  People are simply saying they will not do it and there is no way they will be required to have documentation to cross a bridge they have crossed every day of their lives in certain scenarios.<\/p>  <p>  My insurance company emailed all of its policyholders about one and a half months ago telling us we needed to apply for a green card one month in advance of Brexit.  I wanted to know what the process was and whether there would be a charge so I called the company to inform it that Brexit was one month away.  I was told to call back in two weeks.  When I pointed out that the company had emailed its customers telling us all to apply one month in advance of Brexit, the response was that the company did not really know what was happening.  I replied that it should join the rest of us because we did not know what was happening either.  However, it had told policyholders we needed a green card if we wanted to be insured while crossing the Border.  I was told the company would issue green cards to all those who request them after 29 March when it knew better what the position was.  I asked what would happen to me if I was driving in the North on 29 or 30 March as my car could be impounded and I could be in breach of the law.  The company then took my name on the basis that it would try to get a green card out to me beforehand.<\/p>  <p>  Most people in Donegal have very little awareness that this is the position and they are not applying for this insurance green card.  One issue that aspect really annoys me, and one which the T&aacute;naiste or Minister might bring some clarity, is that the website of the Motor Insurers Bureau, the authority in Britain that issues green cards, states clearly that a person does not need a green card for any European jurisdiction.  That position will clearly change after Brexit.  It also states that a green card is not required for Andorra, Serbia and Switzerland which are covered.  As such, there are countries outside the European Union to which the green card does not apply.  We have known for more than two years that Brexit will happen and we knew there was potential for a hard Brexit.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why the issue of drivers being required to carry in their vehicles an international travel document was not resolved beforehand.  This is a very serious issue and it works both ways.  Telling people travelling from the Bogside to Buncrana that they need to carry such a document is anathema to them.  They are not happy with it and they will not accept it.  It is not right.  This is an area on which the Government, particularly the line Department, should receive genuine criticism for not having its homework and preparations done.  This issue should never have arisen given that we can see that drivers in other countries are exempt from the requirement to carry a green card.  We are told this is an industry issue or a matter for the European Commission.  Citizens of many other countries do not need to display the green card.

What is true, as I understand it, is that the European Union can reach a consensus or agreement with the British Government and ourselves that in the event of Brexit, cards will not be required.  In the meantime, tens of thousands of these green cards are being printed and the whole thing is an appalling mess.  I ask that the Minister use his good offices as a matter of urgency seek to ensure that the cards are not required.  I appreciate he might not have that answer by tomorrow.  If the cards are required, I ask that each motor insurance company sends them to every motorist.  That is the only way out of it as I see it.  Either everyone does it or no one does.  In the worst-case scenario, cars will be impounded north of the Border and, in theory, they could be impounded south of it too.  That is something no one wants.

However, that is not surprising.  A couple of weeks ago, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport was before the transport committee and I had never witnessed anything like it.  He knew damn all or had damn all information to impart when we asked him questions.  He was not sure how many green cards would be required or whether there would be a charge for them and he did not know if people would be covered in the event of a crash.  He seemed to be slipped pieces of paper by his officials every time we asked a question.  The most disappointing thing, albeit it was not surprising, was that he had made no effort to seek a dispensation for people living on the island of Ireland.  It would have been one thing if he tried, but he did not even try, which is shocking.  What that has done is contribute to the confusion and uncertainty people are now experiencing.  While 1 March has come and gone, I have not heard of anyone who has applied or even knows how to apply for a green card.  There is uncertainty as to whether on 29 March people can travel the two miles from south Armagh into Louth without a green card.  What is the story there?  The failure of the Minister to seek a dispensation from the EU is horrific when one considers the confusion this will cause and how problematic it will be for people who cross the Border every day.  The very fact of having to carry a green card to prove that one has insurance in one's own godforsaken country is a shame.  No effort was made given the common travel area to negotiate well in advance to have this set aside for the people living on the island of Ireland.

To clarify the position for the House, it is currently the case that cars driven from Ireland to other parts of the European Union are covered by the EU's motor insurance directive.  The directive allows one to drive anywhere within the Single Market while having one's home insurance certificate recognised under the EU system.  If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union on 29 March without a plan or deal, Northern Ireland will no longer be in the European Union and the EU directive will not apply in that jurisdiction.  The insurance industry made it clear some time ago, in the context of its own contingency planning, that to facilitate continued travel by cars from the Republic of Ireland into Northern Ireland, which will be a drive out of the European Union notwithstanding our dislike of that fact, proof of insurance cover will have to be provided.  A green card, which is slightly unfortunately named in the context, will provide that proof of insurance cover where a car has driven from the Republic into Northern Ireland and is stopped.  It is not that people will be stopped on the Border to allow green cards to be checked and it should not be painted as that.<\/p>  <p>  While there is a way to resolve this issue, Ireland cannot do it on its own.  The European Commission must resolve the matter on a bilateral and reciprocal basis with the UK.  The reason the UK has potential arrangements in place with other countries is that it can make bilateral deals with those countries.  However, it does not have a bilateral arrangement with the EU on this.  While the Commission has put contingency plans in place in many areas, including aviation and other areas people are aware of, no contingency plan is in place yet to facilitate access here without proof of motor insurance.  That may materialise between now and 29 March if we continue to move towards a no-deal Brexit but we will know a great deal more about that next week.  In my view, it is unlikely that we will continue in that direction, but it is not possible to say for sure.  While the insurance industry has printed and issued hundreds of thousands of green cards as of now to act on this contingency, it would be more helpful if a bilateral arrangement were in place between the UK and EU on a contingency basis while a longer-term solution is worked out.  The Government and the Minister could not have resolved this problem even if they wanted to because the EU must resolve it collectively.  The European Commission must.
