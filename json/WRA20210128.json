CETA is designed to benefit EU and Canadian companies through improved trade flows in support of increased employment for our citizens. The elimination of tariffs, reduced trade barriers and simplified customs procedures that flow from CETA all make it easier and cheaper for Irish companies of all sizes to export to Canada and vice versa.  Outside of Europe, the US and China, Canada is our largest indigenous export market with more than 400 Enterprise Ireland clients doing business in the Canadian market employing over 6,000 people. <\/p><p>Diversifying trade is an important part of our Brexit response and it will be an important factor in our recovery post-pandemic.  To this end, the best way to achieve export growth and market diversification is by improving market access and reducing costs of entering those markets which is what CETA is designed to achieve.  Given our historic ties with Canada, Ireland&rsquo;s enterprises are particularly well placed to benefit from CETA.<\/p><p>At EU level, a Sustainability Impact Assessment relating to the negotiation of CETA was carried out by Development Solutions.  This study provided a comprehensive assessment of the potential impacts of trade liberalisation under CETA.  The impact analysis assessed the economic, social and environmental impacts in Canada and the European Union, in three main sectors, sixteen sub-sectors and seven cross-cutting issues.  In addition to examining potential gains from removing factors affecting the free flow of goods, services and capital, consideration was given to areas such as labour mobility, government procurement, intellectual property rights, telecommunications services and electronic commerce.  Overall the impact assessment found that the sustainability impacts to Canada and the European Union would not be significant.  The European Commission published the final report in June 2011 which is available online at <i><\/i>.  <\/p><p>As part of the finalising of the Agreement, the EU and Canada also agreed a legally binding Joint Interpretative Instrument (JII) that was added to CETA to provide further assurances in relation to public services, labour rights, environmental protection and investment.  CETA does not affect EU rules on food safety or the environment.  Neither does it restrict the EU or Canada from passing new laws in areas of public interest such as the environment, and health and safety.  Importantly, in CETA both sides also agree that more trade and investment should not be at the expense of environmental protection and labour rights.  On the contrary, the EU and Canada are committed to ensuring that CETA helps ensure that economic growth, social development, and environmental protection go hand in hand.<\/p><p>At a national level, my Department has commissioned econometric modelling on the impacts of CETA. On a bilateral basis, Ireland&rsquo;s exports to Canada are estimated to be 31% higher in 2030 than they would have been in the absence of CETA.  The analysis also finds that Ireland&rsquo;s GDP is estimated be 0.2 percent higher in 2030 than would have been the case in a baseline scenario without CETA.  It further finds total global exports from Ireland are expected to be 0.7 percent higher in 2030 as a result of CETA.  In addition, the current modelling estimates that, given that existing average tariffs on exports to Canada are relatively low (0.3% weighted average), the main benefits for Irish exporters stemming from CETA arise from a 10 percent reduction in non-tariff barrier costs on Ireland&rsquo;s exports to Canada.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the EU produces an FTA Annual Implementation Report which identifies progress with FTA deliverables and which can inform further actions if required.  Finally, in July 2020 the European Commission appointed a Chief Trade Enforcement Officer who is tasked with overseeing effective implementation and observance of commitments in our EU FTAs, including CETA, which includes strengthening the enforcement of sustainable development commitments, notably in relation to the climate agenda and labour rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800056#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800056#WRA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[4583\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800056#WRA00600","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if special exemptions were given to supermarkets that also sell homeware to allow for click and collect during level 5 given that this seems to be the case in a particular store.","asker":"1566","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>S.I.

My understanding is that the grant was not intended to replace lost revenues for such businesses, but instead to help those business meet certain costs such as the provision of PPE or similar costs which arose as a result of the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  At an early stage of this crisis, it became apparent that the impacts on economic activity were going to remain with us for much longer than originally anticipated.

The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan. <\/p><p>Details of CRSS were published in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website at:  <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>To qualify under the scheme a business must, under specific terms of the Covid restrictions, be required to either prohibit or significantly restrict, customers from accessing their business premises to acquire goods or services, with the result that the business either has to temporarily close or to operate at a significantly reduced level. For the purposes of CRSS, a qualifying &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; is a building or other similar fixed physical structure in which a business activity is ordinarily carried on. <\/p><p>It is not sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19.  The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or restrict access to its business premises. Where a business supplies goods or services to businesses in the hospitality industry which, under the specific terms of the Covid restrictions, are required to prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises (for example pubs and restaurants), it will not result in the supplier business being eligible to make a claim under CRSS.  Each business must meet the qualification criteria in their own right. Similarly caterers or event organisers who provide services away from their business premises are not eligible for the scheme.<\/p><p>Businesses whose trading profits are not chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D do not meet the eligibility criteria for CRSS. <\/p><p>A charity shop that is not chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D will not qualify for CRSS.  This includes a charity shop that has been granted charitable tax exemption status because it is exempt from paying corporation tax or income tax on any income received where the income is used for its main charitable purpose. <\/p><p>The CRSS is just one of the Government&rsquo;s supports to assist businesses impacted by COVID-19. Businesses who are not eligible for CRSS may be entitled to alternative supports put in place by the Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). Businesses may also be eligible under the Debt Warehousing Scheme to &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain VAT and PAYE (Employer) liabilities, excess payments received under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), outstanding balances of self-assessed Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020. I have no plans to change the eligibility criteria for the CRSS.<\/p><p>Deputies will be aware that the D&aacute;il yesterday discussed the draft Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (Covid Restrictions Support Scheme) (Percentage Adjustment) Order 2021. This order provides for an increase in the levels of payment to 20% of average 2019 turnover up to &euro;20,000 and to 10% of turnover above that amount for the three weeks beginning 21st and 28th December and 4th January. I have no other plans to vary the rates of payment.<\/p><p>The purpose of the CRSS is to provide additional support to the businesses who have had to close temporarily or significantly restrict access to their premises as a direct result of public health Regulations.  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800057#WRB04798","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":114,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[4784\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800057#WRB04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to continue the employment wage subsidy scheme in view of the continued impacts of Covid-19 on businesses, considering that the current restrictions have the potential to severely impact the hospitality sector in particular in 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

However, the reality of COVID-19 is that our whole economy and labour market have been rapidly transformed by this unprecedented shock and nearly all sectors have been negatively impacted either directly or indirectly. <\/p>  <p>  The objective of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible.  The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times.  To date, subsidy payments of over &euro;1.5 billion have been made and PRSI relief worth over &euro;270m granted to over 41,600 employers in respect of over 467,000 employees. <\/p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS.  It is noted that the legislation implementing the measure provides that it will be in place until 31 March 2021, but also provides that the scheme may be extended until the end of June 2021 if required and subject to certain procedural conditions. <\/p>  <p>  It is likely that continued support will be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment and to provide businesses with certainty to the maximum extent possible.  Decisions on the form of such support will take account of emerging circumstances and economic conditions as they become clearer.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, I am satisfied that the design of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) fully takes account of the changing environment around living with the COVID-19 pandemic, in line with Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19. <\/p>  <p>  For those businesses who may need additional support at this time, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise

","asker":"1604","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":133,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 53 together. <\/p>  <p>  On 18 March last the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) announced a coordinated approach by banks and other lenders to help their customers who were economically impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.  The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. The implementation of this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a flexible response to the emerging COVID-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis.<\/p>  <p>  While many borrowers whose payment break has ended have been able to return to full payments, it is also recognised that many borrowers continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of COVID-19 and they may not be in a position to resume their loan repayment commitments when their payment break ends or may now be in difficulty for the first time.  Regarding the issue of residential rental payment breaks, that is a matter which falls within the policy remit of my colleague the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  <\/p>  <p>  First, regarding the offering of further payment breaks, the Deputy should be aware that the Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.  The BPFI has also reiterated this month that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their situation.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the accrual of interest on loans during payment breaks, it is noted that lenders will continue to incur costs (both in respect of funding and enhanced operational requirements) and that other borrowers will continue to be liable for their interest charges.  Payment break measures do not come without cost to the banking sector and these costs will also have to be managed in a way that protects their business and will be as fair as possible to the various stakeholders.  From the outset, it has been made clear to banks that it will not be acceptable for them to make excess profits on payment breaks and that it will be a matter for them to demonstrate that such a situation will not arise.<\/p>  <p>  Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections, such as the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the Consumer Protection Code, and lenders have specific obligations to support and work with borrowers who are continuing to experience loan difficulty because of COVID-19.  The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Central Credit Register (CCR), it is important to note that the CCR does not produce credit ratings, rather its purpose is to provide factual information to lenders and borrowers on a borrower&rsquo;s credit record. The Central Bank has also advised lenders that in their reporting to the CCR, they will need to apply judgement around whether a restructure has been agreed in response to an identification of financial distress and should be reported as such.<\/p>  <p>  Through ongoing engagement with the BPFI and lenders, the Central Bank is working to ensure that borrowers affected by COVID-19 continue to be supported through this period of unprecedented stress. The Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements and Central Bank expectations.<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support.  Regarding the issue of residential rental payment breaks, that is a policy matter which falls within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800058#WRC00875","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":134,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 44 and 45 answered with Question No. 37.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Travel Insurance","counter":135,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800058#WRC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":136,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[4659\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800058#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department has had engagement with the insurance sector regarding the availability of travel insurance for citizens that have received a Covid-19 vaccine.","asker":"1554","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":137,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that the decision of an insurer to provide travel insurance is a commercial one based on the level of risk that it is willing to take.  Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have any influence over the pricing of insurance products, nor can we compel any firm operating in the Irish market to provide cover to individual consumers.  This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules, which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of their products.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Covid-19 and travel insurance, industry representatives Insurance Ireland advise customers to check their policy documents as the scope of the cover can vary.  Generally, it notes that some policies provide cover for non-refundable cancellation costs where there is a government directive prohibiting travel.  Others include an optional travel disruption extension.  It should be noted however, that these policies were generally sold prior to mid-March 2020.  Travel policies sold subsequently  generally do not cover cancellation costs arising from Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, the Government strongly advises against all non-essential travel overseas, and I understand that there are no exemptions in place for those travelling to Ireland who have received a Covid-19 vaccine.  I am aware that there is a wider debate at EU level on whether citizens who have received the Covid-19 vaccine should be able to travel more freely later this year.  How this discussion interacts with the provision of travel insurance is likely to depend on a number of complex factors, including the travel advice that is provided at that time.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would note that the recently published Action Plan for Insurance Reform includes commitments in relation to engaging with the industry on its COVID-19 customer response.  I believe that this is an issue that will be monitored as the situation becomes clearer with the rollout of the National Vaccine Programme in Ireland and developments further afield. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800058#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":138,"content":"<p>Question No. 47 answered with Question No. 37.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800058#WRC01500"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[4785\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800058#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans for the continuation of VAT and PAYE warehousing for the hospitality sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":141,"content":"<p>The Debt Warehousing Scheme remains available to support businesses, including the hospitality sector, experiencing tax payment difficulties arising from the current COVID-19 public health restrictions.

As such, business disruption insurance is specifically included within the Action Plan for Insurance Reform, launched last month.  I am in full understanding of the concerns expressed about how the insurance industry is responding to the needs of its business policyholders in these difficult times, including honouring business interruption claims. Whether a company is able to successfully claim on its business interruption policy due to a COVID-19 enforced closure will depend on the specific policy. This is ultimately a matter of contract law between the business and its insurer.  While this is an issue that Minister of State Fleming and I continue to follow closely, it should be noted that neither we, nor the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI), can direct or require that insurers cover claims, including those resulting from infectious diseases such as COVID-19, nor can we adjudicate on the validity of such claims.  <\/p><p>The above said, we both have had a number of engagements with the insurance industry on this issue, and have made it very clear that insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage. They should engage with those impacted businesses honestly, fairly and professionally to honour those elements of the policies covered, in line with the CBI&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  Minister of State Fleming reiterated this expectation to the main insurers in the Irish market during his engagements with them late last year.<\/p><p>Separately, the CBI&rsquo;s <i>COVID-19 Business Interruption Supervisory Framework<\/i>sets out its expectations of insurance firms in handling related insurance claims.  The objective of the Framework is to seek early identification and resolution of issues which have the potential to cause customer harm and bring clarity to affected businesses as quickly as possible.<i><\/i>Significantly, in my view, where cover and related issues are disputed, the CBI expects firms to pay the reasonable costs of customer plaintiffs in agreed test case litigation.  On that point, I would note that a number of related test cases are before the High Court, with judgments due to be handed down next week. Accordingly, it would be inappropriate for me, or the Government to provide comment on these at this stage.  <\/p><p>In conclusion, the Deputy should be assured that Minister of State Fleming and I will continue to monitor the business interruption issue and will engage appropriately with both insurers and the Central Bank of Ireland on the matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800058#WRC02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vehicle Registration Tax","counter":145,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800058#WRC02100"},{"type":"question","counter":146,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[4814\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800058#WRC02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to exempt vehicles used for mountain rescue financed by voluntary donations and small grants from VRT; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":147,"content":"<p>Section 130 of the Finance Act 1992 (as amended by Section 102 of the Finance Act 2010) introduced, from 1 January 2011, a revised classification system for the assessment of VRT which reflects the categories used for classification of vehicles at European level under various EC Directives.  Passenger Vehicles (EU Category M) and Commercial Vehicles (EU Category N) are classified based on the specifications of these vehicle types and in particular, the number of seats and their goods carrying capacity.  There are no provisions for the classification of vehicles based on their usage.<\/p><p>A vehicle may be registered as an ambulance if it conforms to the definition provided in Regulation (EU) 2018\/858. This states that the vehicle must be: &ldquo;<i>intended for the transport of sick or injured people and having special equipment for such purpose<\/i>.&rdquo;  Furthermore, the layout and technical equipment of the patient compartment have to comply with the European requirement (IS EN 1789:2007 +A1: 2010 +A2:2014) on medical vehicles and their equipment. This standard emphasises, amongst other things, the ceiling clearance level of the patient compartment which gives sufficient space for the treatment of the casualty during transport. Under the terms of the Directive these vehicles are assigned an EU SC bodywork code as a special purpose vehicle at EU type-approval stage.  <\/p><p>Vehicles such as converted 4x4s and sports utility vehicles cannot meet the required standards as set out above, in particular in relation to the ceiling clearance level and partitions.  Revenue therefore regards them as category A which is consistent with their passenger transport design.

In addition, we cannot compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to specific individuals or groups, such as those referenced in the question.  This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure you that insurance reform is a priority for this Government and I, along with my colleagues, am keenly aware of the pressures that businesses have faced over recent times including the cost of insurance.  Those in the tourist sector, such as Jarveys, like all businesses have been significantly impacted by Covid and the Government has brought in a range of support measures to assist at this difficult time. <\/p>  <p>  In regard to the cost of insurance, the recently-launched Action Plan for Insurance Reform contains a range of deliverables, including:<\/p>  <p>  - increasing market transparency through the National Claims Information Database (NCID), including for employer and public liability insurance;<\/p>  <p>  - reviewing the duty of care legislation;<\/p>  <p>  - providing for the Judicial Council&rsquo;s accelerated adoption by 31 July 2021 of new personal injuries guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum;<\/p>  <p>  - consideration by the Department of Justice of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s recent Report on Capping Damages in Personal Injuries Actions;<\/p>  <p>  - looking at how to further enhance the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board; and,<\/p>  <p>  - making proposals on increasing competition in the Irish insurance market. <\/p>  <p>  Recognising that many businesses and self-employed persons need to see the impact of these reforms as soon as possible, the Action Plan contains 66 actions, 95% of which are due to be completed by the end of 2021. The focus is clearly on completing these actions in the short to medium term.  I am hopeful that key reforms around personal injury awards may start to have an impact during this year on the pricing and availability of insurance. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to increasing competition, the measures outlined in the Action Plan will undoubtedly reduce barriers to entry into the Irish insurance market.  I would also highlight to the Deputy that an Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market has now been established in my Department.  This will provide for a more joined-up policy response on promoting competition in this sector, as well as provide for greater information to assist consumers and businesses.  Minister of State Fleming will report on its work to the Cabinet Sub-Group on Insurance Reform.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, seeking to secure a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.  In this regard, it is my intention, along with Minister of State Fleming, to work with our Government colleagues to ensure that implementation of the Action Plan can have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses and voluntary groups across Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800058#WRC03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":154,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800058#WRC03600"},{"type":"question","counter":155,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[4871\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800058#WRC03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if advice will be provided for a person (details supplied) who incorrectly applied for the temporary wage subsidy scheme.","asker":"1602","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":156,"content":"<p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), which is provided for in section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020, operated from 26 March 2020 to 31 August 2020 and was replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) from 1 September 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme was introduced as an emergency measure to provide financial support to businesses that were severely impacted by the pandemic and enabled employees whose employers could no longer afford to pay wages receive subsidy payments.

In this regard, it prohibits the levying of indirect taxes on contributions of capital to capital companies, certain restructuring operations involving capital companies and the issue of certain securities. Irish tax law must be compatible with the terms of this Directive.<\/p>  <p>  Before the Capital Duties Directive came into effect, a stamp duty called companies capital duty (CCD) was levied on the raising of capital by the issue of shares in a capital company and on certain other transactions such as restructuring arrangements. The most usual type of corporate body within the charge to CCD was a limited company incorporated in Ireland. The most common transactions which gave rise to a charge to CCD were the formation of a capital company, an increase in the issued share capital of a capital company and the transfer to Ireland of either the effective centre of management or the registered office of a capital company. However, as CCD was incompatible with EU rules, it was abolished with effect from 7 December 2005. <\/p>  <p>  The issue of whether current Irish tax law is compatible with the Capital Duties Directive has recently arisen in relation to a change in Irish tax legislation taking effect on 9 October 2019, the provisions of which are now contained in section 31D Stamp Duties Consolidation Act (SDCA) 1999. Under section 31D, a stamp duty charge is levied where there is an agreement to acquire a company using a Court-approved scheme of arrangement in accordance with the Companies Act 2014 involving the cancellation of the company&rsquo;s shares and the issue of new shares to the person acquiring the company. This type of arrangement was not previously subject to stamp duty as it did not involve an actual transfer of shares to the person acquiring the company even though the net effect was to transfer ownership of the company. In stamp duty terms, there is no transfer or conveyance on sale on which to impose a charge. This new charge recognises the substance of these types of arrangement (known as cancellation schemes of arrangement) and imposes the stamp duty charge of 1% that, in the normal course, applies to transfers of shares. Stamp duty is now charged on the consideration paid to shareholders for the cancellation of their shares.<\/p>  <p>  I introduced this new stamp duty charge because I considered that it would be compatible with the Capital Duties Directive as the duty is not being charged on the new issue of shares.  Nor did I consider &lsquo;cancellation schemes of arrangement&rsquo; to be the type of restructuring operation that is targeted by the Directive.  However, this issue of compatibility was recently considered in an appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) against a Revenue assessment to stamp duty. The determination made by the TAC on 8 December 2020 found in favour of the appellant (taxpayer). <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it does not agree with the TAC determination and is currently in the process of appealing this determination to the High Court. It intends to await the High Court judgement before deciding on how best to proceed in relation to the status of section 31D SDCA 1999 vis-&agrave;-vis the Capital Duties Directive. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800058#WRC05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800058#WRC05600"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[4925\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800058#WRC05700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if additional financial supports will be put in place for Irish pilots (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":169,"content":"<p>I am aware of concerns that have been raised regarding the pace of recovery for the aviation sector, and that it has been suggested that the level of support be increased and\/or that the application of some of the new State supports should be delineated on the basis of explicit sectoral qualification criteria.  However, the reality of COVID-19 is that our whole economy and labour market have been rapidly transformed by this unprecedented shock and nearly all sectors have been negatively impacted either directly or indirectly. <\/p>  <p>  The objective of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible.  The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times.  To date, subsidy payments of over &euro;1.5 billion have been made and PRSI relief worth over &euro;270m granted to over 41,600 employers in respect of over 467,000 employees. <\/p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS.

The BPFI has also reiterated in recent days that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their situation.<\/p>  <p>  Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections, such as the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the Consumer Protection Code, and lenders have specific obligations to support and work with borrowers who are continuing to experience loan difficulty because of COVID-19.  The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  Through ongoing engagement with the BPFI and lenders, the Central Bank is working to ensure that borrowers affected by COVID-19 continue to be supported through this period of unprecedented stress. The Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements and Central Bank expectations.<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support.<\/p>  <p>  Questions in relation to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800058#WRC05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Treaties","counter":171,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800059#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":172,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[4926\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800059#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the details of the procedures and inspections in place with regard to the double taxation treaty of 1995 between Ireland and Israel since 1967 to ensure that companies established in illegal settlements, persons residing in illegal settlements occupied by Israel since 1967, all economic activities being carried out there and persons living elsewhere but earning income from these settlements, cannot benefit in any way from the provisions of this treaty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":173,"content":"<p>The provisions of the Double Taxation Treaty between Ireland and Israel do not apply to territories occupied by Israel in 1967.

Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.<\/p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an application for mortgage credit remains a commercial matter for the individual lender.  Also a loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial decision for the lender. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for credit, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800059#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Customs and Excise","counter":183,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800059#WRD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":184,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[4977\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800059#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if clarity will be provided on the level of import duties on products imported from the UK in which the country of origin of that product is another country outside the European Union (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":185,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that while the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement has eliminated Customs duties for goods imported from the UK where the goods are of UK origin, this will not impact on goods of Chinese origin that are imported from the UK and these are subject to Customs tariff duties on arrival in the State. <\/p><p>Customs duty is normally calculated as a percentage of the customs value of the goods.

Cost Rental is a new tenure option for Ireland, designed to assist households currently facing affordability pressures in the private rental market. It is defined as housing where the rents charged cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only. Although the current focus is on implementing Cost Rental in newly constructed homes, in order to contribute to an overall increase in supply, the re-purposing of existing homes can be considered in the future.<\/p><p>A range of work is already ongoing to deliver Cost Rental housing, with State support, through a number of avenues. We are utilising the expertise of Local Authorities, the Land Development Agency (LDA), and the Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to deliver three initial Cost Rental projects that are already underway: two developments in D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown at Enniskerry Road and Shanganagh, and a third at Emmet Road (the former St Michael&rsquo;s Estate) in Dublin City. The 50 units at Enniskerry Road are under construction, supported by a grant from my Department&rsquo;s Serviced Sites Fund, and are currently scheduled for completion in Q3 this year.<\/p><p>In addition, Budget 2021 allocated &euro;35m for a new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme, under which the Government will make loans on favourable terms to AHBs for up to 30% of the cost of new homes for Cost Rental. CREL will leverage the proven expertise and capacity of the AHBs, demonstrated in their development and management of social housing units. This &euro;35m will support AHBs to deliver <i>c<\/i>.350 new homes for Cost Rental, at rents below market levels. It is expected that the remaining development or acquisition costs for the homes will be met by long-term commercial loans from the Housing Finance Agency, which has confirmed it will make a corresponding &euro;100m available next year.<\/p><p>CREL will accelerate delivery in this new sector, in advance of the LDA&rsquo;s planned future output and the delivery of Cost Rental homes by Local Authorities. The forthcoming Affordable Housing Bill proposes that the making of loans to AHBs under the CREL scheme will be managed by the Housing Agency, given its expertise and close working relationship with the AHBs and Local Authority sector in relation to housing.<\/p><p>The intention is that Cost Rental will be informed by National Planning Framework priorities.  It will be focused, at least initially, in densely populated urban areas where rental affordability pressures are particularly acute and where State resources can have the biggest impact. A Call for Proposals under the CREL scheme was issued for my Department to AHBs in December 2020, and the assessment process is currently ongoing. Following completion of the selection process, which is expected shortly, the locations of CREL-supported projects will be made available. <\/p><p>The forthcoming Affordable Housing Bill defines a Cost Rental tenancy in Ireland for the first time. The provisions would allow me, as Minister, to designate such a tenancy where the rent is set at a level to cover the costs of delivery (including financing), management, and maintenance of the property. This rent would increase on an annual basis only in line with consumer inflation, which would ensure that rents continue to cover ongoing management and maintenance costs while remaining stable in real terms.<\/p><p>It is envisaged that the primary means of eligibility would be maximum household income, to ensure that Cost Rental benefits a target cohort of moderate-income households who face affordability pressures in the private rental sector. These income limits are currently being developed by my Department as part of the detailed drafting of the Bill.<\/p><p>In relation to examples from other jurisdictions, my Department&rsquo;s work has been informed by examination of the Austrian and Danish housing models in particular.  These systems have mature Cost Rental sectors which have developed over a long period and demonstrate the progressively positive impact that such a model can have over long periods. In addition, the European Investment Bank, which has extensive experience in supporting the delivery of affordable housing across Europe, has sponsored an ongoing research report on Cost Rental in Ireland, which includes an assessment of relevant European comparisons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800060#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hare Coursing","counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800060#WRE02000"},{"type":"question","counter":242,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[4600\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800060#WRE02100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will call for the immediate release of any hares currently in captivity in view of the fact that coursing meetings are not permitted to take place during current Covid-19 restrictions and in view of the animal welfare issues related to holding wild animals in captivity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":243,"content":"<p>The Irish Coursing Club has informed my Department that all hares current held in captivity by coursing clubs will be released forthwith.

Under the current Level 5 restrictions and associated regulations, the planning service is remains operational as an essential service. <\/p>  <p>  A vital element of a functioning planning system is to ensure that public participation rights are not curtailed, subject to public health protocols and remote working where feasible, and that local authority decision making processes in respect of planning applications and development plans can continue to function in a transparent manner. <\/p>  <p>  The planning system as a whole has implemented changes in this regard since the expiry of the extension period, including public health protocols for visitors to and staff working in local authorities and for local councillors, the requirement to scan and upload planning applications to an online location within 5 days of submission, and confirmation by Regulation in October 2020, and again in January 2021, that planning is an &lsquo;essential service&rsquo;, meaning that participating members of the public are permitted to travel to engage in a planning process where it is not possible to engage remotely.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may also be aware, a recent amendment to section 11(3)(b) of the Planning and Development Act also now allows for an alternative to &lsquo;in-person&rsquo; public meetings at the initial stage of a development plan process, which has enabled planning authorities to adapt public consultation procedures in light of present restrictions on the holding of public gatherings during the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has also legislated for remote or partially remote council meetings to take place, including in relation to planning matters such as the county development plan process.

The zoning of land for particular uses, including for new housing, is specified in this legislation to be a reserved function of the elected members of the planning authority. This task is undertaken in order to contribute to meeting the identified housing supply needs of the local authority area in question. <\/p><p>In this regard, I have recently issued the &lsquo;<i>Housing Supply Target Methodology for Development Planning, Guidelines for Planning Authorities<\/i>&rsquo; under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act (as amended). These guidelines provide an integrated and nationally consistent methodology for each planning authority to estimate an overall housing supply target for their development plan that is consistent with adopted  national and regional population growth targets in the National Planning Framework and Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies. This housing supply target is quantified as an overall number of housing units that is to be planned and provided for in the development plan process, with scope for adjustment in certain local authority areas.<\/p><p>In producing the county development plan, the consideration and decision on what particular lands to zone is therefore taken by the elected members of the planning authority.  In selecting lands to zone for future residential development, the planning authority is not, however, required to maintain zonings from a previous development plan. <\/p><p>The planning authority must consider the suitability of such lands for delivering new housing within the proposed plan period as part of the overall core strategy of the development plan. The Planning and Development Act is very clear (Section 10(8)), that &ldquo;there shall be no presumption in law that any land zoned in a particular development plan (including a development plan that has been varied) shall remain so zoned in any subsequent development plan&rdquo;.<\/p><p>The Planning Act also specifically addresses the matter of compensation under section 191, stating that &ldquo;Compensation shall not be payable in respect of the refusal of permission for any development based on any change of the zoning of any land as a result of the making of a new development plan&hellip;&rdquo;.<\/p><p>The availability of infrastructure to facilitate new development further to public or private investment is an important consideration in assessing the appropriateness of land for new housing development.  Overall, the development plan adopted by the elected members must ensure that sufficient residential lands are available to contribute towards meeting the identified housing supply target, and should prioritise lands capable of delivering new homes within the six-year development plan period. <\/p><p>It would therefore be expected that sites that benefit from investment in services would normally be prioritised over sites that may be unserviced, but given the range of factors that must be considered as part of a county development plan process, these are matters for the planning authority to assess and determine in the context of the county development plan as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800061#WRF02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"question","counter":294,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[4910\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800061#WRF02600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he plans to provide an interim solution to the long delay in granting exempted status to the installation of solar photovoltaic rooftop panels on schools and community buildings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":295,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[4911\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800061#WRF02700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he plans to amend the regulations pertaining to the installation of solar photovoltaic rooftop panels on houses and businesses; if so, when he plans to do so; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":296,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[4923\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800061#WRF02800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if the planning regulations for the installation of solar rooftop panels will be revised to ensure exemptions are in accordance with action 30 of the Climate Action Plan 2019; when revised planning regulations will be submitted to the Houses of the Oireachtas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the specific conditions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Climate Action Plan 2019, my Department is currently undertaking a review of the solar panel exemptions, and is actively engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as other key stakeholders, with a view to finalising a proposal for draft amending Regulations - to reflect, inter alia, technical developments in the sector. One of the key considerations of the review is to ensure that solar panels can be erected - subject to certain siting and size conditions - without the need to obtain planning permission, to facilitate more widespread generation of energy for self-consumption. Also included in this review are solar panel exemptions for educational and community buildings. <\/p>  <p>  The main outstanding issue that remains to be addressed in the current review is the potential for \"glint and glare\" impacts for aircraft and the need to ensure that they do not result in any real or potential threat to aviation safety. Accordingly, my Department is presently engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as the Irish Aviation Authority, in order to find a safe and workable solution in relation to this particular aspect of the review. The Department has begun the tendering process for this project, which will involve the development of aviation safeguarding maps for each airport\/aerodrome in the country, and has received feedback from potential tenderers estimating a timeline of up to 9 months for its completion. As such, these maps, which are a fundamental aspect of any amendments to the exemptions, are expected to be finalised in Q3 2021.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the length of time that it is expected to take to complete the aviation safeguarding maps, my Department has decided to adopt an interim measure which would allow the revised regulations to be introduced prior to the completion of these maps, but with defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes for solar installations. My Department is consulting with the Irish Aviation Authority on this matter, and is working towards the development of draft regulations in this regard, the precise details of which have yet to be finalised.  <\/p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, any such proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made. The draft regulations will also be subject to environmental assessment reporting considerations before being finalised and signed into force. The process for finalising the interim solar panel planning exemptions as referred to above, with exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes, is now expected to be completed by the end of Q1 2021. These interim regulations will allow for the vast majority of the country to be covered by the solar panel exemptions apart from those areas in close proximity to airports and aerodromes..<\/p>  <p>  The overall process for updating the solar panel planning exemptions to include the completed aviation safeguarding maps for airports and aerodromes is still expected to be completed by Q4 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800061#WRF02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing","counter":298,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800061#WRF03100"},{"type":"question","counter":299,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[4914\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800061#WRF03200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the policy basis for only using one-bed units for housing first tenancies; if the policy will be amended to include two-bed units given the shortage of one-bed units; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":300,"content":"<p>Housing First enables homeless individuals with high levels of complex needs to obtain permanent secure accommodation with the provision of intensive housing and health supports to help them maintain their tenancies.<\/p>  <p>  The National Implementation Plan for Housing First, published in September 2018, which puts the programme on a national footing, is designed to provide this response, by delivering permanent housing solutions and associated supports for rough sleepers and long-term users of emergency accommodation.

This plan builds on the intentions set out in the White Paper in relation to equipment acquisition, modernisation and upgrade and has been developed to ensure that our Defence Forces have the major equipment platforms, ancillary equipment and force protection equipment to carry out their important roles both at home and overseas. The current position regarding the major equipment platform projects is as follows.<\/p>  <p>  The mid-life upgrade of the Army&rsquo;s fleet of 80 General Dynamics European Land Systems (GDELS) Mowag Piranha III armoured personnel carrier vehicles is well underway.   This programme is on-going and continues to command significant resources and commitment of effort.  The vehicle, which is the backbone of Defence Forces armoured capability, has been well proven in all its roles since the first vehicles were introduced in 2001.  By end-2020, some 47 vehicles have been upgraded including modernisation of protection systems and weapons. The overall programme is due to be completed by 2023. In addition, an order for 28 Armoured Utility Vehicles AUVs was recently placed with Centigon, a French company, and these will provide a level of protected mobility between the levels of soft-skinned light transport and heavier armoured vehicles. Delivery of these vehicles is expected to complete in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Defence Forces communications systems, there is continued investment in the development of suitable network enabled communications in order to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex operational environment. In July of 2020 a tender competition was commenced for the supply of Software Defined Radios to the Defence Forces and the competition is currently underway. The scope of the project consists of two main requirements; Personal Soldier Radios and Multi-Band Handheld, Manpack, Vehicular and Airborne radios. Given the complexity of the requirements, the procurement process is expected to be comprehensive in nature with the first radios not expected to enter service before 2023.<\/p>  <p>  There is also continuous investment in the non-armoured vehicle fleet.  In 2019, a contract was signed with Toyota Ireland for the replacement of the Army's fleet of 3\/4 tonne 4X4 vehicles, the first of which entered service in early 2020.  In March of last year, a tender process was completed for the supply of one hundred and twenty (120) new 4X4 Troop Carrying Vehicles, with the award of a contract to Westward Scania, based in Strokestown, Co. Roscommon.  The first vehicles are scheduled for delivery in Q1 2021 with delivery of all 120 vehicles concluding by 2023.  Funding is provided on an on-going basis for the required maintenance of vehicles in the military transport fleet, both at home and overseas.<\/p>  <p>  A step change in military air-based capability is being achieved through the delivery into serivce of Pilatus PC-12 aircraft.  While nominally a replacement for the Cessna, the new aircraft move capabilities considerably ahead of the previous level.  The original order of three aircraft which were delivered in September 2020 was augmented on an urgent basis by an additional aircraft delivered in April 2020 to enhance fixed wing capacity to meet demands arising from Covid-19.  The PC-12 has proven itself an effective and versatile asset.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper also provides for the replacement of the CASA 235s with consideration to be given to their replacement with larger more capable aircraft which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft was entered into with Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence also sets out an ambitious programme of capital investment in the Naval Service including the mid-life refit and upgrade of the P50 class vessels, L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n and L&Eacute; Niamh, as well as, in due course, the replacement of L&Eacute; Eithne.  The P50 mid-life upgrade programme is well underway.  The replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel (MRV) is the next scheduled component of the White Paper fleet investment programme.

This mirrors the arrangements that were in place during the school closures in 2020, when the majority of schools in the school meals programme continued to provide food to children, largely through the home delivery of food parcels by suppliers.

The majority of schools opt to provide a weekly or fortnightly food parcel.<\/p>  <p>  The arrangements will not change from when schools closed previously: namely that the schools may continue to avail of the funding and they may continue to provide food consistent with normal funding terms and conditions. Schools must ensure that they continue to satisfy all public health guidelines. <\/p>  <p>  In May 2020, my Department issued a survey to the schools and organisations on the school meals programme to ascertain the level of provision of food that was been maintained following the school closures.

The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with Covid-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of Covid-19, the person can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected.  This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system.<\/p>  <p>  The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit was brought in as a short-term public health measure and is not a long-term income support payment. It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19. The purpose of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation. <\/p>  <p>  In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type. Additional payments may also be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports, my Department also provides means tested supports under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who are ill but who do not qualify for Illness Benefit. The Department may also make an exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.   <\/p>  <p>  Given the comprehensive set of supports available to people who are unable to work due to illness, I do not propose to extend the duration of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800064#WRJ05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Payments","counter":502,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800064#WRJ05800"},{"type":"question","counter":503,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[4831\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800064#WRJ05900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons aged between 18 and 24 years of age who are in receipt of a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":504,"content":"<p>An age related jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate of &euro;112.70 generally applies to young jobseekers aged 18-24 to incentivise them to engage in education or training to improve their chances of obtaining full time sustainable employment.

Failure to submit correct documentation is the most common cause of delays in processing applications and every effort is made by CORU to ensure applicants submit the information required to allow for the smooth processing of their application.  <\/p>  <p>  Where applications are received with all required documentation, CORU endeavours to process these applications, including eVetting, within 14 weeks.

Healthcare co-operation with Northern Ireland covers a range of areas and there is ongoing communication between officials in my Department and their counterparts in Northern Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  Meetings of the North South Ministerial Council are an important pillar in our regular engagement with Northern Ireland, both the Plenary meetings and Health Sector meetings. Most recently the 25th North South Ministerial Council Plenary Meeting was held on 18 December 2020. <\/p>  <p>  There is also regular engagement with the Department of Health in Northern Ireland on EU funding programmes. PEACE PLUS, a new EU cross-border programme for the period 2021-2027, will fund a range of activities, including in areas of health, to promote peace and reconciliation and contribute to the cross-border economic and social development of Northern Ireland and the border region. It will build upon the earlier PEACE and INTERREG Programmes.<\/p>  <p>  There has been, and continues to be, significant engagement and cooperation between the Ministers for Health, the Chief Medical Officers, and Departmental officials throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. On 15 January 2021, the Chief Medical Officers in Northern Ireland and Ireland collaborated on a joint statement voicing their concerns about the high levels of COVID-19 and urging everyone to stay home.

This approach is underpinned by a Memorandum of Understanding agreed by the Chief Medical Officers of the Department of Health and the Department of Health in Northern Ireland in April 2020 to strengthen North South co-operation on the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  In November 2020, this overarching agreement was supplemented with a further Memorandum of Understanding in relation to a framework for mutual support for the provision of critical care.<\/p>  <p>I am committed to continuing this close and productive cooperation with Northern Ireland, particularly to foster commonality in approaches, where possible, in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800068#WRN02375","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":696,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800068#WRN02400"},{"type":"question","counter":697,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[4686\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800068#WRN02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if passenger data for persons who are travelling to Northern Ireland via Dublin airport is being shared with the Northern Ireland Executive on public health grounds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1620","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":698,"content":"<p>There has been, and continues to be, engagement between myself and Minister Swann, and our officials, on data sharing from respective passenger locator forms.

They have signed Service Level Agreements which obliges them to provide additional hospital capacity to the HSE, to deal with the current surge in Covid-19 cases and any further surges in the pandemic, if they arise within the next 12 months. <\/p>  <p>  Under the safety net arrangement, the hospitals have to supply, depending on the incidence of the disease, up to 15% or 30% of their capacity. The HSE will be responsible for invoking the safety net arrangement. The private hospitals must provide the capacity not more than 7 days after being notified by the HSE that it is required. The HSE's decision will be determined on the basis of any one of three metrics which objectively indicate that a Covid-19 surge event is imminent or present. These metrics cover the level of community transmission, the number of hospital beds in the public system occupied by Covid-19 patients and the number of ICU beds in the public system occupied by Covid-19 patients. <\/p>  <p>  The agreement also provides for additional capacity over the 30% to be made available by mutual agreement between the HSE and any of the hospitals. <\/p>  <p>  The capacity obtained by the HSE will be used to free up capacity in the public hospitals and will be mainly used for urgent, time-dependant and complex care. The HSE and individual private hospitals will work on a collaborative basis to manage the effective flow of patients, having regard to the capabilities of the private hospital concerned. It will be a matter for the private hospitals to determine the clinical priorities regarding the use of their capacity which is not taken up by the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  The agreement will see the private hospitals provide a full service within the capacity made available including medical services and will be reimbursed at their standard commercial rate. It is not possible at this time to provide definitive costings as the monthly and final, cost of the agreement will be determined by a number of factors, including the length of time that surge arrangements are in place, as well as any future periods for which the agreement may be invoked. The total cost of the arrangement will be published at the appropriate time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800068#WRN05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":725,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800069#WRO00200"},{"type":"question","counter":726,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[4745\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800069#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when clarification will be provided to the medically vulnerable as to the category they will be included in under the vaccine roll-out programme.","asker":"1566","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":727,"content":"<p>The COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy sets out a provisional list of groups for vaccination.

A final decision must be communicated to the applicant within 4 months of submission of a complete application. Once a non-Irish qualification has been recognised the applicant can then apply for registration with CORU.<\/p>  <p>  I have consulted with CORU, who have confirmed that there are currently no outstanding delays for new applications within the CORU registration process, except where applications received are incomplete. Failure to submit correct documentation is the most common cause of delays in processing applications and every effort is made by CORU to ensure applicants submit the information required to allow for the smooth processing of their application. <\/p>  <p>  Where applications are received with all required documentation, CORU endeavours to process these applications, including eVetting, within 14 weeks. Many applications especially those of graduates within the State are significantly quicker. <\/p>  <p>  CORU has assured me that they always prioritise those applicants with job offers, especially for critical hospital roles and will continue to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, in response to the pandemic and in line with Section 98 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest  (Covid-19) Act 2020, CORU also created an application process to enable former, registered health sector professionals, who either voluntarily withdrew from the register of their designated profession or were removed due to non-payment of registration fees, to have their registration restored.

The CFP provides the framework for the long-term conservation and sustainability of fish stocks around our shores and is designed to ensure the long-term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters.  <\/p><p>There are a range of measures which are employed to ensure the conservation of fish stocks and the long-term sustainability of fishing in EU waters.  These include setting Total Allowable Catches in line with Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY).  The CFP specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY.  <\/p><p>Technical measures are also used to support sustainable fishing.  Technical measures are rules on how, where and when fishers may fish and also include gear, catch composition and ways to deal with accidental catches. <\/p><p>In 2020, 45% of the stocks of interest to Ireland were fished at or below MSY - this increased from 34% in 2013.  In 2009, at EU level only 5 stocks were fished at MSY.  This shows that the many years of intensive, industry-led conservation measures are paying off.  <\/p><p>However, in some cases, when a stock is seriously depleted, there may be no other option but to prohibit fishing for that stock. <\/p><p>Regarding the specific stocks referred to by the Deputy, in the case of Sea Bass, Ireland has been to the forefront in protecting this vulnerable stock for many years with a complete prohibition on commercial fishing in place since 1990.  In addition, EU vessels are prohibited from fishing for Sea Bass in Irish waters of Area 7 (the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and waters of the south-west and west coast).<\/p><p>As regards Dogfish - sometimes called Spurdog or Picked Dogfish - it is prohibited to target, retain on board, tranship or land picked dogfish, also known as spurdog.Spurdog are log lived, slow growing and late maturing fish and are therefore particularly vulnerable. The latest advice issued by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) on 2 October 2020 is that there should be no targeted fisheries for dogfish in 2021 and 2022.  On the basis of the available scientific advice on the current state of the stock, there is currently no possibility of re-introducing a targeted fishery in the near future. <\/p><p>The responsibility for salmon conservation comes within the remit of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.<\/p><p>The Herring stocks around Ireland are currently in a very vulnerable state and for 2020, and ICES advice for the Celtic Sea fishery and for the North West fishery is for zero TACs. The EU Council agreed very small &quot;data collection&quot; TACs for them to allow for the continued collection of scientific data which is set at a level that will not impair the recovery of these stocks. The setting aside of the 2012 Ministerial Policy was only decided by me because these were &quot;scientific quotas&quot; and, accordingly, the priority for the fishery was to deliver on the collection of the required data. In the normal course for commercial fisheries, any amendment of policy requires full assessment and consultation with stakeholders.<\/p><p>Within the Management Policy for mackerel,an amendment to the arrangements was put in place for the 2020 fishery that increased the trip limit from 500kg to 750kg for the hook and line mackerel fishery following a proposal in respect of this fishery from the National Inshore Fisheries Forum.  Any proposals for mackerel management must have regard for the Judicial Review (2017\/816JR) which is ongoing whereby a decision made by the Minister in July 2017 in respect of the allocation of Ireland&rsquo;s total mackerel fishing quota is being challenged<i>. <\/i><\/p><p>Ireland does not have a national quota for Bluefin Tuna.  The available Bluefin Tuna quota is allocated each year to Member States on the basis of relative stability as established in the late 1990s.  At that time, Ireland did not have a track record of commercial fishing for Bluefin Tuna and, accordingly, did not receive a quota allocation.  The only way to obtain a share of the EU quota now would involve changing relative stability within the EU.  The EU percentage share of the international TAC is set down and there is no likelihood that an international country will concede any share to the EU.  This means that EU Member States, with a national quota, would give up a share of their allocation to Ireland.  <\/p><p>The EU Commission has advised that it intends to commence the Common Fisheries Policy review process when there is clarity on the future relationship between the EU and the UK.

Both the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and Employment Wage Subsidy Schemes have supported the incomes of employees and the self-employed in our seafood sector and I am aware that many aquaculture enterprises availed of these Government payments during earlier phases of market disruption.  Government has also made available low-cost loans to seafood businesses for working capital and other purposes.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's &euro;240 million European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Programme 2014-2020 is the principal source of public funding for the sustainable development of our fisheries, aquaculture and seafood processing sectors.  The Programme is delivered through a range of support schemes providing supports for capital investment, innovation, advisory services, marketing, training, stock conservation and protection of marine biodiversity.  These support schemes have continued throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic and take-up of grants has remained strong.

My Department also supports the work of the Native Irish Honey Bee Society.<\/p><p>In relation to the importation of honeybees into Ireland, this is allowed under regulations governing intra-Community trade with other EU Member States. The specific health requirements for trading in bees are laid out in Council Directive 92\/65\/EEC. All imports of bees must be accompanied by a health certificate issued by the country of export. This is to ensure that imported bees are healthy and do not harbour pathogens or parasites that may be harmful to our native bee stocks. <\/p><p>The importation of bees is therefore subject to EU regulation on intra-community trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800073#WRS01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry","counter":972,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800073#WRS01700"},{"type":"question","counter":973,"qnumday":346,"qnumall":"[4935\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800073#WRS01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on introducing a new decommissioning scheme in view of the reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s fishing quota; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":974,"qnumday":350,"qnumall":"[4940\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021012800073#WRS01900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if individual fleet segments will be targeted in the decommissioning scheme; the safeguards that will be put in place to prevent unsustainable investment in other fleet segments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":975,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 346 and 350 together.<\/p>  <p>In the context of the Commission Proposal for a Regulation establishing a Brexit Adjustment Reserve, I am exploring a variety of possible measures to support our sector with the impacts of the quota transfers to the UK agreed under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement.  This is likely to include a Temporary Fleet Tie-up Scheme to support the sector in the short term as the effects of the quota transfers begin to affect fishing opportunities, with a possible Fleet Decommissioning Scheme to follow that would seek to re-balance the fleet with the reduced quotas available.  <\/p>  <p>  However, as I announced to the Dail last week, I propose to set up a Task Force involving seafood industry representatives and representatives of other stakeholders to provide recommendations to me on the appropriate measures that will best support the sector and the local coastal communities with the impacts of the quota cuts. I will be ensuring a broad representation of our seafood sector, as it is important that there is full buy-in to the process.  <\/p>  <p>  I will be asking the task force to immediately focus on arrangements for the Fleet Temporary Tie-up Scheme, so that it can be ready to go live as soon as it is needed. I also expect that the Task Force will provide prioritised recommendations on a range of other appropriate measures that will allow our seafood sector and coastal communities to adjust to the impacts of the quota reductions. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to safeguards to protect against the investment of aid payments to introduce new vessels in other fleet segments, I note that a Decommissioning Scheme funded under the Reserve would require a State Aid Notification to the European Commission.  Commission State Aid approval would likely require that it follow the rules for similar schemes implemented under the new European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, which provide that the beneficiary of Decommissioning aid is prohibited from registering any fishing vessel within five years.  <\/p>  <p>  I am also conscious of the 2016 Cost Benefit Analysis report from Grant Thornton, commissioned by BIM, which recommended that any decommissioning scheme should only be implemented if fleet management measures could be introduced that specifically avoids future expansion of the active fleet that undermines the economic benefits brought about through decommissioning, ensures the benefits of the scheme achieved are maintained for those remaining, and prevents any competitive advantage for those that availed of the scheme.

The agreement includes a tariff rate quota (TRQ) of 50,000 tonnes of Canadian beef access to the EU market, but our analysis concluded that this was unlikely to pose a significant threat to our beef sector. Canada was unlikely to be able to fill this TRQ in the short- to medium-term, given the high transport costs, together with the significant financial investment required to move to a hormone-free production system. At present, the Asian market appears to provide comparable prices to the EU market and has lower costs for Canadian exporters.<\/p>  <p>  Our analysis also concluded that the agreement contained good opportunities for our wider agri-food industry.  This has been borne out by the fact that the TRQ of 18,500 tonnes for EU cheese and industrial cheese has helped to drive our dairy exports to Canada. These exports have grown from &euro;9.9 million in 2013 to &euro;14.7 million in 2019. The agreement also included immediate 100% tariff-free market access for EU beef to Canada.
