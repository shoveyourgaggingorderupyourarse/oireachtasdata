Although a developed and costed proposal has not been presented by the sector to my Department, the cost of introducing a leisure card as outlined by the Deputy could potentially involve a very significant level of Exchequer support.  On the basis of a national scheme with coverage extending to all children and young adults in Ireland under the age of 25, currently totalling some 1,500,000 people, with a weekly subvention of just &euro;10 per week or over &euro;500 per annum, the total cost would be in the region of &euro;750 million.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, under the National Sports Policy 2018&ndash;2027 introduced in 2018 there is a target to double the level of State investment in sport from &euro;111 million in 2017 to &euro;220 million by the end of this policy.<\/p> <p>As a result of the Government's strong commitment to the development of sport in recent years, we are well on track to achieve our investment targets.  In budget 2023, a total allocation of &euro;174.8 million has been made for sport, which will allow for increased availability of sporting opportunities next year for all ages, young and old alike.  Additional resources have been allocated to Sport Ireland, the agency responsible for the development of sport in Ireland, which will permit improved budgetary resourcing of the governing bodies and local sports partnerships that deliver so much to families and children across the country.<\/p> <p> In the area of the cultural activities provided by the State, visits to the national cultural institutions are free of charge to all, including children and young people.  The institutions also continue to develop and expand on their learning and engagement activities for children and young people.  Under the all-of-government Creative Ireland programme led by my Department, access is provided to children and young people to engage in free creative activities through its Creative Youth and Creative Communities pillars.  For example, the flagship Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g provides free creative activities for children and young people nationwide in June every year.<\/p> <p> Although the introduction of a national leisure card is not currently considered a feasible or realistic proposition in the circumstances outlined, either from the Exchequer perspective or due to the considerable complexities that would inevitably arise from the administration standpoint, it would be inappropriate to completely rule out its introduction in all circumstances.  Future circumstances may allow for the adoption of such an approach, perhaps modified for particular sports, age ranges or population cohorts, and I would be open to considering specific proposals in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900003#A01300","speaker":"1475","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664444400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>According to research published by the Federation of Irish Sport, for every &euro;100 invested in sport by the Government, the Exchequer receives up to &euro;195 back through taxes on sports-supported expenditure and incomes.  We also know that half of the money invested by the State in the arts later comes back to the Exchequer.  This proposal is based on the Icelandic experience of a leisure card.  We propose a three-year pilot scheme where every child in junior and senior infants would get &euro;130 worth of credit to use on extracurricular sporting and-or cultural activities as they choose.  We then expand the scheme over the remaining primary school classes on a phased basis and, over a five-year period, the scheme would be rolled out to all children in primary and secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, a similar scheme was introduced in Iceland in 2007 as a response to the crisis among its youth around alcohol, tobacco, drug use, mental health issues and social isolation.  The changes in the experiences of children have been transformative.  As a long-term measure, the benefits far outweigh the initial costs and, as I said, the research shows that those costs can be recouped by the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900004#B00200","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1664444400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I agree that investment in sport, physical activity and cultural opportunities yields huge benefits for young people.

That is why we have secured an overall &euro;60 million fund for community, arts, Gaeltacht and sporting organisations, with &euro;35 million directly for sport so we can mitigate some of the cost increases and support the membership and continued volunteerism that is central.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, the cost of this proposal would be around &euro;750 million across all age cohorts.

It has been transformative in Iceland and, as I said, the research shows that the money invested would come back.  As we know, given the current cost of living crisis, there are many families and working parents who, with childcare costs, mortgages and so on, cannot afford to pay for extracurricular classes.  There are also many families who just cannot afford it full stop.  In the long term, the benefits far outweigh the costs involved.

As I said, we have seen a step-change in investment in sport this year, with cost of living being a big dimension of it.

The council provides financial support to a number of single art form festivals, for example, theatre, dance and film, and such festivals are supported within the policy context of those art forms.  The council also supports many multidisciplinary arts festivals across different art forms, including literature, music, street arts, theatre, visual arts and different areas of arts practice.  Its festivals investment scheme, for example, is specifically designed to support local and voluntary organisations to develop arts festivals.  Further details can be accessed on the Arts Council's website.<\/p>  <p>  Through collaboration with the local authorities, F&aacute;ilte Ireland's regional festival scheme is available to local community festivals.  The scheme seeks to influence culture and arts sector investment in outdoor activation to enhance visitor experience in local communities aligned to tourism objectives.  Tourism Ireland is working closely with many festivals to provide exposure for them in key markets overseas.<\/p>  <p>  I might get more time to come back to the issue of insurance, which the Deputy specifically referenced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900004#B00800","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1664444400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I take the Minister of State&rsquo;s point that the Government supports many local festivals, fairs and so on.<\/p> <p>However, the issue for many of them is that they cannot get an insurance quote.

The 20-year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010&mdash;2030 represents the State's policy in relation to the language.  The strategy has cross-departmental ownership and, accordingly, responsibility for its implementation rests with several Departments, in addition to Irish-language and Gaeltacht institutions and organisations.  My Department is responsible for co-ordinating the implementation of the strategy.<\/p>  <p>  To accelerate implementation, my Department published a five-year action plan for the language in June 2018 following a public consultation process and extensive engagement with key stakeholders.  It contains more than 180 actions to be implemented over a five-year period by around 60 stakeholders across each of the nine areas of action set out in the strategy.  The plan provides for a more efficient framework that supports the ongoing implementation of the strategy and is focused on specific, measurable and time-bound activities.  The plan also serves to stimulate more efficient and effective participation with the overall objectives of the Government in relation to the Irish language in the context of the 20-year strategy.<\/p>  <p>  In line with a commitment made when the plan was first published, the Government publishes annually an implementation report covering all of the aforementioned actions contained in the action plan.  Further details of significant advances being made across Government in support of the Irish language can be found on my Department's websites.  Key actions include: the ongoing implementation of the language planning process under the Gaeltacht Act 2012; the ongoing implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022 being spearheaded by the Department of Education; the implementation of a range of programmes by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge aimed at strengthening the use of the language within the Gaeltacht and on an all-island basis; and the initial steps now in hand to develop a national plan for the provision of Irish-medium public services following the signing into law of the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that, with the additional financial allocations being provided for the language of &euro;8.5 million, my Department and other stakeholders will be enabled to take further significant strides in advancing implementation of the plan to the overall benefit of the Irish language and Gaeltacht regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900006#D04300","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1664445600,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I welcome the &euro;8.5 million the Minister of State mentioned for the Irish language and Gaeltacht.

This meets objective No. 9 in an strait&eacute;is, which is to ensure we will support \"High quality broadcast services through the medium of Irish...\".  It is good to see this specific objective is being met.  I turn to objective No. 7 as well, however, and this is something we need to work on.  Perhaps the Minister of State could work on it in conjunction with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  I was out in my front garden at the weekend with my child who attends a na&iacute;onra.  He picked up what turned out to be a dead leaf, but in his imagination it was a f&eacute;ileac&aacute;n.  For a three-year-old to come in and to use that kind of terminology and those words, which he has obviously picked up at the na&iacute;onra, shows the good work those schools do.  Will the Minister of State comment on whether any additional funding will be available to na&iacute;onra&iacute;, above that which normal, English-language schools receive?

This is something we must examine to ensure we can manage to nurture and foster this positive outlook among people seeking to acquire Irish at a young age.  I questioned that childcare provider and, to my knowledge, no funding is being received specifically to allow staff to go and improve their own language skills.  They are dealing with children.

Supports are also available for local businesses who might wish to create an Irish-language friendly environment in their workplace by using bilingual signage, for example.  The Foras na Gaeilge website, <i>www.forasnagaeilge.ie<\/i>, contains a section on funding schemes which lists the opportunities currently open to applications and also those where the application deadline has passed.

After the few difficult years that community groups experienced during the pandemic, this funding was made available to organise community events through Irish, helping to re-energise the use of Irish at face-to-face events.  This fund attracted a high level of interest from community groups; 171 applications were received by Conradh na Gaeilge under this scheme and funding was offered to 160 of the applicants.  A wide range of events were organised with something suitable for all ages and all levels of Irish.<\/p> <p> The Irish language supports schemes section in my Department directly funds a number of initiatives and projects with a voluntary element.

A report on that forum has been drafted and will help inform and direct the measures my Department takes to address youth participation in sport.<\/p>  <p>  In May 2021 Sport Ireland published its Participation Plan 2021-2024.  Sport Ireland is now undertaking several initiatives under that plan for children and young people, which will be delivered through local sports partnerships, national governing bodies and other partners.<\/p>  <p>  In 2021 Sport Ireland launched the research report, Adolescent Girls Get Active.  Following on from the report, Sport Ireland created a new funding strand through dormant accounts funding to support local sports partnerships in the creation of physical activity programmes targeting teenage girls.<\/p>  <p>  Sport Ireland is working to establish a brand identity for teenage girls' programmes rolled out by local sports partnerships and governing bodies.  Sport Ireland is also tendering for the roll-out of a communication and activation campaign targeting inactive teenage girls.  This will be the first time a dedicated national physical activity campaign has ever been created for this target group and highlights the commitment of Sport Ireland and the Government to trying to motivate teenage girls to be more active.<\/p>  <p>  We know from the research that a participation gap arises at this time in women's and girls' lives and that this has an impact on participation for many years, so we are trying to focus initiatives on that.

As the slogan goes, if they cannot see it, they cannot be it.  The platforming of young women and girls in sport is really important because, as the Minister of State rightly pointed out, those participation rates have fallen away.  I was Chair of the Committee on Children and Youth Affairs during the term of the previous D&aacute;il.  The committee did a comprehensive overview of childhood obesity and found that the drop-off rates in women's participation in sport at a young age is quite alarming.

I think that will complement the promotional campaigns Sport Ireland is running not only to try to activate that cohort of our population that is more likely to stop activity in sport but also to develop specific initiatives.  The key role of the local sports partnerships and the women in sport initiative is to drive that level of participation and to try to address the participation gap.  We are also clear that at a leadership level within sport there has to be increased activity in respect of our target of 40% of board members of our sporting organisations being women by the end of next year.

There is a role for the Department of Education to play in rolling out further improvements to the physical activity, PE, facilities in schools up and down the country.  There was a report a couple of years ago.  I cannot remember the precise figure but it was stark as to the number of schools that did not have PE halls and those sorts of activation measures, if we want to call them that.

There is a huge amount of PE and other activity during the day in those schools, and they open their doors for sporting organisations to use their facilities in the evening.  Other schools do not have the facilities and are closed when the school day finishes.  The Department of Education is on our sports leadership group.  We are trying to encourage that Department to communicate to schools that we really need to embrace that community partnership.  There is an opportunity, through the sports capital programme, for schools to apply with a sporting organisation or club such that if there is an all-weather pitch, they can build a pitch in partnership with a club for use by children during the day and the club has the benefit of the pitch after school.  That maximises the overall benefit of the capital investment the State makes where education and sport are combined, but we have more to do on that.

In the context of their respective roles, the focus of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media is on\u00a0the development of tourist traffic within or to the State and the development and marketing of tourist facilities and services in the State.  The wider hospitality sector is a key enterprise sector as well, providing employment to people all over the country.<\/p> <p>Specific policy areas within the T&aacute;naiste's Department, such as the operation of the work permits system, are vital factors in how that sector operates.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, regularly meets and remains open to engaging with a wide variety of tourism stakeholders and representative bodies.  Department officials have also engaged with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and tourism representative bodies in order to understand further underlying issues surrounding the recovery of the tourism sector and to emphasise the importance of maintaining a strong value proposition at the core of tourism.  The recovery oversight group recently submitted its fourth report to the Minister.  The report notes that while much headway has been made in implementing the recovery plan presented in September 2020, a range of current tourism challenges, as set out in the report, means that significant headwinds remain.<\/p> <p> Regarding addressing the rising costs of operation, the aim of budget 2023 is to support the tourism industry to recover and grow in a sustainable way.  A total of &euro;214.762 million has been allocated to the tourism sector.  A total of &euro;15 million in additional funding has been secured for overseas marketing of Ireland.  This includes &euro;5 million to develop further a new tourism initiative aimed at stimulating international demand.  An additional &euro;15 million is being provided for a range of industry initiatives including skills development and retention, domestic marketing, the hosting of American college football and sustainability.  Other allocations include &euro;36.5 million in capital funding for tourism product development for the continued delivery of enhanced visitor experiences.<\/p> <p> Budget 2023 includes wider measures that tourism businesses can avail of to assist with escalating energy costs and to plan for the future.  This includes a &euro;1.25 billion temporary business energy support scheme providing qualifying businesses with up to 40% of the increase in electricity or gas bills up to &euro;10,000 per month.  Departmental officials have sought clarification on a number of points of particular relevance to tourism to ensure the scheme offers the best possible support to the tourism sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900008#F01600","speaker":"1475","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664447400,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I raised similar points with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, last week but I am not convinced that the Government appreciates how many family-run businesses and SMEs are close to closing.  It is likely that many will at least shut temporarily during the winter and some may not reopen without proper support.  The VAT rate for the sector is increasing in March.  The exorbitant prices people have to pay for some Dublin hotels was cited as a rationale for the change to VAT but the whole sector will have to pay for that.  Rural businesses are suffering because of the prices charged in Dublin hotels.  Caf&eacute;s, restaurants, pubs and hotels in rural areas like west Cork need targeted interventions now because their closure will have a disproportionate effect not only in terms of people losing jobs, but a reduction in footfall will have a knock-on impact for suppliers and producers.<\/p>  <p>  Another operating cost of which the Minister of State will be aware is the insurance and financial fees that SMEs are being hit with.  I know this is not his Department's direct responsibility but it seriously impacts the viability of small businesses.  West Caf&eacute; and Wine Bar in Bantry, a family-owned business, posted on social media that it had to pay over &euro;800 in fees for card payments for just two months which is ridiculous.  During Covid going cashless was encouraged and now it is practically the norm but businesses are paying severely for that.  I ask the Minister of State to raise this issue with the Minister for Finance.  It is yet another operating cost for hard-pressed SMEs in the hospitality sector.  On top of those massive operational cost increases, businesses in Bantry have been forced to close today for a whole business day as the town is without power.  The ESB has cited essential maintenance but surely that kind of maintenance and disruption should be planned for overnight, for a Sunday or for any time that would avoid further massive disruption to already-struggling businesses.  We need joined-up thinking in this regard because there is only so much businesses can take.<\/p>  <p>  We need the Government to support and invest in family businesses and SMEs now because that will pay dividends down the road and save many towns and villages.

It is unfortunate that a day's business has been lost.  There should be better engagement on such matters.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's wider points, I will raise the issue of the cost of card payments with the Minister for Finance.  On the reduced VAT rate, as the Deputy knows, in line with the recommendation in the tourism recovery plan a reduced VAT rate of 9% for the sector was introduced from 1 November 2020.  It was originally designed to apply until the end of 2021 but this was extended to 31 August 2022 and later to February 2023.  Thousands of tourism and hospitality businesses across the country did not have to apply different VAT rates during the year which further enabled them to stabilise their businesses.  The reduced VAT rate promoted business survival, supported employment and helped somewhat to stabilise prices in the sector during what was a very difficult time because of Covid.  The reduced VAT rate has been a very important element of the business supports secured for the sector in the last two years as it is being rebuilt.  The Minister for Finance has referenced the reduced VAT rate as one of a number of supports the Government provided for tourism and hospitality businesses over the course of the pandemic but it was designed as a temporary measure, with a sunset clause included in the enacting legislation.  The rate will be kept under review, as the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht and Sport, Deputy Catherine Martin, has stated previously.<\/p>  <p>  The Government fully acknowledges the impact of inflation and the economic stresses and difficulties that businesses are facing, including food and energy costs, increased wages in a very competitive labour market, and the cost of insurance.  That is why the Government is providing significant support.  There is a lot of co-ordination between the tourism and hospitality sector, the Minister and the T&aacute;naiste.  The Government will really try to partner and support businesses over the winter period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900009#G00300","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1664447400,"counter":126,"content":"<p>While I acknowledge that there is lots of Government engagement with the sector, ultimately there is a significant discrepancy between what tourism and hospitality businesses in Cork south west are telling me and the messaging from the Minister of State, his Department and others.  The Government must be getting similar briefings to the ones I am getting but the urgency and need is not being reflected in Government policy or in the budget.  I recognise that this is a cross-departmental matter and appreciate the Minister of State saying that he will talk to various Ministers about the other relevant issues.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State's Department is responsible for tourism which is a major employer, especially in rural areas, where communities are solely dependent on tourism and agriculture.  I recognise what the Government has said about the VAT rate but the point I am trying to make is that there is such a profound difference between how businesses operate in rural areas and how they operate in Dublin.  If it is necessary to increase the hospitality VAT rate, can the Government provide more targeted supports for businesses in rural areas?  One cannot compare the kind of price gouging by hotels in the capital city with how hotels operate in more rural areas.  Somehow the Government could not figure out how to target particular households in the context of the energy crisis but it did manage to figure out how to do it for businesses.  Will the Department look at more targeted supports for businesses in more rural areas that cannot operate in the same way as the urban-based hotels, restaurants and caf&eacute;s?

The Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, launched the night-time economy support scheme, NTESS, on 22 June this year, in support of two recommendations in the report of the night-time economy task force, namely, actions 1 and 12.  The scheme has an overall allocation of &euro;4 million to provide support for cultural activity in pubs, nightclubs, caf&eacute;s and other suitable licensed and unlicensed premises during off-peak times.

I was really encouraged by the response to the scheme, which saw over 470 applications for funding processed with well in excess of 2,000 events being rolled out in cities, towns and villages right across the country.  The events range from live music, DJ nights, comedy nights, dance, theatre, literature and poetry, as well as art and photographic exhibitions.

As set out in the reply of 21 June from the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, the overall framework focuses on a number of key strategic areas that are the most important legacies for Galway as a European Capital of Culture including sustaining and strengthening existing partnerships, networks and opportunities in Europe and internationally, as well as forging new opportunities for Galway based artists and cultural organisations; drawing on the successful delivery of projects under the Galway 2020 programme to support new place-based cultural programming, including through the Irish language; and supporting the Galway cultural and creative sector to build capacity through training, advice and networking opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  Until the legacy framework is agreed I am not in a position to advise on the breakdown, but the framework will be published and will contain a breakdown of how the funding will be applied.

For example, it will include co-funding for successful applications to EU and international funding programmes, such as Creative Europe.  The funding will also build on the flagship placed-based programme under Galway 2020, Small Towns Big Ideas, with new calls for projects as well as initiatives aimed at sustaining and enhancing the capacity of artists and arts organisations to deliver projects of scale.

As we speak, there are 17,000 children waiting for initial contact with children's disability teams.  There are 2,500 children who are waiting for and overdue an assessment of needs.  As the T&aacute;naiste knows, these are crucial assessments the families and the children involved are entitled to, but they are being failed by a system that is totally unable to meet their needs.  The situation is dire.  It is continuing to get worse year after year under the Government.  The number of these assessments carried out by the HSE has plummeted.  Thousands of children are being failed by the State and left in limbo while they wait for care they are entitled to.<\/p>  <p>  I will tell the T&aacute;naiste about one of those children.  Uisneach turned 13 last month.  He received his official diagnosis of autism in an assessment report this week.  Uisneach is a lovely little boy who has a rare syndrome involving physical and intellectual disability.  His mother first asked for an autism assessment when he was six years old and beginning primary school.  He got that assessment this summer as he became a teenager, following seven long years of uncertainty and barely in time to make applications for secondary school.  Due to this shocking delay, Uisneach did not receive the supports of home tuition or July provision he was entitled to.  He had autism his entire life and should have been entitled to both these supports but because he did not have the formal assessment and diagnosis, he was excluded from these supports.  It was only after this official assessment was completed - seven years after it was requested - that his parents were directed for the very first time to any supports tailored for neurodiverse children.  Because everything is put on hold for the assessment to be completed, delayed assessments mean delayed access to supports.  Uisneach will not get that time back and he will not get back all the missed supports he was entitled to for many long years.  Neither will the 2,500 children who are waiting for assessments of needs that are overdue or the 17,000 waiting for initial contact.<\/p>  <p>  These families are left in limbo after reaching out for support.  They are being failed by the Government, and this is happening under its watch.  Ministers were out this week with announcements in the budget that sound impressive on the glossy surface.  When you scratch beneath the budgetary spin, however, it is clear the Government has not responded adequately to the situation.  The vast majority of money announced this week is to stand still, not to speed up, the delivery or assessments, or the badly-needed services that should follow these assessments.  The Government's disability capacity review made it clear the levels of funding that were required to meet the needs of children and adults across the State.  The Government provided a fraction of what was required.  In doing so, just like last year and the year before, the Government will fail these children and many others like them.<\/p>  <p>  When will the Government will deliver the investment needed to support these children and their families?  When will it provide the investment necessary to ensure that they get the fairness and respect they deserve in a timely manner, and not be obliged, like Uisneach and his family, to wait seven years to be given the supports they are entitled to from day one?  Will the Government rethink the budget decision and provide the resources to meet the needs of these children and deliver on the recommendation in its disability capacity review to the effect that substantial additional funding is required?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900012#K00500","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1664449200,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.

I am sorry to hear of the case the Deputy raised and hope Uisneach is getting the support he needs now.<\/p>  <p>  There are lots of delays in getting those assessments of need done for the children who need them.

We have seen a huge increase in spending on health and disability in recent years but money alone does not solve problems.  You need to recruit and retain staff, which is a challenge here and everywhere around the world at the moment.  You also need to be able to ensure your systems work well.  Perhaps we need to consider a change of approach here.  At the moment, you need to get your assessments of need before you get the therapies you need.  However, I know people who work in the sector would state that it does not necessarily have to be that way.  You could start providing therapies right away.  It can be very clear that some children need therapy.  The system we have at the moment where you wait for your assessment of need before you get the interventions is perhaps not the best option.  Where it is obvious a child needs a particular intervention or therapy, why do we not provide that straight away?  We need to provide additional resources, which is happening, and additional staff, which is a challenge.

Earlier this month, we learned that house prices had surpassed their Celtic tiger peak.  Never before in the history of the State have they been so high.  Workers and families are locked out of homeownership, stuck in a never-ending loop of paying extortionate rents but never being able to buy a home.  The housing disaster is causing untold human misery and pain.  Nowhere is this clearer than in the record numbers of people who are becoming homeless.  Homelessness is up by a massive 30% this year.  Child homelessness has skyrocketed by 47%.  Thousands of children are losing their childhoods while growing up in emergency accommodation.  This is happening on the Government's watch and it is getting worse.  People no longer believe the Government's promises on housing.  Why should they?  The reality is that under successive Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il Governments, levels of homeownership have collapsed.  The share of 25- to 34-year-olds who own their own homes more than halved between 2004 and 2019, falling from 60% to just 27%.  That is Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il's record on homeownership - a generation of young people who no longer hold out any hope of one day owning their own homes.  None of the Government's targets on affordable housing has been delivered.  Last year it did not manage to build a single affordable home, not even one.  This year will not be much better.  The Cabinet sub-committee on housing has been told that targets for affordable and social homes have no hope of being met.  Those targets were not ambitious enough to start with.<\/p>  <p>  Faced with this disaster and litany of failure, what is the Government's response to the affordability crisis?  It is not to build more affordable homes or to meet its own targets.  Instead, it is to make homes even more unaffordable.  The Government has decided to introduce a levy on concrete blocks that will add a further &euro;3,000 to &euro;4,000 to the price of a home.  On what planet does this make sense?  Does the Government really propose to place the cost of shoddy building work and defective materials onto the shoulders of people who are struggling to buy a home?  Can the T&aacute;naiste explain?  Why has the Government not directly pursued those responsible for construction defects as it promised?  Why are quarries that are producing defective materials still being allowed to operate?  That is what the Oireachtas housing committee was told by experts a few months ago.  Is the Government going to abandon its plans to impose this unfair levy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900013#L00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1664449800,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that the housing shortage is an enormous challenge facing our country and people of all age groups, but particularly young people.  It is the case that Ireland is a country with high homeownership.  Some 60% or 70% of people own their own homes.  That is a good thing.  However, that is not the reality for people in their late 20s and early 30s, when it used to be.  Probably only 30-something per cent of people in that age group own their own home and it would have been much higher 20 years ago.  That is a breach of the social contract, in my view.  If somebody works hard, plays by the rules and saves some money, they should be able to buy their home.  That has become harder and harder over the past 20 years, and I acknowledge that.<\/p>  <p>  The reasons for this are myriad.  We have a booming population and smaller households.  We had a collapse in the construction industry 12 years ago that we have still not recovered from.  We are essentially running up an escalator that is moving in the other direction.  We are making some progress.  Approximately 25,000 new homes were built in the past 12 months, the highest figure in ten or 11 years and certainly since the current data were collected.  We have had about 15,000 first-time buyers in the past year.  That is really encouraging because it is the highest in 15 years.  It is not enough, however.  I would like to see the number of new homes being built closer to 40,000 or 50,000 and the number of first-time buyers close to double what it is now.  That has to be our objective.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of what we are doing about it, the response is to increase supply.  We are doing absolutely everything we can to increase supply.  Only yesterday, I had some discussions about that with people involved in the business.  In the budget we extended the help-to-buy scheme, which helps people to buy their first homes.  The Deputy will know from the independent report that it is the authors' view that the scheme has not had an upward pressure effect on house prices.  That is not my view, it is the view of the independent analysis.  All the more reason, I believe, to extend that, and it has been extended for two years.  We are providing people with grants to do up old and derelict properties and turn them into homes.  I really hope that turns out to be a big success.  That also applies to sites in small rural towns and villages.  We have the first home scheme.  This is an affordable home scheme in respect of which we are getting really good feedback and strong interest.  That scheme is helping to bridge the gap.  If somebody can get a mortgage for &euro;250,000 but the house they want or need to buy is &euro;320,000, we can bridge the gap through shared equity.  We are seeing a lot of interest in that programme.  If it turns out to be oversubscribed, as it may well be, we should expand it if we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900013#L00300","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1664449800,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I asked three specific questions.

The Government can help, however, and it wants to help the kind of people the Deputy mentioned.<\/p>  <p>  How can we help?  As the Deputy knows, there will be a fuel allowance cash payment that people in receipt of the fuel allowance will receive in the next couple of weeks.  In addition, we are extending eligibility for the fuel allowance to many more people.  That will kick in from the new year, subsequent to the social welfare Bill being passed by this House.  A double social welfare payment will be paid in the next few weeks.  For people not in receipt of social welfare, there will be a double child benefit payment and a double working family payment.  That will help people with their essential bills a lot.  An energy credit of &euro;200 will be paid before Christmas and a further two credits, each for &euro;200, will be paid after Christmas.  These credits will run through to March.  Then there are the emergency needs payments that are available from the community welfare service.<\/p>  <p>  That is the kind of help the Government is offering in the round.  I hope that answers the Deputy&rsquo;s question in terms of what we can do to help people who are pay-as-you-go customers.  I have outlined many different actions.  The Deputy asked whether we can do it without limits.  I do not think so.  I do think we can say to anyone that we can cover the cost of their electricity or gas without limits.  No matter who it is, I do not think that would be reasonable or right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900014#M00200","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1664450400,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I am gobsmacked by the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s reply.

They are the people who have been disconnected in the past and put onto the meters and are, in many cases, the lower-income people in society.  Many of them are vulnerable individuals.  The T&aacute;naiste stated that there is the fuel allowance, the community welfare officer and energy credits.  That will be fine; it will get many of those people through the winter.

There is no shortage of statistics thanks to Trolley Watch.  While numbers fluctuate day on day, if we look at the trends, we will see what is happening.  If we look at this year, from January to August, we see that compared with all other hospitals, SUH started off in January as the fifth worst.  As the year progressed, it went from fourth to third.  When we get to August, because that is the last full month, we see that it was in the fourth-worst position.  The figures in September show a distinct disimprovement.  The headline figures for the month of August, which show Sligo with 720 people waiting, do not tell the full story.  One needs to look at the capacity of any hospital, such as the number of beds and staff, because that, to a large extent, determines how it can manage those waiting on beds.  If we look at August of this year and compare bed capacity in Sligo and Limerick, for example, which is meant to be perhaps one of the worst hospitals from the perspective of those on trolleys and waiting for beds, we see that Sligo is the worst of all the hospitals in the country.  That is measure of the real challenge that is facing SUH, not the headline figures that are screaming at us at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste is well familiar with this issue, not just from my interventions, but from his party's councillors and Government Deputies, some of whom described the situation recently as truly shocking.  They are right; the situation is truly shocking and completely unacceptable.  The situation, while it is worsening, has not crept up on us by stealth; rather, it has worsened year on year.  If the T&aacute;naiste looks at the figures back from 2006, he will see that those figures are getting worse year on year.  All hospitals have experienced increases, but Sligo is the worst.<\/p>  <p>  That is why I am asking the T&aacute;naiste for an immediate, short-term response for the coming winter-spring period.  I know there are longer-term plans for a 42-bed unit, and we are waiting on that.  However, we need immediate action.  The hospital is under severe pressure.  Staff are under huge stress and suffering burnout.  Covid tested all of us, but it tested healthcare staff more than others.  As we face into uncertain winter and spring in the context of Covid and flu, what short-term messages can the Government put in place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900014#M00600","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1664450400,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Harkin for raising this important question and raising SUH again in the D&aacute;il.

I acknowledge the Deputy&rsquo;s point that ten people on trolleys in a small department, such as Naas or Portiuncula, for example, is worse than ten in a very large department, such as, for example, St. James&rsquo;s or St. Vincent&rsquo;s.<\/p>  <p>The Deputy makes a valid point and I acknowledge it.<\/p> <p> With regard to short-term actions, the HSE is currently preparing its comprehensive winter plan.  That will include bespoke local plans for Sligo University Hospital and the community healthcare area of which it is part.  It is being finalised and will be brought to the Government very shortly.  In the meantime, funding has been provided for actions to take place this year.  These include GP and out-of-hours support, the extension of the local injury unit operating hours, transition-care funding and short-stay respite services.  Across the country, the HSE has been instructed to recruit an additional 51 emergency medicine consultants, including on a locum basis, if necessary.<\/p> <p> Attendances in Sligo have been very high relative to the predicted range for September.

There will be a bespoke winter plan for Sligo, taking into account not only the hospital but also the community services in the wider area.  Diagnostics can help quite soon.  I know from bitter experience, both as a doctor and Minister for Health, that patients very often must wait a long time in hospitals, particularly over weekends, to get the scans or tests they need.  Then they must wait for a senior decision-maker to decide whether they need to stay or can go home.  Just having more diagnostics, particularly in the evenings and at weekends, and having senior decision-makers on site, can speed up services.  Just reducing the average length of stay by half a day can be as good as providing dozens or hundreds of additional beds across the health service.  You need to do all of these things to reduce the average length of stay, and also provide additional bed and staff capacity.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy mentioned, there are plans for a new four-storey block for the hospital.

Sin mo ch&uacute;pla pointe as Gaeilge.<\/p> <p>I have a few questions on the education side of things.  This area was close to the Minister of State's own heart in his previous role, so I know he will still have good channels of communication with his colleague, the senior Minister, Deputy Foley, in the Department of Education.  I ask him to raise these questions with her.  The Minister mentioned that the mental health pilot would be rolled out following engagement and consultation with stakeholders.  Can the timeline for this engagement process be outlined, as well as the thinking regarding when this pilot should be up and running?  Teachers' representatives should also be included in those conversations, particularly those from the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, which campaigned for its representatives to be included at the beginning.  Will the Minister of State also ask the Minister, Deputy Foley, to outline a breakdown of the figures for the new mainstream teachers who are to be provided to special education classes?  The Minister flagged an overall number of 686.  Will she break this total down by special education teachers, SETs, special class teachers and special schoolteachers at primary level?  Undoubtedly, the Minister of State is in no position to be taking note of all these questions in shorthand now.  I know he probably does have a very good memory, but no doubt some officials in the Department will also be listening.<\/p> <p> Turning to class sizes, in the press conference yesterday where it was announced there would be a reduction of one in class sizes, the Minister also said she would like to see another reduction next year.  Will she restate that commitment?  Regarding capitation, and I raised this already, schools have warmly welcomed the once-off 40% increase in direct funding for this year.  They have also, however, genuine and serious concern that the capitation payment is not increasing from September 2023.  Therefore, is there a contingency plan in the event that schools are in financial difficulties next autumn?  There are many moving parts in this context in respect of costs, especially energy costs, and global challenges.  It is difficult to start projecting as far away as September 2023, but I think there are ways of allaying these fears.<\/p> <p> I see my time is coming to an end.  I am grateful for having had the opportunity to speak.  I will stick within my allotted time because I am very grateful for the c&uacute;pla bomaite chun labhairt inniu.

This is a budget that recognises the challenges of today and invests in our future.

As a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister in a coalition Government, I am delighted to be supporting this budget.  I am very proud that the principles of my party have been put forward in this budget by our Ministers, together with those from the other parties.  I am very proud that Fianna F&aacute;il is in government and that we are making real changes that are putting money into people's pockets.<\/p>  <p>  Undoubtedly, people are facing hardships.  Therefore, we have put together the largest social protection budget day package in the history of the State.  As the old saying goes, we cannot change the direction of the wind, but we can adjust the sails.  Ireland is a small, open economy and we cannot always control events, but we can decide how we respond.  Thanks to our strong economy and full employment, we can respond aggressively to this crisis.  In Ireland today, more than 2.5 million people are in employment.  This is the most people who have ever been at work.  All we hear, though, day in and day out from the Opposition are complaints and problems to be exploited, with no solutions offered and no recognition that this country is in one of its best places ever and that this situation has enabled us to undertake the redistribution we have in this budget.<\/p>  <p>  I am very proud of the role that Fianna F&aacute;il is playing in this Government by delivering the type of progressive and protective measures we have announced.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach said here that there is a divide between those who want to solve problems on this side of the House and those among the extreme left that we have for an Opposition who wish to exploit problems.  Many in the Opposition scramble for sound bites.  Fianna F&aacute;il is finding solutions to problems people are facing today.  As we demonstrated during the Covid-19 pandemic, we will not shy away from taking decisive actions in the interests of the people, and of all the people.<\/p>  <p>  In primary education, our history demonstrates the transformative effects education can have on our society.  I look back to our Constitution in 1937, to Donogh O'Malley and his contribution to education, that of Patrick Hillery in expanding third-level education and even that of Eamon de Valera in bringing Trinity College Dublin, TCD, into the State system.  We have much to be proud of in this country.  All that history and the progress we have made is continually denigrated by those on the Opposition benches.  I am certainly not going to continue to accept that.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is now reducing class sizes and reducing costs for families and there has also been a huge increase in funding at every level in education.  We now have a historically-low staffing ratio at primary level.  We can see this already when we visit primary schools, with smaller classes than we saw several years ago.  This will improve even further next year.  Turning to special education, we are doing a great deal in this area.  We always need to do more, because, quite frankly, it seems there are more children with diagnoses who need the attention of the State and extra supports in primary and secondary schools.  Moving on to third level, I am also glad to see that a significant proportion of those who have got college places this year have got there via the higher education access route, HEAR, or disability access route to education, DARE, schemes.  It is great to see that level of inclusivity at third level.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, I attended the GradIreland careers fair at the RDS.  What I was struck by most was the positive energy to be found among those students, mainly final year students and recent graduates.  They are interested in the future.  To me, they were inspiring.  Notwithstanding the problems that are out there and that must be faced, the aspirations, excitement and interest those students have is never reflected on the Opposition benches.  We never hear about creating opportunities in this country.  We never hear about what investment we are going to have to undertake to ensure there are jobs for our graduates.  We have record numbers of job openings now.<\/p>  <p>  We also have record numbers of young people attending third-level education.  I salute them and we will work in every way to support them.  This is why the student contribution fee has been reduced this year.  There will also be a permanent reduction next year as well for most students.  Taking last year's budget, for example, we changed the adjacency rules which means that more people qualify for the non-adjacent grant rate.  In Meath East, this decision has meant the grant situation has changed drastically for those students living in Donore, for example, and studying in Dundalk or those living in Dunshaughlin and studying in University College Dublin, UCD.<\/p> <p>This is about fairness.<\/p> <p> On pensions, budget 2023 delivers for everybody in society.  That is what Fianna F&aacute;il has always been about.  At the outset, the &euro;12 a week increase is an additional &euro;624 for recipients annually.  A once-off double week will be paid to pensioners, at Halloween and at Christmas as well.  There will be a lump sum of &euro;400 for those in receipt of fuel allowance.  Living alone allowance will involve a lump sum payment as well.<\/p> <p> Significantly, the qualification threshold for fuel allowance is being increased from the new year.  This will bring over 90,000 pensioners into the fuel allowance scheme.  One of the main complaints I get from pensioners who may have a very small pension to put with their State pension is that they do not have fuel allowance.  Tens of thousands of those pensioners will now be brought in.<\/p> <p> On the EU, we have seen a real positive impact over many decades of EU funding.  That continues through the PEACE PLUS programme, which the Government will be contributing to along with the UK and the EU.  The Government has received, and it is still distributing, &euro;1 billion of funding from the Brexit adjustment reserve and I am proud to have played my role in helping to negotiate that.  That continues.  Ireland will receive almost &euro;1 billion in EU funding from the recovery and resilience facility but, more importantly, Irish companies will be able to benefit from that facility all around Europe because we have one of the most export-driven economies.<\/p> <p> I look forward to this budget being passed.  I am glad of the important assistance in the form of energy supports that has been given to our citizens.  We will continue along that path towards income equality that we have worked on for many decades .  All of the statistics show that the position in this regard has only been improving in recent years, despite what the Opposition would tell you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900020#V00700","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664454300,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I want to make reference, in the context of my portfolio, to the experience I had in the past month.  I visited the Horn of Africa, in particular Kenya and South Sudan, and witnessed first-hand the absolute devastation that is happening there.  People are at risk of famine of a scale we have not perhaps seen since the mid-1980s.  People are currently dying.  There were children suffering from malnutrition, the impact of which I saw first-hand.  Mothers, fathers and community leaders talked to me directly.  They asked if I would do two things.  They asked if, when I returned to Ireland, I would talk about this matter and be their voice.  They also asked if I would make sure that the Government continues to support them.  Ireland is one of the key providers of support in this area through the work of Irish Aid and through the incredible work of the Irish NGOs that are helping on the ground, day in and day out, along with their UN support colleagues to deal with this situation. <\/p>  <p>  I was incredibly proud that as part of this budget we are doing two key things in respect of the Horn of Africa.  First, we are making &euro;30 million of extra funding available immediately.  That will make a difference.  It will enable those NGOs to continue their work.  We need to see other countries come play their part, but we will very much continue to play ours in terms of what we can do.  Critically, we have increased our overseas development assistance budget.  This will increase to &euro;1.2 billion as part of the budget.  That is a 17% increase.  Last year was the first year that we crossed the &euro;1 billion threshold.  This year the amount involved will increase to &euro;1.2 billion.  This represents a steady and significant growth in what we are doing.  As we all know from the various other aspects of this budget, there were many calls in respect of the resources we have available.  However, in the context of some of the most vulnerable people in the world, we are reaching out and recognising what our role is internationally.  That role involves being a country that has a proud aid programme that is admired and recognised for targeting those who are farthest behind and helping them the most.  That is something we will continue to do as part of the aid programme, particularly in the Horn of Africa where we will be to the forefront in the next year as we have been in previous years.<\/p>  <p>  We also recognise our commitment to Ukraine and to the impact the unjustified horrible war started by Putin has had on people's lives.  We will continue - and we will make extra funding available - to support Ukraine and to respond to that crisis.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to address the other aspect of my Ministry.  I am the Minister of State with responsibility for the Irish diaspora.  It has been an incredibly rewarding job because the diaspora is at the heart of what is good about Irish people no matter where they are in the world.  We have a programme which supports the diaspora.  That programme, the emigrant support programme, has supported more than 530 organisations with grants of over &euro;200 million since it started in 2004.  It is incredible to see - I have had the opportunity to do so first-hand - the work that Irish organisations do right across the UK, the United States, Australia and New Zealand.  Anywhere they are, Irish people are willing to come together and work in community-based organisations to help others who left this country, whether it was in the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1950s or more recently.  A tremendous aspect of the support and work is there for our culture, for our games and for all that we associate with Ireland as part of the work which we do.  We have a &euro;12.5 million programme that we will take into next year.  That will enable those organisations to continue to meet the challenges they face on a daily basis in supporting those Irish communities.  I look forward to working with them as part of that process.<\/p>  <p>  Those are the two areas of my direct responsibility within the budget.  It is an excellent budget that shows clearly the three parties in government working together to deliver.  It is a budget which, at its heart, is all about fairness and support and helping our people in communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900021#W00200","speaker":"1573"},{"type":"speech","time":1664454300,"counter":259,"content":"<p>Deputy McAuliffe is down for four minutes but there are more minutes left because the other speaker is not here.

There will be thousands of members from across the country who will be coming to the Ard-Fheis for the first time since we entered Government.  Many of them can be proud of the budget that we have presented to this House.  There are many shared goals with our coalition partners, but I can see Fianna F&aacute;il's fingerprints all over this budget.  I can also see the values that many of those members of the party have in the detail of the budget.  Despite the Opposition trying to present it as a collection of bankers and developers being at the Ard-Fheis, those involved will be people from every community.  It is those people who will benefit from this budget.  There will be families with young children who will be paying less in childcare.  There will be families with children in primary school who will be paying less because they will have free schoolbooks.  There will be families with students who will be paying less because of the reduction in student contribution fees.  There will be people who need the State's support who will get one of the largest increases in social welfare, including targeted supports.  All of those communities right across Ireland, including older people who will have additional access to the fuel allowance and, importantly, the better energy warmer homes scheme, which will allow them to insulate their homes for free, will benefit from this budget.<\/p>  <p>  They will come to the Ard-Fheis this weekend with higher energy bills.  In order to resolve that, we have put in place a sustainable, affordable, costed, implementable way of tackling the energy crisis.  It will not negate all of the increases that Putin has imposed on the people of Europe and I look forward to seeing the European co-ordinated approach on a windfall tax because that will help fund us.<\/p>  <p>  This Government has managed the economy in a way that we can make an &euro;11 billion intervention without borrowing.  That is significant.  We do not want to create &euro;11 billion to put into our back pocket.  We want to distribute it, support people and tackle some of the issues that have been as problems for more than a decade, particularly those in the area of women's healthcare.  We now have free contraception for all women under 30.  We will have zero VAT on period products and zero VAT on hormone replacement therapy, HRT, and a new publicly funded IVF model.<\/p> <p>These are the many interventions that people have talked about for some time and that had not been addressed but that have now been addressed by this Government.  We can vote for the resources in the budget, but the challenge will be for us to actually implement them.  In this budget there is more money for people with special needs and more money for SNAs, with provision for more than 20,000 SNAs.  The secret and the job of government is to implement such resources.  We have managed the economy, protected families, protected incomes and ensured that jobs stay in place.  Now we have to get on with the job of delivering these programmes in order that people can benefit from them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900021#W00400","speaker":"1568","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664454900,"counter":262,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to speak.<\/p>  <p>  Delivering a budget - or delivering an alternative budget, as many Opposition parties do - is challenging and onerous, and they are pretty difficult to put together.  Therefore, while I do not agree with much of what is in the Government's budget, I wish to state for the record that I recognise that the elements I disagree with are the result of the Government making poor political choices and not the result of any effort on behalf of the officials who work behind the scenes to put the budget together.  Similarly, I thank the policy team in our party for putting together our alternative budget document.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2023 was delivered as Irish households face the biggest drop in living standards since the 2008 financial crisis as earnings from work fail to keep pace with soaring inflation.  We have just been treated to a couple of minutes of the greatest hits of Fianna F&aacute;il.  However, the party's Deputies left out the economic crash.  They left out my poor auntie, who has to talk to her kids on Skype.  They left out the fact that Fianna F&aacute;il brought this country to its knees and drove it over a cliff.  When they talk about Fianna F&aacute;il and how proud they are of its legacy, let them not forget what that legacy is and how it is felt in every single home the length and breadth of this State.  I will not thank anyone in Fianna F&aacute;il for a trip down memory lane with them because the memories for many people, in my family and in other families, are painful.  As Deputies pointed out, we see again the icy cold hands of Fianna F&aacute;il all over this budget and, indeed, the hands of their very best friends in Fine Gael.  There has never been more than the width of a piece of paper between the two parties when it has come to policy decisions.  It is not so much that the Opposition is the hard left, as was described, but, rather, that we face the hard right every day, which I think has its effect on how we appear to the Government.<\/p>  <p>  Many workers have waited all year for this budget.  They wanted to see what the State would do to ensure that their work would pay.  There are many things the Government can do to influence how we make work pay, but two areas are the national minimum wage and the delivery of collective bargaining for trade unions.  Workers are being battered by the cost-of-living crisis.  The 80 cent increase in the national minimum wage is far from what was needed to ensure that work pays.  Furthermore, the increase is totally inadequate as the first step towards progressing to a living wage.  Again we see the contradiction at the heart of some governments.  They say they are interested in a living wage, but when the opportunity is presented, as it is every year at the time of the budget, to move meaningfully towards a living wage, that very small step is not taken, which makes me think they are not serious about delivering a living wage at all.  In recent months there have been increases in rents and fuel, food and energy costs, to name but a few, which has meant that the cost of living has spiralled out of control for workers.  A real and substantial increase in the minimum wage on the journey towards a living wage was what was needed in budget 2023.  The recommendation by the Low Pay Commission, which was agreed by the Government, absolutely failed to grasp this.  It was no wonder to me that the trade union representatives issued a minority report and dissented from that 80 cent recommendation.  I said the same to the chair of the Low Pay Commission at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade, and Employment yesterday.  A higher minimum wage could have helped business by driving higher consumer demand.  I think we all know that workers on low incomes, when they get money in, spend that money.  They spend it locally and in the domestic economy.  Increasing the minimum wage and moving meaningfully towards a living wage is an investment in local business.  The Government's recommendation of a minimum wage of &euro;11.30 represents a 7.6% increase.  It does not keep pace with inflation and, as Government members will know because we have said it to them time and again, if it does not keep pace with inflation, it is effectively a pay cut for the lowest income workers in this State.  Yet yesterday and in the run-up to the budget we heard again from big business owners and their representatives that a small increase, a modest increase, in the minimum wage would hit them hard.  They should know, however, that that money will go directly into their budget and their coffers.<\/p>  <p>  This is the third budget in a row in which billions of euro in funding and supports have been provided, very rightly, to businesses to keep them afloat, particularly to those businesses that are vulnerable but viable.  They absolutely need that.  However, they should not be allowed to do what they did after Covid and pay massive dividends to their shareholders.  The supports that are there should be for the businesses that need it.  When businesses talk about welfare for themselves on the one hand, they need to understand that that is a two-way street and that workers have to benefit as well.  Often the people on the business side of the House will say that more money in the economy through wage increases will cause a cost-of-living spiral.  Of course it will not, no more than putting money into businesses to keep them afloat will cause an inflationary spiral.<\/p>  <p>  While there is stuff in this budget that one would welcome absolutely, there is an awful lot in it that will not deliver, particularly for low-income workers.  That is a shame.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900022#X00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1664454900,"counter":263,"content":"<p>This budget is akin to trying to put out a fire with a watering can.  It is a waste of effort.  There are billions being spent but spent in favour of high earners, vested interests, golden circles, vulture funds, developers and institutional landlords.  It is payback for the Fine Gael core voter, with the odd crumb for the few people who will vote Fianna F&aacute;il and the Greens in the next election.  We will be told that trickle-down economics will be the rising tide that raises all boats.  However, as our older people, the working poor and anyone living in rural Ireland will tell the Government, trickle-down economics does not exist.  The difference between the have-yachts and the have-nots is that the have-yachts have a boat to be risen.  Our older people and ordinary workers and their families are left to try to keep their heads above water.  It is telling that those earning &euro;100,000 will benefit four times more than those earning &euro;35,000.  In reality, those low-income earners and our older people will see meagre increases quickly eroded by inflation, carbon tax and spiralling rents.  What is also telling is Fine Gael Deputies' defending single people earning more than &euro;70,000 getting support from the State with their energy bills.  It is a damning indictment of the Government's performance that it feels that people on relatively good incomes need support from the State.<\/p>  <p>  There will be no change for teachers struggling to find affordable homes to rent.  So much for the hope to reduce pupil-teacher ratios.  Unless the Government has plans for robot teachers, I do not know what it is going to do.  There will be no change for nurses starting at the bottom of the ladder.  They want to stay to try to fix our health service but are being forced to move abroad, where they can afford to live.  Of course, that suits the Government as the majority of our young people can see that Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are bad for them and bad for this country.<\/p>  <p>  The budget forecasts that the economy will flatline next year at 0.4%.  It also predicts that inflation will rise by 16% over this year and next year.  There is little in the budget to deal with the fallout from this.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's fully costed alternative budget favours our older people and ordinary workers and their families.  It provides targeted support to those who need it most, not a golden shower for those at the top.  Sinn F&eacute;in in government will cut childcare costs by two thirds, not the quarter promised in this budget.  It will value our older people, people with different abilities and those who care for those people.<\/p>  <p>  Active Retirement Ireland - not Sinn F&eacute;in - stated that this budget falls short in protecting older people against the cost-of-living crisis.  It stated that the winter fuel allowance will not go far enough for older people after two increases in gas and electricity costs in 2022 alone.  The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, was patting himself on the back for that a few moments ago.  He needs to stop.  Active Retirement Ireland goes on to state that the budget does not go far enough for the most vulnerable.  We need to see the charge for blood tests and prescription costs scrapped in order to make healthcare more affordable.  Budget 2023 is falling short for our older people, who deserve to live with security, independence and dignity.  A Sinn F&eacute;in government would support households through the winter months by reducing electricity prices, rolling out cost-of-living payments to assist with other energy costs and protecting the most vulnerable.<\/p> <p>In 2023, we would deliver an income tax package to put money back into people's pockets, reduce the cost of fuel, support renters and shield lower-and middle-income householders from the impact of inflation.  Sinn F&eacute;in would give workers and families a break.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900022#X00300","speaker":"1588","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664455500,"counter":265,"content":"<p>In the short time available to me I will raise a number of issues, some of which pertain to my own constituency of Limerick while others relate to the Minister of State's brief of enterprise.  I welcome some of the measures in the budget but am really disappointed by others, particularly those relating to rent.  While the &euro;500 tax credit will be welcomed by a lot of renters, it will not go far in easing the cost of renting in Limerick and across the State.  The Government said previously that a rent tax credit without rent certainty and a rent freeze would be a transfer of Exchequer funds directly to landlords and that is exactly what is going to happen with the new tax credit.  For most people, it only amounts to around two weeks' rent, given current rent rates.  Rents in my own city have increased by 15.5% in the last year, while the number of properties available to rent continues to decline.  There has been no real movement in this area and the renters I have spoken to in the last day or two are really disappointed.  They were expecting some sort of bailout.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State knows well, the housing crisis is probably the number one issue we are facing across the State.  It is having a huge impact on everything else.  FDI companies I met recently told me they are putting projects on hold because they cannot get staff because there is nowhere for them to live.  People are stuck in emergency accommodation, those on the social housing waiting lists have no chance of ever getting a house and those renting who want to buy their own homes have no chance of doing so either.  <\/p>  <p>  The other issue in my constituency that I have raised consistently since I was elected in 2016 is the chaotic situation in the emergency department at University Hospital Limerick, UHL, but there was no plan in the budget yesterday to address it.  The only plan the Government has is to deliver a 96-bed unit which, in effect, will deliver 48 new beds in two years' time.  That is simply not enough.  In order to bring UHL up to the level of other comparable hospitals, it would need an additional 200 beds but there is no plan from the Government to provide such.  It has told the people of Limerick and the mid west to suck oranges.  The people have been abandoned but they deserve much better.<\/p>  <p>  The next issue I wish to raise is that of low pay.  During the pandemic we were all appreciative of the low-paid workers who kept shops open.  We were grateful to the cleaners and others earning the minimum wage or, in some cases, even less.  They were expecting some recognition in this budget.  If this really was the \"give-away\" budget some have described, it would not contain a minimum wage increase of only 80 cent.  That is pathetic.  As Deputy O'Reilly said, the Mandate trade union has said it represents a pay cut once inflation is taken into consideration.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to move towards a living wage but there have been no significant increases to the minimum wage in the first three years of this Government's term and this 80 cent increase will not take us much closer to a living wage.  This is a missed opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  The final issue I want to raise relates to the enterprise brief and is yet another missed opportunity.  In 2019 on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in I launched a policy proposal on the establishment of an Irish enterprise agency.  In short that policy seeks to reorganise the 31 individual local enterprise offices, LEOs, into one centrally-led, national jobs agency with the aim of supporting and growing indigenous Irish businesses.  The policy recognises the imbalance in our industrial strategy and the State's huge dependence on foreign direct investment, FDI, in terms of both jobs and tax intake.  The purpose of the new State jobs agency would be to grow our indigenous business sector to provide balance in our economy, workforce and public finances.  The Sinn F&eacute;in policy document highlighted our severe over-reliance on FDI for jobs and for the State's tax income without dismissing the hugely positive impact of hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs provided by FDI.  We need to refocus the State's attention on domestic business.<\/p>  <p>  The new agency, in addition to providing business supports to SME owners, would encourage good pay and working conditions for employees and develop remote working hubs in regional Ireland, thus helping to address the decline of many of our town centres.  The agency would also have a multimillion seed capital investment fund which could be used to take equity stakes in start-ups or existing businesses, similar to what Enterprise Ireland does with exporters.  These investments could provide stability to businesses, protect jobs and allow businesses to scale up.  In return, dividends on profits would be returned to the Irish enterprise agency and the State for further investment.  Companies would be expected to show that all employees have good pay and fair working conditions, including proof that no gender pay gap exists, to be eligible for any State financial support from the agency.<\/p>  <p>  In October 2020, in response to my questions in the D&aacute;il, the T&aacute;naiste gave a commitment to consider the establishment of an Irish enterprise agency specifically focused on helping micro-businesses, co-operatives, and SMEs.  In that context, it is disappointing not to see a commitment in budget 2023 to establish such an agency in order to protect our economy going forward.  This is a missed opportunity.  I urge the Government, having forgotten about it in budget 2023, to act as a matter of urgency and establish an Irish enterprise agency or similar body.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900023#Y00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1664455500,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I will focus during my six and a half minute contribution on health and transport.  On health, I will focus on three areas that relate to the rights of workers in the health service on which this budget has either been silent or has failed to react appropriately.  The first relates to recruitment and retention across all levels of care but in particular in our acute hospitals and across the grades of nursing, midwifery, healthcare assistants and others.  We have a story to tell that starts off well when it comes to nursing in this country.  We have around 1,800 new nursing graduates every year and immediately after graduating, approximately 96% of them stay to work in Ireland.  However, that number quickly evaporates as the harshness of the conditions of working and living in Ireland, in terms of trying to afford housing, build a life and have a good standard of living, begins to bite.  We are losing nurses at an unbelievable rate, as well as other grades across the health service.  Approximately 6,000 health service employees will be recruited as part of this year's budget but we do not know where they will be recruited from.  The vast majority of our nursing staff are now recruited from overseas.  They are really well trained and are great workers but we are not able to retain them either because the same housing and cost of living issues impact them as much as they impact the graduates that come through our own education system.  We are allowing really great trained staff, irrespective of where they were trained, to slip between our fingers.  The staff in our health service are working their fingers to the bone.  We applauded them during the pandemic and did everything we could to try to acknowledge them during the crisis.  They are still working their fingers to the bone, covering shifts and trying to ensure that we have a health service that functions.<\/p>  <p>  I received a reply to a parliamentary question today on pandemic recognition payments for healthcare staff who do not work in the HSE.  Incredibly, the tendering process for a company to administer and process those payments only finished this week.  An external company is being brought in to try to find all of the eligible healthcare staff in our hospices, nursing homes, section 39 organisations in the community, and in home help and home care agencies and process their payments.  It is an absolute shambles.  The chance of these workers getting their payment before Christmas, never mind as part of this budget, is diminishing ever further.  That is a failure of the workers in our health service.  We are also failing our section 39 workers who have been conducting a 14-years-and-counting campaign for pay restoration and pay increases.  Such pay increases are long overdue but these workers remain outside any formal process and are not even being dealt with at arms' length.  The trade unions that represent them are not getting a response from Ministers to their letters.  These are the workers who work with the most vulnerable in our communities.  They need help and support but they are not getting it from their own Government.  This budget was silent on all of these issues.  The recruitment and retention crisis in our health service is going to continue because it will not be resolved by this budget.<\/p> <p> On transport, the Labour Party asked for a radical proposal, namely, a &euro;9 monthly climate card.  That would do one of two things, one of which is increase the number of people who would use public transport through vastly reducing the cost.  As a follow-on, it would improve Ireland meeting its carbon targets, on which we are way behind.  Transport is a key reason for that.  The measures announced were continuations of what are good measures, in terms of the fare reductions that have already been put in place, but they are not the radical measures we need to encourage people into public transport or to meet our climate targets.  <\/p> <p> We have anomalies in those schemes.  For example, there is a crazy situation on the north county line where towns like Balbriggan and Skerries are outside of the 90-minute fare, even though people within those towns can get to where they need to go, be that college or work, well within 90 minutes in the morning.  However, commuters from Rush, Lusk, Donabate, Malahide and Portmarnock are included in that fare.  Throughout the country, in particular in my constituency and constituencies around Dublin, there is a poor or, at times, non-existent service provided by privatised bus services.  There is a major problem with the Go-Ahead Ireland service in north county Dublin, North Wicklow, and areas of Kildare.  Buses are not turning up in the morning and people are missing work, are late for school or college and are missing hospital appointments which they have to reschedule.  We need a transport system that works.  When these contracts end, they cannot be renewed.  We need a State-owned public transport system, such as Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, which is resourced properly, to run our transport services.<\/p> <p> Another Tweet from a constituent of mine this morning thanked Go-Ahead Ireland bus services and said it was another taxi fare for them this morning.  Taxi services, another area of our transport system that has been totally ignored over the past number of years, have to step into the breach.  <\/p> <p> The Labour Party supported a scrappage scheme for cars linked to electric or cargo bikes.  They are expensive.  A lot of people are driving old cars which are not efficient.  They may have a second car in a family.  People would be willing to scrap such cars if there was an incentive to buy an electric or cargo bike.  We would like to see the Government revisit that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900023#Y00300","speaker":"1564","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664456100,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I am happy with the budget.  It is a budget that has Fianna F&aacute;il fingerprints all over it.  We have worked really well with our colleagues in government, Fine Gael and the Green Party, to ensure that those in society who are marginalised and the squeezed middle are looked after well in the budget.  The Fianna F&aacute;il I joined way back in 2000 was a centre-left party.  Parties sometimes deviate from a pathway they are on.  This budget rings true to the true causes, aims and aspirations of our party.<\/p>  <p>  There are a lot of good measures in the budget.  One is the lowering of childcare costs by 25% per week, a double payment of children's allowances this winter, home energy credit payments being paid in three instalments of &euro;200 each and supports for small and medium-sized businesses.  I wish to hone in on some examples of how people will benefit from the budget measures.  A person with a disability living on his or her own stands to see a saving of &euro;2,464.  A lone parent with two children under the age of 12 could see a saving of &euro;2,288.  A home carer caring for a loved one in a home environment who is in receipt of the fuel allowance could stand to benefit to the tune of &euro;2,540.  A single renter with an income in the range of &euro;40,000 per annum stands to make a saving this year of &euro;1,330.  There is a lot of good in this.  I am proud of my party and what it has brought forward in this budget.<\/p>  <p>  I want to comment in particular on the Minister, Deputy Norma Foley.  Of all of the measures in the budget, I as a former teacher, was delighted to see a huge budget this year for special education and to make primary school books free.  It harked back to 1967 when Donogh O'Malley, of my party, made second level education free.  We need to strive and do more.  The pupil-teacher ratio for September 2023 will be 23:1.  More can be done, but I want to commend the Minister, Deputy Foley, on all of her efforts in this budget.<\/p>  <p>  Regional airports funding is very welcome.  I look forward to seeing the final figures being revealed for Shannon Airport in my constituency.  Shannon Heritage owns a number of iconic sites in the midwest region, including Bunratty Castle and Folk Park, which were due to transfer from the Department of Transport to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, that is, from the Shannon Group to Clare County Council.  There was hope that the budget would have explicitly stated that there was a funding stream for that.  It is to be hoped that detail will come out in due course because everyone is waiting with baited breath to hear a funding announcement to make that move successful.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to make the some final quick points.  The concrete levy of 10% is something I have a number of concerns about.  Just a few weeks ago we passed a massive redress package for home owners with defective mica and pyrite concrete blocks in their buildings.  It was right to do so.  The detail of that will be stitched into regulations and brought forward in a redress scheme homeowners can apply for very soon - it is to be hoped before Christmas.  I do not know if it is fair to put a 10% levy on each person who tries to undertake a building project, be it with concrete blocks or liquid poured concrete, over the coming months.  To me it seems that they are being burdened with a levy that the suppliers and manufacturers of these blocks should pay for.  <\/p>  <p>  The dogs on the street know who made these blocks.  CHR plc, in my constituency, was a major manufacturer and supplier of these blocks.  Cassidy Brothers in Donegal is known.  We cannot always say that on the street, but we can say it in here.  It is those companies we need to go after.  The Office of the Attorney General is preparing a landmark legal case to take some companies through the courts system and recoup the costs on behalf of the taxpayer.  That needs to be expedited.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, Sinn F&eacute;in has spouted for days that we need an electricity cap.  We have all seen pigs fly in politics, but I never thought I would see the day where it would follow Tory policy.  We have seen the ruination that has brought to the British economy over the past week.  It is in turmoil, freefall and tailspin.  To hear Sinn F&eacute;in talk about a home energy electricity cap is insane.  It is costing that at &euro;1.6 billion, but commentators have said it would cost &euro;10 billion.  Maybe it is getting advice from Liz Truss.  Maybe the famous photograph of Michelle O'Neill shaking hands with King Charles III rubbed off a little bit, because it is coming back with daft ideas from Britain.  Maybe it will give up its abstentionist policy in the House of Commons because it is certainly trying to bring forward a suggestion of Tory policies here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900024#Z00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1664456100,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I wish my colleague all the best in his analysis.  It is certainly an interesting one.  I appreciate the time I have, albeit short, to make a few comments on this budget.<\/p>  <p>  In a budget of &euro;11 billion, it is impossible to give an opinion on every line and detail.  I wanted to choose a few select points and offer a few considerations the Minister of State might take back before we get the finance and social welfare Bills in due course.  To quote a former Taoiseach, the late Garret FitzGerald, this is a good budget.  That has to be recognised.  When we consider what member states across the European Union and other countries around western Europe, including our nearest neighbours, have to do to in order have the resources and financial ability to do what this Government is doing in this budget, it makes us the envy of many other member states.<\/p>  <p>  This is a credit, most importantly, and first and foremost, to the hard-working people of this country and the businesses of all shapes and sizes across the country that kept the lights on during the pandemic and made every possible sacrifice to ensure that tax revenues went up so much.  This has resulted in an economy with, in effect, full employment and continuous economic growth.  These are very important things.  The social challenges are great - no one is pretending they are not - but the current position gives us the basis to start addressing the challenges in a way that so many other countries simply cannot.<\/p>  <p>  One area I am particularly enthused by is the fact that the budget clearly puts money back into people's pockets through a genuine income tax package to address USC in a manner that rewards work and gives people the opportunity to continue in their pursuits.  One thing I welcome that is not in this budget, but which has been highlighted for consideration, is an effective third rate of income tax.  That would be important.  It would put us in a far more regular position alongside many other economies.  A third rate of tax would be great for employment.  I hope that after the assessment is done it is something that we put on the table for consideration for the Government.<\/p> <p>A range of payments is very important to deal with the potential and rising cost-of-living and energy crisis we face.  None of us can be sure of its sheer magnitude or of what will happen, be it related to the ongoing, brutal war foisted on the people of Ukraine by Vladimir Putin and his oligarchs or the extremely worrying situation in the United Kingdom and the reaction on the bond market to the sheer budgetary madness that was announced last week.<\/p> <p> The sort of payment we see in order that people have the chance to cope with some of the rising costs is the fact that &euro;1,000 will come off third level fees this year and &euro;500 will come off next year.  It will make a tangible difference to families throughout the country who are totting up the costs and seeing where savings can be made, as will the double child support benefit and, indeed, the additional winter and fuel allowance benefit package.<\/p> <p> I think we all agree that housing was the biggest issue in the general election of 2020, regardless of constituency.  One would have to be a fool to say otherwise.  The fact that there is a commitment to build 9,000 extra social homes is welcome in this budget but we have to keep building and address the rising cost of construction and the labour shortage.<\/p> <p> After housing, what came up in my own constituency on countless occasions was the issue of childcare, that is, the cost and availability of childcare and, indeed, the ability of childcare providers to simply keep the lights on.  That is why I very much welcome the measures announced in this budget.  I welcome the Together for Better funding model that was announced prior to the budget, but we can do more in this area.<\/p> <p> One area in which I have asked for genuine consideration over the coming weeks is the situation of childminders.  Not everybody can put their child into a registered aftercare facility, cr&egrave;che or Montessori centre.  When we look at the funding model of Together for Better, it is a question of why we have 100% take up of childcare providers in Leitrim but only 81% in my own constituency.  That area of core funding has to be looked at.  There is not necessarily a one-size-fits-all approach to this.  Costs are rising.  The availability of staff is decreasing.  It is an area that absolutely requires a fresh look but that is not to take away from what is extremely welcome in this budget.<\/p> <p> The easiest thing to do would be to come into this Chamber, go through an &euro;11 billion budget and pick out the two or three things that are not exactly perfect.  However, we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good when it comes to this budget because much is being done for every aspect of society.<\/p> <p> I am extremely enthused about the commitment to recruit 1,000 extra members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and 400-odd extra civilian staff.  That is vitally important to the aims of getting garda&iacute; out on the street, on the beat and in our communities.  That is the most important thing.  It is not just about addressing crime rates but the genuine perception and concern when it comes to antisocial behaviour, be it on our public transport or in our neighbourhoods.  I fundamentally believe that those additional garda&iacute; have to be accompanied by the supports for the garda&iacute; with regard to equipment, vehicles and access to ICT and, parallel to the budget, by a genuine review of our sentencing policy in this State.<\/p> <p> We have legislation in this Chamber already.  A Private Member's Bill has been introduced by Deputy Griffin, to cite ramming as an offence and the other legislation is from me, which would introduce a mandatory minimum sentence for anyone who would assault a peace officer, be it a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a firefighter or a paramedic.  This is the sort of thing people really want to see.  If we have more garda&iacute; on our streets making our communities safer, they need to see that those who attack members of the Garda and the State will go to prison for an extremely long time.<\/p> <p> There is much to consider in this budget.  I have gone into the WhatsApp groups, houses and neighbourhoods in my community and there is a welcome for this.  People are worried about what is around the corner but this budget fundamentally puts the State and, most importantly, our society on the best possible footing to meet those challenges in the coming weeks and months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900024#Z00300","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664456700,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this today.  I have listened to a good few contributors in between committee meetings this morning and I will say something I have said many times since I came in here: the Government is more reactive than proactive.  Let us be honest - we do not always agree on either side of the House - but we are all here to represent the people outside this House.<\/p>  <p>  All the announcements were being drip-fed to the media prior to the budget brought a level of expectation to the people for whom we are supposed to be working.  The people in middle- to low-income households were worried about energy costs before the budget and, unfortunately, they are still worried about it after the budget.  It was a missed opportunity to cap the energy crisis which, as Sinn F&eacute;in said last summer, would have given more certainty.  A worrying story was reported last week in a local paper in Cork, about Castlemartyr village, which is an area in my own constituency.  A drop-off box had been set up as part of a collection for torches and batteries for old people.  Despite us patting ourselves on the back or the Government patting itself on the back, as a fella said to me a long time ago, a pat on the back is only a foot and a half away from a kick on the backside.<\/p>  <p>  I will also touch on investment in mental health.  As a former spokesperson on mental health, I was extremely disappointed with the &euro;14 million additional moneys that the Government has set aside.  I have been coming in and out of here for the past four years battling over this and even Mental Health Reform is saying a minimum of &euro;35 million should have been the investment.  Our budget proposal was to invest in &euro;81.7 million in mental health.  Other speakers have mentioned what we are putting into the health service and, yet, we are still closing beds.  We are still closing respite beds.  Nothing that was promised in the last budget has come to head.<\/p>  <p>  Transport and connectivity was another area.  One still cannot get a bus from Youghal to Midleton in County Cork to connect up with the train for connectivity.  These areas would assist people because, obviously, energy prices have risen very high.  Certainly, the Government should be promoting public transport but those are very simple little things.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome measures regarding schools and school buildings.  I will be and always am fair, in that I welcome that moneys have been invested in east Cork because there is a considerable issue in this area.  However, we also have a massive issue with school transport, which I will take the opportunity to raise while I am here.  I do not know whether there is anything that can be done to alleviate the fact that a person over 70 cannot drive a school bus.  I spoke to school bus operators who are willing to do a six-month or 12-month medical on this to speed up and facilitate stuff.<\/p>  <p>  We spoke a while ago about energy costs and retrofitting.  There also needs to be urgency when it comes to facilitating businesses that have invested considerable money in solar panels and, yet, cannot sell the excess electricity back to the grid.  I was hoping that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, would be here.  Good news broke two weeks ago in east Cork about a big hydrogen plant to go on the site of the Whitegate oil refinery.  The following week, unfortunately, one of the main players there, Shell, pulled out.  However, there is a considerable opportunity for our own wind and hydrogen energy.  I spoke to a couple of businessmen.  One of them said that we have the potential to be the Dubai of Europe when it comes to wind energy and the associated energy that goes with it.  Another businessman told me that one of the by-products of hydrogen is oxygen.  He said we will have so much of it that we will be able to give it to the hospitals.  The old saying goes that where there is an action, there is an instant reaction.  I urge the Government to take that on board with urgency because we do not want to fall behind.<\/p>  <p>  The biggest fear I have when we talk about tax breaks and tax proposals is that more than 1.8 million people will not benefit from this budget when it comes to tax.  Those are the people who are struggling.<\/p>  <p>  I will leave the Minister of State with one thought.  I hope he can revisit this if it comes to an emergency, which it is.  We are coming into the winter months.  Old people are absolutely terrified.  I would love to see the Government do a U-turn and say we need to cap energy prices and go back to what we were in May last year to give the people certainty.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900025#AA00200","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1664456700,"counter":272,"content":"<p>There is a ritualistic element to the debate.<\/p> <p>I have seen many of these debates over the years and you have to be for or against.  Those who are for or against make speeches against one another and in many cases read speeches against one another.  However, the difference is that in the old days, we got a much longer opportunity to speak.  I regret the change and now we all seem to be confined to four, five or six minutes.  With the few minutes available to me I do not have the opportunity to go into all the different aspects of the budget.  It was a huge budget with &euro;11 billion in expenditure.  There are one or two things I would like the Minister of State to address when he is replying to the debate.<\/p> <p> The first is that this year, the Government will spend an enormous amount of taxpayers' money, and rightly so, on providing State contributory old age pensions.  That sum will be considerably added to as a result of last Tuesday's announcement.  As the years go on, the burden will become even greater but we must ensure our elderly population have peace of mind and a sense of security in their twilight years.  There is, therefore, an onus on the Government to make this whole system sustainable but what I fail to understand is how the recent announcement of changes in the administration of the pension system is going to make the system more sustainable.<\/p> <p> It is my understanding the cornerstone of the proposal was that at the moment, a person who reaches the age of 66 years and has his or her full contributions paid is entitled to a full old-age pension.  If there are no contractual difficulties etc., a person can continue to work and receive his or her pension.  My understanding of the proposal is if a person forgoes his or her pension until he or she is 70 years of age then he or she will get &euro;70 more per week and there are graduated figures in between.  Let us leave out potential or projected inflation as we do not know what they are going to be anyway.  Take somebody who is presented with a choice at the moment.  The person intends to continue working on at the age of 66 years and is entitled to the old age pension.  If the person forgoes the pension for the next four years then according to my arithmetic it will cost him or her &euro;55,000 in today's money.  A figure of &euro;70 per week in four years' time to compensate you for the loss of &euro;55,000 between now and the age of 70 years will mean that before you start benefiting in net terms from that change, you will be 83 years of age.  What person would, in their sane financial senses, opt for such a system?  In my view there will be very few.  We are presented with this as a cornerstone of making the whole system more sustainable but so few people will be taking it up, if any, that I cannot understand, quite frankly, how it is going to make it more sustainable.<\/p> <p> The other thing that was missing in the recent Government proposal was how we are going to get over this contractual requirement to retire at the age of 65 years.  It can be done immediately by legislation and does not require a constitutional referendum but if it does, let us have one.  We have arguably had such referendums for much less important matters than giving people security and peace of mind in their twilight years.<\/p> <p> Before I conclude, I make brief reference to the proposed levy on concrete products, including concrete blocks, pouring concrete and other such products.  I accept the taxpayer is not at fault here; he or she is not responsible for this debacle.  I accept the people who are responsible for it should be made pay if that is possible.  I also accept that when there is wrongdoing, and clearly there was here, there should be consequences.  However, the question is, consequences for whom.  The taxpayers are going to have to fork out this &euro;5 billion one way or another and we have a levy that will have to be applied for 50 years before the sum is made up, according to the figures.  Would it not be ironic if a subset of taxpayers, namely, people who are going to be hard-pressed because they want to build or purchase houses - and they are hard-pressed indeed - was to be made pay twice over by contributing to the &euro;80 million per year levy?  This is going to happen if that levy is passed on, which it inevitably will be.  This is due to be discussed on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill and the measure is not due to kick in until 3 April, as I understand it.  The Government will have to reflect very carefully indeed between now and the Finance Bill.  This should be discussed fully within the Government parties.  It will be discussed in committee when that particular section of the Finance Bill is dealt with but I urge the Government to think very carefully about the consequences.  It is not that I do not want wrongdoers to suffer, because I do, but I do not want the victims to suffer in an attempt to get at the wrongdoers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900025#AA00300","speaker":"1492","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664457300,"counter":274,"content":"<p>We sought a progressive and decisive budget and one that was mindful of the once-in-a-lifetime challenges facing the country in the form of the energy and cost-of-living crises.  The Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Michael McGrath, have certainly responded and I thank them both, as well as their staff.  Doubtless they spent many long hours over recent months to come up with budget 2023.  It is important we also acknowledge that a budget is just a snapshot in time and no one budget will every resolve all the issues in their entirety.  We have one party in this House that reckons it will take it ten years to sort out the country yet it expects one budget to effect wholesale and transformative change.  What we have seen is a decisive budget focused on the key objective of this Government, which is equality of opportunity for all.  We will certainly build on this in subsequent budgets during the lifetime of this Government.  What we have seen this week from the Government is a real statement of intent in the areas of housing, health, education and childcare.  We will continue to build on that in subsequent budgets as we work towards being one of the most inclusive and progressive societies in modern Europe.<\/p>  <p>  I will address a number of key components of the budget.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, for listening to our concerns about the rates issue in County Longford where, following the escalation of decarbonisation and the closure of the ESB power plant, the local authority was faced with a &euro;1.3 million rates shortfall.  I am thankful the Government has once again committed to making up the shortfall in rates in County Longford.  That is an important component within this budget.<\/p>  <p>  The Government was very inclusive and listened to the recommendations of Members on all sides of the House.  In the months leading up to the budget we were all very much aware of the massive energy crisis affecting SMEs throughout the country.  To its credit, the Government has responded with the energy rebate scheme, which will be retrospective from September and run until February.  It is a massive support to businesses that are struggling and will be rolled out quickly and effectively.  The overwhelming message from that community is that it is welcoming this measure and that is important to put on record.<\/p>  <p>  It has been a brave and a bold budget for education and I commend the Minister, Deputy Foley, on her work and on delivering so strongly.  We see a commitment to continue with 453 building projects throughout the lifetime of the Government.  That is important to us in County Longford in particular as we have a number of notable building projects, including the convent, St. Mel's College, our two secondary schools in Ballymahon and the community college in Lanesborough.  This budget is a real statement of intent about education.  We have seen that with the abolition of charges for schoolbooks in primary schools.  I hope within the lifetime of this Government we will see the elimination of schoolbook costs at second level as well.<\/p>  <p>  There are highs and lows in any political life but Tuesday was one of the good days because we sought to reach out and assist those who have been worst affected in the face of the energy and cost-of-living crisis.  Our President has in the past spoken of the need to ensure we have a glass floor within society through which no group is ever allowed to fall and never has the Government of the day's commitment to those who are struggling been more evident than in budget 2023.  As I said, a budget is merely a snapshot in time and will not encompass or deal with every issue but we have seen massive expenditure.  As previous speakers have said, our budget is in many respects the envy of many of our European peers.  That is down to the prudent and effective management of our finances by the Government of the day.<\/p> <p>At times it is a difficult, three-party Government.  However, we have seen the value of the Government in this budget and we have seen its commitment to those who are worst affected in a time of unprecedented crisis.  I am especially proud to be associated with the budget.  It delivered on many of the issues that I highlighted to both Ministers.  I am delighted that my concerns were taken on board.  On the whole, the society that we serve and to which we give so much is in the main pleased, happy and, more importantly, reassured by this budget.  People are reassured that they know the Government has taken account of the challenges and difficulties that many families are facing.  The Government has responded in kind through budget 2023.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900026#BB00200","speaker":"1597","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664457900,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I spoke on the budget on Tuesday night.  As I said then, despite lots of highlighted figures and talk of unprecedented expenditure, the net fact about this budget is that the majority of workers, pensioners, social welfare recipients, people with disabilities and vulnerable low and middle-income households will be worse off next year than they were last year.  The measures taken have not protected people from the spike in the cost of living or the ongoing housing crisis in terms of extortionate rents and house prices and of course homelessness.  That is the net fact, no matter what way the Government tries to dress it up or spin it.  People will be worse off.  One-off payments that slightly mitigate things for a few months will not hide that fact as we head into the new year.<\/p>  <p>  I want to zone in today on a few more specific issues.  How is it acceptable that the much-trumpeted 80,000 new recipients of the fuel allowance will not get the &euro;400 payment before Christmas?  That is not acceptable.  The Government has been forced to accept that those 80,000 or 90,000 people need fuel allowance because of protests and pressure.  Because the Government is not going to actually give them the fuel allowance until January, they will not get the &euro;400 payment.  They need it every bit as much as those who are going to get it but they are not going to get it.  That is not acceptable.  The Government should rethink that one.<\/p>  <p>  The vast majority of those in receipt of jobseeker's benefit, illness benefit, enhanced illness benefit, maternity benefit and disablement benefit, in other words people who are not long-term recipients of social welfare payments, get no fuel allowance, will get no lump sum payment and will get no Christmas bonus.  How is that acceptable?  Where is the help for them to deal with this excruciating cost-of-living crisis as we head into the winter months?  They are going to get the bill hikes the same as everybody else but they are not going to get any assistance at all in terms of the payments that are being given out and much-trumpeted by the Government.  That is not acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Another small but important issue for those who are affected is the abolition of the infamous Croke Park hours.  The austerity hours imposed on public sector workers are finally abolished.  However, I have discovered that, among others, service officers here in the D&aacute;il and, I think, the ushers and similar grades will not get the return of their overtime payments based on the abolition of those hours.  Overtime will still be calculated on the same divisor, as it is known technically, as if the Croke Park hours still existed.  Very regularly the service officers and ushers in here are asked to accommodate Culture Night or late-night activity in the bar.  Is it fair that they are not getting what they are fully entitled to in terms of overtime payments which should have come back with the abolition of the Croke Park hours?  I suggest the Government look into that.  We often rightly praise the staff who keep this place running.  There may be many other public sector workers in similar grades affected by this.  If the hours are gone then the overtime payments should be restored.<\/p>  <p>  As I debated with the Minister of State, Deputy English on the radio this morning, the biggest, shocking, disgraceful failing of this budget is in respect of the most severe aspect of the cost-of-living crisis, namely, the ongoing housing and homelessness crisis, the crisis of unaffordable rents and house prices.  It is difficult to know where to begin with how this budget has failed.  I have highlighted and will continue to highlight the failure to raise the income thresholds for social housing eligibility.  This means that people who got a marginal increase, for example those who get &euro;4 extra a week with the tax band changes, may now find a very bitter sting in the tail of this minimal, pathetic increase in their income.  They will now be flung off the social housing list, as has been happening to thousands of people over recent years because the Government has not raised those thresholds despite promises.  Worse than that, they will not be entitled to the housing assistance payment, HAP, either.  They go a few euro over the threshold and now they have no help, even though they have not got a prayer of being able to afford the rents out in the open market or buy their own home.  That is outrageous.<\/p>  <p>  It is outrageous that &euro;5 billion has been put in the rainy day fund while at the same time, all the strategic housing developments that are being built, all the apartment blocks, are not being bought up by ordinary purchasers but by investment funds, which then rent them at extortionate rents.  Often the State pays anyway through HAP, rental accommodation scheme, RAS and leasing arrangements.  Why on earth would the Government not use that money to buy up that property, the vacant and derelict properties and the tenancies of people who are being evicted into homelessness?  That would save those people the housing misery and homelessness they are suffering.  It would actually save the State money in terms of HAP and RAS payments.  Why will the Government not do it?  Why will it not impose rent controls and stop the profiteering of the vulture landlords and the energy companies?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900027#CC00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1664457900,"counter":277,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900027#CC00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1664457900,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 37 and the name of the Member in each case:<\/p><p>Deputy Jackie Cahill:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo discuss specialised long-term dementia care in the Tipperary area. <\/blockquote>  <p>Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo discuss recognition of qualified teachers in the Cork Life Centre; and if she will make a statement on the matter. <\/blockquote>  <p>Deputy Steven Matthews:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo discuss retrofitting schools that were built pre-2008 as we face into winter with increasing heating bills. <\/blockquote>  <p>Deputy Patrick Costello:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo discuss the HSE position that children will not be treated under a proposed long Covid model of care. <\/blockquote>  <p>Deputy Brian Stanley:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo discuss difficulties caused by the withdrawal of welfare officers from local face-to-face services in rural towns. <\/blockquote>  <p>Deputy Catherine Connolly:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo discuss treating offshore islands as one area with a &quot;local action group&quot; under the LEADER programme. <\/blockquote>  <p>Deputies &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Mair&eacute;ad Farrell:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo discuss continued and improved services in Clifden Community Hospital, Galway.  <\/blockquote>  <p>Deputies Kieran O'Donnell and Joe Carey:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo discuss an update on a public service obligation, PSO, to establish EU hub connectivity from Shannon Airport to Schiphol, Amsterdam. <\/blockquote>  <p>The matters raised by Deputies Cahill, Stanley and Matthews have been selected for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900027#CC00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Financial Resolutions 2022 - Financial Resolution No. 6: General (Resumed)","time":1664457900,"counter":280,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900027#CC00600"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1664457900,"counter":281,"content":"<p>Debate resumed on the following Financial Resolution:<\/p><p>- (T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1664457900,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I thank the Ministers for being here this evening for this debate on the budget.  I welcome the fact that there is now over &euro;23 billion being set aside in the health budget for 2023.  It is extremely important that we continue to grow and develop our healthcare services and that we try to identify the areas where additional funding is required.  We have done this in the budget, in the sense that &euro;443 million has been set aside for dealing with waiting lists.  It is extremely important that we use that money effectively and that we make every effort to reduce those waiting lists.<\/p> <p>Some of that work will have to be done outside of the HSE hospitals, but we also need to make sure we get value for money in relation to the delivery of the healthcare that people require.  We also need to look at how we can make the premises of the HSE hospitals and care facilities available to help to reduce those waiting lists.  For instance, do we need to look at how we can use some of those facilities at weekends, particularly on Saturdays?  How can we have the appropriate number of staff there to be able to provide the care and back-up support for delivering those services in respect of whether it is day care procedures or whatever medical consultation is required?<\/p> <p> One of the big challenges we have over the next 12 months is in respect of having an adequate number of staff in all our healthcare facilities.  We are competing in a worldwide market for medical care staff.  All of the staff who are leaving Ireland are extremely well trained and have experience.  No matter where they travel to in the world, they can get employment.  We have got to make it attractive to retain the staff that we have here and make sure that they have adequate supports.  It is extremely challenging for any person working in the medical area who has a young family and is to trying to do the balancing act of looking after a young family while giving their full commitment to providing healthcare.  We need to be far more effective in giving those supports to our healthcare workers.  I am not sure that we have done that in the past.  We also need to be able to be flexible to take on board the challenges that people who are working in the healthcare sector have when they also have young families.<\/p> <p> On healthcare infrastructure, we have much catching up to do.  We have already put a huge amount of money into upgrading our facilities for elderly care.  It is interesting, and I just got the figures today on the costs of running those facilities.  These are community nursing homes across the country.  It is now costing more than &euro;550 million per annum.  That money is spent wisely, but it is important that we make sure that every one of those facilities is up to modern-day standards and can deliver the care that is required.  In the context of healthcare in general, it is important to note that private nursing homes do not have the same financial support that is available to public nursing homes.  It has not been upgraded in the past number of years.  We now need to make sure that they are adequately funded.  We have had a number of private nursing homes close for different reasons.  We cannot afford to lose any beds in either public or private nursing homes.  It is important that the adequate amount of funding is available.<\/p> <p> Likewise, on home care, we also need to bring more people into that area who can provide home care to keep the maximum number of people in their own homes but, at the same time, provide the care that they require.  It is interesting that in the Cork-Kerry region, for instance, over 18 months ago we had more than 1,800 people working and providing home care.  We lost 400 people in a very short period.  We came from 1,800 down to 1,400 providing home care.  That is just in the Cork-Kerry region.  It is just a difficult challenge to reverse that drop-off in the number of people who are providing that service.  Therefore, we need make sure &ndash; this applies to all people who are leaving our healthcare sector &ndash; that there is an exit survey to make sure we can identify what the issues are, why people are leaving and what we can do to reverse that.<\/p> <p> It is important that we continue to provide healthcare support in the community.  It is interesting that in this budget there is &euro;138 million for healthcare and social care services, with &euro;29 million out of that for new developments.  That is very welcome.  Likewise, there is &euro;150 million for older persons and &euro;18 million is in relation to new developments, which is, again, very welcome.  The other area where we are putting in extra money in this budget is mental health, with more than &euro;58 million being invested.<\/p> <p> I was at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts this morning.  We had the HSE in before us to discuss dealing with its 2021 budget.  We went through the figures and challenges there.  Again, like what we faced with the community hospitals, we now face in the mental health facilities as well, where we need to make sure that we invest heavily in infrastructure in this area.  It is very difficult for staff to work in a place where up-to-date facilities are not available.  Therefore, any place where it is identified that the facility is not up-to-date, we then must make sure that we can upgrade them and, if necessary, in some cases, we might have to build totally new facilities.<\/p> <p> I just want to touch on the area of GPs.  They form an important part of our healthcare provision.  It is interesting that we have a huge commitment by them, but we do not have the same level of support that is in other jurisdictions in relation to back-up support, such as administration and nursing staff.  Over the next few months we should engage with the Irish Medical Organisation to work towards having additional support staff put in place in GP surgeries so they can deal with the increased demand.<\/p> <p> We are facing huge changes in healthcare over the next eight years.  We currently have 760,000 people over 65.  Within eight years, that will have risen to 1 million.  This is going to be a major challenge.  GPs are the first port of call for people who require healthcare.  We need, therefore, to put in place an adequate level of supports for those GPs so that they can deliver healthcare and reduce the number of people that they are referring into hospitals where they do not have a choice because they cannot get access to the care that is required.<\/p> <p> I touched on the issue of nursing homes.  Again, we face challenges there where they are now facing the difficulty of trying to retain staff.  We need to work with them to make sure that we can have the required number of staff in each and every healthcare facility across the country, whether it is in hospitals, community hospitals, nursing homes or day care facilities.  We now need to look at how we grow the healthcare sector and make working in it attractive.  I am not sure that we have done enough of that over the past ten years.  As a result, people are leaving that sector and moving into other areas of employment.  It is important that we meet the challenges.  We have had an increase in population of more than 1.2 million in the past 20 years, which is 60,000 per annum.  This year, the population may very well increase by 150,000 if you look at the people who are coming back from abroad, the natural growth in population and also the more than 50,000 people who have now come in from Ukraine.  We could have a growth in population of 150,000.  That will be more demands on our healthcare sector.  We need to respond to that demand in every area, whether it is paediatrics, cancer care or elder care.  Right across the board, we need to respond.  The way we can respond is by making sure that we have an adequate number of staff in all areas.<\/p> <p> Again, I thank the Minister for Health and the both Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for their commitment to ensuring that we have an adequate budget for healthcare in the coming year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900027#CC00700","speaker":"1523","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664458500,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Regarding the budget, certainly, &ldquo;the devil is in the detail&rdquo; rings a bell.  One would see that when looking at the commitments around GP care.  We know that commitments made previously in relation to under-12s, which has, in fact, been legislated for, has not come to fruition.  There is much ambition in relation to that.  It is welcome, if it can actually be implemented.  In counties such as mine - I presume this is the case in many rural towns, especially - people cannot even access a GP in many cases, or else they will wait two or three weeks for a basic appointment.  The roll-out of free GP care is welcome.  However, it actually has to be implemented.<\/p> <p>It would have been preferable had that been run by GPs before it was announced because it clearly came as news to them.<\/p> <p> When it comes to the devil being in the detail, the rent credit is also an issue.  Rents have been increasing not just in our cities but also in counties like mine.  The average rent per month is now nearly &euro;1,000 in County Roscommon.  In the first three months of this year, rents increased by 18% in County Galway alone.  I am referring to rural towns where people are really struggling to pay rent.  A rent credit is welcome.  It is something for which we have called for years, but what is the point in putting in place a rent credit without imposing a pause and or ban on rent increases in the first place?  Rents are continuing to rise and there is no sign of them slowing down.  Therefore, the tax credit will work regarding rents only if the ban on rent increases comes with it.  Rent is one of the issues in respect of which we see young people in particular really struggling.  They are finding it impossible to save for a mortgage.  They are the very people who are once again being driven out of this country to faraway places.  We are definitely losing our best and brightest to emigration once again.<\/p> <p> I spoke to a young worker yesterday who is about to take up a job on a salary of &euro;26,000 per year.  She will get nothing in the tax package introduced by the Government this week.  Someone earning &euro;130,000 will see a benefit of &euro;830 whereas a teacher or nurse on &euro;35,000 will see a benefit of only &euro;190.  That is not fair.  We have heard a lot about low- and middle-income workers - the squeezed middle &ndash; in recent weeks and months.  They have not been served in this budget, and they are going to continue to struggle.<\/p> <p> With regard to social welfare, it is deeply disappointing that no weekly increase will be seen until January.  The lump-sum payments are welcome to some degree but in many cases their equivalent will be spent even before they are received.  It is disappointing that we have yet another budget that does not recognise the minimum essential standard of living when it comes to social welfare increases.  It is still the case that, at the time of every budget, there is a circus over what an increase will be.  It is never linked to anything.  The increase is not linked to inflation and does not protect from poverty.  It is just a figure plucked out of the air.  We are no closer to protecting people from poverty when it comes to social welfare.  When we talk about social welfare and social protection, it is important to note that the smallest group of recipients comprises jobseekers, people who have lost work.  The majority are carers, including family carers, and also people with a disability and the elderly.  These are the people who will see no badly needed increase in their weekly income until January.  That was a mistake.<\/p> <p> I welcome the moves made on the fuel allowance.  I have asked many times for the eligibility criteria to be considered because the scheme has been far too rigid.  It is really unfortunate that the extensions as regards eligibility will not come into place until January.  That will leave people without support by way of the fuel allowance and locked out of all supports to meet energy costs in the next few months and into the winter.<\/p> <p> On the subject of lone parents, the likes of SPARK and One Family Ireland have voiced their disappointment over what the budget does for lone parents.  It is deeply disappointing that we have seen no moves on the child maintenance service and the establishment of a proper service to examine child maintenance for lone-parent families, who deserve nothing less.  It is disappointing that we did not see a recognition of the cost of disability after the report that we know was furnished to the Minister.  There should have been moves on this in the budget.  Many other organisations, representing family carers, older people, people with a disability, are disappointed with this budget, so the Government does not have to take it just from Sinn F&eacute;in.<\/p> <p> On the cost of living, we need clarity on the double payment that will be made in the autumn.  The budget book was very clear in stating the double payment in October will be paid to those on long-term social welfare payments.  The position on this is similar to that pertaining to the Christmas bonus.  It does not include the likes of the illness benefit, yet the T&aacute;naiste said today on the floor of the D&aacute;il that it includes all payments.  We need clarity on this because people need to know.<\/p> <p> On what is available for rural development, it is disappointing that there is no increase in LEADER funding, which has been sought.  This will be detrimental to rural communities.  It is also disappointing that funding for the statewide sheds of the Irish Men&rsquo;s Shed Association and Ireland&rsquo;s Women&rsquo;s Sheds across the State was not reinstated.  They do wonderful work for people living in rural communities, many of whom are isolated.<\/p> <p> The devil is in the detail of this budget.  We have much work to do on poverty in this State and getting people through the cost-of-living crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900028#DD00200","speaker":"1604","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664459100,"counter":286,"content":"<p>As a Government Deputy, I am proud to be associated with this budget.  We have been lobbied a lot over the past couple of months.  We have been in an unprecedented crisis given the war in Ukraine.  We have made a very serious attempt at addressing the cost-of-living increases for those under the most pressure.  At times in politics, we receive a lot of criticism and many issues are raised with us, but since Tuesday we have received many calls from people saying they are delighted with this budget.  There has been a serious attempt made to address the cost-of-living crisis people are facing.  I am delighted to be a Government Deputy who has lobbied our Ministers for a progressive budget like this.  An unprecedented &euro;11 billion has been put into the economy to address the cost-of-living crisis facing us.  It really justifies the reasons why we went into government two and a half years ago.<\/p>  <p>  There are two things I would like to see in the Finance Bill.  I would like to raise them with the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, and then move on to aspects of the budget.  The first concerns the means test for the carer&rsquo;s allowance for parents with incapacitated children.  This is a matter I raised in the D&aacute;il a couple of weeks ago.  I have a family in my constituency who have been put in financial hardship by the conditions of qualification for the scheme.  Since the father of the family got a bonus in his employment this year, the mother&rsquo;s carer&rsquo;s allowance has been reduced to less than &euro;50 per week.  The couple have a child with serious health needs &ndash; a child who cannot talk, walk or swallow.  The child was not expected to live beyond 18 months or two years, but, due to the excellent care she has received in her home, she received her first Holy Communion this year.  There are not too many of these children in the State.  I urge the Minister to remove the means test to qualify for the full carer&rsquo;s allowance through the Finance Bill.  There is a precedent for this.  People can qualify for a medical card and the domiciliary care allowance without a means test.  Since the number of families in the circumstances I describe is extremely small, I urge the Minister to reconsider this matter through the Finance Bill.  For a family with a child in need of care 24-7 and a mother who gave up an extremely good job to look after that child and who is doing so exceptionally well, I urge the Minister to reconsider the matter in the Finance Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue I wish to raise, on which I have been quoted in the media today, is that of the concrete levy.  I fully accept the concept of the levy and of recovering money from the industry for mica and pyrite remediation.  We now see apartment buildings in Dublin with defects.  The bill will continue to grow but the levy needs to be postponed for a period until the cost of concrete returns to a level such as the one that obtained before the war in Ukraine.  The price of concrete has risen by 50% in recent months.  Next April is just not the time to impose a 10% levy on concrete products.  We all want to see the maximum number of houses built and to control the price of houses.  I was talking to a concrete provider yesterday who said the levy will add &euro;120 to the cost of each load of ready-mixed concrete.  While I fully accept the principle of a levy on concrete and that such a levy has to be imposed, I urge the Government to postpone it until a date later than April 2023 to allow costs to come back into line.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance gave the example of what a pensioner living alone and in receipt of the fuel allowance will gain from budget 2023.  He said it will total &euro;2,374.  In my lifetime, I have never seen such a huge increase for people on social welfare.  The cost of living and cost of fuel will be enormous this winter, but this is a huge step in alleviating fuel poverty.<\/p> <p> The double weekly payment, the Christmas bonus, a once-off fuel allowance payment and living-alone payment, as well as a weekly increase that is permanent, and the three &euro;200 energy credits are a major attempt by this Government to ensure that people stay out of fuel poverty this winter.<\/p> <p> We have been inundated with calls from constituents who recognise the unprecedented effort that has been made in this budget.  A working family with kids in school or college will gain a total of &euro;5,640 from this budget.  That underlines the massive effort being made by the Government to ensure that the impact of the cost of living on families will be neutralised.  This shows that the Government is fully getting to grips with the crisis facing the economy and has made a major effort to ensure that families will not be in fuel or food poverty this winter.<\/p> <p> Another area this budget addresses, and one which I had pushed for, is a separate targeted agriculture modernisation scheme, TAMS, budget for climate negation measures.  As a farmer, I am fed up with being told what we cannot do.  At all the forums I have attended I have always stressed that my industry, the agrifood industry, wants to concentrate on producing food sustainably.  I judge all climate negation measures by the fact that if they do not impact on our ability to produce food sustainably in this country, then they will be successful.  If they impact on our ability to produce food, then they will have failed.  This separate budget that has been introduced for TAMS is directed at putting in place solar panels on farm buildings at the moment.  I urge that be brought further to include constant aeration of slurry, rubbers on slats, different fertilisers that involve significantly less run-off and production of organic, pelleted fertiliser.  There are many things that can be done within the agrifood sector to reduce emissions and meet our emissions targets.<\/p> <p> In regard to the &euro;90 million that has been put into this separate TAMS budget relates to a point I made very strongly to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine about the fact that we have a TAMS budget for infrastructure and that we needed a separate TAMS budget to tackle climate change.  I am delighted that this has been recognised in the budget.  It is a huge step forward in our task to meet the 25% emissions reduction target that was agreed a couple of months ago.  We can build on this and drive forward.  A further &euro;3 million is being allocated over the next four years to kick-start farm-based anaerobic digestion.  This is hugely welcome.  A great deal of technology exists.  Farmers around Europe are ahead of us in this regard.  Animals on farms throughout Europe typically produce an income.  They also produce an energy income.  They are a valuable source of income.  We can go a long way towards our renewable energy targets inside the farm gate.  I am delighted to see these initiatives in the budget.  I have worked hard in the parliamentary party to push this agenda and thankfully I got a receptive response.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating and now the money has been put in place.  We have to continue to build on that.<\/p> <p> Yesterday evening, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine visited Lisheen in my constituency visiting the bioeconomy research centre.  The technology being produced there is a vehicle that can be used to produce modern technology to allow us to meet our targets in agriculture going forward.  We have already seen one project emerging from the research centre where used plastic is turned into a wax in the former Bord na M&oacute;na plant in Littleton where used plastic is turned into a valuable commodity that can be used to make glue and for other purposes in the future.  That is where we have to go but it can only be done with investment.  I am delighted to see that investment in the constituency of Tipperary in this budget.  With this kind of investment and these types of initiatives, we will be able to go a long way towards meeting our 25% emissions reduction target.  It had to be in budget 2023.  In the past we were slow off the mark on such investment but we now have a separate budget for it.  While there are many positive things in this budget this initiative on how the agrifood industry will meet its climate change targets is most welcome.  I am delighted to be associated with this budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900029#EE00200","speaker":"1611","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664459700,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I am happy that Deputy Cahill got those phone calls in the first ten or 12 hours because, since then, listening to our local radio station, Tipp FM, there is a great deal of disquiet among our constituents in Tipperary about the gaps that are left by this budget and the number of people who will fall through them.  A budget of this size should have given people certainty that they will be able to meet the challenges as we go through the winter.  However, to fill the gaps in our public service, the chance is gone.  There is no long-term plan in this budget, just a series of once-off measures that leave cohorts of people on the sidelines.  Many fixed-income working people are also being left on the sidelines.  That is what is coming across on the radio and in the phone calls we are receiving.  Take, for example, the fuel allowance.  While we welcome the extension of the fuel allowance, there is no doubt that it is too limited.  We argued before about working family payment recipients.  They should be included in it but they have been locked out again.  Even the cost-of-living support package will only be available to long-term welfare recipients.  This potentially locks out those on payments such as illness benefit and newly unemployed people&rsquo;s jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Will the Minister give us more details on that?  Deputy Kerrane also raised this issue.<\/p>  <p>  What was behind the decision to allocate an inadequate &euro;12 increase in respect of pensions and core welfare payments that will immediately be eaten up by inflation?  These increases are deferred until January.  Deputies across the House made an issue of the cost of living and how people are struggling.  Now they are being asked to wait for three months or more before many of these increased payments will commence.  That does not make sense.  Family carers and older people are being forced to wait until January, all the way through the winter.  We all expect the weather to start to pick up from January onwards, yet they have to wait until January to get these increased payments.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to tax, there is no denying that the tax package puts the interests of high earners above those on low and middle incomes.  Those earning &euro;130,000 will benefit to the tune of &euro;830, while people earning &euro;35,000 will benefit by just &euro;190.  I have been contacted by people on disability or invalidity allowance who are due to transfer to the pension shortly and who may not now be entitled to the lump-sum payment.  I would like clarity on that for them.  Would they not have been better served with the system and the resources instead of giving it to people who are earning &euro;130,000 or more?<\/p>  <p>  Assistance with the cost of home heating oil was left out of the budget.  This, again, disregards many rural households.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to those with disabilities, there is &euro;11.7 million to address the backlogs in accessing assessments of need.  I realise that many families are in the situation they are in because after all that has happened in this country, it all comes down now to just addressing the backlogs.  There is no forward thinking about what is coming down the road; it is just about addressing the backlogs.  It is purely a monetary issue with this Government.  It does not deal with the systemic or staffing problems that every one of us knows to be the problem.  Mental health services got a mere &euro;14 million extra at a time when Sinn F&eacute;in had identified a need for, and would have provided, an additional &euro;81 million.<\/p> <p>Long-term housing planning is also lacking.  What is happening on the report on social housing threshold which has been sitting on the desk for months?<br\/><br\/>What planning has the Government done to ensure that GPs can handle the welcome increases in medical card eligibility?  Any GPs being interviewed on local or national radio will tell you that this was landed on them with no thinking at all and they can see the problems that this is going to create.<br\/><br\/>There are no additional hospital beds in the health service.<br\/><br\/>Where is the energy cost certainty for those businesses which called for a cap on the prices?  I could go on.<br\/><br\/>This budget is a missed opportunity again to make a real difference in people's lives especially when the Government is spending so much money, namely &euro;11 billion, as the Government says itself.  I was listening to an economist the other day and he reminded people that &euro;7 billion of that is just to stand still, as there is only just &euro;4 billion to go forward.<br\/><br\/>As far as Sinn F&eacute;in is concerned, the Government has no long-term plan but just a series of sticking plasters and they will fall off very shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900030#FF00200","speaker":"1613","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664460300,"counter":290,"content":"<p>Sometimes I think we are looking at different budgets.  Some &euro;11 billion of a budget is very significant indeed.  I remember the days when we were taking figures of &euro;6 billion, and so on, out of the economy.  It is a seismic budget.  What is the alternative in continuing with existing spending and expanding that, to not doing that?  Of course, &euro;7 billion has to be spent doing that, with the remainder to be spent on different measures.<\/p>  <p>  The tax measure is of great significance for so many families because we look at this through a poverty focus and lens.  Giving people tax back at every level is about keeping people out of poverty and is about helping them avoid difficulties.  These are people who have not faced difficulties in the past but who will this winter and who deserve a break and extra assistance whether through the energy grant or the tax changes.  It is so important that we try to address in advance what we know are going to be difficult times for people and the tax changes, therefore, are of great importance.<\/p>  <p>  Changing the band obviously affects everybody over that band but the proportionate benefit to people on lower incomes is much more significant.  To say that this measure is targeted at high earners is simply missing the point entirely.  We are desperately trying to support people who are in the squeezed middle and who need more money of their own back in their own pockets in order to have better control over their own spending.<\/p>  <p>  The idea being advanced that this is a failed opportunity to have energy cost certainty is made as if such a thing was possible.  If we had energy cost certainty, we would know exactly what we needed to do, which is the whole point of what we have been facing which is the very essence of uncertainty.  How can one possibly give people certainty with the external threats we have been facing?  What measure of certainty can we give to people that they will not have to pay bills beyond a certain level?  The taxpayer will have to pick up the cost, however, one way or the other.  No matter what one does, there is a measure of uncertainty, whether that is for the State or for the household.  One tries at least to be honest about that.<\/p>  <p>  This idea that we are somehow going to give people certainty because a person&rsquo;s Bill is only going to be whatever number of hundreds of euro and no more, and completely neglect to be honest with people about the fact that the taxpayer themselves will have to pick up the cost no matter what, is a dishonesty.  It should not persist any more.<\/p>  <p>  Again, the social welfare package is deliberately targeted.  Of course, there is the extra &euro;12 and the measures kicking in after Christmas but that is deliberately balanced by upfront payments between now and Christmas, designed to target people who will need it most.  There will be a double payment to all social protection recipients, including pensioners, carers and people on disability payments, in October and in December.  There are lump-sum allowances to be paid to those receiving the fuel allowance, the living alone allowance and the working family payment.  There is a cost-of-living payment to the carer&rsquo;s support grant.  These are directly identified to try to target people in advance of Christmas, when we know that big bills will be coming, and to then have the longer-term measures in place.<\/p>  <p>  This is a good structure where one faces into each budget year having to address the particular context of that year.  We have had Covid-19 over the past number of years and it is obviously the energy crisis now.  That is exactly what the Government has to do.  It has to look up in front to see what the big challenges are, their timing and how we can address that.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the criticisms are that the Government has done too much in one-off payments and has not brought in enough permanent structural measures, as such.  The budget, however, is year-to-year.  There are no permanent measures.  Everything changes and the budget is addressed every year.  The tax changes are never permanent nor are the social welfare changes, as we do not know what situation we will be in this time next year.  We do not know how much money we will have this time next year.  We think that we will have a solid budget surplus, we hope we will, but we genuinely do not know.  There has to be an honesty in how we present the budget to people and tell people that this is the amount of money we have this year.  It is more than we thought it was going to be so we can address these different concerns that we know people are going to have.<\/p>  <p>  Next year could be very different, last year it was very different and there has to be a measure of honesty about that.<\/p>  <p>  There are two things I very much want to welcome. First, are the childcare changes which is something that I and so many others in this House have been campaigning for for so long.  I believe this is the beginning of a very big structural difference we can make.<\/p>  <p>  The second thing - where I agree with the National Women&rsquo;s Council - is that this is a big budget for gender equality.  There are the steps on childcare, in particular, but also on a whole range of other measures of social welfare and so on, which are big steps towards gender equality and reflect directly the work that we are trying to do in the Committee on Gender Equality in implementing the recommendations of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly.<\/p>  <p>  Last year the Minister for Social Protection very considerably extended the eligibility for carer&rsquo;s allowance and it will be interesting to see when this kicks in in June how many more people have applied to avail of the carer&rsquo;s allowance under the new thresholds and how that will work out.  I hope that it will work well because the change was so significant.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome seeing this year the changes to the domiciliary care allowance and to the way in which that is paid.  It will now be paid for babies who are born and remain in hospital.  We had a vaguely ridiculous scenario in the past where the parent had to go home from the hospital and go back in, which made no sense at all.  I am very glad to see that the Minister has changed that and has indeed increased the rate of payment.  The last thing that a parent of a child in that situation needs to have to do is to engage with the social welfare office, or engage in that for any reason whatsoever.<\/p>  <p>  I call again on both the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Protection to take the initiative to establish an Intreo presence in the paediatric and children&rsquo;s hospitals for the ease of parents to be able to access the additional needs payments that they are entitled to, that they should be able to get easily.  They do not need an additional stress in having to get it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900031#GG00200","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speech","time":1664460300,"counter":291,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach.

N&iacute;l aon dabht ach go raibh diangh&aacute; leis na ruda&iacute; at&aacute; s&aacute;ite istigh ann.<\/p> <p>One thing in particular I have campaigned for in Fine Gael, and I put down a motion on this at the Fine Gael Parliamentary party some time ago, was an empty homes or vacant homes tax.  I can think of no better way to have a go at the 160,000 empty homes around the country, in particular the 37,000 empty homes and apartments in Dublin city, and to put pressure on the owners when they lie vacant for a significant period.<\/p> <p> As I said, I have campaigned for this and I have worked with the Peter McVerry Trust in Drogheda as I campaigned.  They came to Drogheda and I brought them around and showed them homes which were vacant and empty.  Some of the homes had birds nesting in the roof spaces for years, flowering shrubs growing out of the windows and, as we all know, rodents dancing and having a merry time in the kitchen, with the doors locked and nobody inside for years.  Nobody gives a bloody damn, or that is the truth of it until people like the Peter McVerry Trust say otherwise.<\/p> <p> It is about time that this Government woke up to these issues.  I had to campaign hard for this and there was significant opposition to this move, as we all know.  The reality is that when an empty homes tax was introduced in Vancouver, a major city, the number of vacant homes has dropped 30% since 2017.  That is some figure.  Imagine if we could do that in Dublin, in Drogheda or right around the country.<\/p> <p> There are significant and appropriate exemptions for families or people who own these homes, for example, if somebody is in hospital or in a nursing home.  The data show there are many significant and important exemptions.  The key thing is not to get the income from the tax; the key thing is to get the house let and to get people living there.  There is evidence that we have significant purchasers of properties in the major cities and other significant areas who are very well able to buy these homes, but they buy them to leave, they buy them to appreciate in value, they buy them to make a profit for themselves.  Nobody is turning the key to go into those apartments or to use the kitchens or the facilities.<\/p> <p> It is time to put an end to that and I believe this is a start.  I acknowledge what some of the people on my left are saying, namely, it does not go far enough.  Of course, it does not go far enough but, by God, it is a damn good start.  As we debate the budget and the legislation that is to back this up, I will be making my submissions on it.  If the housing committee meets on this issue, I hope that it takes evidence from people in other countries as to how this can make it tougher on those who are abusing the privilege of owning a home and excluding people from it by virtue of just sitting on it.<\/p> <p> The other point I would like to make concerns another campaign in County Louth which is not mentioned in the budget.  Nonetheless, it is part of my thinking and Fine Gael has referred to it.  This relates to using compulsory purchase orders to release into the community homes that were vacant or abandoned.  It was a very active programme in County Louth and over a three-year period more than 100 houses were brought back into commission, with families living in them, for an average cost, including the site cost, of under &euro;200,000.  There is progress.  There is a way forward.  It is time for the Government to follow up further on this.  Of the empty homes officers who are dotted around the country, some of them work very hard on empty homes and others, regrettably, do other administrative work, which, to me, is a joke.  If they are on the empty homes desk, that is what they should be doing - ringing up, putting pressure on, getting people to respond to queries, finding out who the owners are and if they cannot find them, they should then go through CPO to get the homes occupied.<\/p> <p> The Government is serious about housing.  The budget for this year is more than &euro;4.5 billion.  Let us continue that work.  As part of our armour, let use the pressure of this empty homes tax, beginning this year, based on facts and on what has happened in other jurisdictions.  Let us increase the tax on these homes if people do not use them and if they do not put them into commission in the first year.  In Vancouver, that tax was raised from 3% in the first year to about 5% or 6% now.  I welcome that.  It is what we need to do.  I am not one for shouting about what I do, and not too many other people shout about it either, but I want to say I am very happy with this and I very much support this.  I might be sitting on the backbenches but my voice, hopefully, will continue to be heard.  Should I have the exalted position that the Minister of State holds in the future, I will be very happy to shout there as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900031#GG00400","speaker":"1598","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664460900,"counter":294,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900032#HH00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1664460900,"counter":295,"content":"<p>Is that a job application?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900032#HH00300","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1664460900,"counter":296,"content":"<p>At least I have no chance of getting that job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900032#HH00400","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1664460900,"counter":297,"content":"<p>Put in your CV while you are at it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900032#HH00500","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1664460900,"counter":298,"content":"<p>We move to Sinn F&eacute;in.

I would also argue that budget 2023 fails to deal with either of them and just tinkers around the edges.<\/p>  <p>  The big solution for renters in this week's budget is a &euro;500 annual tax credit.  Again, it is welcome and better than nothing, but it is a sticking plaster approach and the problem is just getting worse.  In the last Daft report, a three-bed house in Dublin 24 that a family might hope to live in was &euro;1,971.  This credit is potentially only worth a week's rent to them.  If rents go up another 12%, for a family moving into a house down the road next year, fully half of that &euro;500 credit is wiped out in the increase.  A tax credit with no control on rents is simply throwing good money down the drain.  It will help workers and families in the short term, but will still leave them vulnerable to the long-term spiralling of rents and does nothing for security of tenure.  Some suggest it may even fuel inflation in rents.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste if one person's tax credit is another person&rsquo;s tax income.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in would have put a month&rsquo;s rent back into every renter's pocket and banned rent hikes for the next three years.  Renters deserve real action and real relief, not one-off measures that potentially do more harm than good.  We must address the root causes of the problems if we are to be fiscally prudent and not simply populist parties, trying to buy the electorate with tax credits and income tax that narrow our tax base further and tie our fate to that of a small number of multinational companies.<\/p>  <p>  This budget is yet another example of how the Government has no real plan to address the fundamental problems facing our health service.  There will not be one more acute bed in our capacity after this budget.  We consistently hear big numbers being thrown around about the health service.<\/p> <p>Every year, we are told that that year's is the biggest budget ever.  We have a growing and ageing population.  As such, we will spend more on our health service each year just to stand still.  The Minister announced that hundreds of thousands of people would have GP care.  That is welcome, but it was put forward as if it were some sort of magic wand.  Hundreds of thousands of people have no access to a GP because this Government has allowed the retention and recruitment problem in our health service to become a crisis.  There has been no mention of additional trainee places for nurses, doctors, radiologists and other key professions where gaps need to be filled.  People cannot access the most basic elements of healthcare, namely, GPs, dentists and scans.  Even if someone can get on a GP's, dentist's or consultant's books, it can take weeks, months or years to get an appointment, depending on which the person is trying to see.  I am tired of these grand ideas when there is not a shred of a plan to implement them.  Last year, the Minister announced that there would be 10,000 more staff in our health service.  That was welcome, but we have recruited fewer than half of that number.  This Government is great at telling people what they want to hear when it does not have the slightest intention of seeing it through.<\/p> <p> The Government's commitment to retrofitting has been lacklustre.  The current scheme ignores the oldest, coldest and poorest homes and prioritises those with the greatest means rather than the greatest need.  According to the response to a recent parliamentary question asked of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, it would take up to ten months just to get a home surveyed for a Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, free energy upgrade.  The whole process would take more than two years.  We must introduce tiered supports, with deep retrofits for low- and middle-income homes funded by between 65% and 100%, depending on income.  This would make retrofits a realistic option for those who remain locked out of the Government's schemes.  It is all well and good for the Government to say that it will match people's investment if they happen to have &euro;10,000 lying around, but that is far from the reality for most of those households that I deal with every day.  A deep retrofit of the family home is the single greatest way for many families to reduce their carbon output.  If the programme is to have meaningful results, we should support those with needs rather than those with means.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900032#HH00700","speaker":"1571","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664461500,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  While the budget contains some welcome measures for which Sinn F&eacute;in has been advocating for years - I will claim those as a victory on our part - others that the Government is introducing are being implemented in a half-baked way.  The failure to implement a rent freeze ensures that renters will continue to face financial uncertainty, given that landlords will use the tax credit to hike rents.  We have long advocated for renters to receive a tax credit worth one month's rent and for this to be accompanied by a rent freeze.  One cannot be done without the other, but that is the problem with what is in the Government's budget.  Students will lose out because they cannot avail of it, nor can the lowest paid workers, given that they are not in the tax bracket.  Units are not registered either.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, is from the same constituency as me and will know from the people coming to his office that there is a great deal of unregistered rental accommodation.  Unfortunately, an opportunity is being missed.<\/p>  <p>  The budget provides no additional social and affordable homes for purchase.  The provision of these units is an essential component in resolving the housing crisis.  Speaking as a member of a party of affordable home purchase, I am disappointed by this.  The Government has written a blank cheque for landlords, increasing rent subsidies by &euro;97 million.  These were introduced as a short-term measure.  Like me, the Minister of State will remember when they were introduced.<\/p>  <p>  The vacant homes tax is a step in the right direction, but a small one.  As the Minister of State knows, the value of many of the properties in question is low.  In Laois, they will be rated at &euro;99 per annum.  Three times that makes &euro;297.  That is not enough of an incentive to get vacant properties back into use.  It needs to be stepped up, and I advise the Government to go further.<\/p>  <p>  The lowest paid workers will receive a derisory 80 cent increase in the minimum wage.  That does not even keep up with inflation.  We called for an increase of &euro;1.40 in line with our plans to reach a living wage by the end of 2023.  The Government's income tax changes also fail to benefit lower paid workers.  According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, the medium wage is &euro;36,095, meaning that fewer than 50% of workers will receive a benefit from the higher tax threshold moving from &euro;36,800 to &euro;40,000.  We would have reduced USC on a tapered basis so that low- and middle-income workers would benefit more.  This measure would have meant an extra &euro;700 for those on &euro;35,000 or less but the Government's means &euro;190.  That is a fact.<\/p>  <p>  The budget does not deal with the root cause of the energy price crisis.  Instead, the Government has written a blank cheque for energy companies.  As previously, the energy credits for households will be pocketed by the energy companies.  We wanted a cap on energy prices.  The incentive for the companies not to hike up prices would have been the introduction of a windfall tax to ensure that they would be financially penalised for price gouging.<\/p>  <p>  Workers and families face a further increase in the carbon tax in October, yet the Government's retrofit plans do not prioritise low- and middle-income households.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposed a number of targeted retrofit schemes that would prioritise regions like the midlands in particular, where there is a high dependency on solid fuels.  We also proposed a tiered scheme based on household income.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has continued its scheme to subsidise the purchase of large electric vehicles.  I do not have a problem with grants for electric vehicles, only large electric vehicles like SUVs and Land Rovers.  From the figures we have received over the past year, many of those are in places like south Dublin, where there is adequate public transport.  People in Laois-Offaly are subsidising those.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to health, we welcome the decision to adopt our long-advocated proposal to expand the GP visit card.  This is a welcome step towards the reformed system under Sl&aacute;intecare.  However, there are no targets to address the crisis in the hospital system.  This is disappointing.  There are no figures in the budget for additional critical care beds despite Ireland being well below the international average at approximately half the OECD level.  Sinn F&eacute;in's alternative budget committed to expanding hospital capacity rapidly, including through an extra 37 ICU beds.<\/p>  <p>  While there are some welcome measures in the budget, and despite the fact that the Government is committing large amounts of public money, it has failed to put much of that money where it is most needed, particularly in health and housing.  That is disappointing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900033#JJ00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1664461500,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I was considering raising a number of points, starting with unfairness.  Deputies will know the example of the person on &euro;135,000 who will get a tax break of &euro;830 and the person on &euro;35,000 who will only get &euro;190.  I was going to go through each issue individually, but then I said \"Maybe not\", because what are we doing here?  We all accept that we are in the middle of an energy crisis and the EU, in particular the European Commission, is finally getting around to dealing with it, albeit slowly.  We know that the geopolitical situation is not going well for Vladimir Putin - I do not mean to take away from the difficulties that the people of Ukraine are facing - but the one thing he seems to have going for him is the financial and energy crises across the western world.  We need to get our act together.<\/p>  <p>  Under our proposal on capping prices, people would have short-term clarity until February, letting them know what bills they would be paying.  As Deputy Stanley mentioned, we are calling for a windfall tax on energy companies to ensure leverage.  This is a legitimate short-term solution.  We know that there is a wider problem that needs to be dealt with and the EU should have been on the ball faster.  Ireland also needs to play its part.  We could have the old argument about how this Government was not going to do anything to decouple gas and electricity prices, but we are in a different place now and we need that decoupling to be delivered.  Without decoupling, Ireland and every other country will face economic carnage.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the budget's measures are good.  We accept that a cut of &euro;1,000 in the third level fees that someone must pay for his or her kid is a significant measure.<\/p> <p>That is accepted.  The problem is we have a budget built on a major flaw.  We are still dealing with original crises, especially concerning health and housing.  We welcome the &euro;500 tax credit for renters, but we do not accept it will do the business.  We have all seen the sky-high rents.  Everybody here has quoted them, from one end of Ireland to the other.  It is an abject failure.  I am not sure how people are able to make some of these payments.  I do not understand how the system has not fallen apart already.  Until we start doing the business, that is, until we start to build enough houses, including council houses, affordable mortgages and cost rental, we will be going nowhere.  This is where we really need to do things.<\/p> <p> Regarding healthcare, we must deal with the fact of the backlog and the failures which mean we do not have the required positions in community and primary care.  We all know the issues existing concerning disability services.  Even where people have established rights to services, everything has been granted and assessments of needs successfully gone through, and all the rest of it, they cannot access those services.  Until we deal with those aspects, we are an abject failure and there is no point in saying anything different.  <\/p> <p> As I said, some things are to be welcomed.  Then I ask myself what it is we really want here.  What is a worthwhile target and project?  All I am going to say is that we need a new Ireland.  I do not think anybody would find it shocking that a member of Sinn F&eacute;in would stand up and espouse Irish unity as a solution.  I do not, however, mean it in the sense of a fourth green field.  I am talking about the fact that on Saturday, 1 October, at 1 p.m. in the 3Arena, we are having a Together We Can event.  It is a conversation on Irish unity, and includes several people who sit in this Chamber, from across all parties.  I welcome this fact.  The meeting obviously has people from North and South.  It even has people like Colm Meaney, who would have acting skills on a similar par to mine.  <\/p> <p> The point of the event is that we are living on a changed island now.  We are in a completely different place.  We all know the old Orange state has gone.  Beyond that, we now have an opportunity to build something better.  When I am talking about doing that, I am talking about an Ireland where we all undertake these pieces of work together.  It would be an Ireland where we would build a decent Irish national health service, develop a decent housing system that delivers for all our people and deliver an education system across the board and one where we have a conversation about how we will all live together.  There has been a failure at Government level to do these pieces of work.  I welcome the cross-party support for this event and I also welcome anyone going along to event in the 3Arena.  It is on at 1 p.m. and tickets are still available on Ticketmaster and at the door on the day.  We have a genuine opportunity to build something real and better on this island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900033#JJ00300","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664462100,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I have to reflect on the last contribution because it doubles down on a previous contribution concerning the Sinn F&eacute;in reaction to the budget.  I am conscious of the Europe we are living in now.  Looking at the UK, its economy is going down the tubes because the British people were asked to eat a flag in a Brexit referendum a few years ago.  I see that in Italy a party with neo-fascist roots has been elected because people there have been asked to eat a flag.  The same thing has happened in Hungary, Poland, Austria, France and the US.  It seems to me that the No. 1 response from the main Opposition party has been to encourage Irish people to eat a flag as well and I find this utterly depressing.<\/p>  <p>  When I look at this budget, many parts of it are to be welcomed.  It is not possible to look at some of the measures announced this week and not welcome many of them.  I am thinking of the education system.  For many years, I campaigned on the issue of schoolbooks and on changing the conversation in education from one of money to one of child development.  I say that because, as I repeat often, the interaction between a parent and a school, and between school leaders and parents, can often be about money.  That is a humiliating relationship if people do not have that money.  Therefore, if we delete those conversations by inserting the State, which I think Fine Gael has finally concluded is a good thing, we will unleash the potential of that relationship to be built on something other than money.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the announcement of free schoolbooks at primary level is welcome.  We should, however, always go further.  We should do that at second level as well.  We should ban voluntary contributions.  We should talk about all those things in the education system that act as barriers to conversations between parents and school staff.  Principals do not want to be fundraisers.  The Minister of State knows that so many parents' associations become effective fundraisers.  <\/p>  <p>  On the capitation announcement, there really was not one.  This is where the structural element versus once-off measures comes into clear focus.  It was announced that &euro;100 million will be allocated to address how schools will be able to get over the winter.  This was not a structural announcement, though, and I wish to see more detail on it.  I say this because, inevitably, when a school cannot meet its electricity or other energy bills, and one third of the cost of running a school stems from energy outlays, then that responsibility is going to fall back on the fundraising capacity of a school and parents will again be asked to put their hands in their pockets.  Therefore, I want to see more movement in this regard as well.<\/p>  <p>  We are concerned that much of this budget, as my party leader, Deputy Bacik said, is a treadmill budget.  It will see us over the next couple of months, but we could well be back here in the new year talking again about these structural issues that have not yet been addressed by this Government.  It made an announcement concerning free GP care last year, but that has not yet been introduced for children of a certain age group.  Announcements were also made regarding pandemic payments to certain healthcare workers and they have also not been delivered on yet either.  Additionally, people in the Construction Defects Alliance are deeply concerned that the Government is suggesting the &euro;80 million to be raised through the levy on concrete blocks will be enough to be able to fund the addressing of retrospective construction issues in future.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to housing, we absolutely could have a more visionary approach in respect of giving people certainty on rents by having a rent freeze and certainty on evictions by having a ban on them.  Moving on to the area of SMEs, as the Labour Party's enterprise spokesperson, I would say we are very concerned about the Government's lack of preparedness for a jobs crisis over the winter.  We could see many people on reduced hours or, indeed, losing their jobs because of the crisis small businesses are facing.  While the Government has made announcements, I do not think they go far enough.  I certainly do not think that supporting businesses is going to be enough; there must also be support for jobs.  The Government did that during the Covid-19 crisis, and this is the basis on which it should approach this situation as well.  There must be investment in programmes and schemes that will support businesses in trying to keep jobs, and this endeavour must be focused on the workers.<\/p>  <p>  I was struck by the last few words of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, when he spoke about families and businesses.  It is not, however, just families and businesses that need to survive, but also the workers.  It must be ensured that those workers still have jobs to go to in January, when, as I said, we could very well be back here in the new year talking about these issues again.  Turning to the issue of childcare, the measures announced for that area are welcome because we had been talking about childcare for some years.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is to be congratulated because he has stuck with this and he has made the difference in this budget.  Again, though, we believe that in the context of a cost of &euro;275 million we could have a further intervention for families and a cap on fees of &euro;200.  I say this because we again stand apart in this regard as our childcare fees are the highest in Europe.  We also pay for schoolbooks when people in other European countries, and in the North, do not.  People here also pay for GP visits when nobody in the North or the UK does so.  <\/p>  <p>  My final comments will refer to my initial ones.  I am proud to be here as a representative of the people of Dublin Bay North to interact with the Government regarding this budget.  I have seen what has been happening across Europe, however, and I have also seen the main motivation of speakers from Sinn F&eacute;in, the main Opposition party, this week, and it worries me.  I say this because for 100 years, or more, we have convinced people that if they could just eat a flag, it would make all of us much better.  There must be a different way.  The State must be bigger, it must be on people's side and it must support and empower them.<\/p> <p>People cannot eat a flag because it will not nourish them or make them happy.  Our budget debate needs to be much more profound than that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900034#KK00200","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664462700,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I am at risk of repeating much that has been said about this budget this week already.  However, I cannot but acknowledge the many good things that have been secured in this budget that will make our society better and fair.<\/p>  <p>  My Green Party colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, secured significant cuts in childcare fees.  There is a 25% reduction in fees this year, moving to a 50% cut in two years.  Funding for more childcare places and affordable childcare are critically important for our society, for parents, children and employers.  It gives stability and security to the sector and was very good news for families throughout Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome this budget because we are introducing free school books for primary school children and solar panels for every school in the country.  I welcome this budget because of the historic &euro;90 million allocation for nature and biodiversity.  That is an 83% increase since the formation of this Government.  There are energy credits, social welfare increases and a fuel allowance payment in this budget that will help our people through this winter.  I welcome the major increases in the retrofitting budget with continued focus on low-income homes that will help insulate our people from high energy prices in the future.<\/p>  <p>  However, in certain areas this budget did not go far enough.  In my view, it is not sufficiently aligned with our climate policy.  I say so particularly with respect to transport.  I acknowledge there are good measures in the area of transport.  The 20% cut in public transport fares and the 50% cut in fares for our young people are being extended to the end of 2023, but it has been reported that my party fought hard and expended political capital to get this.  This should not have had to be the case.  It is a policy that is popular and is right, and I would have expected it would have been enthusiastically supported by our coalition partners.  I see the evidence daily, as I use public transport, of the benefit of this measure.  There was a step change in usage when it was introduced a few months ago.<\/p>  <p>  I want to talk about gaps that are in this budget and I will begin with vehicle registration tax, VRT.  With respect to VRT measures that were implemented a number of years ago which aim to reduce inefficiency in the private transport fleet, to some degree they are succeeding, but I would argue they are not succeeding nearly quickly enough.  We must drastically reduce the sale and use of fossil fuel vehicles.  Those reforms are also not effective at reducing SUV sales.  We can see that such sales are surging.  They are a scourge on our roads.  They impact on our climate but also on the safety of our people.  It is my strongly held view that we have not used VRT to discourage SUV sales sufficiently.  This should not be politically difficult.  We are talking about the SUVs that have not been purchased yet.  The only people who would have been upset are the car dealerships and the motor industry generally.  We can and must stand up to them.<\/p>  <p>  We have given generous grants to the taxi industry in recent years to purchase electric vehicles.  It was time, in my view, to give supports to other sectors.  My own preference was that home help workers would be supported.  These are people who must use their own vehicles for their work, who are low paid, who provide a critically important and undervalued service for our elderly and infirm, who for the most part are rurally based, who cannot afford to purchase electric vehicles, yet who often must drive tens of kilometres daily in the course of their duties, thus, through no fault of their own, making a large contribution to our transport emissions.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to active travel, beyond the overarching programme for Government commitments, there is nothing in this budget.  It would be wrong of me not to acknowledge those overarching spending commitments.  They represent an unprecedented investment in public transport and in walking and cycling infrastructure, and I am seeing the roll-out in my own constituency.  I give credit to Limerick City and County Council and its active travel team for being unique among Irish local authorities, I think, in managing to spend their allocation and in developing a pipeline of well-designed projects for the future.<\/p>  <p>  However, there was much more that could have been done with respect to a reduction in VAT on bikes, electric bikes and cargo bikes.  With respect to cargo bikes, there is a shortage of drivers in the retail sector and we could have easily addressed that issue with supports for cargo bikes for businesses.  The bike-to-work scheme remains limited to the PAYE sector.  I believe broader supports are needed to encourage uptake in other cohorts, especially among the retired, the unemployed and those in education.  Those are merely examples of where we could have done better in the budget.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to understand that system change is needed in transport.  Currently, our policies and our system promote growing car use and we are overly reliant on electric vehicles as a solution.  It is not nearly enough that we transition our private fossil fleet to electric vehicles.  This is not system change.  In many ways, it is bedding in the system we already have, one that is the problem.<\/p>  <p>  From a transport and climate point of view, we did not get it all right in this budget and our policy approach generally is not right either.  We should be much more ambitious in the next budget but we have an opportunity now as the climate action plan is being revised to make amends for the gaps in this budget.  It is critical, in my view, that we introduce a meaningful vehicle-kilometre reduction target.  We simply will not reduce transport emissions by 50% by 2030 and we will not bring about system change unless we do this.  Applying a vehicle-kilometre reduction target to all vehicles, not only those that run on petrol and diesel, is meaningful and beneficial to society.  Our neighbours in Scotland are doing it and we should too.<\/p>  <p>  I am looking forward to engaging with the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues in respect of the points I have made today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900035#LL00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1664462700,"counter":307,"content":"<p>Dealing with the cost-of-living crisis is the top priority in budget 2023.  The Government introduced a very significant &euro;11 billion package on Tuesday to support households and businesses.  The budget will continue to invest in public services, particularly our education, health, childcare and housing services, while increasing social protection and pension rates, supporting enterprise and delivering tax relief for working people.<\/p>  <p>  The &euro;4.1 billion cost-of-living package is very welcome and necessary as we face into a challenging winter.  In particular, I welcome: the &euro;600 energy credit, which will be paid in three &euro;200 instalments in November, January and March; the &euro;1,000 tax credit for renters, &euro;500 of which can be claimed this year and &euro;500 next year; childcare fees being reduced by up to &euro;2,100 per child; a double payment of child benefit in November; a double payment of welfare payments in October as well as the normal double payment at Christmas; a &euro;500 grant for carers and those with disabilities; a &euro;1,000 reduction in college fees for all students; major expansion of eligibility for the fuel allowance to bring more than 80,000 households into the system in January; fuel allowance to include a &euro;400 lump sum; a working family payment to include a &euro;500 lump sum; and a double SUSI payment in one month, paid in December.  All of these are extremely welcome.  Many colleagues spoke about them earlier and it is good to hear the members of the Opposition also welcome many of the measures.  Of course, I cannot fail but mention the much-needed energy supports for the SMEs which require support over the next number of months, with up to &euro;10,000 per month being offered there.<\/p>  <p>  Working families with one child will save up to &euro;4,500.  A working family, for instance, with three children, one of whom is in college, will see a saving of up to &euro;5,640.  A pensioner living alone in receipt of the State pension will see savings of up to &euro;2,375, while a person with a disability living alone will see savings of up to &euro;2,460.<\/p>  <p>  It is also recognised that the cost-of-living crisis will impact every household.  The &euro;600 electricity credit reflects this.  This direct payment will assist households to manage their bills over the winter regardless of whether they use oil, gas or solid fuel to heat their homes.  The significant adjustment of tax bands to ensure people earning under &euro;40,000 do not have to pay tax at the higher rate is extremely welcome.  This recognises the fact many people earning between &euro;35,000 and &euro;40,000 and above are not eligible for many social supports such as the housing assistance payment, HAP, and social housing.  I welcome the permanent increases in social protection payments, such as the broad increase in core rates.<\/p>  <p>  The budget will make a real difference in people's lives.  Moving beyond the direct payments, we can see improvements in other areas that will improve lives also.  For instance, in education, the Minister, Deputy Foley, is rolling out free school books to all primary level schools.  This will benefit 500,000 students and their parents next year.<\/p> <p>The reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio to 23:1 recognises the challenges facing children after the disruption of Covid.  It should be noted that this is the third year in a row of tackling the pupil-teacher ratio.  An additional 686 special education teachers and an additional 1,194 special needs assistants, SNAs, will make a huge difference for children and the learning environment.  Parents with children in childcare will see a saving of up to &euro;2,106 per child, a real difference which will help parents.<\/p> <p> There is a massive investment in health too, with 6,000 new staff and the removal of hospital inpatient charges for public patients, worth &euro;800 per patient.  There is a &euro;443 million package to reduce waiting lists and a &euro;9 million package to reduce oral health waiting lists.  Those changes will make a real difference for hundreds of thousands of people in need of such care.  There is also investment in mental health.<\/p> <p> Students will benefit from the reduction in fees, the bonus SUSI payments, which I have referred to, and the permanent increases in grants from next year.<\/p> <p> In the few moments remaining to me, I will touch on just one issue the Opposition has raised, namely, the capping of energy rates.  We need only look across the water and at what happened even today to see that borrowing rates are going through the roof and there are serious challenges facing that economy, challenges which could have an impact on our economy too.  We have to be conscious that if we follow that route, we too could be impacted in that way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900035#LL00300","speaker":"1481","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664463300,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak about the budget.  It is a huge budget and has been welcomed across the board.  I had intended complimenting members of the Opposition on also having acknowledged the tremendous efforts on the part of the Government to support people.  Unfortunately, nobody from the Opposition is present at this time as they have left early on a Thursday.  This budget should get due debate.  We have given over time to do so and Government Deputies are here to speak about it.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the tremendous and unswerving effort of my Green Party colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, on the delivery of a 25% cut in childcare costs for parents and minors.  That is probably the most significant State intervention support for parents in respect of the affordability of childcare ever, and we are only at the halfway mark.  The intention and objective of the Government and the Minister are to reduce childcare costs by 50%.  We will approach that in next year's budget, but the reduction in this budget is massive.  My children have just finished childcare but I have been spending on childcare for the past 12 years and the cost is eye-watering.  If we can reduce that cost by 50%, it will put money back into the pockets of parents.  I note the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, in his speech yesterday estimated that that measure represents about &euro;175 per month back in the pockets of parents.  That is massive.  It takes pressure off.  It is not just people with children who will benefit from that; grandparents will as well.  Often grandparents are left with childminding.  That can be stressful and difficult for grandparents but they feel obliged to do it.  We are making childcare affordable, which is hugely important.<\/p>  <p>  To go back a step, the pay agreement for childcare workers has been broadly welcomed by the childcare sector, by SIPTU and across the board, and that is incredibly important.  We leave our children with early educators and childminders and they need to be paid properly for the tremendously important work they do for our children, so I welcome that as well.  Additional core funding has also been provided in order that we can have extra hours as well as funding for childcare workers.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of other areas in childcare.  We forget sometimes, because of budget day and the big reveal, although most of the budget tends to be in the public domain two or three days beforehand, but earlier this year we expanded and brought forward the school meals programme.  We expanded the number of Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, schools.  I think up to 60,000 children will get school meals this year because of that Government intervention.  I can think of nobody more vulnerable in society than a hungry child in a classroom.  I highly commend the Ministers, Deputies Humphreys and Foley, on that measure.  There are also the solar panels for schools.  It makes complete sense to put solar panels on schools.  It helps them with their electricity costs and they can sell the excess generated back to the grid.  It is a small source of income for schools.  We often see schools under pressure for income and then parents feeling under pressure on voluntary contributions.  Anything we can do to help schools to accumulate a little money is to be welcomed.  This is a really smart move.  I welcome it.<\/p>  <p>  In transport, again, because of budget day, we forget what we did in the previous year, when we reduced transport fares for the first time since 1947.  Deputy Leddin referred to the transformative changes we have to make in transport and how we get people around and get them to work, school and recreation.  It has to be on public transport.  Public transport has to be affordable and punctual, and cutting fares is a measure towards that affordability.  The 20% reduction in fares was maintained in budget 2023.  We had agreed it would continue to the end of 2022, but now it will be extended to 2023.  It should continue permanently.  That is what we should work towards as a Government.<\/p>  <p>  We have continued to develop transport throughout the country.  Significant sums of money have gone into all levels of transport.  There are new buses.  I live by a new bus route to come from Wicklow up to Bray and Dublin, starting early in the new year.  There are train carriages arriving into North Wall this week.  They are on the seas at the moment.  They will go into service around the country.  That is continuous, forward-looking Government investment and an understanding that these things take time.  When we go from year to year and people do not know what their budgets are, it is hard to plan.  There should therefore be forward thinking, rather than going off cliff edges with budgets, in order that people can plan and transport companies such as CI&Eacute; and Irish Rail can plan to purchase that stock.<\/p>  <p>  Under the DART expansion programme, a large number of electric trains are on order.  The largest ever order for electric trains was placed earlier this year or last year.  I think it is for up to 750 carriages.  That is for the greater Dublin area, but we also have the Connecting Ireland programme and new buses being purchased and new services being rolled out.  We have towns that never had a bus service before now being served by buses.  It is really making a difference in those towns.  Buses are not just for getting to work; they are for getting to school and hospital appointments and for recreation and communities.  We often think of transport as a service in the morning and evening for people to get into work, but transport builds community.  I could go on about the positives of public transport all day, and I have often done so, so I will cut it short now.<\/p>  <p>  We talk about this budget being a cost-of-living budget.  Energy costs are through the roof and gas prices are spiralling because Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine and cut off gas supplies.  That is the reason energy costs are high.  They are high for everybody in Europe, and everybody is suffering as a result of high energy costs.  The introduction of the three &euro;200 energy credits, in November, January and March, to coincide with the billing cycles will help people.  We do not want anybody to be afraid to turn on the heat or the lights.  The energy credits will help.  People should know that they are on the way and will come with the billing cycles.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, will look with fairness at mounting energy costs for people as bills build up.  The moratorium on disconnections is very welcome.  People should be assured that the Government is supporting them with the electricity credits, the various double social protection payments, the double childcare payments and the double fuel allowance payments.  There are targeted measures as well.  There are double payments of children's allowance, which is paid to everybody.  That is what we do.<\/p>  <p>  As for the grant system we have, the short-term challenge on energy is, ultimately, to get through this period while gas prices are high and the war is ongoing.  We do not know how long that will last, but the Government is committed to helping people through that period.  We need to think further into the future about how we never again fall into the problem of this dependency on fossil fuels, the prices of which are going in only one direction.  Be that diesel, petrol, oil, gas or whatever other type of fossil fuel, it is running out and it will only go up in value and cost.  We therefore need to think to the future and to renewables.  I think it was the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, who spoke about the resources to go into MARA, the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority.  Ireland's energy future is in renewable energies, our offshore capacity and our massive sea area.<\/p>  <p>We can become an exporter of energy to Europe.  Countries like Holland and Germany are looking at us with jealousy because of the size of the ocean reserve we have, the capacity we have in natural resources and the hydrogen we can develop for export.  We can export that renewable energy through copper, through the two electricity interconnectors to England, one of which is under construction and the other of which is in operation, as well as the interconnector to France, or we can export it as hydrogen.  We will also be able to use that hydrogen for our own electricity generation.  Gas plants will be converted to hydrogen and that is the future.  We will retrofit every home so that homeowners can take advantage of the abundance of electricity we are going to have.  We will heat our homes with electricity and will have solar panels on every roof.  We have talked about free solar panels on schools but we also have the grant that we rolled out this year.  A &euro;2,400 grant is available to every home in this country, which makes a lot of sense.  If one puts a 2.5 kW solar installation on one's roof, one will probably cover one third of one's electricity needs and at the rates being charged for electricity at the moment - we do not know how long that will last - one will get one's money back in around seven years.  That makes a huge amount of sense.  More and more people are getting solar panels installed and more and more companies are providing solar equipment.  As that ramps up, it will create more jobs.  These are clean, green jobs that will last into the future.  That is how we will have an economy that is secure in its energy, in the direction it is going in transport, in decarbonisation and in cutting down on our carbon emissions.  It provides an economy that is secure so that we can fund health and education and support our people through these really difficult times.  That is the future vision that I have for this country.  That is the future vision the Green Party has had for a long time and I am so happy to be part of a Government, with our coalition partners, that is putting these things into practice and putting in place the policies from the programme for Government we agreed.<\/p> <p>Finally, I want to comment on the vacant homes tax that was introduced, which is a first in this country.  This is Ireland saying that it can no longer tolerate vacant homes and that we are going to take action on it.  There cannot be so many vacant homes when so many people do not have a home.  I welcome the measure and thank the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, for introducing it.  We can expand on it, bring more properties into play and make it an activator of houses rather than a revenue generator.  I also welcome the Minister for Finance's comments on property and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  He welcomed the commission's proposals on changes to the local property tax and the site value tax.  They require careful consideration and consultation across government and I look forward to same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900036#MM00200","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664463900,"counter":311,"content":"<p>It is worth noting that there is literally no Opposition Deputy in the D&aacute;il Chamber right now.  As I look across at a phalanx of empty benches, it is a point worth noting.<\/p>  <p>  This is a good budget for families, small and medium enterprises and businesses generally, schools, students, those who police our streets, those who are at the receiving end in terms of need in acute healthcare, public transport users, employees, schoolchildren and the most vulnerable in our society, including those who are addicted and their families.  It is also a very prudent budget.  For six years I have been a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Budgetary Oversight and at every meeting with previous Ministers for Finance I have raised the issue of corporation tax and the warnings by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, about our over-reliance on corporation tax and our vulnerability with regard to corporation tax as a source of expenditure.  This is the first Government in my experience that has taken the advice and warnings of IFAC seriously.  It has put a significant sum away and plans to put an even more significant sum away next year to protect and insure against any other shocks that the economy may experience.<\/p>  <p>  The background to this budget is the weaponising of energy by Russia resulting from its invasion of Ukraine.  Many of the challenges we are facing right now would not have arisen had energy supply and energy sources not been weaponised in such a way.  It is important for the public that this connection continues to be made because it is so easy to lose connection with the reality underpinning some of the incredible measures, particularly around energy, that have been required, including the commitment to pay businesses of a particular size up to &euro;10,000 per month to assist them with their energy bills.  <\/p>  <p>  I was out and about at a number of constituency engagements this morning and several constituents asked me what I thought of the budget.  I told them that what I think of it is not really important and asked what they thought of it.  There was a broad welcome for the budget.  That is the impression I am getting.  Having spoken to a number of businesspeople in recent weeks in relation to the energy piece, I know that many of them will be breathing a very deep sigh of relief, not just today but in terms of how this budget will assist in the months ahead.<\/p>  <p>  A number of family-friendly measures are worth mentioning.  Obviously, the childcare costs measure is a big one for young families and the situation with regard to childcare and cr&egrave;che fees will be improved again next year and built upon.  Things like the energy credits, free primary schoolbooks, reductions in university fees and the retention of reduced public transport fares are welcome, as are the pension increases for older families, couples and individuals.<\/p>  <p>  There is another key measure which I will take some responsibility for, unless someone says I was not the only one to raise it.  I raised it at the aforementioned budgetary oversight committee after a constituent of mine raised it with me and pointed out that some businesses are doing extraordinarily well.  Last year the Government introduced a measure enabling businesses to give a &euro;500 tax-free gift to their employees.  The piece for the employer was that he or she did not have to pay PRSI on it.  The constituent I spoke to asked if that could be raised to &euro;1,000 this year because there are employers out there who would like to make that kind of gift to their employees.  I raised it with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, who passed it on to the Minister for Finance.  Not only has the increase to &euro;1,000 been included in the budget, but provision has also been made for an employer to give that gift twice.  Imagine employees receiving a gift certificate or One For All voucher in mid-November or on 1 December.  This quite substantial measure has been somewhat overlooked in the reporting of the budget but I would encourage those employers who are doing very well to consider using it.<\/p>  <p>  The budget has been reasonably good for third and fourth level students but I want to highlight the plight of PhD students.  This Government is more committed than any previous government to higher education and has the first Cabinet Minister with full responsibility for higher education.  However, we are not giving enough to PhD students to enable them to study.  Without the resource of PhD students, the country will be poorer in terms of enterprise opportunities that may lie ahead.  In particular, I want to mention educational and clinical psychologists.  The health service is so short of clinical psychologists and they have campaigned for an increase in the amount they receive to &euro;24,000 per year.  I ask the Minister not to focus solely on clinical psychologists because educational psychologists have as important a function in our society.  We really need to look at that PhD piece.<\/p>  <p>  Garda resourcing has come very much into focus in the last number of weeks and while I am glad to see the recruitment figures for next year, there are also pretty significant attrition rates in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is not just due, as would traditionally have been the case, to retirements.  Some garda&iacute; are leaving because they cannot afford to live in Dublin, while for others the nature of the job is so challenging, including a lack of promotional opportunities, that they have decided to seek alternative employment.  That should be a cause of concern for the Minister and the Government.  <\/p> <p> I would like to see more resources allocated to new technologies which, as the Acting Chair knows, is a subject close to both our hearts.  The Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill has gone through the D&aacute;il and now has to go to the Seanad, and includes provisions relating to scramblers.  Technology, including drone technology, will be needed to police the use of scramblers.  I would like the Garda and Minister to have a conversation about that.<\/p> <p> The building blocks measure is probably an issue.  There are apartments in my constituency that need remediation, and people expected measures in this budget.  This is the measure that the Minister for Finance has decided will help to pay for pyrite, mica and defects generally.  I have two issues with it.  Obviously, it will affect every builder or contractor who buys concrete materials or blocks.  The problem is that the people who will ultimately pay for that comprise a much smaller group.  They will, more than likely, be first-time buyers or whatever.  These measures have to be paid for.  They are significant.  Social housing construction is outstripping private housing construction.  If this was repeated next year, the State would pay itself, through local authorities and approved housing bodies, because they are the ones who would be purchasing materials or paying contractors.  That is not what we want.<\/p> <p> Ultimately, something dramatic has to happen with the Construction Industry Federation of Ireland in respect of facing up to the reality, in particular in regard to defective apartments and homes in Dublin.  I want to assure my constituents and those who have raised this issue in the Construction Defects Alliance that this is an issue that will not be left sit.  <\/p> <p> We talked about public transport fares.  Reducing fares is great, but if there are no buses on routes reduced fares are of little use to anyone.  I note the apology by the National Transport Authority, NTA, to commuters yesterday.  That is about as useful as reduced fares when there are no buses on routes and young students, in particular young female students, travelling late in the evening, are left stranded at bus stops and do not know until the last minute what is happening until the bus that is due disappears from the schedule.  My understanding is that when free school transport was extended in the summer and there were not enough buses, the Department seemed to find buses from everywhere.  I would say to the NTA that it has its own public service obligation to commuters.  It needs to go out and find buses for these routes until such time as a contractor can supply buses to those routes.  An apology is simply not sufficient and flies in the face of Government measures.  The Government has taken successive steps in regard to making public transport much more affordable and attractive.  The NTA simply cannot provide buses on the routes to supply and meet the demand that is out there.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, is present.  A number of items relating to acute neurological healthcare are welcome.  I welcome the funding for an issue that is close to my heart, namely, Huntington's disease.  The Minister of State knows that I served for a number of years on the Tallaght drugs and alcohol task force.  There is an additional &euro;10.5 million for the drugs strategy and a further &euro;4 million for the expansion of community and residential addiction services, which are so important.  There is almost &euro;1 million for care pathways for high-risk drug and alcohol users.  One measure I welcome is the &euro;1 million for monitoring new and emerging drugs.  This is a budget that is very broad in its scope and encompasses those who are signed up to the social contract in our society.  It has done its very best to meet the challenges that face this country heading into winter 2022 and spring 2023.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900037#NN00200","speaker":"1572","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664464500,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I have listened carefully to the previous contributions.  I have listened to many contributions on the same subject over many years.  The usual clich&eacute;s used to be trotted out, such as \"Too little, too late\".  Somebody resurrected that phrase again, with some encouragement, in the past few days.  The phrase \"Opportunities lost\" is now a fable.  We were told we could have done more and did not do it, and that the budget is a failure.  All of those things have been trotted out at various times in the past.<\/p>  <p>  The budget is excellent.  It does what is needed now to address the issues that are pertinent and pressing and that are affecting people's livelihoods, their cost of living and their families.  It does not resolve everything; no budget ever did.  There were always people who said the Government could and should have done more and that if they had been in government, they would have done more.  The important thing is that the they are usually the Opposition.  They would always do more, until they get the chance to do something and then there is something missing.<\/p>  <p>  All credit is due to Ministers for their presentations and the manner in which they went about addressing the issues that are pertinent and pressing now.  In education, that involved school transport and pupil teacher ratios.  There are some outstanding issues in the school transport system.  I have raised the issue a few times and it is to be hoped it can be resolved relatively easily, in particular students with concessionary tickets.<\/p>  <p>  I want to briefly mention that this was made possible because the country was run well in the past two and half years, even in difficult circumstances and in the face of an international and national economic crash before that.  If this country had not stood its ground in 2008, 2009 and 2010 and 2011 and faced up to its responsibilities, we would not able to do anything now.  It would not be possible.  We would still be going around with begging bowls.<\/p>  <p>  I recall people saying a couple of years ago that money should not be put into what became the rainy day fund on the basis that it was raining heavily outside at the time.  If precautions had not been taken then, we would not now have independence and be able to do the things that need to be done.  There is always an unforeseen threat coming down the road.  That remains the case still, and it may remain the case into the future.<\/p>  <p>  I was on a committee with the now Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications between 2006 and 2008 when the energy industry was being reviewed.  The European Union was, correctly, attempting to create an international grid in such a way that there would be some electricity at all times readily available and generated, and Europe would eventually be independent in terms of energy production.  That did not happen for many reasons.  In this country, we failed to deliver it.  I will not mention any names, but an announcement was made to the effect that we had sufficient energy, or even surplus energy, for the foreseeable future and there was nothing to worry about.  Of course, that person was speaking against the background of a country that was on its knees in an economic recession.  That prediction was completely and absolutely wrong.  At the time, EirGrid should have looked much more carefully at the situation that presented.<\/p>  <p>  There is also an issue regarding wind-generated electricity.  I have heard an argument, that still continues to this day, about offshore wind generation.  Offshore energy generation means that people want it to be away from them in order that they do not have to put up with it.  I would warn against too much reliance on offshore wind energy at this stage because it requires at least ten years of heavy investment that has not yet been put in place.  We would have to import it and produce more energy onshore.  There are still some places where we can produce more onshore.<\/p> <p>There were other interruptions such as the undergrounding of all cables.  I recall going to Italy some years ago and looking at the cables all over the place.  They were up the sides of mountains and so forth.  It was good enough for there but we were to go underground in the same way as the Netherlands.  There is something of a difference between the terrain in the Netherlands and here.  Digging into rock formations takes much more ingenuity than driving across a level plain.  Much more needs to be done yet with some urgency.<\/p> <p> There is no use in waiting for the lights to go out to take the means that are available and within reach and put them into operation.  That is an area on which we need to focus in the future.  I agree with my colleagues that the time will come eventually, I hope, when electricity can heat homes and good insulation and energy conservation will do that.  It is a good combination.  <\/p> <p> It is expensive to retrofit houses and so on.  It is not easy by a long shot.  The biggest contribution that can be made is double or triple glazing of doors and windows.  It completely eliminates the escape of heat and noise for those who live in areas where they are concerned about noise such as near motorways or airports.  The issue can be, and needs to, be dealt with in a more focused way.  We need to examine it and see how and when we can produce the end result, as opposed to saying we have it up and running and it will be done by offshore investment.  It will not because it is not there, but it needs to be looked at in a meaningful way.<\/p> <p> I could not make this contribution without a mention of housing.  Housing remains to be done in an even more meaningful way than it is being done.  It is a considerable challenge as it was five or ten years ago.  Twenty-seven years ago, I predicted that housing would be the biggest challenge facing the country in the next 20 years.  Guys laughed at me in this House and outside it, but I was right.  I will make the next prediction now that, sadly, a food shortage will be the next crisis that hits the globe along with the other military challenges we see at present.<\/p> <p> That is why we have to balance.  I am not chiding my colleagues in the Green Party but we have to challenge those who suggest that we can afford to reduce our food-producing capacity in this country and at the same time survive; we cannot.  It does not work that way.  We provide food in this country for approximately 50 million people.  The knock-on effect of that, if food shortages increase, will be that 50 million people who are barely affected now will be affected by any food shortage in the future.  Such a shortage will come rapidly and will be severe.  We can think about that because it is a fact.<\/p> <p> The budget is tremendous.  It addresses the issues as they need to be addressed now and does not overdo it.  It holds something in reserve in the event that we have to go again.  However, the bit that I have to laugh about is this: the budget has not got through the House and, already, some commentators are asking whether there will be a mini-budget.  They do not seem to look across the water to see the result of a mini-budget over there.  Even with all the resources it has, the tide can quickly turn into a crisis.  We need to talk and act very carefully in a structured way.  That is being done.<\/p> <p> Suffice it to say that housing and health remain issues.  We are not underspending on health, incidentally.  Some &euro;22 billion on health is a fair spend.  It is a considerable sum and takes a lot of getting.  We have to organise it more efficiently than we have in the past and try to ensure that we make the changes that are necessary, long before they become a crisis to cater for the demands that are likely to arise in the future.  That is my humble suggestion in that area but I know the Minister and the Government are conscious of that.<\/p> <p> I said, years ago, that there was a necessity for an emergency housing programme.  I still think that is the case.  Even though there has been success, it is efficient to get ahead of where we are to be.  If there are 100,000 people on housing waiting lists of all descriptions - both public and private - in a given year, by the time we get to resolving that, there will be 200,000 on the lists, unless we make considerable changes.  We have to cater for asylum seekers and, rightly so, and for our indigenous population.  Between them, we need to address it in an extra special way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900038#OO00200","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1664465100,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Saincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Debate","time":1664465100,"counter":316,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900039#PP00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","time":1664465100,"counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900039#PP00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1664465100,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I will make a point before I start and I intend no disrespect to the Minister of State who is here.  I have looked for this Topical Issue matter on a couple of evenings and it has been selected for this evening.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has responsibility for the area that I wish to discuss and I am disappointed I was not informed by the Ceann Comhairle's office that she was not available.  The Minister of State is hard-working and this is in no way a criticism of my party colleague.  She has been very helpful to me on a number of issues and I have been discussing the issue of dementia care with the her.  We all wait for our slots in Topical Issue debates and it would be only proper and courteous that if the Minister with responsibility for that area is not available, we be told in order that we can wait for a time slot when that Minister is available.  It is no disrespect to the Ministers of State who are present but Deputy Butler is the Minister of State with responsibility for dementia care.  She is developing a new strategy for dementia care and it is to her I wished to make my points on dementia care in County Tipperary.<\/p>  <p>  When a Minister is not available, the Ceann Comhairle's office should inform us of that and give us the opportunity, if we so wish, to wait for an opportunity for the relevant Minister to be in the Chamber.  I make no criticism of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  I have an excellent working relationship with her. This evening did not suit her work schedule, which I fully appreciate and accept, but I wish to make the point.<\/p>  <p>  Dementia, unfortunately, is becoming an ever-bigger issue in our society.  We had an historic budget this year that we have been talking about for the past number of hours.  It includes &euro;180 million for older persons.  I give great credit to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, for securing that in this year's budget.  She has worked extremely hard to get her budget increased and has managed to do so for older persons in this year's budget.  She has clearly stated that she wants to develop a dementia strategy following this budget allocation.  I also welcome the announcement that a further &euro;50 million of funding will be allocated to deliver a target of 24 million hours of home care in 2023.  The Minister of State's priority and focus on development of dementia services and supports will continue.  There has been an increase of 15% in new home-care hours ring-fenced for people with dementia, with a continuation of dementia home supports and continuing funding of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  This is all very welcome news that will be viewed positively by many families throughout the country who have loved ones living with dementia.<\/p>  <p>  I will highlight a serious need for long-term care for people with dementia in my home county of Tipperary.  While I appreciate and fully support the fact that we should care for older people in their homes as much as possible, there are times when this is simply not an option for families.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and I visited a dementia-specific nursing home village in Bruff, County Limerick, which is leading the way in dementia-specific care in that area.<\/p> <p>I was most impressed by the standard of care in this facility, the resources available and the specialised approach being taken to the residents.  It was top class.<\/p> <p> That is what I am looking for for my county.  I am aware the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is developing the strategy.  Both she and I were there that day at the village in Bruff and we saw the excellent care and the model that is there.  I want to push with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, for us to get that nationwide and obviously as a Deputy representing Tipperary I am looking for the county to host one of the pilot dementia village projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900039#PP00500","speaker":"1611","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664465700,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Improving services for people with dementia is a priority for the Government and the past three years have seen significant new investment in dementia-specific support services and care countrywide.  Next year will see a further &euro;12.16 million investment dedicated to dementia and this is in addition to the cumulative &euro;27.9 million provided across 2021 and 2022.<\/p>  <p>  I will bring the Deputy's concerns back to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  In fairness to her, she is very much to the forefront of fighting for funding in her area and is a pleasure to work with in the Department.  This funding over three years is allowing for the rapid expansion of dementia diagnostic services and post-diagnostic supports through the provision of new memory assessment and support services as well as two new specialist memory clinics in Cork and Galway.  It is also providing for numerous other initiatives including: dementia-specific day care; quality improvements in hospital and mental healthcare; improved access to the National Dementia Adviser Service; dementia-specific education for home support workers; and the implementation of a national clinical guideline on the appropriate prescribing of psychotropic and antipsychotic medication.  In addition, it is targeted at increasing the proportion of new home support hours specifically for people with dementia to 50% in 2023, which is up from 5% in 2021 and 11% in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years the national network of memory technology resource rooms has expanded to 23 centres.  Of these, two are located in County Tipperary.  One is in Thurles and the other in Clonmel.  These provide an occupational therapist assessment and guidance along with the opportunity to find out about assistive technology options to help manage memory difficulties.  Dementia-specific day care is provided in Clonmel and Thurles and taken together all these investments are rapidly improving access to diagnostics, post-diagnostic supports and ongoing care for people with dementia.<\/p>  <p>  While national policy on care for older people is focused on supporting people to remain at home for as long as possible, the national dementia strategy recognised that for some people long-term residential care may be required when home care is no longer feasible or appropriate.  A majority of people with dementia reside in generic residential care facilities and this is reflected in the 2016 revised HIQA National Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland.  The standards place a strong focus on quality of life and a person-centred approach to care for all residents, including those with dementia.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to residential care for people with dementia in north Tipperary, following a meeting last month at Government Buildings, HSE mid-west community healthcare is preparing an options appraisal document for older people services in the north Tipperary area.  As agreed at the meeting, the service is reviewing all options for the Dean Maxwell unit and the progression of the new older persons unit in Nenagh.  The service is also examining the overall requirements for older people services in the region.  HSE mid-west community healthcare is committed to delivering the best possible older people services to the people of north Tipperary and it is expected an options paper will be presented in quarter 4 of 2022.  As for dementia-specific residential care services provided in south Tipperary, the Cashel residential older people services provides an 11-bed dementia-specific service for women configured as nine single rooms and one double.  All other long-term residential beds are profiled as generic beds in order to meet the need.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy talked about the great facilities and excellent care in Bruff, County Limerick.  I will also bring that to the Minister of State's attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900040#QQ00500","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1664465700,"counter":324,"content":"<p>In case there is any misunderstanding, I am not criticising the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, in any respect.

It is an important service and sometimes it is vulnerable people who need it most.  They may have no transport, may have run out of money or may not be in receipt of any payment from anyone anywhere.  They may be out of work or perhaps out of work due to ill health and not had their claims processed yet.  The service is therefore the last hope for people in dire straits through no fault of their own.  There was a strong network going back over the years in every county and in key local towns.<\/p> <p>There might be between six and ten of them in a county, depending on the size of it.  It is for people who do not have a computer and may not have a phone or phone credit.  It is important that the walk-in service is there.  Sometimes I come across people who are accessing that service who have a learning disability or intellectual disability and may not be <i>au fait<\/i>with laptops.  They may not have a laptop and may not even have a phone.  There is more demand now than ever for this service.  The additional needs payment is welcome for people who are in energy poverty or energy hardship, to meet once-off demands with the current energy crisis and so on.  There is a growing demand for that service.  It was never needed more than it is at the moment.  It is the last hope for those who are in a bad situation or who are in dire straits.<br\/><br\/>I raised this with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, on 8 September and she sent me back a reply stating that continued in-person customer engagement remains a pivotal feature within the community welfare service.  She outlines that this is still available at two locations in Laois.  I would contradict that.  This is not the fault of the local community welfare officers.  She also says there is a free-phone helpline in Dublin and that people can send an email.  She says there is no longer a requirement for a person to meet a community welfare officer to make a claim.  There is.  That is what I contend.  The Minister goes on to say that it is important to note that the assessment and decision on claims and any further customer interaction is carried out locally, based on community welfare officers, as it always has been.  Her letter states that the delivery of a locally based community welfare service remains the cornerstone of the service.<br\/><br\/>I would question that seriously, given the way it has been centralised.  This service has been overly centralised over the last couple of years.  Gone is that network of face-to-face walk-in services where the community welfare officer came to a particular health centre, Government office or wherever for two hours, typically, on some morning during the week.  The one community welfare officer would cover a whole county doing it.  They would not even need to spend all their time at it, just a couple of hours in each town.  Now people are being told to email Dublin or contact the national helpline.  Telling people that is absolutely daft.  People are being told to download forms on a computer.  We are talking to people in a lot of cases who do not have a computer and are not computer-literate.  This service has really deteriorated.  The assurances given by the Minister here and what she said in the letter do not reflect the reality on the ground.  That network of community welfare officers is no longer in place.  I ask the Minister to address this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900040#QQ00900","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664466300,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  She is at a conference in Cavan today for rural development Ministers from the OECD.  I thank Deputy Stanley for raising the issue.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is the safety net within the overall social welfare system that provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient.  The community welfare service, CWS, remains a flexible service which meets the varied needs of vulnerable people and the Minister wants to be absolutely clear that it continues to provide local access to local community welfare officers, CWOs, in local areas across the country and there are no plans to change the service.  Her Department has maintained staffing levels in the CWS nationwide in recent years, during times when demand decreased.  This is reflective of the commitment to continue to support delivery of locally based services to customers.<\/p>  <p>  CWOs can facilitate urgent and in-person meetings in 51 Intreo centres across business hours five days a week.  In addition to meeting citizens in the Intreo offices, branch offices and Department of Social Protection offices, CWOs can facilitate an appointment within a short time of a person requiring a meeting at a mutually agreed location including the person's home.  The Department of Social Protection has introduced innovations this year which have increased efficiency in processing applications for the supplementary welfare allowance payments.  One of these is the establishment of a back-office team to undertake preparatory work on applications.  That includes registration of claims and the gathering of supporting documentation that is necessary to assess and finalise a claim.  Providing this clerical assistance has been found to be very effective in releasing the CWOs from administrative tasks and allows them to focus on delivery.  It allows for increased capacity of CWOs to meet people locally or to travel with them as customers as required, and also for more timely processing of claims.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister firmly believes that a modern community welfare service should be easily accessible to all customers.  For this reason customers no longer have to meet in person with a CWO to make a claim.  This significant change ensures enhanced access to the welfare system.  It means, for instance, that those who require community welfare assistance in a more remote rural area no longer need to wait for an outreach service to be available.  The application form is available to download for those who can access it online.  It can also be requested by phone through the dedicated CWS free-phone line, and also by email.  The Minister cannot emphasise enough that while changes to modernise and improve the service for customers are a feature of welfare services, the delivery of a locally based service will remain a cornerstone of her commitment in the Department.

Unfortunately the reality in County Laois does not correspond with what he has outlined.  Councillors from the Government parties raised this matter at the monthly meeting of Laois County Council last Monday and are very exercised about it.  It is a real problem.  I understand the Minister cannot be here and appreciate that the Minister of State is standing in for her.  I ask the Minister of State to get the Minister to investigate this and examine what the situation is on the ground.  What she sent me in this letter of 8 September and what the Minister of State has outlined is just not the case.  The Minister of State has outlined that it is a safety net.  It is a safety net and the last hope for a lot of people.  The Minister of State mentioned that people are doing back-office work and preparatory work.  Sometimes the people who are going in need help filling out forms, be it the community welfare, the supplementary allowance form, the additional needs form or the urgent needs payment form.  They need help with those.  The CWO going around and having the local network of five or six clinics in a county provided that help for them.  The further we take things away, the more complicated they get.<\/p>  <p>  The other thing that is missing is that there was a local appeals system.  There was a superintendent in each county or one for every two counties.  If a case failed, there was an opportunity for the person to appeal to that superintendent.  Now it goes to D'Olier Street and by the time it comes out of D'Olier Street, God help anybody who would be waiting on it.  The Minister of State knows from his own office that it can take six or nine months or longer to get stuff back from D'Olier Street.  If there was a justifiable, genuine case there, the appeal could be made to the local superintendent who would review the case again and maybe there was additional information required.  We cannot pull away all of that.  People talking to a phone, getting through to a chasing line telling them to press this button, press that button, or trying to download forms on a computer when they do not have a computer just does not work.  This is causing real hardship.  People who are in this situation are already in hardship.  I do not want to see them put in further hardship.

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan, for being here, because the question is on refurbishment and retrofitting.  The Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, OPW, has good experience in the fine work that the OPW carries out on many of our buildings across the country.<\/p>  <p>  I want to ask about the retrofitting of our schools across the country.  Many of us visit and talk in schools.  Schools we visit can have varying, different standards of buildings.  I visited a school recently in Rathnew, namely, St. Coen&rsquo;s, which was newly built and is absolutely fantastic.  There are high energy-efficiency measures within the building - everything from the taps to the water conservation measures and more.  It has water attenuation tanks outside that catch rainwater from the roof and then regenerate back into the building.  The roof was wired for solar panels but they did not have them.  They asked me to look into that, so I would be delighted to go back to them now to tell them that we are putting free solar panels on schools.  That is a bit of good news going back.<\/p>  <p>  However, other schools we visit &ndash; the Minister of State knows ones I am talking about &ndash; where you go in and there are the badly-fitted windows, the central heating is pumped up to 90 and the heat is all going out through the windows.  The heating is blasting out, but yet the children are cold in the classrooms.<\/p>  <p>  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Education on it, and the response came back about the energy retrofit pathfinder programme, which is a programme to identify and assess schools for retrofitting.  I just do not know how a school actually applies for it, how it is assessed or how it gets onto that pathfinder programme.  We know the tremendous work that the teachers do in the classroom and the school principals are absolutely up to their eyes, so I do not know if they would have time to sit down and look into how to apply for a retrofit for their schools.  It would be good if we could make it easier for those schools to apply for those energy retrofits to get the assessments carried out to see what the best return for them is, for example, new windows, thermostatic controls, lighting controls or something to help them with those huge energy bills, especially where they are dependent on oil heating.  It is expensive, wasteful and bad for our environment.  <\/p>  <p>  I do not know if the Minister of State has any information on that.  However, I would like to be able to go to the schools and tell them about the pathfinder programme that was introduced and is a collaboration between the Department of Education and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  How do school apply for that programme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900042#SS00100","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1664466900,"counter":336,"content":"<p>At the outset, I want to thank Deputy Matthews for raising this issue.  My office had, through the offices of the other Ministers for whom I am deputising, reminded them to tell colleagues if they were not available, so I do not know what happened in respect of the other issue.<\/p>  <p>  I want to thank the Deputy for raising this issue, as it provides me with an opportunity to outline the current position on retrofitting and sustainable energy in school buildings for the Department of Education.  The Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings.  This performance has been recognised at both national and international levels.<\/p>  <p>  The National Development Plan 2021-2030, which was published on 4 October, provides capital funding of more than &euro;4 billion for investment in school infrastructure during the period of 2021-2025 and there continues to be a strong climate action dimension in this.  The Department of Education&rsquo;s technical guidance documents set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency.  Schools that are designed and built in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s school technical guidance documents have been receiving A3 building ratings since 2009, with current schools typically achieving up to 20% energy performance and 25% better carbon performance than required by the current building regulations, along with 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics and infrastructure provided for electric vehicle charging.  All new technologies and approaches are tested to ensure compatibility with school design and operational requirements.  Successful and repeated results are then incorporated into the new school designs and refurbishments.<\/p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s policy is supported by a strong research programme with more than 50 research projects at various different stages.  In the interest of sustainability, it is critical that renewable applications are properly suited to the schools&rsquo; needs, so as to reduce energy costs and carbon and not just apply for the sake of having renewables.  It is also critical that we minimise the demand for energy before we invest in renewable energy applications.  This has been assisted in previous years with wall and attic insulation programmes and a water conservation programme, which the Deputy referred to. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Education and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications jointly funded the pathfinder programme, which the Deputy also referred to.  That is administered through Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  The pathfinder is a great example of collaboration, ensuring deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced in an education environment and an evidenced-based approach.  The programme continues to assist the Department of Education to explore options and test various solutions in the school building network.  It is paving the way for and informing a much larger national programme for the energy retrofitted schools built prior to 2008, as included in the national development plan, NDP.  It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have to be tried and tested, and is providing valuable development information for a solution-driven delivery strategy, which will be founded on a solid evidence base and proven to be robust and scalable, of renewable solutions within the school sector.  <\/p>  <p>  The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 41 schools across the country to date, with work on an additional 15 currently at various stages of design.  Each school undergoes a comprehensive assessment to ensure that the measures are suitable for that school and will deliver value both to the school and the environment.  The works typically include upgrades to the building's fabric, including walls, roof, doors, windows, airtightness improvements, lighting, heating and other renewable technologies.  As part of the cost-of-living measures to be enacted this year, &euro;90 million is being provided in a once-off additional funding to support increased running costs for primary and post-primary in the free education scheme in dealing with the challenges that they face due to high energy costs.  This will be paid at a rate of 40% of schools&rsquo; basic and enhanced rates of capitation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900042#SS00200","speaker":"1494"},{"type":"speech","time":1664466900,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I completely agree that the first step should be energy reduction.  That is what we should be pursuing.  It is encouraging to hear that 41 schools had pathfinder works carried out and another 15 are under assessment.  That is kind of what my question is about.  How does a school apply for or get on the radar of the Department for an assessment to be carried out?<\/p>  <p>  I visited a school in Wicklow town recently.  It was a school that had two buildings.  One was the original 1955 block with high ceilings and high windows.  It was the type of classic, old Irish national school building.  I went in to have a look at it and I could see very simple measures that could be introduced there, for example, interior wall insulation, rather than exterior, because it is a classic looking building and you do not want to take away from that classic look.  There were very simple measures that could be carried out that would reduce the heating costs in that school.  If we can reduce the heating bills for the school, it will reduce the pressure on principals who want to keep the schools warm and comfortable for children and staff.  The bills roll in and that money could be better spent on other provisions in the class.  I have no doubt that many principals would have many other things to spend the money on rather than high energy bills.<\/p>  <p>  Particularly, in relation to St. Patrick&rsquo;s school in Wicklow town, I would appreciate if the Minister of State could relay to the Minister for me that it is a school that would be very suitable for that pathfinder programme.  Generally, how does a school apply?  Does it go on the SEAI website like a residential or business user would?  Is there a direct line to the Department where you can tell it the school is freezing, the bills are huge or the windows are drafty and ask to be put on the pathfinder programme?  If the Minister could come back to me at a later stage, I would very much appreciate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900042#SS00300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1664466900,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I will ask the Department of Education, through the office of the Minister, Deputy Foley, to respond to the Deputy directly.<\/p>  <p>  On the retrofitting of older buildings, Deputy Matthew&rsquo;s commented that the OPW is steeped in this.  Every old building presents its own challenges.  In many cases the buildings the Deputy referred to are listed buildings.  This includes primary and post-primary schools, that are either listed on the city and county development plans or, in some cases, are protected structures.  That creates a difficulty as well for the board of management in terms of what can be done on the external elevations and windows.  We have to be practical as well in relation to making sure that these buildings are comfortable.  This is where often there is a clash in the prioritisation of needs.<\/p> <p>We all have in our constituencies old buildings where children are trying to be educated.  These buildings are on the list of protected structures or somebody's list of protected structures.  Unfortunately, however, the comfort and needs of the children, teaching staff and support staff often fall far down the pecking order.  Where there is a mass concrete building, the difficulties associated with attaching external or internal insulation must be borne in mind.  If it is a stone building, the stone has to be able to breathe.  The lime has to be able to breathe.  This comes with a lot of complications, and these are not easily rectifiable.<\/p> <p> We encounter these problems in the Office of Public Works when dealing with older buildings, particularly given the fact that a building will actually tell one what it is and is not capable of taking by way of modern infrastructure placed upon it.  Therefore, it is not easy, particularly where buildings built before 2008 are concerned.  Many of these were built in the 1960s and 1970s, and many of us were educated in them.  To be quite honest about it, there is probably a bigger question to be asked regarding whether it is sustainable to try to insulate a building of the scale, nature and age that I describe instead of constructing a replacement one, for instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092900042#SS00400","speaker":"1494","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1664467500,"counter":340,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an D&aacute;il ar athl&oacute; ar 5.42 p.m. go dt&iacute; 2 p.m., D&eacute; M&aacute;irt, an 4 Deireadh F&oacute;mhair 2022.<br \/><br \/>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 5.42 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 4 October 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
