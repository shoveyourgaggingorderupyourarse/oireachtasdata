I have received apologies from Senator Mark Wall, who has been ill for the last couple of weeks.  We wish him well.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read some formal notices, starting with the Covid-19 code of conduct.  The Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, and the Cathaoirleach, Senator Mark Daly, published a Covid-19 code of conduct for the parliamentary community in May.  Members, staff and visitors are requested to continue to be vigilant and to follow public health advice on preventing the spread of Covid-19 infection so we can manage the risk for ourselves and for others who are more vulnerable, including colleagues and their family members who may be elderly and-or have underlying health conditions.  All members of the parliamentary community and visitors are strongly encouraged to wear face masks &ndash; not visors &ndash; in busy or crowded locations in the Leinster House complex.  Medical grade FFP2 masks should be worn whenever recommended by the public health advice and should be worn for ten days after diagnosis of Covid-19.  This will help to reduce the risk of Covid-19 spreading among the parliamentary community.  I ask for everyone's full co-operation in this regard.  <\/p> <p>  On privilege, I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the parliamentary precincts will be asked to leave.<\/p> <p>  The first item on our agenda concerns the minutes of our previous meetings, which the members will have received on MS Teams.  Are the minutes of our meetings on 16 June, 22 June and 28 June agreed?  Agreed.  <\/p> <p>  I warmly welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, who has special responsibility for special education and inclusion, and officials from the Department of Education.  The committee appreciates the Minister of State taking the time to come before us this morning while preparations are under way for the Committee and Remaining Stages of the Education (Provision in Respect of Children with Special Educational Needs) Bill 2022 in the D&aacute;il tomorrow.  The Bill will allow the Minister for Education to direct schools to provide places in special classes to children with special educational needs, SEN, a topic very relevant to this committee.  In our second session this morning, we will hear from representatives of the teaching unions, namely the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, and the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland, ASTI.<\/p> <p>  Before we hear from the Minister of State, I propose that we publish her opening statement on the committee's website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I suggest that the Minister of State should make her opening statement for ten minutes, following which we will have questions and comments from each member, limited initially to three minutes.  If we have time remaining, members can come back in.  Our session today is for one hour.  It was meant to be for one and a half hours, but unfortunately the Minister of State is caught for time in the context of the preparation of the legislation.  I thank her for taking the time to attend.  We felt it was important that she came into this committee prior to the legislation being enacted.  I invite her now to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#A00200","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":6,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation.  I am accompanied by Brendan Doody, assistant chief inspector, special education; Frank Hanlon, principal officer, special education; and Andrina Donovan, assistant principal officer, special education.<\/p> <p>  The mission of the Department of Education is to facilitate all individuals through learning to achieve their full potential and to ensure that the education system upholds the rights of every individual.  The subject of this meeting is autism policy in education and as Minister of State with special responsibility for education and inclusion, I am committed to making a difference for students who have additional needs as part of an inclusive education system.  My Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure that all children with special educational needs can be provided with an education appropriate to their needs.  This means that children with special educational needs should be included where possible and appropriate in mainstream settings with the necessary additional teaching and care supports in place.  In circumstances where children with special educational needs require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are provided for.  I fully recognise that these more specialist supports and settings also have an important role to play.<\/p> <p>  It should be noted that the vast majority of children with special educational needs are educated in mainstream classes.  The benefits of mainstream education are known and recognised.  We must continue to build a society with inclusion at its heart, where everyone is welcome and where full participation is the right of all people, no matter their background or need.  While the overwhelming majority of our students are to be found in mainstream provision, we recognise the need to ensure that those students with more complex and enduring special educational needs are provided for as effectively as possible.  In recent years, we have made great progress in providing the additional special class and special school places necessary to meet the emerging needs of children and young people, particularly those with autism.<\/p> <p>  This year, my Department will spend over &euro;2 billion, or more than 25% of its total education budget, on providing additional supports for children with special educational needs.  This represents an increase of over 60% in total expenditure since 2011.  The number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased from 548 in 2011 to 2,118 for the 2021-22 school year.  A further 315 special classes have since been sanctioned, which will bring the total number of classes to at least 2,463 in the 2022-23 school year.  This represents an increase of 349% since 2011.  The vast majority of our special classes are provided for children with autism.  There are now 2,184 special classes for children with autism in place: 146 early intervention autism special classes, 1,401 primary autism special classes and 637 post-primary autism special classes.  Special classes to support children with significant special educational needs are substantially smaller than mainstream classes and have a pupil-teacher ratio as low as 6:1 and will have special needs assistants, SNAs, assigned to look after the pupils' care needs.  Special classes for children with autism, for example, have one teacher and two SNAs for six children.<\/p> <p>  Overall, almost 13,000 pupils are enrolled in special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, representing approximately 1% of the overall pupil population.  Three new special schools have been opened in the last three years, two in Dublin and one in Cork, and additional places continue to be provided to ensure that children with the most complex educational needs, including those with autism, receive an education in line with their needs.  We have worked hard to strengthen and streamline the planning systems between the Department and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to ensure sufficient special education places are available to meet needs throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  Significant investment has been made to ensure that schools have the necessary accommodation and facilities to receive children and young people with disabilities.<\/p><p>Professional development for teachers and school leaders is key to building capacity and confidence among teachers and their leaders and a truly inclusive culture and school environment.  A comprehensive range of in-service teacher professional learning opportunities allows those working at all levels of education to access supports which will benefit all learners, including those with autism.  Annually, the Department of Education provides funding for two distinct categories of postgraduate programmes for special education teachers, namely the postgraduate diploma programme of continuing professional development, CPD, for special education teachers and the graduate certificate in the education of pupils on the autism spectrum.  The aim is to provide substantial theoretical and practical CPD to teachers working with students with special educational needs, contributing to the school's overall capacity to meet the needs of pupils with SEN, including autism.<br\/><br\/>I recognise the need for schools and teachers to have access to high-quality resources and supports to inform their practice every day.  I was pleased, therefore, to announce the publication of Autism Good Practice Guidance for Schools in March 2022 as a resource for schools and others.  This important document is designed to help to support the well-being, learning and participation of children and young people with autism in education.  It will assist school staff to understand the varied nature of students' strengths and needs and to identify whole-school and individualised approaches to supports for students.<br\/><br\/>We are also reviewing the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, known as the EPSEN Act.  That legislation, as the committee will know, has been in place for almost 20 years, and it is timely that we are reviewing it now.  There have been many significant changes and developments in departmental policy since the EPSEN Act, and education provision has increased very substantially in the intervening period.  There has also been legislative change that impacts education.  This review will help to ensure our laws reflect current policy on and international norms in respect of provision and inclusion.  It is envisaged that the full review will be completed by early 2023.<br\/><br\/>Supporting the transition of young people with a disability right through the education system, with a particular focus on enabling young people to make informed life choices, is a priority for me.  We are working with colleagues across a number of Departments to ensure that remains a focus of the third action plan under the comprehensive employment strategy for persons with disabilities, which will cover the period from 2022 to 2024.<br\/><br\/>The development of a demonstration transition programme has been agreed to address the transition needs of young people with disabilities in the two-year run-up to their departure from school.  Under the proposal, the pilot will take place on 20 project sites with representation from a cross section of schools to include students with disabilities in mainstream post-primary settings, located in special classes attached to mainstream and in special schools.<br\/><br\/>I announced on 15 November a further planned development in the area of transition; namely, a transitions pilot for post-primary level students with special education needs.  This measure will involve the Department partnering with an NGO with experience in this area and a number of schools, identified following a call for participation, to support the transition of post-primary level students with SEN to employment, training or further study.  Under the proposal, the pilot will take place on seven project sites.  Each one will partner with a careers and employment facilitator to engage with students and their parents and to collaborate with teachers in complementary activities such as mini companies, work experience and transition planning.  This development is in the initiation phase and is planned to progress later this year.<br\/><br\/>I believe representatives of the NCSE have been before the committee recently.  As members will know, it was set up in 2003 with the aim of improving the delivery of education services to persons with SEN, with a particular emphasis on children.  I recently appointed the new CEO of the NCSE, John Kearney, who I believe will make the necessary changes to reform the organisation.  There are legacy issues that need to be addressed.  I am well aware of that and I will put in place the necessary resources in order to achieve that.  The Department of Education continues to work with the NCSE, all the education stakeholders and, of course, schools to seek to continue to improve education provision for children and young people with SEN.<br\/><br\/>There are a significant number of policy initiatives and various legislation relevant to the provision of education for children and young people with SEN.  In particular, the NCSE's final report offering policy advice on special schools and classes will be submitted to the Department later this year.  It will inform the Department in making decisions on the direction of special education policy in the coming years, including in respect of special school and special class provision.<br\/><br\/>The committee asked for a statement on the Department's plans to increase the number of post-primary special schools.  This is specifically in reference to the disparity in the number of primary special schools and post-primary special schools in Dublin.  It should be noted that all special schools are categorised by the Department as primary special schools.  There are no post-primary special schools.  While there are a small number of special schools which cater largely to post-primary-aged students, those special schools remain primary special schools.  Therefore, they operate for the primary year, which means that the students attend throughout June.  Furthermore, 60% of our post-primary schools have either an existing special class or a project on the school building programme which will provide SEN accommodation.  Last year I secured an agreement to introduce future-proofing at post-primary level involving the incorporation of four special classes in all new 1,000-student post-primary schools and other large-scale projects and <i>pro rata<\/i>for medium-sized to smaller schools.  We have also successfully engaged with the Spiritan Education Trust on SEN provision at its school sites, including its post-primary schools in the fee-charging sector.  We are opening new special schools in response to emerging demand and looking at new opportunities to enhance how children with SEN are supported while awaiting school places.  The Ombudsman for Children's report recommends that the Department and the NCSE publish a plan for ensuring there are sufficient school places in the short to medium term to meet the forecasted needs of children with SEN in their local communities.  I welcomed the ombudsman's report.  I have accepted its recommendations and will work with stakeholders to implement them.<br\/><br\/>I am committed to engaging intensely with schools, particularly post-primary schools, to ensure that there is an adequate supply of special classes and, ultimately, that every school will have special education provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#A00300","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for that comprehensive statement.

I am really glad she congratulated the Spiritans on their recent collaboration with the Department of Education.  They are really leading the way, and I hope other educational organisations will follow suit.  The Minister of State has done a lot of work in this field.  I thank her for opening Our Lady of Hope School, in my area, Dublin 12, with the Minister, Deputy Foley, earlier in the year.<\/p> <p>  As we know, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done.  One of the big issues that concerns me is the fact that, as the NCSE confirmed last week, early intervention classes cannot be accessed without a confirmed diagnosis of autism.  This does not fall within the remit of the Minister of State's Department, but children are not getting diagnosed because of the huge delays in diagnosis.  That has a direct impact on children accessing early intervention classes.  It leaves us in a space where only the children of the rich can access early intervention classes provided for by the State.  That is hugely unfair on children.  All children should have equal access to these classes.  On top of that, in areas like Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W there are not any early intervention classes.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to use the new emergency legislation, namely section 37A of the Education (Provision in Respect of Children with Special Educational Needs) Bill 2022, to ensure that schools open early intervention classes.  We all know that early intervention is key, and these classes can make a huge difference to children when it is clear very early on that they have an autism diagnosis.<\/p> <p>  I am really glad the Minister of State mentioned transition into the workforce and the pilot programmes.  That is very much welcome.  However, when we open special schools and autism classes around the country, it is really important we have wrap-around services like occupational therapists, OTs, physios and speech and language therapists.  That is just not there at the moment.  I know the Minister of State is well aware of that, but it is prudent of us as members of the autism committee to call once again for proper services to be attached to these autism classes and special schools around the country because they do not really function without the OT, the speech and language therapist, the physio or the behavioural therapist.  It is sort of like an ICU bed.  Many of the advocates would describe special education provision as such.  You need not just a bed but also all the wrap-around services to provide for children in order that they have the support they need.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State.

More than 4,000 children have already received support through AIM.<\/p> <p>  As regards early intervention classes, there were 132 such classes in the 2021-22 school year.  We had 118 of them in 2015-16.  The NCSE sanctioned the establishment of special classes, including early intervention where needed.  There have been occasions when these classes have been redesignated into special classes.  That occurs in circumstances where there is a changing age profile of students, a change in needs in an area or to ensure a continuum of support for pupils who require a special class placement.  That rarely happens, however.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about therapeutic supports.  Obviously, some children need additional supports for them to realise their potential.  There are approximately 63 special classes for children with severe speech and language disorders.  The inspectorate report on the work of these classes indicated that schools highly value the services of speech and language therapists, SLTs, who are allocated to support the work of special classes.  Many SLTs have shared professional knowledge effectively with teachers.  In short, this approach works but it is not perfect.  The progressing disability service is really under the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  Its introduction has had an impact on the provision of therapeutic supports for children with SEN in schools.  There are significant recruitment issues in that regard.  One third of all posts remain unfilled at present, including SLTs and OTs.  That has had a big impact on therapeutic supports, particularly in special schools.  All present know of the benefits of such supports.  As Minister of State, I accept that.  The principle underpinning the school inclusion model, which will involve psychologists, OTs and SLTs working collaboratively with schools, will be of value.  There is an issue in terms of recruitment of therapists, however, and we are working closely on that with my colleagues in the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure we can provide the therapeutic supports to which the Senator is referring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#C01000","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Classes have opened across my constituency and there are more to come.  What in her perception or experience brought her to the point where she believed there is a need for the legislation she is introducing?  What was the genesis of the legislation?  What is the need for it?  Having gone through a collaborative process with many schools and seen the output from that, I know many schools have been able to provide classes.  Other schools in my constituency face challenges in doing so.  What is the need for the legislation?<\/p> <p>  I refer to a particular issue relating to the legislation.  I am aware of a child in fifth class in a school in my area who has been told that his needs are such that the school will not be able to provide support next year.  The school is working hard to provide support to the child but it does not have enough SNAs or resources.  There is a conflict that does not need to be there.  I hope it can be resolved.  The child does not need to be moved at this point.  It may be that the school needs more support.  The child has fewer SNA hours available to him as he gets older because, as more children come in, there are more children with a diagnosis.  He has gone from, say, a one-to-one situation in the early part of his schooling to a one-to-five or one-to-six situation now.  What will happen to that child and others like him who I worry are caught up in the difficulties faced by schools?  The schools do not have space to open extra classes just yet and have to operate on their existing resources.  The child to whom I refer is getting older and does not need to be moved.  What will happen there?   What effect will the legislation have for him and other children like him whose parents are worried they may need to move schools?  That is my main question. <\/p> <p>  I note the comments of the Minister of State regarding the document published in April in respect of departmental support for schools that have opened additional classes.  A secondary school in my area has opened two additional classes.  I congratulate the school, St. Laurence College, on that, but it needs more support from the Department in terms of implementation.  The Department has published a document.  Is there someone in the Department whom a school can telephone between now and the opening of the classes in September in order to work out some of the practicalities?  Some of the school's questions are simple ones.  Is that something the Department can provide?<\/p> <p>  As regards teacher education, it is great that CPD and extra classes are available but what I am hearing from teachers and schools is that they can be difficult to access.  It can be difficult to get places on the weekend or shorter courses.  There is a question in respect of whether teachers can take time off to do more intensive courses.  It is all very well opening classes, but which teachers will teach those classes?  What training have they received?  The current teacher training gives students two weeks in a special school where they do not even have an obligation to prepare a lesson plan.  What preparation is available to teachers who want to do that?  Schools are asking if the Department can consider facilitating structured time away for existing and experienced teachers who may have very good teaching and social skills but want to get better at this to do the appropriate training?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#C01200","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  She asked several questions.  Her first was on the legislation.  Obviously, I would prefer to be in a position where schools volunteer to open special classes.  However, in circumstances where we still have 56 children in Dublin without a special class and approximately 49 children who do not have a special school place, we had no option but to bring forward the legislation.  This relates even to some of the schools that have been named, such as Scoil Bhr&iacute;de boys school in Blanchardstown, which is a very diverse school that welcomes migrant children from many different backgrounds and already has a special class.  It is not that these schools are not already inclusive; it just means that some of them will need to open second special classes and others will open a special class for the first time.  We do not want to be in a position every year where we are scrambling to try to open special classes at the last minute.  The legislation will help to truncate the section 37A process so that there is a six to eight week timeline in which the Minister can give a direction or an order to compel a school to open a special class.  It is always open to the school to open that special class earlier in the process.  Indeed, the school would have already received letters from us.  The section 37A process has worked on two occasions in the past.  This is the third time we are triggering it.  That is the reason we are bringing this legislation forward tomorrow.  It will be of great assistance to families.  It is a bittersweet act, one that we were reluctant to take, but we believed that we did not have an option.<\/p> <p>  In terms of SNAs, the Deputy is aware that the exceptional review process is available to schools.  We will have approximately 19,169 SNAs by the end of the year, which is an increase of 81%.<\/p><p>There should not be a difficulty in a school accessing an SNA.  It can be tricky sometimes if a child is moving from one different placement to another in those circumstances but a school should always contact the NCSE if it requires more SNA support or a child comes on stream, perhaps.  Through this legislation, under section 67, a child will be able to be designated a placement in a school.  That will be a new child and there may need to be additionality in the SNA support there.  It is always open to them to do that.<\/p><p> I think the Deputy asked about training for teachers as well.  She will know there is a mandatory inclusion module at the beginning for teachers, so all teachers are trained and they are qualified to teach.  The NCSE will the give the advice primarily that you really need experienced teachers for special classes and special schools, but there is ongoing continuing professional development, CPD, and the national induction programme for teachers where there is a range of induction workshops for newly-qualified teachers.  With the Department of Education, I mentioned earlier the two postgraduate programmes - the certificate and also the diploma programme on CPD as well, which is for special education teachers.  Those two are very valuable.  There is also the professional development service for teachers, where they provide quite a lot of different, varied modules and programmes.  The NCSE itself has teacher professional learning, which is within the confines of the Teaching Council national framework and there are supports there.  There is a complete suite of professional learning opportunities.  If any teacher has an interest in pursuing this particular area they should contact the NCSE or indeed the Department because there are bespoke in-school supports that can be offered for whole school staffs, for small groups and for individuals.  It can be tailored as well to specific needs of the particular school.<\/p><p> I mentioned earlier the Autism Good Practice Guidance for Schools, which we only published in March of this year.  It is really critical, especially for this committee to know about, because it is specifically around ASD and it is developed as a resource for schools to support them to support the needs of autistic children.  It will assist leaders, SNAs and teachers.  The guidance was developed by an expert working group drawn from the NEPS, the NCSE, the inspectorate and of course the Middletown Centre for Autism.<\/p><p> I am sorry Chairman.

The Minister of State referenced that she is in favour of and aspires to inclusive education.  However, the special units she proposed a few weeks ago could not be further from inclusion.  Has that proposal been completely withdrawn at this stage?  We all know children will blossom if they are in the correct setting with sufficient resources and that is what we want to see.  I am aware it is necessary now to bring in the emergency legislation because there are insufficient places this year but it is something that is happening year after year.  The NCSE was here last week and its officials indicated they have regular meeting with the Minister of State and with the Department.  The council has the data on how many children have additional needs so why is there not proper planning to ensure there are sufficient places, especially for children progressing from primary to post-primary?  They are in primary for eight years and their needs have to be known.  We know they are going to need a place in a post-primary school in their area.<\/p> <p>  Also on the NCSE, I welcome the fact the Minister of State recognises it needs additional resources and will be providing them.  The NEPS is in need of additional resources as well.  I think it was pointed out last week the number of special educational needs organisers, SENOs, employed by the NCSE is lower now than when it was first established.  That is something that needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  There is also the issue of the number of students who must travel outside their area to access appropriate education.  More than 15,000 children travel.  That is quite an expense.  There is one area where it is costing over &euro;72,000 per day to bus children to appropriate school placements outside their areas.<\/p> <p>  There are also 1,455 students in receipt of home tuition.  That may be a choice for some but for many it is not and is being done because the school placement has broken and children were unable to access an appropriate school placement.  I am wondering what plans the Minister of State has to address those issues.<\/p> <p>  It has also been referred to that we need more places within our schools for children with additional needs but the place is not the only thing that is needed; we need more qualified teachers, SNAs, resources and sensory rooms, etc.  I have been told of cases where a young, newly-qualified teacher has been told by the principal that he or she will take the special class for a year or two and then they will give him or her a full-time position.  That is not fair on the children and not fair on the teacher either.  Those teachers are not qualified.  Many teachers will do their utmost to teach those children but then they will move on, so it is not fair on the children who are not getting appropriate education.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State did not reference summer provision in her opening statement.  What are the plans to improve that scheme, because something drastic needs to happen?  It is too late for this year but for next year something needs to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#D00300","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I will try to answer as best I can.  Obviously, any proposal the Department comes up with would need to be in agreement with the special education consultative forum I set up that comprises advocacy groups and other stakeholders.  Any proposals, effectively, would need the forum's sign-off.<\/p><p>On the legislation and the planning, the Deputy will be aware that even the Ombudsman for Children noted and acknowledged the work over the past two years in terms of our forward planning.  We now have a geographical information system, GIS, forecasting model where data is shared in real time from the planning and building unit with the NCSE.  That was not done before so it should help with forward planning into the future.  There is also the fact we now have a commitment from the Department that all new schools will automatically have an SEN base in future.  That means 1,000 post-primary schools will have the four classrooms and then <i>pro rata <\/i>for medium-sized and smaller schools after that.  That should make a big difference.<\/p><p>The inspectorate report on provision for students with autism was published in March 2022 and we are in the process of setting up a working group around that because obviously Covid interrupted it.  However, some of the main findings are pertinent to the Deputy's question.  Some schools, we found, are operating restrictions in their enrolment policies at primary and post-primary level.  Some post-primary schools explicitly prioritised enrolment for students with higher cognitive functioning or for students who could easily integrate into mainstream classes which was thereby denying places for students with more complex needs.  In fact, the enrolment policy for post-primary special classes was found to be clear in just half of the settings.  The evidence would suggest learners with more pronounced autism needs and co-occurring learning needs encounter difficulties enrolling in special classes in these primary and post-primary schools.  Some of them are directed towards home tuitiion or indeed special schools.  The report also indicated some students' placement in a special class is inappropriate.  There were students who should have been fully enrolled in mainstream classes because their needs did not merit special class support.  There was also an issue around placement reviews.  It is important to note that in the context of the Deputy's question.<\/p><p>She also mentioned transport.  There are 15,500 children travelling.  She is correct in that and we do not dispute what the Ombudsman for Children is saying.  That is at a cost of &euro;289 million per year.  The first duty we have is to find an appropriate placement for a child.  Then our second task is to try to ensure they can attend a placement in their locality.  In Cavan there are 46 special classes and one special school and there are 36 in Monaghan at present.  Obviously, it is completely desirable that a child would go to school in their locality but it is not always completely possible.<\/p><p>On summer provision, we are putting &euro;40 million into that this year, as the Deputy knows.  We expect an increase in participation this year and hope about 48,000 students will participate.  There were about 38,000 participants last year.  There has been an increase in uptake with special schools and classes over the past two years.<\/p><p>We also have inclusion programmes for Ukrainians and others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#D00400","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>We might set the clock at two minutes for members from now on.

I believe one of them was on the school inclusion model, which is concerned with providing the right supports at the right time.  It has a number of elements, including the provision of in-school therapies such as occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.  There was a trial run in February 2019 with 75 participating schools and the outcomes for children were positive.  Unfortunately, Covid interrupted it through the closure of schools and the diversion of HSE therapists from the project.  However, the new pilot has recommenced in the area of community healthcare organisation, CHO, 7, which is where it was originally run.  We are planning an expansion.  The Department is consulting with other relevant Departments on this, including the Departments of the Taoiseach, Health and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, to ensure that we have sufficient therapists.

It is important to note that several schools have been crying out for special education classes but have been struggling to get them.  I am aware of a school in my area that had been chasing the NCSE for a letter of authorisation and only received it on the last day of term this year.  It now has to scramble to get the classroom ready for the pupils.  That level of response from the NCSE is not good enough.  I hope that the Minister of State and her team can take some action on it.<\/p><p>I will follow up on an issue that Senator Ardagh mentioned, that being, children awaiting a diagnosis.  We have a problem in children's disability network 8, CDN 8, in Longford, which probably has the largest number of children <i>per capita<\/i>awaiting diagnosis in the country.  As of 1 July, we had 186 children awaiting diagnostic screening and assessment for autism, the average waiting time was 31 months, and 37 children had been waiting for longer than 48 months.  <i>Per capita<\/i>, that is probably the worst figure in the country.  The Minister of State has acknowledged the significant challenges in trying to recruit therapists for these services.  Currently, there are 4.5 vacancies in the Longford centre.  Two of those are speech and language therapists.  Most ironically of all, 0.8 of those posts is being filled through a speech and language therapist from an agency.  I have made a proposal, supported by the schools in the area, to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, that we consider allocating emergency funding to allow the schools to source private therapy providers and bring them into the schools.  There is a fundamental issue with the service in Longford.  I am conscious of my speaking time, so is this something that the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, will give consideration to with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, given the severity of the crisis in Longford, as highlighted by the figures I have provided?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#E00700","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

That is how it should be.<\/p><p><i>Vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the Deputy's question on access to special classes and special school places, I will discuss it with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  As the Deputy conceded, it is primarily under her remit.  The nature and level of the education response in terms of special classes is based on the professionally assessed needs of each child.  In terms of a special school, all children have to have a professional recommendation that says that they have complex or severe learning needs that require the support of a special school setting and the reasons for that being the case.  In terms of a special class and early intervention, a diagnosis is required in order to ensure that the right supports are given to those with the greatest levels of need.  The Department's policy is to try to get children into mainstream education if at all possible, but if they need special school classes or places, they will require diagnoses.  The Disability Act provides for the assessment of the health and educational needs of persons with disabilities, which falls within the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  The HSE makes an assessment through an assessment officer or another of its employees.  An assessment officer prepares an assessment report and states in it whether there is a disability, the extent of that disability and a statement of health-led needs.<\/p><p>I appreciate there are waiting periods and I know the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is working really hard to reduce those and has done in certain cases.  I will let her know about the Deputy's contribution and certainly pass on the comments to her.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#E01200","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and her officials to today's meeting.  Before I ask my first question, I assume she has the required delegated responsibility for the area of special needs.  Will she confirm that?<\/p> <p>  We had a good engagement with the chief executive officer of the National Council for Special Education last week and he was open to the idea of re-examining and reappraising the threshold, that is, the numbers of students per special class.  I can think of a couple of schools in my constituency that have requested the opening of a new class but they are not in a position to do it because other schools in the area, although not in the same community, have classes.  Working on the assumption that the Minister of State has the delegated responsibility in this area, does she share the same opinion as the chief executive officer on re-examining that threshold?  It is six per class currently.  A reduced number would satisfy many parents who wish to keep their children in their own community.<\/p> <p>  It is not satisfactory that the system looks at a 20-mile radius but people who have sons and daughters in mainstream primary school classes are afforded the luxury of being kept in local communities.  Under the current policy, if the classes do not fill to the required threshold, children with special needs may have to travel 20 km, 25 km or 30 km.  That is against the express wishes of the school, the principal, the board of management and the parents' association, who have an aspiration or ambition to open another class.  Under the current policy, they are not in a position to do so.<\/p> <p>  The NCSE and SENOs work under this policy and, in fairness, the SENOs see the value of keeping sons and daughters in their own communities.  Under the current system, that threshold of six is a big number, especially in rural areas.  It may cover an area between 25 km and 35 km across and parents who wish to keep children in a closer school may not be able to do so.  This is the complete opposite to what is happening in the greater Dublin area, where there is pressure to get schools open.  In my county, principals want to open classes but are not in a position to do it because of current policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#F00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>As a former Minister for Education and Skills, I take Deputy McHugh's contribution seriously, as I do with all members of the committee.

It is not the first time I have heard such comments about the numbers in a special class and there are different views on both sides.  It is something we could consider although we would not be able to sign off on anything without the collaboration of stakeholders and unions around that, along with the school community itself.  We could ask the principals' forum if it is something they feel they could provide.  In a case where there are three children looking to enter a special class in circumstances where such places are available but it would not be properly sanctioned until there are six in the class, it must be looked at.  I have also heard from some people they would like more pupils per class, such as eight or ten.  That could also cause difficulties.

I asked if its planning and analysis of the need for school places was robust enough so the Department and schools could plan ahead.  I ask the Minister of State the same question.  Given the legislation we will deal with this week, does any aspect of the process need to be strengthened?  That relates to planning.<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the Minister of State's comment earlier about interest among teachers.  Does she have an indication of that level of interest among teachers in providing special education?  The Minister of State told us about supports for teachers already in place but has there been any reorientation with respect to teacher training models for new teachers?  It is crucial for all teachers because if education is to be inclusive, there must be reorientation, but it is particularly important for teachers who want to specialise.  It should be seen as an attractive proposal.<\/p> <p>  My final question concerns July provision.  All of us receive so many emails from parents right across the country who are beyond distressed.  One parent told me the family would be in lockdown until 1 September, and that gives an indication of how acute this problem is.  In that context, has the Minister of State given thought to childcare practitioners, many with level 6 or level 7 qualifications, who have expressed an interest in providing July provision?

On the question of forward planning, there is a range of strategic initiatives we are building on and some of the recommendations were set out in the ombudsman's report.  We have been building on those anyway for the past two years.  As I said, he acknowledged that there has been much work done over the past two years with the Department, the NCSE, patrons and management bodies.  There is also updated technical guidance for building projects and future-proofing, which I mentioned a few moments ago, for future accommodation in all new schools.  The modular accommodation framework has also been in place since 2021.  There is the expansion of existing planning exemptions for additional accommodation at existing school sites.  Usually, if a school applies for additional accommodation under the scheme, it is requested to put in a special educational needs provision when it seeks that new project.<\/p> <p>  The strategic initiatives have helped to deliver permanent accommodation for 292 special classes and there is additional capacity for 122 classrooms in 22 special schools.  That is during the period of the national development plan.  There are 700 projects under that plan that would deliver 1,300 new special educational needs classrooms and 200 replacement classrooms for 7,800 pupils in primary and post-primary education.  Almost 100 are currently on-site delivering classroom spaces for almost 1,000 additional special educational needs pupils.

I will endeavour to be brief where others have failed and see whether I can stick to the two-minute limit.  My questions are closely related to those of Deputy Harkin.  My first is about vision as distinct from forward planning.  If we want to know the steps we need to take we need to know where we are going.  It strikes me there is tension, even in the Minister of State's opening statement, between the wish we have to provide a fully inclusive society and providing specialist supports and settings where appropriate for the educational needs of the child.  If we are sitting at just under 2,500 special classrooms at present where is it envisaged we need to get to with provision?  Instances of autism are fairly predictable in terms of numbers per population.  We have a good idea of the population that will attend our schools.  Similarly with regard to special school placement, are we where we need to be?  Where do we understand we will need to get to?<\/p> <p>  My next question is on continuing professional development arrangements.  I am not sure they are sufficient, notwithstanding the position of the NCSE last week.  For example, there is provision for substitute cover for up to 35 days for some diplomas.  Stepping out of a special classroom and asking a substitute teacher to step in for seven weeks of the year is suboptimal.  We need to plan ahead in terms of the provision of training for teachers.  Very often we end up in a situation where teachers stay in special classrooms for a long period of time because they have become the most qualified teachers in the school setting and they find it difficult to step out of it either to access training or further training or to take a break in a mainstream setting.<\/p> <p>  I have failed miserably to stick to my two minutes despite my stated intention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#G00600","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I will try to answer the questions.  The question the Deputy asked on vision is very important.  Whatever about the work we are doing about the transit we need to know what the endpoint is.  The Department has a core alignment with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and particularly Article 24.  We have a triple-track approach with mainstream classes, special classes and special schools.  The UN convention very much looks at a single-track approach.  To give practical effect to this would take many years.  There is absolutely a place for special schools, special classes and mainstream classes.  We need to comply with the UN convention but it will take a long period of time to give effect to it and it will have to be in collaboration with all of the various stakeholders to achieve something like this.<\/p> <p>  With regard to prevalence rates, the then Minister for Health Deputy Harris commissioned a report in 2018 that found 1.5% of children have autism.  The NCSE data on ASD indicates a prevalence rate of 1.55%.  While it seems small in the scheme of things it is an important component of the education system.  This figure is used for planning buildings.  We do provide a little more space above and beyond this.  The Deputy was effectively saying there is an exponential growth in autism, which there is, and it is something we need to be mindful of when making our calculations, particularly forward planning for school buildings and ensuring we have adequate capacity for these children.  The calculation is based on children between the ages of four and 18 in State-funded schools.  It is a best estimate of what we have at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#G00700","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I also asked about continuing professional development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#G00800","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I have outlined the various continuing professional development options available through the Department of Education, the NCSE, the professional development service for teachers and teacher professional learning.

I fully welcome the legislation passed this week.  It is extremely important and will benefit thousands of children throughout the country.  We will see children being educated in their own communities with their siblings.  This is extremely important.  I know the Minister of State is passionate about special education and that she is making very positive moves for families throughout the country.  I fully support the school inclusion model.  We have spoken about it on a number of occasions in recent years.  I would like to see it expanded even faster.  Deputy Flaherty mentioned issues in our county where there is a severe lack of services.  If the Minister of State is looking at expanding the model I ask her to consider a model in our county where there are 36 primary schools.<\/p><p>That would be an ideal area to expand, especially given that it is lacking in services due to the lack of occupational therapy and speech and language therapy staff.<\/p><p> The summer provision has been highlighted by a number of members.  We have it on our programme for discussion in the autumn.  That might be a good opportunity for the Minister of State to come back in to discuss the provision.  There is a major issue with the lack of schools engaging, the lack of special schools with a programme and the lack of in-school provision.  Parents send me Facebook pages advertising people who are available to do the homeschool-based provision and looking for four or five families to come together for it.  The children for whom we set up the July provision a number of years ago are not getting it now.  Summer is a long period of time.  I agree with Deputy Harkin about the possibility of using ECCE staff.  They are qualified, some with a master's in education, but are not eligible to take part in it.  I would love to see all schools running July provision.  We could have ECCE staff coming in who are fully qualified.  We could have speech and language and occupational therapy students from the colleges working in schools during the summer for work experience.  If not every school, we could look at bringing two or three schools together.  Senator Wall spoke to me about this issue as well.  In a town in Kildare, four schools came together and agreed that at least one of them would have a full four-week provision.  All the teachers from the four schools worked in the one school to make sure the kids in the area were covered.  That is something that needs to happen.

Around the summer provision, there has been a 64% increase in special schools and classes availing of it between 2019 and 2021.  It has increased over the last three years.  However, I accept what the Chair is saying.  We want to increase that into the future.  I would like every school to provide summer provision where they can.  There were 377 special schools with special classes providing it over the last two years, which is around 5,587 children.  To put that in context, there were only about 149 schools in 2011 with about 2,500 children.  It helps children build their confidence, increases their well-being and provides motivation to them.  We want to see more schools providing it into the future.  I will be working very closely with the Department to make sure we get the feedback from this year.  We can come back to the committee if it wishes and speak about that.<\/p> <p>  The special schools get an extra &euro;2,000 in grant funding to try to incentivise them.  There is an extra week's pay there as well.  I have heard what the Chair and Deputy Harkin said about using other staff outside the education staff.  That is worth considering.  The National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education, NABMSE, and the Department inspectorate provided a presentation on the supports and the benefits to children on the summer provision to try to encourage other schools to avail of it.  We will be doing as much as we possibly can, on top of what we are already doing.  Some of the steps we took included the provision of paid overseeing and preparation time for schools.  We have reduced the administrative burden for schools, as I said earlier.  We have tried to provide greater flexibility in the timing of the programme and guidance to schools to design and deliver the programme so we can have as much uptake as possible.  It is a long summer and it can be very difficult for families.  The children get so much out of it.  They also get a report for September on what they have done.  They can learn a lot through fun-based activities, whether that is in music, drama or art.

Gabhaimid bu&iacute;ochas leis an gcoiste as an gcuireadh teacht agus labhairt ina l&aacute;thair.  The INTO is the oldest and largest teachers&rsquo; trade union in Ireland, representing almost 50,000 teachers at primary level in the Republic of Ireland and primary and post-primary level in Northern Ireland.  We welcome the opportunity to address the committee.  We would like to focus on access to assessment and early intervention, issues with assessment of need and some current challenges being experienced in the education system.  We would also like to look briefly at the need for autism-friendly school buildings.<\/p> <p>  I know the Minister spoke to the committee this morning.  She probably bamboozled members with the same statistics that I will.  There are currently 3,329 primary schools on the Department of Education&rsquo;s database.  In the 2022-23 school year, there will be 1,548 autism classes and early intervention classes across all primary schools.  This is an increase of 674 classes since 2018.  The number of autism classes has almost doubled from 743 to 1,404 over that period.  It shows that schools are committed to providing inclusive education for all pupils.  These statistics speak for themselves.<\/p> <p>  As inclusive education has evolved in recent years, autism spectrum disorder, ASD, and special classes have become an integral and essential part of the Irish education system.  It is important that the State continues to offer a range of provision to ensure that children obtain the best possible education in a setting that suits their needs.  The INTO believes that all schools are inclusive schools, including special schools and schools with ASD and special classes.  Inclusive education does not necessarily mean that all pupils must be enrolled in mainstream classes.  The INTO believes that a range of options across a continuum of provision must continue to be available to parents.<\/p> <p>  In making this submission, we emphasise that the INTO has long advocated the need for improvements to educational provision for students with ASD.  In 2014, we called for increased emphasis on early intervention, targeted professional development relating to ASD and improvements regarding the transfer of information process.  I know the Minister referred to transitions this morning.<\/p> <p>  The INTO is fully supportive of the policy of inclusion, where it is in the best interests of the child and where resources are provided to meet the needs of the child.  We must always be mindful of the potential effect of having a child who is either misplaced in a mainstream setting or for whom the back-up support services are not being provided by the State.  The maintenance of a continuum of provision to include ASD and special classes is essential to ensure that the educational needs of all children are met.<\/p> <p>  An inclusive approach to education that is not fully supported through the provision of resources, support and therapeutic services, as well as professional development, places an intolerable burden on families and on school communities.  Pupils who access ASD classes and early intervention ASD classes have unique additional needs that require specific therapeutic support that is often beyond the remit of a teacher.  Due to a lack of therapists, teachers are being asked to take on duties that other professionals, such as speech and language therapists or occupational therapists, would normally carry out.  While we welcome the commitment by the Government to continue to pilot a model of in-school speech and language therapy, we further recommend that other therapies, such as mental health supports, should be available to children on-site at schools.  It is imperative that the Department of Education and its counterparts in the Departments of Health and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth devise a model to enable children attending school to be provided with the therapeutic services which they require, preferably in an in-school, on-site arrangement.<\/p> <p>  Collaborative multidisciplinary assessments should be readily available in a pre-school setting to facilitate early intervention.  Timely access to therapeutic supports and other services is essential if early years settings and early intervention ASD classes are to provide targeted interventions at an early stage in the child's education.<\/p> <p>  Schools should be better supported in the transition of children with special educational needs from pre-school to primary and from primary to post-primary level.  Protocols should be agreed about the transfer of information and continuity of support to ensure that there is no gap in the provision of resources.<\/p><p>While it is regrettable that the increase in special classes at primary is not currently matched by corresponding increases of special class provision at second level, we realise that there are improvements in the pipeline.  This creates significant difficulties for pupils transferring from primary to post primary, particularly those who require a continuity of experience and support.<\/p><p> On assessment of need, AON, we all know the Disability Act 2005 provides for the assessment of health and educational needs of persons with disabilities as occasioned by those disabilities.  All children and young people born on or after 1 June 2002 are eligible to apply for an assessment of need under the Act, regardless of their age at the time of application.  As a union, we are painfully aware that the HSE is currently unable to provide assessments as envisioned in the Act.  Children all over the country are currently awaiting a full assessment to determine whether they have a disability as defined by the Act, the diagnosis of which could lead to more targeted interventions and supports being provided in schools and early years settings.<\/p><p> Following a recent legal judgment in 2021, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, now has the responsibility to nominate an appropriate person to carry out an assessment of education needs for children on behalf of the HSE under the AON process.  This assessment of education needs will be informed by existing school-based information, which provides details of a student&rsquo;s education needs as identified by the school.  Schools will need to be supported by the NCSE and the Department of Education in providing the information necessary.  The INTO is calling for substituted release time for school personnel who are responsible for the compilation of these reports to be provided, given this is such an important element of the process.  We are also calling for the State to do all in its power to ensure that there are sufficient personnel in all HSE areas to carry out an effective assessment of needs under the 2005 Act.<\/p><p> The expectation gap between schools and the HSE needs to be closed and a clear policy developed in relation to the provision of services for children.<\/p><p> I will focus on some challenges.  While we would welcome the publication of the Guidelines for Setting Up and Organising Special Classes 2016 for boards of management and principals of schools, we advocate for better planning across the system for the establishment of special classes for children with autism spectrum disorder, ASD, to ensure all pupils have access, irrespective of demographics or geographical location.  The union notes the engagement in schools to date as evidenced by the exceptional increase in provision since 2018.<\/p><p> The INTO would also at this point like to condemn the recent naming of four Dublin schools by the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and once again calls on the Minister of State to apologise to the schools in question.<\/p><p> We also welcome the recent publication by the Psychological Society of Ireland of the Professional Practice Guidelines for the Assessment, Formulation, and Diagnosis of Autism in Children and Adolescents, which could prove invaluable to psychologists.  <\/p><p> We note with positivity the proposals of the NCSE&rsquo;s Policy Advice on the Education of Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder proposing that professional development opportunities should be made available for principal teachers, particularly in relation to setting up and managing special classes.  However, we believe that induction and ongoing professional development are vital for all teachers working in special education settings.  In this regard, we welcome the NCSE recommendation that special class teachers should be supported to engage in appropriate learning opportunities to ensure they have the knowledge, skills and competencies necessary for that role.  However, teachers would value more opportunities for professional development in the form of summer courses to ensure they are prepared in advance of their placement in special classes in September, rather than subsequent to their placement.  Furthermore, teachers should also have the opportunity to visit other special classes first-hand to see how these classes operate.  Again, substitute cover and time must be in place for these visits and liaisons with other schools to be accommodated.  Ongoing professional development must be provided to ensure that teachers engage in current and best practice at all times.<\/p><p> We are aware of and support the public calls for public buildings to be more autism-friendly.  However, the provision of ASD classes in primary schools is not as simple as identifying a space and providing adequate furniture.  ASD classrooms need to be correctly designed as suitable learning environments for children with ASD, particularly those with associated sensory difficulties.  Outside the ASD classroom, schools need to be reconfigured with indoor and outdoor sensory spaces and learning environments.  Issues such as lighting, noise management and even the colour schemes need to be addressed throughout buildings to ensure and facilitate inclusion.  Outdoor areas such as pathways, walkways and play areas also need to be designed to meet the needs of all pupils.  All ASD classrooms and the schools providing them need to be fully and properly resourced.<\/p><p> In conclusion, teachers are to the fore in making inclusion a reality in mainstream schools and ASD and special classes.  The Department of Education and the NCSE need to acknowledge and address their needs and experience, including their health and safety needs and their professional development needs.  For a policy of inclusion to be successful, teachers in ASD and special classes must be supported with professional development opportunities, access to multidisciplinary services and adequate resources and facilities.  The INTO is engaged in ongoing consultation with teachers and principal teachers to ascertain their views on the provision of ASD and special classes and we explored this issue in depth at our biennial special education conference in March 2019.<\/p><p> We strongly believe that ASD and special classes can and must continue to provide an essential part of the continuum of provision for children with special educational needs and look forward to engaging in more detailed discussion on the issue.<\/p><p> Gura m&iacute;le maith agaibh as ucht &eacute;isteacht liom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms M&aacute;ir&iacute;n N&iacute; Ch&eacute;ileachair","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I thank Ms N&iacute; Ch&eacute;ileachair.

I might just start off with a correction to the record.  My good colleague here to my right is Ms Miriam Duggan, our president-elect of the ASTI, rather than vice president, and she will assume office at the end of August.  It is a minor point, but it is important to have it correct on the record.<\/p> <p>  I commend, as usual, my colleagues in the INTO for their excellent, in-depth analysis.  I have ten minutes allocated to me.  We made a written submission that contains many very similar points, which I think speaks to the unanimity of analysis and recommendations that exists among the practitioners at both management and teacher level around how we move forward with making sure we have inclusive schools, buildings, etc. for students with autism.  I will just make about three points that are more reflective of where we are right now, and perhaps we need to reflect on the pressing issues right now.<\/p> <p>  First, I will perhaps just set the scene.  As someone who was around in 2003, 2004 and 2005, when finally the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 passed the Oireachtas and as someone who is very familiar with and has a background in special needs, particularly at the policy level, I really think that moment was absolutely critical.  We are at a similar juncture now in terms of how our society responds to students with autism and, indeed, students within the wider special educational needs community.  The latter is consistently rated as 25% prevalence within student cohort throughout most of, one could say, the developed world.  Some 25% of all students are deemed to have special educational needs.  The statistic for autistic children in the primary and second level cohort is 1.5%, which represents 14,000 students in the system in any given year.  Therefore, we are talking about very large numbers of pupils.  <\/p> <p>  We are also talking about a condition, which by its very nature, is absolutely heterogenous.  Every student with autism is a different student to the next student with a diagnosis, which makes policy particularly challenging.  It has to be very flexible and be very much based on evidence, ongoing analysis, evaluation and moving forward.  The whole point, of course, about education and support is that the children who become the young adults are then able to live lives that are meaningful and independent and they are capable of contributing to society, including earning a living.  <\/p> <p>  I think we are at a step change.  Obviously, the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2018 was the major step.  The invitation to today&rsquo;s meeting included links to the two debates in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann from April 2019 and April 2021 and I read them in detail.<\/p><p>I was impressed by the language around students with special educational needs and people with autism having changed, profoundly, which gives us all hope that we can meet this challenge.  The challenge is not insurmountable and it is not all about resources either.  That is a considerable dimension of the problem, but it is not the only one.  What came out in the latter debate in 2021 was that we want to be the accepting society.  That is a good model for society to want to aspire to, in that we accept difference and diversity.  That is the setting.<\/p><p> One of the issues of the day is the rightful anger and indignation about the fact that there are at least 270 children with autism who do not have a school place for September.  That is outrageous.  We also have the phenomenon of 15,500 children travelling outside their locality every day to attend specialist educational settings.  A further 1,455 students are in receipt of home tuition, as a result of lack of specialised placements.  Those statistics, incidentally, are from the recently-published report by the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  That report is critical because its focus is on places.  It diagnoses the problem of lack of places as a lack of central planning, effectively, whereby demand cannot keep up with supply.<\/p><p> There are a number of dimensions to this.  One is that the Department of Education has said that in the Irish education system, at both legal and cultural level, we have parents' choice.  Parents have a choice about where to place their children.  If there is a local service, but the parent prefers to have their child in a specialist location elsewhere, the parent's choice is predominant.  Of course, that contributes to challenges, but it could be a cop-out clause.  The biggest problem that the ASTI sees is that we simply do not plan sufficiently well in advance.  With the guarantee of early childhood places, in particular, we have much more data about growing up in Ireland, the children coming through and the early childhood care and education, ECCE, sector.  We have much more data than we have ever had before to be able to plan ahead.  Unfortunately, that is not happening.  I will not sit here and belabour and besmirch the good people in the Department of Education.  The ombudsman's report has said everything.  Central planning is failing to catch up with the need that is out there.<\/p><p> I will also pick up on a point that my colleagues at the INTO and others have made.  We are very concerned about what I would describe as an emerging narrative that schools are reluctant to enrol special educational needs, SEN, students and that the problem lies at school level.  I need hardly point out that the schools are highly-regulated institutions, which are regulated by law, policy, normative culture and professional ethics.  We are operating in an environment in which a school that makes an admission decision on the basis that it does not have the capacity to enrol a child with particular needs, does so in full compliance with the regulatory environment in which it operates.  However, it seems that sometimes, we blame schools for deficiencies at central level.<\/p><p> As a trade unionist and a part of the wider trade union community, the narrative of putting the blame on individual schools absolutely deflects from the wider contextual issues, whereby social infrastructure is not keeping up with a developer-led, market-based model of housing provision.  New towns and suburbs and the beginning of cities are emerging and we simply do not have the schools, green places or primary care and public transport facilities.  We really need to get the narrative right.  This is not a case of individual schools making discriminatory decisions.  It is a case of a social infrastructure not keeping pace with human need and demand, where we have a lot of evidence of such, because of the way we regulate and how we house and place people.  I will not labour that point.  I have made it very clear.<\/p><p> Trade unions are in the middle of pay talks.  One of the biggest themes in those talks is the concept of the social wage and contract.  What do we want from our society?  One of the things we want from our society is respect.  We wish for children to go to local schools and be with their buddies.  We do not wish to spend hours in the car every day to get them there and back.  When they leave school, they should be able to go to their friend's house for a birthday party.  Unfortunately, the reality is that for thousands of autistic children and other children with high-level special needs, that is not part of their lives.  We very much need to get back to basics and stop blaming schools for decisions over which they have no control.<\/p><p> The other issue which is utterly to the forefront for the ASTI, at present, is that of access to assessment and intervention.  I carefully read the D&aacute;il debate.  The definition, which I like because it is simple and coherent, is that, \"autism is a 'spectrum' condition that affects the typical development of the brain in areas such as social interaction, communication and sensory processing\".  The two characteristics of autism are its variety and its being lifelong.  This very much places an absolute premium on making sure that we get assessment and intervention done at the earliest opportunity.<\/p><p> If a child has a lifelong condition which changes and varies over time and with intervention and the child does not get intervention until the age of six, when the period of up to three years old is when the brain is expanding exponentially, we have lost a considerable development stage in that child's life.  I can very much see why the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is really harping on about this point.  If we do not get assessment and intervention right, we will not make it.  I will not quote the statistics about which the ombudsman's report was quoted with regard to time delays and the numbers on waiting lists.<\/p><p> We have all learned one thing, on which the politicians have given considerable leadership, in that when we had the pandemic, we pulled together.  When we have the pandemic we pulled together.  We made decisions overnight.  We had money to make schools safe and to keep people's income alive and keep our businesses from going bankrupt.  We have seen the same alacrity and capacity to make quick decisions on the Ukrainian refugee crisis.  I cannot see why we do not have that capacity to respond to the current challenges, especially with autistic children, which is the business of today.  Trade unions are very much in the business of finding solutions.  We have capacity, past form and precedent.  We can do this, but we really need to be clear about what needs to be done and get the investment rolling.<\/p><p> I will move on to building on what we call a strength and I will make a few recommendations to the members, who are the decision-makers.  Sometimes we forget that only 2% of our special educational needs students are educated in specialist facilities.  We have one of the highest rates in the world of students with special educational needs educated in mainstream schools.  We know that, frequently, might mean they are in segregated classrooms on the same campus.  That is where we are starting from.  We need to go forward, but only having 2% outside of mainstream school is a considerable advantage.<\/p><p> One of the most devastating things I read about the displacement of young people in Ukraine was the fact that children with Down's syndrome and developmental disorders, and even dyslexia, are placed in institutions far away from homes and cities.  I saw scenes of panic, chaos and mayhem and thought \"oh, my goodness\".  We really forget how good Ireland is, when it comes to getting a little bit along the road, and then we seem to stall and do not get any further.  Only 2% of our students are educated in separate facilities.<\/p><p> We were around this table talking about the framework for junior cycle many times.  It was introduced in 2015.  We have a differentiated curriculum of levels one and two and then we have junior cycle for students with a very high level of needs or a low level of needs.  The reform of the senior cycle is prioritising the development of follow-on programmes.  The inspectorate has a dedicated model of evaluation of provision, which commenced after 2017.  It is already generating significant evidence about how well schools are doing in terms of meeting needs.  What are the gaps in provision and what do we need to do?<\/p><p> The chief inspector's report, indeed, published earlier this year for 2016 to 2020 was broadly positive about provision and outcomes for students and, what is very critical now about the inspectorate focus is outcomes.  Are these students learning?  Are they thriving?  Are they meeting the educational and developmental goals?  We are beginning to learn a lot about what happens in the inclusive school.  That is very important.<\/p><p>However, and I would not be sitting here representing the ASTI unless we had a however piece, we do not have training.  When a new model of allocation of teachers to schools was introduced in 2017, the practice of withdrawing the child to the resource room to be taught by the specialist teacher was meant to end and the specialist teacher was meant to come into the mainstream classroom and co-teach along with the subject teacher.  That was the ambition.  It has not happened to the extent it was desired or envisaged.  The reason is the training.  There was no national training programme required.  The entire area of planning for students with SEN is a complete fudge.  Who will do it, who will follow it up, who will stand over it, who will record it and so forth was never worked out.  There is also the area of qualifications and access to CPD, which the INTO has thoroughly gone into, and the time for planning.  The biggest resource teachers have is time.  That is their first resource.  The second biggest resource is the time to do all the incredible work that they do.<\/p><p> In 2019, we did a survey on inclusive schools.  I have brought it with me and I will leave it with the committee.  It is very interesting, and I will finish on this note.  It was done in Easter 2019, which was just before Covid-19.  It gives some very good statistics on what is happening at second level.  One of the areas I ask the committee to examine, and I am sure it has or will, is the fallout from Covid-19 and the impact on students with SEN, especially autistic children.  I am sure some of the members had the experience of listening to the Joe Duffy radio show one week - I forget which year it was but possibly in 2020 - when families talked about regression in their children's lives and their families' lives and the chaos that was happening in homes because these children had no access to their daily education and daily routine.  There is the issue of places and the issue of early and timely assessment and intervention.  The third priority must be how to make up for that.  For mainstream students we call it the learning gap, but we are talking about developmental black spaces for autistic students with very high needs.  We need to put as much resources as possible into ensuring these children get to lead the lives they all deserve.<\/p><p> I am sorry, a Chathaoirligh, that I got carried away on a few points.  I like to think the two unions have complemented each other regarding the elements on the ground and then the wider contextual issues.  Please do not blame schools.  They did not make the decisions about the resources they get.  We need to look at the wider picture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Moira Leydon","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1656975600,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Carroll MacNeill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#N00200","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I am conscious that I had to step out to attend another committee meeting, so I am happy to let somebody else speak now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#N00300","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I call Senator Ardagh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#N00400","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I have never agreed so much with trade unionists.

My apologies for that.  I have one question and one observation.  On the observation, I have been working closely with schools, teachers and parents across my constituency and I see a very mixed picture.  From some parents I hear about a teacher or principal being absolutely wonderful and that the atmosphere the teacher or principal brings within the school is transformative in the delivery of education plans, the experience of the child, the communication between the parent and teacher and how it all works.  Then I hear about a different experience in other schools, where it is hard to get the plan done, it is hard to make any criticisms and it is hard to raise problems.  Parents ask me if there is a way of doing this through the board of management so they do not have to go through the principal because they feel the principal is not working with them on that occasion or perhaps is not as interested.  I have also worked with schools in my area that have identified a premises and proactively chased the Department to make sure to get it as well as others who have very much wanted to do that and are already doing massively inclusive work, but maybe have not had the time or capacity to help to get its board of management to find the extra premises or whatever.<\/p> <p>  I see a very collaborative sector with parents and politicians across the board and I see people with very different challenges across my constituency.  However, I do not believe at any stage that anybody is immune from criticism.  I do not believe that the witnesses are immune from criticism, that I am immune from criticism, that the Minister is immune from criticism or that any other sector is immune from criticism.  I struggle with that and how there are genuinely mixed experiences when I see how much collaborative work is being done.  I struggle with that in both of the submissions.  Perhaps this is not what the witnesses are saying, but I struggle with this idea that nobody can be criticised at any point.  I am sure that is not what they are saying, of course.  It must not be.  However, we have a challenge with making sure that all children get access.  Certainly, I have tried to work proactively on the ground with schools in my constituency to make sure the Department is delivering extra funding and making sure the painting is done on time and all the different things are done to deliver extra classes because that is what we want.  There is a question around that.  I am sure that is not what the witnesses are saying, or maybe it is.  They can tell me.<\/p> <p>  Second, what is the union view on what more needs to happen with regard to July provision and making sure that people are available to deliver the July provision that is necessary so students, particularly at the more acute end of the spectrum, are not faced with the scale of disruption and regression that is happening year on year?  What is the role for teachers in that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#N00700","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I will take the question on July provision first.  July provision has expanded amazingly in the last three years with the advent of Covid-19.  The DEIS summer camps are available not only to DEIS band 1 schools but to all DEIS schools.  The summer provision is available to all schools and not just those with special units in them.  There would have been a tradition in certain schools of July provision where there was a special class or the children required it.  It is a new thing for schools.  One of the major issues we have found at trade union level is the payment of teachers for July provision.  People are working this week and in our experience they will not see money until December.  The prompt payment of teachers is a huge issue for it.  There is a solution and we are hoping that this year the online claim system will be used effectively and far more efficiently than it was used last year for the payment of teachers.<\/p> <p>  It can be difficult in schools where there is no tradition of summer provision to establish that tradition.  Schools are working very hard to do this.  There have been some very creative solutions found this year, such as the registration of student teachers in the Teaching Council with student membership and the engagement with colleges of education to make sure newly qualified teachers realise they are eligible to teach on the summer provision courses.<\/p><p>Schools which have not traditionally provided it have started on that journey.

We have been calling for some time for the parent and student charter Bill.  It was at various stages and iterations in the Houses of the Oireachtas.

We are not sure where it is at but would welcome if the Houses of the Oireachtas would look at that legislation in time to provide those engagements at school level.  They are happening all the time.  We advise and assist school leaders.  As issues arise, the best approach is to engage with the principal of the school.

There is not much I would disagree with in them.  I still think there is resistance from some schools, both primary and post-primary, to open special classes or classes for autistic children.  I was a teacher in post-primary and was the SEN co-ordinator for a number of years.  There were a number of other second level schools in the area and I knew of parents whose child wanted to go to one of the other schools but was actively encouraged to go to the school I was teaching in because the SEN supports were better.  That was unfair.  We valued every child who came to us, put the resources into meeting their needs and got a good reputation for dealing with special needs, but every school has a responsibility.  The admission to school Act in 2018 improved things but every school needs to step up to the mark and include all students who want to attend.  Ms N&iacute; Ch&eacute;ileachair mentioned the importance of the transition from primary to post-primary.

Some of the children went out of the area to other post-primary schools with which we did not have a relationship so it was harder to establish good practices.<\/p> <p>  Transition is not just a report.  It is a more complex ongoing process that needs to start early in the year to build up a child's expectations of what is happening and engage with parents.  Both schools on either side of the transition need to engage.  We are doing interesting research with Early Childhood Ireland on transitions from the early years sector to post-primary, especially in the light of two years of more formal education under the ECCE scheme, and to see if a different type of reporting or transition is needed.  That is a much more complex process that needs to be looked at.  Each child will need a different support.  We all know the children who wave goodbye at the school gate and never want to see you again, but others need support.  Much of the transition process should start as early as September for some children; definitely by the middle of term 2 that process should be engaged with by both schools on either side of the transition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#O00900","nonspeaker":"Ms M&aacute;ir&iacute;n N&iacute; Ch&eacute;ileachair"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Those reports were good as an indicator to the child coming into the school.

Deputies Tully and Carroll MacNeill raised the issue of the mixed response at school level to special needs.  No school can discriminate in terms of admissions but we all know the concept of soft barriers.  There are soft barriers there.  How do we change it?  I referenced the concepts of accepting societies and inclusive schools.  These are goals and processes.  How do we get there?<\/p><p>It is important that we talk about the fact that they exist for starters.  We cannot gloss over it.  Our job as trade unions is to represent our members and defend their working conditions.  We can also play a role as honest brokers and discuss what goes on at system level.  In terms of soft barriers whereby a school prioritises academic achievement and the transition to third level as being more important than an emphasis on inclusion and culture, the system has tools to address this.  The tools are working.  I see them as a carrot and stick approach.  The stick is an cigire or the inspector.  The inspectorate has 16 models of inspection within the formal school system, not to mention the youth detention centres and special schools.  One of those models, as I said earlier, is a dedicated inspection of special educational needs, which is focused on outcomes and use of resources.  It assesses whether the additional teachers allocated to the school to teach and work with students with special needs, are actually teaching honours maths as distinct from co-teaching.  The inspectorate reports identify these practices and schools are required to change them because the inspectorate performs follow-up visits.  After giving schools recommendations, inspectors come back to see what is happening.  There are quality assurance mechanisms in the system to address the soft barriers.<\/p><p> We also have a model of internal quality assurance in the school system called school self-evaluation.  We are all familiar with the concept of school planning.  It is a dual process.  Schools now have a three-year plan - prior to Covid it was typically a two-year plan - which is based on a self-evaluation.  Schools gather evidence, look at different types of students and how they meet their ambitions and departmental requirements etc.  This is ongoing all the time.  Again, we sound like a broken record.  What do teachers say about this process?  They ask when they are going to get the time to do it.  They are doing it at lunchtime or during breaks.  We have a very 19th-century view of teachers as people just being in front of a classroom.  The role of the teacher in the 21st century is a wide professional role based on classroom teaching but with multiple non-classroom teaching duties.  Until we start to factor in those non-classroom teaching duties into the working day, we will not achieve the kinds of outcomes and educational policies that we want.  We make no excuses as teacher unions in saying teachers need time, because they do not have time.  Teachers go into school for 9 a.m. and they are still there at 3.50 p.m. teaching students.  Where do they get the time to do all the other tasks?<\/p><p> The Deputy is right to raise the issue of soft barriers.  There are quality-assurance tools available to the system.  There are also cultures that need to be addressed, which the member's Government colleague, the Minister, Deputy Harris, identified in his critique of the over-reliance on moving to third level education as distinct from looking at other post-school opportunities.  We need to start broadening our horizons about what is a valid way to contribute to society in the 21st century.  It is not all about going to college or apprenticeships.  It is about autistic students who have extremely poor interaction skills and no friends.  When they leave school, they can communicate and have friends.  That is a huge achievement for a school and we need to start highlighting the value we attribute to that.  Yes, we need to discuss and acknowledge that there are soft barriers.

There is no doubt that the country is facing many challenges.  One of the defining challenges of our time, for which a call to action is required, is the need to address the deficiencies in special education.  I acknowledge that the change in the socio-economic landscape has fed into that in terms of additional challenges and providing infrastructural resources and all of that, which needs to be factored in.<\/p><p>One of the great successes we have had as a country has been the partnership model.  No one better emphasises that better than the teachers.  Teachers' unions and teachers have led the way on partnership.  They have been community and school leaders.  I was struck by what Ms Leydon said about the changing dynamic in moving from the perception of a 19th-century teacher.  I spoke with a principal who has a large number of special needs classes in his school.  One of the things that would assist him the most would be if he had a principal's assistant, which would be a new, non-teaching role.  We have to take this on board if we expect our teachers to be at the front line of child welfare.  Throughout the Covid pandemic, how many times did we ask teachers to be the front line?  Local garda&iacute; also relied on teachers during that period.<\/p><p>I greatly value the partnership model and what the unions and its members have done thus far.  To emphasise this model, I was struck by what Ms Leydon said in that some traditional schools have not engaged in the summer programme.  I also accept there were issues with payments, but I am hopeful that will be addressed this year.  In the spirit of the partnership model, we have to get to a point where it is not acceptable for special schools not to deliver a summer programme.  It was for those schools that the scheme was envisaged.  Those parents are in greatest needs of the summer programme and are really struggling.  If a special needs child misses out in that, the whole house is thrown into chaos.  Union representatives have come here with their asks and we will take them on board, but they should bring the message back to special needs schools, in particular, that it is not acceptable for schools to continue the stance of not delivering the summer programme.<\/p><p>I come from Longford where we have a problem with the children's disability network team, CDNT, which I flagged with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.  The team is particularly understaffed and is at 50% capacity <i>per capita<\/i>.  We have the longest waiting times in the country for diagnostic assessments.  We have 37 young people who have been waiting 48 months or more for an initial assessment.  In hard numbers, it amounts to six special needs classes that have not been filled because the assessments were not done.<\/p><p>The CDNTs should look after preschool initial assessments.

We are looking closely at a model in the UK where there are teams of educational mental-health professionals based in schools.  They are not the teachers; they are other professionals.  I have said that sometimes teachers are expected to be all things to all people.  They are expected to be the occupational therapist, speech and language therapist, psychologist and counsellor.  I am aware there is a national shortage of therapists, but we need to be recruiting them under all disciplines.  I would love to see them based in schools.  I know this is not Government policy and that the policy is for them to be based in the community.  We know from international best-practice that when the therapies were based in school buildings and campuses, there is a far higher level of engagement and success rate because therapists can engage with teachers and complement what is going on in each other's practice.<\/p> <p>  The suggestion to give the funding to schools and let them manage it is a sweeping statement and I think of the beleaguered principal who would then have something else to manage.  Administrative deputies were mentioned.  There are very few of them at primary level.  At one stage a few years ago there were 24.  I think we still have fewer than 30, but there are definitely fewer than 50.<\/p><p>Release hours for deputy principals, which were given during Covid, were taken away by the Department again this year.  It would be very valuable to have them, especially where schools have special needs classes or ASD classes.  In many cases the deputy principal is the SEN co-ordinator in the school, and such provision would free that person to do vital administration.<\/p><p> We really need to consider the co-location of therapies.  We have school buildings.  We have campuses.  We now have a policy of campus development which means that somebody who is co-located on a campus development could very easily serve four or five schools.

I have the same opinion about school meals - when the State has children, it should feed them.  When the State has children, it should provide supports.  In the case of the school I visited, one of the CDNT areas provides support out of Dungarvan.

I know of teachers who would like to do these courses but do not want to step out of the classroom for a period and bring in a substitute, particularly in these contexts and environments.

Many of the schools attended.  Many of them had only a short experience due to the onset of Covid, with some only having had access to therapists for six weeks or so before schools were closed.  The experience was mixed.  Some of the schools stated that they benefited from the CPD that was provided and the various programmes that were rolled out in the schools.  The upskilling of teachers in the programmes was welcomed.  Some of the schools indicated to us that they had continued the programmes during the Covid closure and had seen real benefits.<\/p> <p>  The schools were disappointed because, although they had believed that the therapists would engage in more therapy with individual children, this did not seem to be a feature of the demonstration project.  There was a fear among teachers that, once they were upskilled to a certain level, they would more or less be left to carry on on their own.  The nature of the project was of an advisory and CPD nature, but the therapies were not carried through.<\/p> <p>  We are aware that the programme restarted in November.

Unfortunately, Covid put a spanner in the works.  We need to see how the programme will progress.  The principle of having a multidisciplinary team available to and-or within the school is the only way forward to meet needs.  We all like to refer to the concept of best practice, and it is the practical way to go, but best practice internationally is to view the child in his or her entirety.  To paraphrase the Ombudsman for Children, who has always made this point, the child is not just the learner.  When the child goes home, he or she is not just the kid at play.  When the child goes to the therapist, he or she is not just the person receiving speech and language therapy or whatever.  The child is the whole child in the school setting.  Therefore, the services must come to the child.  This is the optimum model of service delivery, particularly for students &ndash; we are discussing a minority, lest the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform get the heebie-jeebies &ndash; with very significant needs and who require access to therapeutic services and so on.<\/p> <p>  We endorse the principle of the project.  Covid hampered it, so we need to extend the timeframe.  What would be demoralising for the system as a whole would be to do what we always seem to do in Ireland.  We might have fantastic pilot projects, but good reports on them sit on shelves for ten years and, by the time there is the political will to implement some of their recommendations, the situation has changed.  The five-year-old who needed all of that support has become the 15-year-old, who has not had the affirmative and life-changing experiences that he or she could have had.  The project's principle is fine, but we need more evidence.

Third level education is also important, but we focus on universities a lot and this is about meeting the child where the child is.  Last week, I made a comment about not having segregated schools.

Like the INTO's representatives, I have not spoken to one person who agrees with the call for five special schools to be put in place through an emergency measure.  This follows on from one of the points I made last week.  All week, there has been a blame game, with the Department blaming the schools and teachers.  At the end of the day, this is just a way of kicking the can down the road instead of trying to create places for more than 270 students with special educational needs who do not have places currently.<\/p> <p>  Someone touched on the issue of children travelling outside their localities.

Their work is important for students with special educational needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Miriam Duggan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":130,"content":"<p>In terms of collaboration, one of the powerful things about trade unions, and particularly teaching unions in the Irish context, is that we have significant political capital.  We do not have that just because of the power that trade unions have <i>per se<\/i>because of the workers.

I want to focus on the challenges that teachers and schools face in trying to provide quality inclusive education.  I have read the witnesses' documents and I agree with many of their asks.  Many of them are practical, day-to-day asks.  They include issues like teachers having substitution to go to another special needs class.  How are we to get experienced teachers if they cannot gain experience?  There is a lot of that there.  Those kinds of things can be delivered.  Ms Leydon spoke about the importance of early intervention which underpins everything.  That is the big picture.  The witnesses have dealt with both the day-to-day and the big picture very well in their documents.<\/p> <p>  I have one other comment before I come to my two questions.  A number of Deputies have commented this.  There is a narrative that schools are not co-operating perhaps as well as they should.  We need to dig deeper on this.  This is not just about financial resources.  It is about qualified personnel that can provide quality education and committed teachers.  Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh asked a good question.  He spoke about a career pathway for those teachers.  That needs to be looked at.  We are in the middle of transformational change.<\/p> <p>  Ms Leydon said that we are good at starting things but this a matter of moving it on to the next step.  Transformational change requires support at so many different levels.  While schools have a responsibility to provide for students in their area, we should not underestimate the challenge involved.  I have spoken to many teachers about the challenges they face.  If there are six students in a class, four of those students might be non-verbal.  There is a huge range of abilities.  There can be very bright children in those classes.  The teacher has to be able to understand how each of those individual children learn.  We often do not understand how demanding it is for those teachers to do a good job.  That needs to be recognised.  I do not say that because I am a former teacher, because the truth is that I did not do half of that, but I know many teachers who do.  I wanted to make those comments. <\/p> <p>  I have two questions.  I asked the Minister earlier about teacher training.  I did not refer to ongoing development but to actual training of teachers and to whether it has been reoriented sufficiently.  This is so that when young teachers come into schools and all teachers to have broad view of what inclusive quality education is.  This is also for teachers who want to specialise.  Do the witnesses feel that there needs to be any change there?<\/p> <p>  My second question is on the July provision.  The Chair has spoken about this and about Early Childhood Care and Education, ECCE, staff.  I want the witnesses&rsquo; views on qualified childcare practitioners being involved in the July provision.  We all received many emails from parents.  I am not putting it too strongly when I say that they distressed beyond words this summer because, although many children might get it, their child cannot access it.  What changes would the witnesses like to happen so that this can happen next year and so that the children who need it can get it?  This is other than the pay change which we spoke about and I fully agree with.  This is specifically around ECCE staff.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#S00800","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I will take the question on teacher training first.  We are very aware that much of the initial teacher education courses are up for re-accreditation at the moment.  The Teaching Council of Ireland will be looking at them.  No more than some schools do some things better than others, some of the colleges prepare students very well for special needs education.  That can be due to the interest of a particular person in the college.  All students will have a minimum.  Like my previous point if I have done something in college ten, 15 years or 20 years ago and now I am faced with a principal asking me to take an autism class this year, my first questions would be, &ldquo;Will I be able for this?  What do I need to learn?  What do I need to do?&rdquo;.  It goes back to the point about time.  I would say, &ldquo;Gosh I would love to, but what training can I get?  What can I do?&rdquo;.<\/p><p>We need to be very clear about what is there for teachers.  We can do a certain amount in initial teacher education but we cannot do it all.  Continuing professional development does what it says on the tin; it is continual.  It has to be there on a continual basis for teachers because we are all learning all of the time.  We can certainly look to standardise across the colleges so that everybody has at least to do a minimum.  There are more ways of looking at inclusive education, where it is across everything, rather than just having a module on it.  It can be about how we deal with parents, how we teach language, how we teach science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and how we engage in outdoor learning.  It could be physical education or anything.  Inclusive education can be built into everything.  I am sure the colleges are all screaming as I say this.  From that point of view, the nature of what we are is never enough.  We always want more and better and we always want it for our students.<\/p><p> I have not thought about July provision and qualified childcare practitioners enough to give an informed answer on that.  It is something I will certainly think about.  I will come back to the Deputy and email her on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#S00900","nonspeaker":"Ms M&aacute;ir&iacute;n N&iacute; Ch&eacute;ileachair","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Ms N&iacute; Ch&eacute;ileachair has covered it.  On early childhood, and Senator Flynn mentioned it earlier, it is about SNAs and respect.  SIPTU's Big Start campaign, which includes F&oacute;rsa and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions more generally, is critical.  We have graduates in the early childhood care and education, ECCE, sector, some of whom are graduates at master's degree level, who are being paid the minimum wage.  We are now at the stage where we have the joint labour committee and improved wages will be brought in.  For people who are professionals with this passion and commitment to their clients, which is what teachers are, whether they are teaching very young children or adults, pay is not everything.  It is also about working conditions, career pathway and validation.  It is critical to have time to grow as a professional.<\/p> <p>  One of the reasons teachers get very cranky is they are just too busy to have time to think about what they want to think about.  That is particularly so in the early childhood sector where they are simply not valued.  If we value pay as a mark of how much we value people, they are not valued.  That is critical.  In addition, they are working in privately run institutions, frequently chains, which have profit as their primary orientation.  Their working conditions, including continuity of work and job security, can be very precarious and vary quite significantly throughout the country.  They have a good, big union behind them, SIPTU, but I can see no territorial reasons why they would not engage with this because they are so qualified.  However, I can see working condition reasons that are barriers to people staying in the sector.  We talk about retention in the teaching profession.  To me, there is a far greater threat of an exodus from the ECCE profession than there is from mainstream teaching at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022070500002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Moira Leydon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I will briefly echo what Ms Ch&eacute;ileachair said about continuing professional development.

This is my first opportunity to pay tribute to all the teachers for the work they did during the Covid pandemic.  My wife is a primary school teacher so I saw the workload when there is teaching from home etc.  It was difficult for teachers, particularly those who had children at home.  It is important to put that on the record.<\/p> <p>  Two words have jumped out at me today: inclusion and partnership.  If this is going to work, it will involve partnership with all stakeholders, including boards of management in schools, teachers, the Department and the Government funding it.  That has to be the case.  I will be honest that I fully support the legislation that has been brought in.  In my home county of Longford, we do not have an issue regarding places at present, but there have been issues around the country where schools have not engaged.  It is important we have a situation where every child in future is able to access education in his or her local community and we do not have situations, which I know of, where some families have to travel 55 km per day each way to access an education.  In particular, as we come up to August and the provision of school transport, there is transport to the local school, but when it comes to special education it is provided to the nearest available school.  We cannot have a situation like that in future.<\/p> <p>  The school inclusion model that was spoken about is something I fully support.  It is the way forward.  There is support for it in the programme for Government and the Government is committed to rolling it out.  Unfortunately, Covid put a stop to it for two years.  I fully support the ask that mental health services be included in it.  I attended the presentation in Buswells Hotel at which the INTO representative, Ms Carmel Browne, spoke about it and asked me to highlight it within my party, which I did.  I hope the Government supports it because it is needed.<\/p> <p>  Special classes and teaching were spoken about.  Is it possible, if a teacher is going to work in a special class in September, that such a teacher would automatically work in July provision?  This is so they will have four weeks' experience prior to going into a special class, if they have not worked in a special class before.  Something that should be looked at, rather than an online course, is a teacher working in person with children for that four-week period.<\/p> <p>  The issue of special schools not providing summer provision was brought up.  That is disgraceful and unacceptable.  July provision was brought in a number of years ago particularly for those children and families.  We now have a situation where those that need it most are not getting it at all.  A situation like that is absolutely unacceptable.  I fully support Deputy Harkin's view on ECCE workers working in summer provision.  As was stated, many have a level 7 or level 8 master's in education but we have a situation where they are signing on during the summer months, if they are only doing the ECCE year.  Yet, we are struggling to have staff to provide summer provision.  I personally think summer provision should be in school more so than at home.  We are one of the only countries in Europe that does that.  The only reason the provision is at home is because we are not getting the people to work it in the schools.<\/p> <p>  Senator Wall brought something to my attention, and it is being done in Newbridge, which is that schools have come together to make sure that at least one school every year is providing July provision.  Staff from the various schools who are available work in that school and it is changed the following year.  That is something that needs to happen.  We cannot have a situation where at least one school in a town is not providing July provision.  That is a very good proposal that should be taken on board to make sure, as I said, we have more provision out there.<\/p> <p>  The committee plans to have a look at July provision in the autumn following this school year.  Unfortunately, I still believe children with most needs, who really need such provision, will not get it this year because of the lack of special schools providing it and because they are unable to supply a teacher to take children for home provision.  It is unacceptable and the committee intends to highlight that we need changes for 2023.  We cannot have a situation where, for two months, families of children are outside the school system and are not getting speech and language and occupational therapy supports.<\/p><p>Students of speech and language therapy and occupational therapy in our colleges, perhaps in third or fourth year, could work in the July provision and work with teachers, so that kids would get occupational therapy and speech and language therapy during the summer because it is too wide a gap for parents and families.<\/p><p> I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee to give their views.  As a committee, we plan to make recommendations by the end of March of next year for policy changes.  That is what it is about.  We want to see those policy changes implemented.  Ultimately, we have to look after the kids who have these needs.  We thank the witnesses for their input.  If there is information they wish to share with the committee, please forward it to us.  This is about collaboration and partnership to make sure we get the best for the kids who need support.  I thank the representatives from the INTO and the ASTI for coming before us today.

By way of an introduction to Cr&eacute;, which is the Irish word for &quot;soil&quot;, we were established in 2001 and we are a non-profit association of public and private organisations dedicated to growing the biological treatment sector in Ireland.  Cr&eacute; supports the use of composting and anaerobic digestion, AD, to produce high-quality outputs, assists with the delivery of the Government's waste diversion and bioenergy strategies and targets and promotes the creation of sustainable indigenous jobs.  To date, our members have processed over 3 million tonnes of household and commercial brown bin and garden waste.<br\/><br\/>For context, in February the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, issued part two of its sixth assessment report.  It emphasises the urgency of taking immediate and more ambitious action to address climate risks.  Referring to the patchwork of pledges and <i>ad hoc <\/i>mitigations undertaken to date, the report states that &quot;half measures are no longer an option&quot;.  Systems change is now demanded, in the form of &ldquo;transformation and system transitions in energy; land, ocean, coastal and freshwater ecosystems; urban, rural and infrastructure; and industry and society&rdquo;, or, in other words, systemic change across the board.To achieve this, it notes that &quot;A sustainable bioeconomy relying on bioresources will need to be supported by technology innovation and international cooperation and governance of global trade to disincentivize environmental and social externalities&quot;.  The circular economy is based on three core principles, that is, &ldquo;to eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials and regenerate nature&rdquo;, underpinned by a transition to renewable energy and materials.  Achieving this is a question of design and a willingness to accept and deliver systemic change.<br\/><br\/>While much of the discussion here is likely to concentrate on the inexplicable failure of successive Governments to provide enabling policy in the area of renewable energy, specifically anaerobic digestion, the most often overlooked aspect of AD is its potential role in redesigning our food systems.  For a circular economy and bioeconomy to succeed, there is fundamental need to consider the full circle of activity.  In the case of the bioeconomy, it all starts and ends with the soil.  It is from the soil that crops are grown and without healthy soils there are no crops.  The gold standard for agricultural digestion, using crops and manures, that I am aware of, is Biogasdoneright in Italy.  The principles of the Italian system are such that they cannot be ignored when we consider other inputs such as biowaste from brown bins, industrial sludges or commercial food wastes.  The system there is designed around soil health and maximising carbon sequestration while minimising other potential environmental impacts caused by inappropriate digestate and land management.<br\/><br\/>In the UK, which is often seen as a leader in food waste digestion, the dash for gas has, regrettably, led to some unintended economic and environmental consequences.  The early deployment of incentives, against a background of not having a policy on food waste collection in England, has forced many wet AD facilities to operate at near zero or at negative gate fees as plants become desperate for feedstocks.  This is a perverse situation where the waste generator, that is the polluter, gets paid.  The environmental impacts from whole digestate mismanagement include increases in ammonia and other greenhouse gas, GHG, emissions from storage and spreading, microplastics and soil compaction from injection.  Today, the UK Government is being forced to rethink digestate management and the industry is seeking alternatives, including pelletisation and composting of digestate.<br\/><br\/>Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria and Germany, to name but a few countries, take a different approach to that of the UK and the composting of digestates from municipal biowastes is the norm.  These countries have similar household biowaste collection systems to Ireland, and in that regard they have either reconfigured existing in-vessel composting facilities or have new-build dry AD systems which, while potentially comparable to biogas yield compared with their wet equivalents, are much more capable of handling the combination of wet food wastes and the more lignocellulosic garden wastes.  Dry AD systems will always have a composting phase, whereas wet systems outside of Italy typically do not.<br\/><br\/>What all these countries have done, and which Ireland fundamentally has not, has been to decide to strategically support anaerobic digestion or indeed the wider biowaste industry.  It is true that Ireland has legislation on food waste collections, and we welcome the plans to expand this further, but as shown in our most recent market report, just 15% of waste food is organically recycled in Ireland and almost 50% of the collected biowaste is exported.  While still counting towards Ireland&rsquo;s recycling figures, it seems illogical to be exporting our organic feedstocks and nutrients to other jurisdictions, and this is before we consider the missed opportunity for jobs and local environmental benefits.<br\/><br\/>It is not just our feedstocks and nutrients being exported.  Last week, we heard of a new &euro;30 million grid connection hub for biomethane in Cork.  While this is welcome, one member of our association asked me why we are building a biomethane hub connection in an area where there is no biomethane product and no production facilities have planning permission.  This member applied to Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, for a grid connection a decade ago.  All the permits and permissions are in place, but it has still not been possible to get a gas grid connection, even though the facility is on the grid and all that is required is 1 m of pipe.  As it cannot connect to the grid, this facility is currently limiting its generation of biomethane.  Additionally, while this member is considering markets for bio-carbon dioxide and thus creating more local jobs in a deprived rural area by expanding production, the facility is currently being forced to sell its biomethane at a low value into the market.  Ironically, it appears it is exported to Northern Ireland, where it is used in low-efficiency combined heat and power, CHP, systems because that is where the incentives bring the highest value.<br\/><br\/>It is commonly agreed that this biogas-to-CHP approach is not the future and that there is an urgent need to move out of the use of gas derived from fossil fuels for heating and to provide low-cost and potentially carbon-negative solutions for heavy goods vehicle, HGV, transport fuels, such as bio-compressed natural gas, bio-CNG, and bio-liquified natural gas, bio-LNG, from biomethane.  Beyond fuels, biomethane has potential in the chemical industry as a source of methanol or hydrogen.  The point is that AD is proven as a technology.  As biogas production and scrubbing technologies improve, so do the market opportunities.  The second, and equally important point, is that for biowaste, at least, anaerobic digestion and composting must be considered as complementary not conflicting approaches. <br\/><br\/>Talking to our members while preparing for this meeting, several themes arose.  These included: planning delays, where it can take more than three years to gain consent; delays in the context of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, where it can take more than two years, at least, to get an industrial emissions directive, IED, permit; uncertainty, be it over feedstocks, as noted above, or concerning biomethane supports; feedstock quality, as brown bin waste typically has at least 10% contamination; the lack of a national standard for digested biowastes; concern over market distortions; and an urgent need for a pragmatic biowaste policy.<br\/><br\/>Looking at the global picture, it is clear that anaerobic digestion is being deployed outside Ireland with speed and sometimes with haste by ignoring the wider soils and environmental aspects.  This technology has a relevant role in energy, nutrient and food security.  As a nation, Ireland has the base point which most countries are missing and that is a clear direction on food waste collection.  What appears to be lacking is the courage to join the dots of the bioeconomy circle to take biowaste from soil to biomethane and back to soil.<br\/><br\/>I again thank the committee for the opportunity to speak today.

Irish farmers understand that they have a unique role to play in meeting the climate change challenge and are committed to playing their part in reducing greenhouse gas, GHG, emissions. However, it must be done in a fair and balanced way.  <\/p><p> The Government commitment to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s GHG emissions by 51% by 2030 has implications for all parts of the Irish economy.  Achieving the reduction target set proposed for agriculture, of between 22% to 30% by 2030, will be extremely challenging for the sector.  Setting an emissions reduction target of higher than 22% would have the potential to devastate the sector.  Achieving a 22% emission reduction will be extremely challenging, but is achievable for the sector based on potential mitigation measures outlined in the Climate Action Plan 2021.  Such a target would recognise the technical challenges associated with monitoring, reporting and verifying emissions reductions in agriculture, as well as the timeframe required for adoption of new technologies.  It would also recognise the sector's unique ability to support other sectors of the economy to offset emissions through on-farm renewables, such as anaerobic digestion, AD.  The development of a sustainable indigenous AD biomethane industry offers significant potential to support the transition to a low carbon energy system, as well as supporting the achievement of agriculture&rsquo;s climate targets.<\/p><p> AD is a controlled process where biomass is used to produce renewable energy in the form of biogas and organic fertiliser.  Agricultural biomass feedstocks for AD include slurries, silage, grass and food processing wastes.  AD technology can be applied at a range of scales, depending on the amount of biomass available.  Systems can range from small farm-based digesters to large centralised anaerobic digesters, CAD, supplied with feedstocks from several sources.  The biogas produced can be used to generate heat, electricity or both.  The energy produced can be used on the farm, while excess electricity or heat can be exported to provide additional revenue, increasing the sustainability of the farm business and reducing on-farm emissions.  In addition, the biogas can be upgraded to biomethane, which can be injected into the natural gas network or compressed into containers for use as a fuel in other applications, such as road transport.  Biogas is the only fully dispatchable renewable energy that can assist in addressing our electricity, heat and transport renewable energy targets.  While the digestate that remains is rich in nutrients and can, after further processing, be used as an organic fertiliser.  This reduces the requirement for inorganic fertilisers and the associated emissions from its production.  Therefore, AD offers a significant step towards a more sustainable farming system.  It can contribute towards the reduction of emissions, particularly those in livestock, thus helping to meet emission targets; the production of organic fertiliser, reducing the need for chemical fertilisers and reducing the wider environmental impacts of producing chemical fertilisers; and the production of renewable electricity and heat for on-farm use, potentially creating an additional source of income from sales of heat, electricity or biomethane.<\/p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s adoption of renewable technologies at farm level is well below the European average.  In 2018, Ireland ranked 23rd out the EU-27 countries for generation of renewable energy from agriculture, producing just 2.6% compared with the EU-27 average of 12.1%.  Farmers want to be central players in Ireland&rsquo;s energy transition.  They recognise the opportunities offered by renewable energy to produce energy for their own use but also to diversify their farm income by selling excess energy to the grid, thereby enhancing the sustainability of their farm business.  AD is a natural fit for Ireland considering our large livestock industry and the availability of manures.  Given the mounting pressure to decarbonise the agriculture sector, coupled with the continuing pressure to meet our renewable transport and heat targets, AD provides a real solution.<\/p><p> As stated previously, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 sets a legally binding target of a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030, relative to a baseline of 2018, and net-zero emissions no later than 2050.  One of the proposed measures in the climate action plan to achieve the proposed emissions reduction for agriculture is that agricultural feedstocks will contribute to the production of 1.6 TW hours per annum of indigenous sustainably produced biomethane for injection into the gas grid by 2030.  In addition to reducing emissions in agriculture, agricultural-led AD can contribute and support other sectors, including the electricity sector, to transition to low-carbon energy sources to meet the its emissions reduction targets.  Among the most important measures for the electricity sector to meet its target is to increase the proportion of renewable electricity to up to 80% by 2030.  While AD plants have been rolled out across Europe at significant scale over recent decades, its deployment in Ireland has been very limited to date, with only a handful of commercial scale AD plants developed.  Around 19,000 AD plants are in operation around Europe, producing 167 TW hours of biogas.  There are many challenges to developing a sustainable indigenous AD sector.  Targeted supports will be needed to support rural areas and farming communities in building AD plants for biogas production if the climate targets are to be achieved.<\/p><p> The ambition for scaling up AD and biomethane production in Europe has further increased since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has massively disrupted the world&rsquo;s energy system and has led to soaring energy costs.  In May 2022, the European Commission published the REPowerEU Plan to rapidly reduce Europe&rsquo;s dependence on Russian fossil fuels by fast forwarding the clean transition to achieve a more resilient energy system. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022070500002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Cullinan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Sorry, Mr. Cullinan.

This investment will enable the introduction of measures to address the main barriers to increase sustainable biomethane production and provide additional incentives for establishing biogas and biomethane partnerships to stimulate the renewable gas production.<\/p> <p>  AD and biogas production has been identified in the EU methane strategy as a cost-effective method to reduce methane emissions from agriculture and waste sectors, while simultaneously generating an additional revenue stream for farmers as well as an opportunity for development and investment in rural areas.  Reducing methane emissions in agriculture is essential to reaching our 2030 climate targets and the 2050 climate neutrality goal.  Agricultural emissions stand at 37%, with methane emissions accounting for over 60% of these emissions.  The strategy recommends that to achieve deployment of AD, co-operation with and among farmers and local communities is vital.

Therefore, if the potential offered by AD is to be realised the following key policy requirements need to be addressed.

We must introduce a renewable heat obligation scheme with attractive subsidies as soon as possible to support the wide-scale deployment of AD production.<\/p><p>This will give greater certainty and security of revenue for farmer-led projects.  We must provide capital grant funding to support the adopted national biomethane strategy and meet the climate targets.

Financial vulnerability has a large impact on the ability of farmers to adopt more sustainable practices, as it limits their ability to test new practices and stifles innovation due to financial constraints.

I am a research scientist in the field of environmental sustainability.  I undertook my PhD in University College Dublin, where I examined the environmental impact of implementing anaerobic digestion in Ireland.  All views contained within this statement are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of my wider researcher colleagues or associated organisations.  My comments today will focus on the key issues relating to the environmental impacts of biogas production in Ireland.  This research has been published in international peer-reviewed journals and is openly available.<\/p> <p>  Often when the environmental sustainability of biogas is discussed, it is in the context of greenhouse gas mitigation.  However, there is now a consensus that biogas production itself may result in greenhouse gas emissions.  It is important therefore that this risk is assessed in determining the overall policy approach.  One of the most important factors to consider is the raw material from which the biogas will be produced.  In Ireland, the most readily available resource for biogas is grass silage, as outlined in reports from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and Gas Networks Ireland.  Co-digestion of grass silage with animal manures such as cattle slurry is likely to be the main way biogas is produced nationally.  There is a risk that using high shares of grass silage may have negative environmental impacts.  The conventional thinking was that additional grass silage for biogas could be produced by increasing fertiliser application.  However, in my research I modelled the environmental impacts of digesting different proportions of grass silage and cattle slurry for biogas production and found that using high shares of grass silage may have negative environmental impacts.  While this approach avoids competition with feed production, the results showed that this can lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions when higher proportions of grass silage are digested due to the additional fertiliser that is required.  The impact arises from both the production of the fertiliser itself and the emissions that are released when it is spread on land.  As a result, alternative approaches need to be considered to provide surplus grass silage without relying on additional inorganic nitrogen fertiliser.  Preliminary research by Teagasc has shown that incorporating legumes such as red clover or the use of multi-species swards has the potential to increase yields without the addition of inorganic nitrogen.  This would improve the sustainability of biogas produced from silage and should be promoted, provided that other potential impacts, such as carbon loss and herbicide use during reseeding, are minimised.<\/p> <p>  The second issue I want to raise is methane leakage from biogas plants.  The main component of biogas is methane, which is a powerful shortlived climate pollutant.  When methane leakages occur due to increased biogas production, these can contribute to global warming and reduce the environmental benefits.  Quantifying methane emissions from biogas plants is becoming a significant topic of interest for the scientific community.  The rate of methane loss assumed in life-cycle assessments of biogas is relatively conservative, with many studies assuming a loss of 1% by default.  In my research, I used a value of 2.4%, which was the average rate of emissions for 13 agricultural biogas plants in Denmark.  As methane loss may be the largest contributor to the carbon footprint of biogas production, it would be important that biogas plants in Ireland monitor, report and address methane losses.<\/p> <p>  Finally, there is a potential risk of burden shifting occurring if other environmental impacts are not taken into account.  The material remaining after anaerobic digestion is known as digestate and can be used as a fertiliser.  Digestate has been shown to have higher levels of ammonium compared with the organic substrate going into the AD process.  As a result, there is a risk of increased environmental impacts from acidification due to the emissions from digestate application.  This is a concern, especially as Ireland continues to breach its emissions target for ammonia under the national emissions ceilings directive.  Appropriate digestate management will be critical, including the use of low-emission slurry spreading, LESS, for digestate application.<\/p> <p>  The scientific research suggests that we need to promote a cascading use of biological resources in the bioeconomy.  The research project, Biorefinery Glas, has demonstrated the potential of biorefining to create a variety of products from freshly harvested grass.  These products include feed for animals and the remaining grass whey can be used for biogas production.  This approach can improve sustainability through diversification into the bioeconomy and makes the best use of environmental resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022070500002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciara Beausang"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Beausang for her opening statement.

Renewable gas, biomethane, is produced when organic materials, such as animal slurry and crop residues, are broken down in an oxygen-free environment, such as in an anaerobic digester.  RGFI is a not-for-profit industry forum which aims to work with the Government and decision makers on a consultative and constructive basis, with the purpose of establishing suitable market conditions to enable the growth of an indigenous, AD biomethane industry.  Our membership includes people from academia, AD operators; community organisations, shippers and industrial gas consumers with high thermal demand for manufacturing and processing, such as the agri-food processing sector, the drinks sector and transport.  As the lead partner for REGATRACE, the Renewable Gas Trade Centre in Europe, in Ireland, since 2019 we have collaborated with key public and private stakeholders to develop an agreed vision and roadmap for AD biomethane in Ireland, that will inform the REPowerEU plan.  Today, we are asking the committee to support the development of a scalable and sustainable indigenous anaerobic digestion biomethane industry, which we have demonstrated can provide significant environmental, social and economic benefits to the national bioeconomy and the circular economy, all aligned to the European Green Deal, the farm to fork strategy, and REPowerEU as well as the Government's stated climate actions, and energy security requirements.<\/p> <p>  The European Commission announced in March 2022 that it will accelerate the roll-out of renewable gases in its plan to move Europe towards independence from Russian fossil fuels by 2030, and to respond to rising energy prices, storage,and security of supply.  The EU target for biomethane production by 2030 will increase to 35 billion cubic metres, bcm, which is 350 TWh, from sustainable feedstock, such as agricultural biodegradable materials.  RGFI, as a board member of the European Biogas Association, EBA, has been lobbying for an increased ambition and security of supply across Europe for many years, with recent intensified talks in consultation with the European Commission and national governments.  The measures within the REPowerEU plan, could gradually displace up to 155 bcm of fossil gas use, which is equivalent to the volume of gas imported from Russia in 2021.  The Commission proposes to work with member states to develop a national biomethane plan and identify the most suitable projects to meet those objectives.  RGFI was recently appointed chair of the EBA's National Associations Platform, which is a member of the biomethane industry partnership, a new joint secretariat with the European Commission on AD biomethane.<\/p><p>In this capacity, we will continue to represent Irish interests.<\/p><p> Ireland lags well behind other EU member states as it does not have policy and legislation to support the establishment of an indigenous biomethane industry.  In recent years, RGFI has worked with industrial gas consumers to develop an integrated business case on biomethane in Ireland, achieving stakeholder and Government recognition, as well as policy and legislative support for biomethane, biofertiliser production and the carbon farming initiatives.<\/p><p> With our grass-based agricultural systems and ready availability of sustainable feedstocks such as animal slurry feedstocks, Ireland is particularly suited to the production of sustainable biomethane and biofertiliser.  Recent research carried out by Teagasc has confirmed the availability of between 2 million and 4 million tonnes of sustainable feedstock for AD biomethane and shows how a move to mixed-species sward pastures can further improve the sustainability of renewable energy values and deliver environmental benefits.  We estimate that there are 735,000 ha of under-utilised permanent pasturelands available to grow incremental sustainable agricultural feedstock to supply an indigenous and sustainable AD biomethane industry in Ireland.<\/p><p> Momentum is gathering in Ireland to embrace sustainable indigenous biomethane and related biofertiliser production.  This is a zero-carbon product that can be used, within a new policy and legislative framework, to meet decarbonisation targets in difficult-to-decarbonise sectors such as thermal demand, agriculture and transport.<\/p><p> We see evidence of strong industrial consumer demand based on collaboration.  An example of this is Project Clover, an industry-led dairy industry collaboration on AD biomethane, biofertilisers and carbon farming, with other sectoral representation from transport.  Project Clover has reached the conclusion that sustainable agricultural feedstock, AD biomethane, biofertiliser production and carbon farming utilising best practices in compliance with the renewable energy directive, the Paris Agreement and IPCC guidelines on monitoring, reporting and verification is the only commercial, practical and technically feasible and viable way for the industry to decarbonise its food production and thermal demands for manufacturing and processing.  Project Clover members have stated their commitment to work closely with farmer producers, developers and key stakeholders to develop a national AD biomethane network of AD plants utilising sustainable agricultural feedstock and management of animal slurries.  The proposal is to develop a number of AD plants that would pilot the use of sustainable forage, such as multi-species swards and animal slurries, and develop the commercial proposition for biofertiliser production and carbon farming based on standardised principles.  Project Clover would be central to the development of a related AD charter underpinning biomethane, biofertiliser production and environmental and social sustainability principles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022070500002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. P.J.

Recent work has determined that, with appropriate Government policy and legislative supports, AD biomethane utilising sustainable agricultural feedstock has the potential to replace natural gas in a way that is technically feasible and commercially viable, with associated biofertiliser benefits.  This would reduce emissions by approximately 700,000 tonnes per annum by 2030, utilising the aforementioned methods.  It would, at the same time, provide farmers with a diverse and reliable income stream, support the development of a circular bio-economy and rural economy and develop opportunities to diversify incomes.<\/p> <p>  Our policy ask is for implementation of article 23 by 2023.  That would see the introduction of a renewable heat obligation, RHO, scheme to socialise the cost of biomethane production.  Members of the RGFI and the Project Clover industry-led collaboration have been proactive in urging the Government to introduce an RHO as early as possible and welcomed the opportunity for public consultation in October 2021.  A Government announcement on an RHO is expected this year but timing is of the essence, given the imperatives in respect of sustainability and energy security requirements.<\/p> <p>  Subject to Government approval, RGFI and Project Clover have secured &euro;24 million in funding from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, subject to commercial terms and conditions, to help develop this project.

The association was established in 1999 as the representative body for the bioenergy sector on the island of Ireland.  Our membership spans the sustainable bioenergy sectors of biomass, biogas, biofuels, biochar, energy crops and wood fuels.  Our biogas biomethane members cover the full supply chain, including farmers, feedstock suppliers, developers, technology providers and energy users.  IrBEA is an active member of the European Biogas Association.<\/p> <p>  Anaerobic digestion technology is a proven technology used worldwide at different scales.  The potential feedstocks in Ireland are many, including but not limited to slurry and farm wastes; grass and silage, including clover and multi-species swards grown without chemical fertiliser; food waste; green horticulture waste; organic residues and wastes; sludges; meat and dairy processing residues; and other wastes.  Anaerobic digestion can be deployed at different scales.  Our membership spans the different scales possible, from micro scale, which involves the processing of domestic food waste to produce biogas for cooking use, to small scale, which takes place on farm or at a business premises where it offsets an existing fossil-based demand.  IrBEA&rsquo;s work at this scale is being advanced through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine-funded European Innovation Partnership small biogas demonstration programme project.  This project is providing a capital support to three farmers to build three biogas plants on their farms utilising on-farm wastes and feedstocks.  These projects are currently at the planning process stage and will soon move to construction.  There are interesting developments arising from the learnings from the project.<\/p> <p>  At a medium-to-large scale, or co-operative style, feedstocks are sourced from many different suppliers, with the energy output supplied to a grid or distribution network either on or off grid.  This scale needs an ongoing support in the form of a tariff or obligation scheme etc. to be economically viable.<\/p> <p>  Biogas production is mainstream across Europe, with more than 20,000 operational AD plants in the EU and several million across the world.  Favourable policy measures are driving the development of the industry across Europe.  France is currently commissioning three to four biomethane plants per week and Denmark has a policy whereby a percentage of its slurry resource must be diverted to AD.  Those are only two examples of policy measures in the EU.  Ireland is far behind its EU counterparts in terms of policy development, with approximately 20 AD plants currently in operation here.<\/p> <p>  In 2017, a European Commission report entitled Optimal Use of Biogas from Waste Streams: An Assessment of the Potential of Biogas from Digestion in the EU Beyond 2020 identified that Ireland had the largest potential for growth in biogas production.  Anaerobic digestion complements existing strategies such as the farm to fork strategy.  The recent REPowerEU report sets a target of 35 billion cu. m of biomethane by 2030.  There is a significant opportunity for Ireland to contribute to this and a dedicated Irish AD policy is required to maximise the opportunity.  However, the gap between the cost of production and the market return has closed in recent times with the increase in fossil gas prices.  This cost gap must be bridged through policy, support, incentives and measures.<\/p> <p>  The lack of progress in developing the industry is a missed opportunity for Ireland Inc.  The technology has many benefits, including energy security, decarbonising our dairy processing and co-operative sector, decarbonising transport, electricity and heat, providing alternative farm enterprises, reducing emissions from agriculture, potentially reducing the size of the national herd through farmers instead producing grass which is fertilised by digestate, digestate displacing the use of chemical fertiliser, enhancing biodiversity, developing the circular and bioeconomy and improving water quality.<\/p> <p>  I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Noel Gavigan, who will outline aspects in further detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022070500002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Finan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Last year, the 40by30 report published by Renewable Energy Ireland identified that as much as 39% of Ireland's heat demand can be met with biogas, solid biomass, and liquid biofuels.<\/p><p>The report further identified that Ireland could completely decarbonise its heating needs with existing indigenous resources.  The challenge, however, is to mobilise those sources and direct them to their most suitable use.  Last year we commissioned MaREI to conduct a report entitled Transport in Ireland: A Pathway to Halving Emissions.  It demonstrates that Ireland could achieve a 51% reduction in transport emissions using a combination of electric vehicles, biomethane in particular, bioliquids and some efficiency measures.<\/p><p> In terms of climate change, biodiversity and sustainability, particularly with regard to what anaerobic digestion and biogas can contribution, these are low carbon and sustainable alternatives to fossil gas when produced in line with the renewable energy directive and its criteria, which is important.  These are most suited to replace fossil gas in industrial heating, dispatchable electricity generation and transport fuels.  Digestate from biogas production, which has already been mentioned, will reduce the need for chemical fertiliser, particularly when it is used in a circular economy scenario of recycling food waste and waste from brown bins.  It has already been identified that we are doing only a small proportion of that.  We can recover those valuable nutrients back to agriculture and the energy from the same material.<\/p><p> Digestion and digestate can be used to manage on-farm waste such as slurry and farmyard manure, allowing farms to efficiently recycle their own nutrients, as well as producing some energy on-site.  That is something we are championing through the small biogas demonstration programme on-farm.  On-farm digestion offers an in-house method for farms to decarbonise an operation while maintaining current food production, which is an important criterion.  Where a farm opts to produce grass for use in a biogas plant, the farm is displacing a certain level of livestock production, thus reducing emissions from livestock and contributing directly to decarbonisation of our energy system.  It is important that a biogas industry based on grass would not lead to direct competition in feedstock with the dairy sector, driving up costs for both sectors.<\/p><p> On policy discussion points, with regard to public perception, there is a need with any new development for public awareness of technology.  We can see European examples of biogas plants located next to residential areas in villages with no issues arising.  In Ireland, we have seen some biogas plants welcomed by the public and others meeting sustained objection based on local opposition.  There is a need for local government to better understand the benefits of biogas and be able to support positive developments of these vital technologies.<\/p><p> It is not feasible to consider replacing the entire supply of fossil gas with renewable gases at this point or in the near future.  Long-term policy must consider conserving the renewable gas we produce for specialist tasks like dispatchable power generation, transport fuel and high-end heat uses.  It is therefore imperative that we decarbonise our gas supply as much as possible and consider reducing gas usage by displacing it with other low-carbon and renewable options, such as solid biomass heating and district heating for the domestic sector.<\/p><p> Current policy measures, such as the support scheme for renewable heat, provides incentives for solid biomass and biogas.  However, this support scheme must be grown and expanded to assist with meeting 2030 decarbonisation targets.  The biofuels obligation scheme was set up in 2010 and to date it has provided the largest portion of decarbonised transport in the State.  This scheme should be expanded as a successful project to ensure that renewable gas-powered vehicles are encouraged and deployed, particularly for heavy goods vehicle and bus fleets where direct decarbonisation options are often quite limited.  Biogas and biomethane provide an excellent opportunity in this respect.<\/p><p> Planned policy measures like the proposed renewable heat obligation must be put in place immediately.  We encourage rapid transition from fossil fuels to indigenously produced renewable fuels and we encourage the committee to progress and encourage the launch of this obligation.  We thank the committee for the opportunity to present today and look forward to answering any questions the committee might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022070500002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Gavigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>We have just over two hours remaining in our meeting so may I get agreement that members will take two minutes to ask questions?

The first question was about the route and ways in which biomethane will be used.  As an environmental scientist, when I assess the technology, I come with a neutral perspective.  I am not trying to prove what the policy direction should be one way or the other.  I am assessing the technology in a neutral way and looking at what the data show.  It is important to consider using biomethane in sectors which are hard to decarbonise, as has been outlined.  Heat and transport are the routes that should be followed.  One can consider the uptake in Europe compared with Ireland.  In Europe, the main pathway for use of biogas was previously electricity generation.  When I looked at that in my own research, it showed that as we further decarbonise the fuel mix in Ireland, the electricity pathway is less favourable for biogas.  That would point to using biomethane to replace fossil gas.  That is where I see biomethane fitting into the relevant sectors.<\/p> <p>  I considered other feedstocks in my research.  I looked at other animal waste, such as poultry litter.  Managing poultry litter sustainably is another option that showed good results.  I also considered waste from the horticulture sector and diverting some to anaerobic digestion.<\/p><p>My focus and emphasis would be on grass silage, because it is the largest resource that has been identified.  In terms of the percentage that it can produce for biomethane, it is the most readily available resource.  It also presents a few risks.  That is why the focus needs to be on producing it in a way that is sustainable, with minimal inorganic nitrogen fertiliser.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022070500002#G01500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciara Beausang","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I will respond to a few of the Deputy's points.  There are many different uses of biomethane and biogas.  The uses are dependent on the economics of it, from the point of view of the costs and the return.  There is potentially off-grid and on-grid use for biomethane and biogas.  There is more value to be gained from the resource by using it in the transport sector rather than for heating.  It depends on the individual economics.<\/p> <p>  On feedstocks, we see a broad mix of feedstocks being used.  Again, it comes back to the economics of it.  Different feedstocks come at different costs.  We have done quite a bit of work on the different costs of various feedstocks.  That has an impact on the actual support requirements, depending on the type of feedstocks that are used.  Biogas and biomethane are currently used mostly in the generation of electricity.  There is some injection taking place, which is being done by one of our members.  However, the support mechanism that has delivered in the past is for renewable electricity.  A lot of the biogas being produced at the moment is being used to produce renewable electricity.<\/p> <p>  On the level of interest, we have received lots of interest from many different stakeholders, including farmers who are willing to grow feedstocks, people who are willing to develop facilities, developers, and technology providers who have technologies and are wondering why Ireland is not advancing in the industry when we are seeing growth in other markets.  We have also received interest from energy users.  Transport companies are interested in getting their hands on biogas and biomethane.  There are also thermal users who want renewable gas as well.<\/p> <p>  On key enablers, planning is one of the big ones.  We have a lot of experience around the planning process through our European Innovation Partnership, EIP, project.  There is very little awareness at a planning authority level as to the different types of scales of industry that are possible.  There is a lack of knowledge about what the technology actually is and what it does.  That is replicated amongst the public and our local political representatives.  There is a lack of understanding as to what the technology is, what it does and what it can do.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's last point on our experience and engagement to date, we have engaged with the Department of Transport, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the development of the sector.  Going back to a previous question asked by Deputy O'Sullivan, the one challenge that we face is that when we go to one Department, we are told that the benefits relate to the area of responsibility of another Department and we are asked why the Department should have to fund an industry that will bring benefit to another sector.  I think we need a whole-of-government approach.  Many Government Departments must come together to create the strategy that is required to mobilise this industry.  The policy paper we produced with Cr&eacute; highlighted that seven Government Departments will significantly benefit from this industry.  I will not name the Departments, but there is a broad range of benefits to be gained from the industry.  We are engaging with many Government Departments and officials.  We have had very good engagement, but we want to move that to the next stage in terms of putting policy in place that will drive the development of the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022070500002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Finan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":193,"content":"<p>In 2019, through the collaboration with industry-led initiatives, and recognising that the Government has significant tasks across sectors in looking at solutions of decarbonising, we looked at the opportunity of what industry could do by way of coming up with solutions.  We engaged with KPMG.  We did a full economic assessment of AD biomethane in full compliance with the Public Spending Code, first to inform policy in Government around the opportunities, options and support schemes and obviously to advise on the size and scale of AD plans.  It is important that we focus on the industry's need to be competitive and aligned with our European counterparts on the cost of producing biomethane.  From then, the interest has been significant both at industry and gas consumer level, and more importantly, in the agrifood production sector.  Operators in the sector are looking at their scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, which AD biomethane will significantly reduce.  The sector has already implemented many of the recommendations on energy efficiency that have been brought to bear with current policies.  Operators are looking at the scope 3 emissions, in particular, because there is a significant carbon footprint attached to that category of emissions.  We are dealing with a very well-educated, commercially-minded agriculture sector and specifically the beef and dairy sectors.  Everybody is realising that there are challenges and that we need to move at pace.  In particular, under article 23 of the renewable energy directive, member states must seek to implement the obligations that we have promoted under the renewable heat obligation scheme.  It is our opinion and belief that entering into a public consultation is probably not the best use of our time.  It is included in the renewable energy directive as an option to exercise.  We should have exercised it a lot sooner.  We should not be consulting and over-consulting.  The policies have already been drafted and consulted upon at a European level.  It is a missed opportunity and we need to move our timelines on a bit quicker.  The support mechanisms are designed so that it is not an enduring subsidy regime requiring Exchequer funding.  The industry has come up with an integrated business case that is complementary to all farm disciplines.  There is no question of giving up one discipline over supplying into an AD plant or a contract to supply.  They mechanisms are being designed to look at diversification, but will retain some of the core principles, obviously.  Our experience across Government Departments is that they have been very engaging and our engagement has been constructive.  The Departments are overwhelmed.  If we have any feedback for the committee, it is that more resources need to be provided to the Departments.  They have a lot of work to do.  We work closely with our colleagues in the Departments in bringing forward these solutions and in trying to make them as easy and implementable as possible.<\/p> <p>  Our key ask of Government is very simple.  The cornerstone is the RHO scheme.  We are asking for 50% capital grant funding.  We must get the industry to an adequate level of maturity.  We also need to accelerate the process and ramp it up, in line with the REPowerEU Plan.  The four key dimensions to realising that include feedstock mobility, which is relevant to our feedstock and pasture lands.  The second dimension is planning.  I do not need to go there.  We need to resource local authorities and communities and inform and educate them.  We must also resource up our planning system.  The third dimension relates to the market conditions.  We must look at what we need to do to debunk some of the regulatory barriers that we are facing right now and how we can do that.  Lastly, there is the funding dimension.  We are fortunate to be in a position to work closely with Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  It has agreed in principle, subject to terms and lending conditions, to fund 50%.  We have the anchor fund.  There are a number of other funders that want to get involved.  We have looked at &euro;200 million.  That can be a roll-up facility.

In Ireland, as well as producing biomethane for heat and transport, there are huge opportunities to produce locally based fertiliser, not only in the agriculture sector but also into the horticulture sector, where in the current situation our practices are unique compared with those of other countries, where there is a demand for peat alternatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022070500002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Percy Foster"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I thank all the participants for their thoughtful presentations.  I have been a supporter of anaerobic digestion for a long time and have wondered aloud on many occasions why we in Ireland have not advanced more quickly, considering the very positive benefits from anaerobic digestion.  The reality is that other countries have been way ahead of us.  That gives us an opportunity.  Our weakness is probably our strength at this stage, the weakness being the fact that we are not really on the radar and the strength being that technologies have advanced.  I think all the witnesses have identified new and emerging technologies in this area.  From the committee's perspective, they are giving us a lot of information.  I do not think there is any diversity of views, but the witnesses are representing different areas.  Maybe they need to come closer together with a pitch, but that is for themselves.  The response will have to come from the Government and from the Oireachtas to some extent.<\/p> <p>  I will throw out a couple of questions to whomever wants to take the ball.  In the witnesses' considered opinion, who do they think is doing this really well?  What country is doing it better than any other?  It may be that some countries are doing some elements of it better than others.  If so, maybe the witnesses will share that with us.<\/p> <p>  As for the response from the Government, I am taken particularly by what Mr. Finan said.  It is often a problem with issues like this.  There is a reason this has not happened.  I do not wish to speak critically of the Government at all, but Departments tend to concentrate on what they have to do and nothing else because they will be rewarded for what they have achieved and criticised for what they have not achieved, unlike politicians, who will be criticised anyway for everything, regardless of whether it falls within their remit.  Perhaps there is a message for us in whatever response we give to the Government.  It may be that a certain Department takes a lead role and absolute responsibility for this area because of its importance and benefit to all and because of the diversity of where the actions need to happen.  I suspect that would be the Department with responsibility for climate change because it has so many tentacles, and many Departments now have climate change officers with responsibility in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022070500002#J00400","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I have an answer to Senator Dooley's first question as to who is doing this well.

Replacing local heat needs with locally delivered AD is a very high priority because it avoids all the wastage in delivery by electricity.  It seems to be a different issue if supplying into the grid.  Would it be different for large commercial operators versus a single farm or a couple of farms?  Would they need a completely different support regime?  Is that what people are advocating?  Could there be a subsidy for establishment and sale at the going price on the grid?  Would that do or would we need the 15-year commitment to a high price?  How does this area compare to other renewables we might source?  We have heard that wind is the big opportunity for Ireland.  In the context of farming, if this is a displacement of dry stock that was relatively unprofitable and is a huge methane gain from society's point of view, how would the farmer gain from that in a regime of this sort?  Do we need a specialist regime that recognises farmers growing biomass for AD and reducing their herd?  They would have to get a very different deal from something that is done separately.

We break up our work in this area into two distinct scales.  There is what we call farm scale, which is similar to what we are covering through our EIP Department-funded project as we offset the fossil energy usage on the farm by farm-generated feedstocks.  The animal by-product regulations govern a lot of this area from the point of view of what we are allowed to bring into a farm, access routes and various other things.  Our project is very specifically dealing with farm-generated waste used to produce biogas and that biogas being used to offset existing fossil usage.  That fossil usage could involve kerosene used for heating, the generating of renewable electricity through a CHP unit or producing fuel for the farm equipment and vehicles.<\/p><p>It is a circular approach in that you are offsetting chemical fertiliser usage, improving the overall carbon sustainable footprint of the farm and utilising the waste that exists and potentially adding value to it for further nutrient recycling.<\/p><p> We break our work into what we call farm-scale and medium to large-scale areas.  Regarding the first part of the question, there is a very distinct difference in the support requirements at what I have described as farm-scale compared to medium to large-scale.  It is very clear from our work that the farmer needs a capital grant to offset the initial construction of the anaerobic digestion facility on the farm.  The farmer's payment is generated through offsetting his or her fossil fuel bill over a period of time.  If you take that to the next level in terms of the medium to large-scale facilities, and these plants could be located on a co-operative-style farm where there could be a number of farmers supplying to it or a site independent of a farm, the role of the farmer in that case is more about supplying the feed stock or a wide variety of feed stocks.  The farmer would be paid for that feedstock and the energy output would go to a grid.  It might be used locally or it could go to a grid to displace heating or transport energy usage.  To answer the first question, there is a very distinct difference in the support requirements across the different scales and a very distinct difference in respect of farmer involvement across the different scales.  A framework that would combine all of that is the carbon farming framework.  If farmers are going to look at the economics and determine that growing feed stock is a better option, and as a farmer I understand the outlook of farmers on this, they make a business decision as to whether it will be more economically viable to grow feed stock or carry livestock.  The framework that ties all of that together is the carbon farming framework in terms of creating a benchmark for carbon levels on farms and putting a value on the various different elements that can contribute to increasing that stock.  Reducing the number of animals is an option but that is up to each individual farmer.  It is about whether the economics stack up better for the production of feed stock as an alternative.  It will be down to an economic decision by the farmer.  I hope this answers the questions about the different scales and the distinct differences in terms of support requirements.<\/p><p> The medium to large-scale support requirements are an ongoing support in our opinion.  Our members are giving us that view.  There are very few models across Europe where at a medium to large scale, capital support has worked or has been deployed.  It is mostly all in the form of ongoing support through an obligation scheme and an exchequer support in some European countries but the levels of capital investment are significant at a medium to large scale.  We are not aware of any significant capital support schemes across the EU to any great extent at the medium to large scale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022070500002#K01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Finan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":221,"content":"<p>If we look at biowaste across Europe in terms of a typical anaerobic digestion site, it is in the region of 40,000 to 50,000 tonnes.  There are large ones such as the one wet anaerobic digestion site in the UK that has 100,000 tonnes while there are other facilities within and outside Milan that have 300,000 tonnes.  For here, probably the best option is to have a series of relatively small-scale sites catering for 40,000 or 50,000 tonnes.  This way, you have the economies of scale to make the operation work.  You do not see waste anaerobic digestion sites below 30,000 tonnes because the economics do not stack up.  I am talking about waste here.  I am not talking about grass.  To make the economics of a waste anaerobic digestion system work, you need to make sure what is coming in enables a valuable product to emerge and you understand what is coming out of the back end.  The UK went very hard on wet anaerobic digestion without any consideration of what was coming out of the bag.  When you look at where the digestate market is in the UK, according to the last Waste and Resources Action Programme figures, it is at minus &pound;8 per tonne.  This relates to waste processors paying farmers to take their digestate even in today's market.  It is about making sure the system is in place to deliver not just the energy but the renewable fertilisers and the compost ready for soil health, for which you must have a market.

We have a population of 5 million people give or take in Ireland.  We have to look at the amount of waste being produced and possibly still going to landfill.  That is one area.  That will not fuel biogas plants across the country so there is a limited amount of waste that would be available and then you move on to animal manure.  Again, there is a limited amount of that.  We have a wind strategy and solar.  As regards generating electricity, we are far better off working on that strategy.  With anaerobic digestion, we need to look at biomethane and generating.  There are two areas where this would be very beneficial.  Number one is transport fuel while the other is in heating.  We need to draw a line there.  This is the way we need to go because it comes back to where it was discussed earlier.  If we are using anaerobic digestion to generate electricity, 50% of your output is going to go in heat.

There is a role for all of this but we are excellent at producing food in Ireland.

We need to sit down and examine whether it will be a mixture of smaller on-farm operations or a mixture of community-based operations, how we are going to set up those supply chains and the barriers to achieving that because we have that obligation and a relatively short period in which to get those plans in place based on what people have said here today.<\/p><p>There is an urgency that we decide to get that plan and get the detail to understand, as has been discussed here, the barriers and find the solutions and that we do that in the most sustainable way possible.<\/p><p> There have been concerns.

There is provision in the national development plan, NDP, for 50% funding for the pilot project, so it is within the Government's policy already to have that 50% funding.

Also, a vast quantity of the material we are looking at using is waste material collected from everyone's house.  This is brown bin waste and food waste.  Although there are lots of strategies to reduce food waste and they have been ongoing for over a decade and there was involvement up to 15 years ago, it is still being produced.

At this stage of the debate, most of the questions have been asked.  The Chairman and Deputy Bruton asked the questions to which I was predominantly looking for answers.  To recap, what are the best examples of jurisdictions that we can learn from?  One of the key priorities for this committee is to learn about this process and its advantages in our collective efforts to reduce carbon emissions.  One of my main concerns in learning about anaerobic digestion in recent years has been the experience of Germany over the past decade or so, which saw the diversion of food crops to anaerobic digestion facilities.  I do not believe that is still happening, but it begs the question as to what the critical mass for this sector is in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  My next question is on the technical side and may be best suited to Dr. Beausang.  Are there different types of anaerobic digestion?  Are there competing means of producing energy from biomass?  If so, have studies been done on which would be the most appropriate for the Irish market?<\/p> <p>  I will next make a general comment rather than asking a specific question.  It is clear that we need a policy to be produced on biomethane yesterday.  We have been talking about it for the entirety of the current D&aacute;il, whose term has been more than two years, and a number of years prior to that, yet we still do not have a policy.  We are missing an opportunity.  I would hate to see this being delayed further by a lack of policy production on the part of the State.

He referred to the missed opportunity.  Developing biogas in Ireland has been something we have been advocating for since our organisation was founded more than 23 years ago.  The Oireachtas has published reports on this as far back as 2010, so the issue has been examined.  Now is the time to move forward, and to do so rapidly.  We have run out of time.  The timing could not be &ndash; I will use an unfortunate term &ndash; better than it is now.<\/p> <p>  Senator Dooley raised an interesting point.  We are all aware that politicians will be criticised regardless of whether they do something right or wrong.  There is also a fear within the Civil Service of doing the wrong thing.  For a number of years, we have seen significant stagnation in policy development.  To be fair to the people in various Departments and other State organisations whom we deal with often, there is a major fear of doing the wrong thing.  We need to alleviate that fear a little.  A considerable amount of regulation with very complex rules is applied to the various support schemes just to try to alleviate the fear of making even the smallest of mistakes.  Maybe we need to consider how to address that issue in future.  It has led to a great deal of stagnation in our consideration of the technologies and options for use in decarbonisation.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's first question was on food versus fuel.  Where biogas in Ireland is concerned, most of the material from farms is grass based.  Grass is a particular crop that we are considering.  Most of Ireland's grasslands are not tillable ground, so they cannot be replaced with a direct food crop.  Obviously, one can feed animals on them, meaning that grass is a material that only has one food-related use, that being, animal production.  This means that the impact of grass is much less.<\/p> <p>  We are living in a climate where we are facing severe decisions in the winter ahead.  Fuel and heating are critical parts of life in this part of the world.  We all must be cognisant that fuel poverty is an issue currently and will likely be a considerable issue this winter.  From that point of view, there is a valid debate to be had on food versus fuel, but fuel also has critical importance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022070500002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Gavigan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":244,"content":"<p>As some of the Deputy's other questions have been answered, I will pick up on his question about the critical mass needed in Ireland.  Through industry collaboration by Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, Devenish and KPMG, they have established that there are 768,000 ha of underutilised pasture lands.  For clarity, this excludes hillsides, special areas of conservation, SACs, and areas of high biodiversity value.  The optimum scale of AD plant that we are promoting, which is 20 GWh, would require slightly less than 500 ha of land to supply the sustainable feedstock.<\/p><p>If we do the maths, we can see there is an opportunity to pursue 9.5 TWh of biomethane production from the sustainable feedstock and available landmass.  This is before we even consider other innovative technologies.  A national network of anaerobic digestion biomethane plants would be complementary to biorefineries and the biocircular economy.  A national network of anaerobic digestion plants would also provide the additional opportunity of pursuing biohydrogen.  With regard to critical mass we will hem ourselves in if we look at this as having one dimension.  We have a significant opportunity to push ourselves to go even higher with complementary technologies.  MaREI has produced figures showing that we could produce as much as 18 TWh of renewable gas in this country before we really tap into hydrogen at scale.  Along with being an exporter of renewable electricity to Europe there is a significant opportunity for Ireland to be a net exporter of renewable gas in the long term if we do it right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022070500002#N00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. P.J.

I will reiterate that while the emissions are not counted from that particular point of combustion, it does not mean there are no associated emissions at other stages of the life cycle.  We would see emissions counted for any fertiliser input, for the energy the digester itself requires and for the methane losses that occur.  It is not to say there are zero emissions.  There are emissions associated with it.

It goes back to promoting a cascading approach in the bioeconomy.  The value of biological materials in the first instance is as feed.  Next is extracting various chemicals and proteins from them.  Going down the order, anaerobic digestion is on a lower tier.  In this regard the prospect of biorefining is a very good option.  The technology means that grass can be crushed using an extruder to produce two different products.  There is a juice and fibre.  The fibre can be ensiled and fed directly to cows.  The juice can be heated to create a protein concentrate that also can be used to feed animals.  The residual grass whey left over can be used for anaerobic digestion.

A new proposal, the REPowerEU plan, is being launched by the Commission to repower the EU.  There is an important debate to be had on growing crops to produce energy and to produce food.  We have a limited land resource.  There is a balance.  We can do both.  We have grasslands in Ireland.  As I have already said on numerous occasions, we are an excellent country at producing food.

Obviously that is lost revenue on a financial model.  There is considerable interest in making sure methane is fully captured, both from an environmental and financial point of view.

A red flag for me is that we would go down the road of what happened with incineration in other countries, in that they are now having to import the stock to feed the incinerators.  One does not want to see us go too big on AD and then have a situation where we are not addressing waste reduction, which is also part of our circular economy strategy.

The Senator mentioned the 1.6 TWh.  We see that as a very conservative target in the medium term.  However, we are starting from a standing start in terms of the deployment of an industry.  In 2019, IrBEA and Cr&eacute; worked jointly on a policy paper which set out a roadmap for how that could be mobilised.  We were very clear, and Mr. Foster has mentioned it in previous contributions, that it has to be a phased approach where we start by building 20 plants and see what happens in terms of how that could be deployed, what challenges that is raising and what issues are arising, and then be able to address those in the next phase in the further roll-out of the industry.  There is huge ambition being talked about for the industry, but it is our firm belief that we must start at a level which allows the concerns to be alleviated through the roll-out of an industry.  We agree with the phased approach, which is very clear in our policy paper.  We also agree with the review mechanism by which one would learn from one phase for the next phase.<\/p> <p>  Regarding what is sustainable in terms of an industry, the SEAI heat study that was recently published refers to a 5 TWh biomethane figure.  That is an increase in ambition beyond the 1.6 TWh.  There is lots of potential for a significant figure way beyond that, but initially we are very clear in stating that it has to be mobilised on a phased basis by starting with a small number of plants, seeing what the lessons from those are and then progress to alleviate the fears that are raised.<\/p> <p>  The Senator's second point was about fodder and the shortage.  Returning to our joint policy paper, which is currently being reviewed based on the economic situation in which we find ourselves and what the economic requirements are, the broad principles of that paper still remain.  From a fodder perspective, we see the development of a biomethane-biogas industry in Ireland as being a strategic resource.  If one looks at previous fodder shortages that took place in Ireland, generally a fodder shortage would only be for a few weeks depending on the particular situation, perhaps a drought or other circumstances.  The fodder that came into the country for previous fodder shortages over a number of years came from the biogas industry across Europe because it had the reserves built up so it could release it at a point in time.<\/p> <p>  We see an AD industry as complementing the fodder industry from the point of view that the AD facilities would build up a supply of feed.  That potentially could be sold back to the farmers in the times of shortage at the price they received for it.  In the intervening period the biogas plants could look at alternative feedstocks in the form of glycerine or other products which would take them over the hump at that particular moment in time.  Then when the fodder situation is alleviated, the farmers could again supply that feed back to the plant to build the reserve again.  We would see a biomethane-biogas industry being very complementary to the agricultural processes and systems with regard to fodder.  All that is outlined very clearly in the joint policy paper that we developed.  That paper is currently being looked at to review and update it to take account of the current economic situation with pricing and also some of the policy developments that have happened in REPowerEU, farm to fork and other policies that have emerged since and with which we need to be aligned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022070500002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Finan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Senator Boylan made an excellent about food waste.

That is why we must be very careful with the strategy on anaerobic digestion to find a balance here.  I believe we need to concentrate on biomethane and generating either transport fuel or heat from biomethane.  We must continue the strategy on wind and solar.  They are very important as well because we do not need a feed stock to supply a solar panel or a wind turbine.  It is about finding the right balance here.

Reference to the 18 TWh is where one would look at complementary technologies to look at pursuing biohydrogen once there is a national network.  I agree with what has been mentioned previously by industry representatives.  Specifically, we have spoken to farming representative groups and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine about that opportunity.  The quality of feed stock for the AD plant needs to be of a standard that would be equivalent to what one would feed a dairy herd or beef herd.  We have proposed that as part of the AD charter and a national structure, 2% or 3% of the feedstock in storage would be made available as a backstop in the event of weather events or geopolitical events into the future.  Consider the volumes here and the criteria for sustainability.  There are 40,000 tonnes going into the AD plant, 20,000 tonnes of which would be sustainable feedstock, and 125 AD plants by 2030.

It is acknowledged that we will not produce that additional grass silage with additional inorganic fertiliser.  It needs to be done in a more appropriate way.  There are a number of ways to do it.

If the Government takes the approach of investing, getting on and learning by doing, it also needs to be confident that the review mechanism is set up well enough to allow us to conduct refinements as we go along.

If we choose to pursue an industry-led initiative, led by the private sector, such as we are doing on biomethane, and come to the Government with key, specific requests without recourse to Exchequer funding, it is an opportunity for the Government to work with industry.  When I say \"industry\", I mean the full supply chain.  There are regulatory requirements for the pillar industries to report under the Paris Agreement.  That filters down to the producers.  It is in nobody's interests to greenwash, whitewash or misrepresent the position.  We have moved away from the era of box-ticking exercises.  We are advocating for measurement reporting and verification, which is the gold standard that keeps everybody honest.  That would mean everybody ensures they produce net environmental gains.  The economics will be a secondary consideration but these things are interlinked.  Sustainable food production goes hand in hand with AD, the bioeconomy, biofertiliser and carbon farming.  To answer the Chairman's question, annual reviews can be useful.  Natural England in the UK is analysing whether any of its initiatives are showing net biodiversity gains.  We are looking at the national biodiversity policy and strategy, and a nature positive system.  Many lessons can be learned from other jurisdictions.<\/p> <p>  The projects must be reviewed, perhaps on an annual or two-year basis, and the net biodiversity gain assessed.  That is already being done in the UK through Natural England.  There are ways to stitch in a review process.  There are ways to monitor and review.  The danger is that we review too much.  There is a five-year period of accounting for carbon farming.  I suggest we start with a five-year review in that regard.  Such a review would examine the scientific net gain of carbon in the soil.  If we do that, our soil quality and health will improve, as will our biodiversity, air and water quality, and our sustainable food production.  There is a danger that we are going to get stuck in the mud without saying we have an overall plan.  We can consider reviews, and have done so.<\/p> <p>  The RHO has an annual review mechanism that considers a contract for difference and the cost of energy production for biomethane.  There are other already clear criteria and regulatory structures under the renewable energy directive, the Paris Agreement and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, guidelines.  We are not reinventing the wheel.

The reason I sought to introduce this Bill was because I see the advantages involved and the need to expedite this process, carry on with it and get going.  At the same time, I would never advocate for diving into something head first without mitigation and examining the science.  Mr. McCarthy recently said something interesting about the fact that 92% of Ireland is covered in pasture.  Mr. Cullinan qualified that by saying we are the best and most efficient in the world, and the most sustainable in terms of our food production model.  Within that 92% of pasture, some farmers can be very good at protecting biodiversity.  Outside those special areas of conservation, SACs, and the mountainous areas we have talked about, there are some bits of biodiversity on farmlands that do not have the same protection.  We hope that the agri-climate rural environmental scheme, ACRES, will go some way towards addressing that through riparian planting, mixed-species swards and wild bird cover, etc.  What I am getting is that 92% is a lot.  That leaves only 8% for everything else and those pure bits of biodiversity.  That suggests an interesting question in respect of balance.<\/p> <p>  It seems to me that on pure waste alone, AD is probably neither viable nor sustainable.  There needs to be an element of silage.  Dr. Beausang referenced the technique whereby what is left after the process is divided into liquid which is still a viable feed.  We need a bit more reassurance to ensure we avoid a situation whereby pasture expands further just to feed AD.  We must retain the sustainable food production element that Mr. Cullinan has said is important.<\/p> <p>  The following relates to one of the main positives.  Our guests might elaborate further on the circular economy.  We sometimes forget about the importance of the circular economy in the context of AD.<\/p><p>He might touch on where that waste food goes, if it does not go to an AD plant.  Where does the waste from a piggery go if it does not go to AD?  In the Timoleague example I gave, there is a successful distillery and the waste grain is brought to the AD.  Where does that go?  That is a very important factor.  The circular economy is so important because we are reusing these products.  I know we are nearly at closing up time, but if Mr. Cullinan could just answer both of those questions, it would be great.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022070500002#S00800","speaker":"1545","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I apologise to Mr. Finan.

This is a huge investment, so we need to be very careful.  We all understand that we need to move forward and a new industry is very important for the sector.  However, we need Government intervention as well.  This is new for the vast majority of farmers.  A number of farmers understand this.  In the general scheme of things, however, it is a new system that we are asking farmers to get involved in.  We will need Government intervention.  There will have to be a proper grant structure.  Again, it is very important and we would like to work with the Deputy on this Bill as well.  It is very important that we bring the Bill forward.  All the agencies coming together and working together would be very beneficial.<\/p> <p>  Again, the Deputy made the point on the circular economy.  That is very important.  One area that was not raised here today was what we will do with the back end of all of this - the digestate.  It is a huge volume and it costs a lot to truck it out there as well.  We need to be looking at the technologies in extracting the ammonia and perhaps using precision farming and applying that ammonia to the grassland.  That is another area we need to look at as well.  There will be a substantial cost involved in all of this.

There are some very strict criteria that have to be met in terms of the output being classified as renewable.<\/p> <p>  The second point I would like to make is that mobilisation of an industry is the priority, and that is required through policy generation.  Any country that has a successful industry has a policy landscape that supports that.  It needs be focused on a phased approach, in that we start off with a small number of plants, learn from the challenges or opportunities that they bring and then work on from there.  A key point for our members is that the support requirements need to match the actual requirements to make it economically viable.  We have seen before where schemes were introduced and, as a result, there was not uptake or a development of facilities because the support requirements did not match the economic realities of the production costs.  That is a very important aspect.  In doing that and in developing our policy paper, we liaised with farm organisations, such as the IFA, the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, and Macra na Feirme.  We talked to them at the time about the production costs required for silage.  They were happy to support our proposal based on the costs we had put forward.  That has totally changed now, given the situation with the associated costs.  We also spoke with our members who are building these facilities.  They have, at their fingertips, the actual operational maintenance cost requirements for these facilities.  In the review of our document, we will be going about that consultation again and ensuring that what we put forward in terms of an update to that paper reflects what the requirements of an industry are.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I just wish to say that the circular economy is a very important aspect.  The spent grains probably would go to animal feed, if not used in a biogas plant.  We have to be conscious of the cascading uses.  The pig slurry would literally be spread on land.  We are not harvesting the nutrient or energy output from that as a result of not putting it through an anaerobic digestion process.  It is the same with slurry from a livestock system.  If we can take the gas from that and add value to that in terms of making the nutrients more accessible when it is spread on the land, that is a win-win for the circular economy, the circular bioeconomy and the cascading principles, which were talked about.<\/p> <p>  All of these current feedstocks are being utilised from the point of view of the waste feedstocks.  However, probably to fulfil that cascading principle, one can put all that through AD and still utilise it to what it is being used for now in a better and more resource-efficient capacity.<\/p> <p>  I will leave it at that.  I thank the committee for inviting IrBEA here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022070500002#T00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Finan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":298,"content":"<p>We are highlighting that biomethane is one aspect, an output and by-product of the biorefinery.  Pursuing the cascading principles, where you have those by-products or resource streams such as spent grain and other industrial residues or sludges, involves pursuing the maximum value of what can be extracted.  We have some fantastic academic centres of excellence with University College Dublin, UCD, University College Cork, UCC, MaREI, and the National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG.  We are currently engaging with industry, for example on Project Clover, and asking what by-products or bioproducts is it looking for.  We have very strong, healthy biopharma, biochemicals and food industries.  For example, biogenic CO2 is an additional revenue stream.  It is important that anybody embarking in this industry understands that the commercial responsibility and duty is to maximise and valorise every revenue stream possible with the principle of getting higher value products.  It is not just about biomethane, biofertiliser or carbon farming; it is about protein extraction, biogenic CO2, bioactives and biostimulants.  Very clearly, there are opportunities to engage directly with industry.  Before we pursue on the industry at scale, we should engage, find out and establish from it exactly what products it is looking for on the market.  Rather than going out and looking and creating a market, we have the technologies and expertise to extract those valuable bioproducts and give them to industry, such as bioplastics.  Mr. Prendergast is working on a project here with BioWILL.  They are looking at the by-product as an alternative for packaging, for example.  Rather than boxing ourselves into one particular by-product, we need to be looking at everything.  It is building an industry within an industry that supports our national bioeconomy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022070500002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. P.J.

From that point, if you use the continuation of that, it will present an opportunity not just with regard to existing employment, but also with regard to generating a new form of employment.

Mr. Black has responsibility for the provision of prisoner services, including education.<\/p> <p>  There are currently more than 4,100 people accommodated in our prisons daily.  In terms of education, the Irish Prison Service provides a broad range of services and activities in which prisoners can participate daily.  These services provide daily constructive activities for those in prison while serving their sentence and are very much designed to target the root causes of offending.  They provide an opportunity for prisoners to address their educational needs or skills deficits through participation in education or work and training, which supports their eventual reintegration back into society.  I am happy to discuss the provision of these services in more detail today and to answer any questions the members may have in this regard.<\/p> <p>  I record my appreciation to all of the head teachers and teachers who support and encourage prisoners every day and specifically to recognise their efforts on behalf of people in custody over the past two years during the pandemic in what was a very challenging environment within our prison system.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Education provides an allocation of 220 whole-time teacher equivalents to the Irish Prison Service through the education and training boards. We are very grateful for this provision.  Education in prisons is delivered in partnership between the ETBs and the prison service with a focus on providing education that is quality assured, student centred and facilitates lifelong learning.  There are outstanding teachers in all of our prison schools and our prison schools represent a positive learning environment.<\/p> <p>  In general, education programmes are adapted to take account of the diversity of the prisoner population and the complex nature of prison life, including segregation requirements and high levels of prisoner turnover.  The partnership between ourselves and the ETBs endeavours to meet the needs of prisoners through helping them cope with their sentence, achieve personal development and prepare for life after release.<\/p> <p>  Prison education includes a core element of basic education incorporating reading, writing, numeracy and IT literacy.  Indeed, our education staff are particularly vigilant in identifying basic education needs.  It is important to highlight the significant fact that over 70% of people in custody are early school-leavers.  The median school-leaving age of those in our care is 14 years of age.  It is an unfortunate fact of life that many people who come into our care have had a negative experience of education in their past.  That is why the provision of quality education and regular and consistent access to the prison school is so important.  As W.B. Yeats once said, \"Education is not the filling of a pail but the lighting of a fire.\"<\/p><p>Anybody who has visited a prison education school will have seen the fire in the eyes of the students there and their burning ambition and hopes for their future.  The prison school is their gateway to a better life for themselves and for their families.  <\/p><p> One of the key challenges for the IPS is to ensure that our students have regular and consistent access to prison schools to provide that opportunity and hope.  Unfortunately the loss of a substantial number of staff on a daily basis to support prisoner escorts can have a detrimental impact on the opening of schools.  This is an area we are committed to addressing and we will seek additional funding through the 2023 Estimates process to strengthen the number of staff in our prison escort corps and thus alleviate the draw of staff away from prisoner services.  <\/p><p> The Prison Education Strategy 2019-2022 is a joint strategy between the Irish Prison Service and Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI.  It reflects and acknowledges the unique nature of prison education in terms of the target population and the environment in which education is delivered. It sets out a commitment to broad-based education provision and includes supporting integration and sentence planning.  The strategy details agreed actions for prison education under seven strategic priorities.  Good progress has been made in all of the actions and these priorities will remain relevant in the coming years. <\/p><p> In the three years, 2019 to 2021, more than &euro;3.7 million has been spent by the IPS on supporting the prison education services.  During this period, the use of technology to support the delivery of prisoner services including the delivery of education was increased due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the IPS continues to work with the ETBs to make greater use of in-cell learning opportunities, remote teaching and education delivered via our prison TV channel.  Balancing the demands for digital literacy among prisoners with security constraints is also another key challenge for the service and an area we hope to address in the coming years.  Embracing technology and providing a blended approach to learning increases the ability of teachers to extend education provision to students, especially to those on restricted prison regimes or confined to cells due to Covid-19 measures.  Innovation and embracing technology will form a central part of the next Irish Prison Service strategic plan to be published next year. <\/p><p> Greater linkages between the work and training area in the prisons and the prison schools are being encouraged and there have been a number of good examples of this collaboration in recent years including barista training, Football Association of Ireland coaching certificates and more recently a pop-up restaurant in Cork prison in collaboration with the Munster Technological University.  In the past year the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science met with representatives of the ETBs, IPS and Solas to discuss how we can ensure that all students in custody are provided with appropriate pathways and links to further education on release, through the ETB adult guidance network throughout the country.  Work is ongoing to formalise and strengthen these arrangements, which will offer great potential for our students into the future.  Both the director of care and rehabilitation and I will be happy to take any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022070500002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Caron McCaffrey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":311,"content":"<p>On behalf of ETBI and the 16 education and training boards, ETBs, that we represent, I am pleased to make this submission to the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on the current and future education provision in Irish prisons.  ETBs are Ireland&rsquo;s leading statutory providers of education and training and are unique in providing whole-of-life education and training to all.  Collectively, the 16 boards have responsibility for 27 community national schools and 246 postprimary schools with over 110,000 students.  ETB postprimary schools are the largest provider of education through the medium of Irish with 47 schools.  ETBs deliver further education and training, FET, to over 200,000 unique learners each year across in excess of 200 FET colleges and training centres and play a central role in the delivery of apprenticeships and traineeships in partnership with employers.  The ETB sector employs more than 32,000 people and has a combined annual spend in excess of &euro;2 billion.<\/p> <p>  It is this expertise and tradition of service that ETBI brings to its work in the prison education service.<\/p><p>Prison education in Ireland is delivered through a partnership between the Irish Prison Service, Education and Training Boards Ireland and organisations such as the Arts Council, Open University and Gaisce.  A joint strategy statement details the strategic objectives for the prison education service and the high-level actions to be undertaken to deliver on the agreed objectives through the 2019-22 period.  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science provides, through Solas, an allocation of 220 whole-time equivalent teachers to the ETB education centres across the country.  The aim of the prison education service is to deliver a quality-assured, broad and flexible programme of education that helps people in custody cope with their sentence, achieve personal development, prepare for life after release and establish an appetite and capacity for life-long learning.  The service seeks to deliver relevant programmes that cater for a wide variety of needs, ensure broad access and prioritise those with basic education needs.<\/p><p> Historically, many of the learners attending education centres in Irish prisons have suffered extreme levels of social, economic and educational disadvantage.  In a sociological profile of Mountjoy prisoners in 1997, Paul O&rsquo;Mahony of Trinity College found that 80% of the prisoners in his study had left school before the age of 16 years.  In the prison adult literacy survey carried out in 2003, Kett and Morgan reported that, within the general population, approximately 25% of people scored at level 1 or below, whereas within the Irish prison population 52% of respondents scored at that level.  More recently, the Irish Penal Reform Trust has drawn our attention to research that suggests the prevalence of people in prison with severe mental illness is four times that of the general population, while an estimated one in two prisoners presents with substance misuse or dependence issues.  Anecdotally, there is evidence that many of the prison population report having experienced several adverse childhood experiences.  For these reasons, a priority for our education centres is to create a warm, supportive and welcoming environment for our learners.  In recent inspections of the four City of Dublin Education and Training Board, CDETB, prison education centres carried out by the Department of Education inspectorate, it was remarked that the teaching staff enjoy a very positive relationship with their learners.  The emphasis is on building the confidence of learners who often have had negative experiences of education, characterised by feelings of failure, so that they can re-engage with the world of lifelong learning.<\/p><p> A broad and flexible curriculum is offered so that learners have the best opportunity to study subjects in which they have an interest.  In this respect, the visual arts play a central role, particularly for those who struggle with literacy issues.  They function as gateway subjects to other areas of the curriculum, as well having an immense value for learners in helping them to cope with their sentences and allowing them to reflect on issues that impact on their lives.  The approach adopted to the teaching of literacy skills is eclectic and follows an adult education model.  One-to-one classes are available, as well as peer-to-peer programmes such as Toe to Toe.  Family literacy projects such as Story Book Mums and Dads recognise that literacy can often be a generational issue within families and these projects play an important role in consolidating links between prisoners and their loved ones at home.  The key priority of our literacy strategy, however, is to ensure that literacy work is integrated into all parts of the curriculum.<\/p><p> Digital literacy is seen by the prison education service as being of vital importance if learners are to be equipped with the competencies necessary to adapt to the needs and demands of society on release, while at the same time accessing knowledge for personal development.  In common with ETB teachers, the Irish Prison Service is concerned that a digital divide will further disadvantage learners in prison education centres.  As was pointed out by Ms McCaffrey, the teaching of ICT-based skills in a custodial setting presents unique challenges to educators and prison management alike.  For this reason, there has been an increased level of collaboration between prison management and the ETB education providers to ensure solutions are arrived at that give learners access to digital education while at the same time minimising security risks.<\/p><p> While engagement with the ETB education centre can be transformative for learners in many cases, there is a need for support structures to help learners pursue progression routes post release.<\/p><p>To this end, prison education centres provide pre-release courses and guidance counsellors.  In Dublin, the Pathways Centre provides a range of supports, including counselling and peer support to scaffold learners as they negotiate the complex challenges they face as they continue their learning journey in further education colleges, at third level and other places of learning.<\/p><p> For those re-engaging with education, the prospect of undertaking courses leading to formal examinations can be daunting and off-putting and, therefore, ETB prison education centres across the country offer a range of non-accredited courses alongside courses that offer learners the opportunity to pursue accredited learning.  The State second level junior and leaving certificate courses are available but increasing numbers of people in custody require a more flexible curriculum that has multiple entry and exit points.  QQI accreditation is, therefore, widely used with assessment by portfolio compilation.<\/p><p> All prison education centres meet the quality assurance standards demanded by QQI and for many learners this is their chosen route to accredited learning.  The Open University has had a long relationship with the IPS and the ETB prison education centres.  Just two weeks ago, I attended the first Open University graduations held in a Dublin prison since the ending of lockdown, when two students were conferred with degrees in environmental science.<\/p><p> The prison population as a whole can be seen to suffer significant disadvantage across a range of indicators but there are a number of discrete groups for whom disadvantage is particularly acute.  The Traveller community is one example of this.  According to the 2016 census, 57.2% of male Travellers had only primary school education, a figure four times higher than the general population.  Only 13% of Traveller girls completed second level education; for the settled community, the figure is 69%.<\/p><p> For the past number of years, the various ETB education services have joined with the IPS and the Traveller justice initiative to help improve outcomes for members of the Traveller community.  Teachers have received training in diversity and inclusion issues.  Traveller champions have been appointed in each education centre to ensure Traveller culture is recognised within the curriculum.  In this regard, Traveller pride events have been organised in prison education centres, which celebrate the cultural contribution of the Traveller community to society.<\/p><p> As the director general has outlined, the challenges facing the prison education service include a shortage of prison staff, and it can be the most frustrating for prison management and education staff.  These are the staff who ensure learners are brought to education centres.. In an attempt to remedy this, the Irish Prison Service, together with ETB education centres, is developing a system of in-cell delivery by which educational courses are delivered to learners through the Prison TV channel.  A total of 150 video courses and accompanying activity booklets have been produced by CDETB teachers, who are at present working with prison staff to have the TV channel ready for the next academic year.<\/p><p> This is only the start of this and we are on a long road.  Ultimately, the holy grail is to have synchronous learning taking place whereby we can have live classes in cells.  This will be the new horizon for prison education over the next five to ten years.  I am really confident that with the support we are getting from the IPS, we will arrive at our destination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022070500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":314,"content":"<p>That was really interesting.  I acknowledge the work of Mr. John Lonergan, who has highlighted many of these issues over the years.  I did some work with him quite a number of years ago and he continuously spoke about the prison population.  There are really good things being done and I will speak to them in a moment but there is really a failure of the education system when we see 80% of the prison population is made up of early school leavers and those who did not see a place for themselves in an education setting.<\/p><p>That issue is beyond the scope of today's conversation but how we address it must be a consideration at the forefront of our education committee.  How do we make it so that young kids of 13, 14 and 15 do not give up and feel there is no place for them within the education system?  It is a fault of the system when we see such high numbers.  We need to make changes.<\/p><p> Studies have shown that a significant number of young people have been failed by the mental health services.  My goodness me; we need to be rescuing much earlier in people's life cycles.  We must put our heads together to ensure we do that.  I commend the work of the education and training boards, ETBs, whose openness I am very familiar with.  We need such openness at secondary school.  The openness in addressing many of these things needs to continue and to be supported.  When I see what the curriculum is made up of, I think it is no wonder that people feel there is no place for them there.  We need to look at that and examine how it serves people.  Not everybody learns the same way.  We must consider how to adjust our curriculum in a more timely way to enable learners to learn in an environment that suits them.<\/p><p> I will ask a couple of questions around those issues.  Mr. O'Connor's submission to the committee states that 4.6% of people in prison have literacy issues, which is far above the national average.  What are the challenges around assessing literacy levels?  I note that one of the actions in the strategy was to complete a literacy and numeracy audit of the prison population.  Has that been completed?  Relatedly, what progress has been made in compiling the education statistics?  Do we have any figures on enrolment in education courses after release?  Perhaps we will talk about what happens after release in a moment and first we should concentrate on getting the statistics we need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022070500002#G00200","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":316,"content":"<p>We have noticed that many people are still presenting in our centres with literacy issues.

Assessing that can be quite a challenge.  A number of years ago, before the pandemic, I made a request to repeat the 2003 adult literacy survey in respect of prisoners.  The original survey was conducted by Mark Morgan and Mary Kett.  We put out a tender for people to conduct that survey but were unsuccessful.  Covid then came along.

We are dealing with people who have either been failed by the education system or in the education system.  Education, as our colleagues said, is a good hook to get people involved in the system again, through arts and ceramics, for example.  We have had a significant number of very good success stories where long-term prisoners have got that initial hook to go back through psychology and education, and who have then gone on to do third-level courses and master's degrees, etc.  I was here with the director general of the Prison Service at the Joint Committee on Justice recently, and one of the prisoners linked into that meeting from the Loughan House open centre.

I remember reading an article by Neil Gaiman in <i>The Guardian <\/i>some years ago in which he wrote that the prison service in the US had been outsourced to private providers.  When an attempt is made to assess what the capacity needs of the prison service will be in 15 years' time, the literacy rates of ten-year-olds are examined.  There is a correlation between the literacy rates of ten-year-olds in any given jurisdiction and the need that will emerge 15 years later for prison places.<\/p><p>The work the witnesses do is crucial.  What happens in the Prison Service reflects wider society, and the witnesses are trying to grapple with that.  As has been said, we have issues in respect of educational disadvantage that are not the fault of those in the Prison Service; its members are just trying to deal with them.  Having such a number of people in the prison system with poor rates of educational attainment tells me two things.  One is that some people have been forced down the road of crime by poverty.  The other is that middle-class people who commit crimes do not end up in prison.  It is important to say there is inequality there as well.<\/p><p>I am interested in the literacy perspective and the comments on the need for in-cell tuition.In the Prison Service, there is obviously a need to balance the security needs of the prison with the digital needs of education.  In wider society we have a functional illiteracy rate of about 17.9%, which means one in six adults is functionally illiterate.  While people in that situation may be able to get through their day and hide their literacy levels, for example, by pretending they cannot see something because they forgot their glasses or whatever, when it comes to filling out forms or engaging properly in Irish society, people who are functionally illiterate will struggle.  Equally, if the rate of functional illiteracy is 17.9% in wider society, I can only assume it is much higher among the prison population.  Surely it is fundamental to identify what that level is to enable us to deal with these literacy and numeracy issues.  Do the witnesses find that there is a need for more enjoyable hooks to act as a gateway to get people to address their numeracy and literacy needs?  Learning to read is not fun.  Addressing literacy deficiencies is not going to be fun.  Art, for example, is going to be more enjoyable, as are activities such as sport and drama.<\/p><p>On literacy rates, how can we get an assessment of what the needs are in this regard?  It was mentioned that literacy permeates the curriculum.  How far are we from in-cell tuition?  People in prison are dealing with a level of trauma and humiliation, thinking about what is going to happen to them after their sentences have been served and wondering how society is going to view them.  There may be a sense of pointlessness in this respect.  People might think they are always going to be tarred with the taint of the time they spent inside prison.  How is it possible to break through those types of barriers?  <\/p><p>I suggest to the Chair that it might be a good use of members' time to visit a prison, with the required co-operation, and observe at first-hand what is being done there.<\/p><p>Education is a great liberator.  It changes lives.  It is the only thing that has been proved to break people out of poverty.  Surely at the most intense level of need is when the resources and the imagination of the State needs to be invested so that it can be the great liberator, not just at the walls of the prison but also about the walls of the mind as well.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022070500002#J00300","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I will take the question on in-cell learning and where it came from.

As Mr. O'Connor mentioned there are 150 courses that can be delivered through the television channel with an accompanying booklet.  We are working very hard over the summer months to get that up and running.  It is not to replace the work that happens in our school but to augment it.<\/p> <p>  There are also harder-to-reach populations.  I always say that 45% of people come to school, they have taken that step, have been hooked in and are engaging in education.  We would like to get to the other 55% of the population.  By the television channel the reach of the school becomes broader.  We can open education up to even more people within the prison.  It is the route out of poverty for many people, as the Deputy said.  It gives people a great chance of employment when they leave prison.  From a higher education perspective we have also been successful in recent years with working with some third level institutions.  Munster Technological University, UCC and Maynooth University have been to the forefront of working with us and the ETBs to allow people in custody who are engaging in education to see a pathway for themselves into third level education.  In many of those cases lecturers and students from those institutions are coming into our prisons and are having classes co-delivered with people in the education units.  That is also really transformative, allowing people in custody to see that actually third level education is a pathway for them to take.<\/p><p>It involves a great deal of work to make the transition from custody into third level education more seamless.  I might have mentioned the pop-up restaurant we had in Cork Prison recently.  That was extremely successful.  That was a course specifically developed by Munster Technology University to be delivered to people in the school in Cork.  Some of those participants have since left prison and they went straight into employment.  Much more can be done to access third level education and employment opportunities.  There is a particular focus in Cork on linking students in with employers and not only third level education opportunities on release.

When the pandemic arose, it got us all thinking that this was a new situation and we had to respond to it.  The word people use these days is \"pivot\".  The prison teachers did so magnificently.  In Dublin we enlisted the support of the curriculum development unit from the City of Dublin Education and Training Board, which provided the most wonderful range of courses in technology such that our teachers are now playing a leading role in Dublin city in the development of technology enhanced learning, TEL.  They have done that in a short period of two years.  They put a great deal of effort into retaining to deliver these apps.  We hope to expand the demands on the Irish Prison Service over the next five years to become leaders in Europe in the way we deliver that.  We are engaged in conversations with other jurisdictions on the way they approach the delivery of in-cell learning.  The technology exists for us to do this.  It is a question of us having the will and resources to do it but there is no question that we can do it.<\/p> <p>  I take on board the director general&rsquo;s point that it will never be a substitute for face-to-face learning.  There is something about two or three people together in a room communicating.  It makes it a human experience.  It is the human transaction that goes on in education that keeps people in education.  Many people go to education for social reasons.  If one goes into a prison education centre, one will often see students and teachers having a cup of tea at the end of class.  That is as essential a part of their learning as anything they study in books or course material.<\/p> <p>  Although there are many challenges, there is space to have hope for all those people who are coming into our prisons because we see the transformation that takes place in individuals.  Every teacher in a prison will be able to tell a story of a student who came in not being able to read and write and going on to achieve academically at a very high level.  It is not the norm, and I do not want to mislead the Deputy on that, but it is an example of what can happen with the correct policies, approaches and resourcing of education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022070500002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I am pretty sure we are going to get hammered in this match today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022070500002#L00300","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":332,"content":"<p>If only I was playing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022070500002#L00400","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":333,"content":"<p>So I believe.

The job of education is to provide the opportunities for people to realise that opportunity of making changes in their lives but we cannot do that as educationalists only.  There are a myriad of other supports that are required to help people adjust when they get out of prison.  That is why the Pathways Centre in Dublin has played an enormous role in helping students realise their potential post release as they attend further education colleges, third level colleges and other places of learning.<br\/><br\/>It is remarkable and wondrous to see somebody who one knew in the early part of a sentence and maybe an officer has come forward to say this person could do well on one of these courses and he or she just needs a little guidance.  They come up to us and after a very short period of time, they get imbued with the enthusiasm that is always part of the adult learning experience.  They achieve wonderful things.<br\/><br\/>At our presentations each term, it is incredible to see the amount of affirmation given by the rest of the prison population to the students who have achieved something academically.  I feel as happy and as joyous about somebody achieving a level 2 in QQI as I do about somebody getting an Open University degree.  The level 2 qualification is the bread and butter of the adult educator in that sense because those people have come from a place where they were not part of the adult education story and now they are part of it.  For those students who do not take any examinations, success is sometimes measured in the fact that they get out of bed, are not depressed and take part in an educational class.  They interact with other prisoners and talk about the kinds of things people outside can take for granted, such as the arts, culture and a range of other subjects they would never be introduced to otherwise.<br\/><br\/>On one occasion, the Abbey Theatre gave a performance of <i>The Risen People<\/i>in Wheatfield Prison.  I think it was ten years ago.  One of the prisoners in the audience was interviewed after the performance and appeared on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot;.  The prisoner was asked how he responded to the play and whether he enjoyed it.  He said it was the first time he had ever been to a play and that he found it engrossing.  It was fantastic.  If we are talking about measuring the success of education, we have to take more into account than examination success.

For many of the men and women, it is the first time they have ever had a positive achievement.  We invited families in to celebrate those successes pre-Covid and we hope to do so again soon.  The Gaisce programme, which is active in our schools, is all about giving people that sense of self-belief and self-worth and that there is a different pathway for them to take.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned, all of the services within our prisons are aimed at reducing the issues that gave rise to the offending.  In some cases, it is low levels of educational attainment.  In many cases, there are addiction issues.  Approximately 70% of our population have addiction issues.  A great deal of work goes on in trying to help people address their addiction issues so that they can take part in education.  Mental illness and mental health issues are very significant in the prison population.  We have an excellent psychology service.  A holistic approach is taken to the people in our care to address all of the underlying issues that gave rise to their offending.  As people are on that journey of addressing those issues, they blossom in our schools and go on to achieve great successes.<\/p><p>As Mr. O'Connor said, accreditation is one measure.  We have been having this conversation with the Department of Education inspectorate.  In prison schools, the class is made up of the most complex people with the most complex needs in society.  Measuring against educational attainment or certificates is not necessarily the measure that should be used.  As Mr. O'Connor said, it is much broader and richer.  The one point I would make is that many people who come to our prisons come for very short sentences.  This can be difficult for the education centre, our psychology services and our healthcare services as they need a sufficient period to help people address the issues that gave rise to their offending.  When people come for three, four, five or six months it can be quite difficult.

In Cork we have the Dillon's Cross Project, an outreach project for female relatives of people in prison.  It has been running for the past 27 years.  While people in prison are given the opportunity to engage in education, imprisonment does not often occur in a vacuum but is often compounded by experience of disadvantage.  We would like to give the families the opportunity to engage in education and receive the supports and services they need.  This is not just educational, although that is a key element of what we do.  It is also about the social and emotional support we provide to our students.  It is that cup of tea in the morning when people who have a family member in prison come in and are able to have a conversation with people who are in the same situation as them in a non-judgmental way.<\/p> <p>  In the Dillon's Cross Project we offer participants the opportunity to engage in phase 1 and phase 2, where they participate in full QQI level 3 awards as well as other life skill courses such as the Red Cross, food and nutrition courses.

This has been running really successfully and we have had many successes out of it.  We also have students who have progressed to further education and employment.  We have strong links with the further education colleges and the ETB.  One student who did a full colouring skills award in the Dillon's Cross Project is now doing a level 5 qualification and is in full-time employment.  This has a knock-on effect on the whole community and the whole family.  These women become positive role models for their children.  They get that shared experience of education with their children as well, where they and their children are engaging in education and the partner in prison is engaging in education as well.  It is really breaking that barrier and helping them to navigate educational pathways, which is crucial.  For a lot of people, the education system can be a very daunting experience, particularly for parents who did not have a positive experience of education themselves.

It would be hard to see it as being a prison when one visits it, yet some of the highest security prisoners in Norway are housed there.  It has the most remarkably humane facilities.  We do not have the resources or the oil dollars of the Norwegians, but we try to compensate for that with how we treat people.  I have noticed a significant improvement over the years I have spent working at prisons.

There is certainly commitment from our perspective.  The point about school officers is good.  I visit our schools often.  Where there is a good, active school officer who sees himself or herself as part of the prison team, the prison works seamlessly, because that person will go into the prison to find somebody who should be in class.<\/p><p>It is helpful in making sure people are at school on time, that if they are missing they are followed up and that people do not just drop out of the prison education system.<\/p><p> We have school officers in the majority of our prisons, with the exception of Limerick Prison.

Many of those who do reoffend are stuck in a cycle where they do not have access to employment on release and they still have addiction issues.  It is about taking a holistic approach to addressing people's needs in prison and not only education.  With regard to what success looks like, from the Prison Service's perspective, and I know our colleagues in education will agree, what we need is society to give people a second chance when they come out of custody and for people not to be labelled because of their conviction.  Many people who invest time and energy in developing themselves in custody come out very different people.  We have an employment and social enterprise strategy.

The IPEA was founded in 2004.  It is a voluntary organisation which has consisted of people from various backgrounds, including prison teachers and researchers and others.  Membership is open to all who are interested in prison education.  We receive financial and practical support for our activities from the Irish Prison Service and the education and training boards.<\/p> <p>  The IPEA promotes the view that education in prison is a moral right that meets a basic human need.  Within this perspective, personal development is considered to be an aim, a process and a result of prison education.  Education in prison has the power to transform prisoners' lives by enabling them to understand, critique and question their previously unquestioned perceptions, assumptions and world view.  Prison education can facilitate the prisoners successful re-entry into society by cultivating the combination of knowledge, skills, values and motivation necessary for active citizenship.<\/p><p>The aims of the association are: to act as a recognised branch of the European Prison Education Association, EPEA; to promote education in prison according to the recommendations of the Committee of Ministers to the member states of the Council of Europe; to promote education in Irish prisons as set out in the joint Irish Prison Service-Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI, Prison Education Strategy 2019-2022; to support and assist the professional development of persons involved in education in prison; to act as an advocate on behalf of education in Irish prisons; and to support penal reform.<\/p><p> The activities of the IPEA include annual conferences, memorial lectures, newsletters and networking events, both online and in person when possible.  We promote the work of support agencies outside the prison such as the Bedford Row Family Project in Limerick, the Childhood Development Initiative in Tallaght and the Dillon&rsquo;s Cross Project in Cork.  As the Irish branch of the EPEA, we have hosted its biannual conference on several occasions, most recently in the Technical University, TU, Dublin in 2019.  The IPEA supports the work of teachers working in prison education centres across the county.  Prison education teachers are innovative, constantly flexible and always client-centred, reflecting the ethos of their centres.<\/p><p> In terms of future developments in prison education, the IPEA would like to see more work and discussion around the area of digital literacy.  There is a significant potential to develop and grow online learning in prisons if learners are given access to personal learning devices, with restricted access, in their cells.  Thus, the promotion of digital literacy is fundamental to our efforts in the coming years.  The recently issued Adult Literacy for Life strategy outlined a vision in which we have &ldquo;An Ireland where every adult has the necessary literacy, numeracy and digital literacy to fully engage in society and realise their potential.&rdquo;  The Council of Europe prison education rules state \"the education of prisoners must, in its philosophy, methods and content, be brought as close as possible to the best adult education in society outside\", as our learners in prison are entitled to the same educational opportunities as adults returning to education in the community.  Thus, it is a basic right that our learners should be provided with the opportunities to learn about and to develop their digital literacy skills, notwithstanding appreciated Irish Prison Service IT security concerns.  During the Covid-19 lockdown, several blended learning courses were developed by City of Dublin Education and Training Board, CDETB, prison education teachers and teachers in centres across the country.  Ideally these courses could be made available to students not just via a prison TV channel, as is currently planned, but also on in-cell devices.  We look forward to evolving technologies and prison education practices which will open the door to developing further innovative study programmes for prisoners in Ireland.<\/p><p> The development of progression pathways for our students upon release is another area that the IPEA believes is of great importance.  We welcome the work of initiatives such as the Mountjoy Prison Maynooth University partnership, MJMU.  The recently launched Kickstart scholarship scheme, which will provide funding opportunities for people with prison experience to attend university, is a particularly welcome development.  The Unlocking Potential project will not only provide support to students progressing to university studies, but will also guide third level institutions in the development of fair admissions policies, which are vital in ensuring that applicants with prison experience will be treated fairly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022070500002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Connell.

One of the things that came up in our previous session on this subject was the quality of the existing physical spaces and infrastructure.  On the other hand, Cork is a prison that has had a modern rebuild.  I have not seen this myself, but it has been said that the facilities there are of good quality, whereas Mountjoy might be in a less positive situation.  Do many of the prisons require significant investment in respect of their education units and physical infrastructure?  Aside from those aspects, is there also a need for significant investment in resources, whether in books, materials, technology or whatever?  Is there a significant shortfall in this area?<\/p><p>To ensure these programmes are successful there must be certainty that it will be possible to recruit people of sufficient skill, expertise and experience.  Are there challenges in this regard or is there a reasonably healthy stream of recruitment and retention at present?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022070500002#V00300","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I will take this question first.  There are certainly recruitment challenges, but this is not just a problem in the prison education area but right across the whole education sector.  There is a serious shortage of teachers in some subjects, such as in home economics, mathematics and Irish, in certain cases.  Therefore, it is a challenge to be able to provide education in every subject area.  Our teachers are incredibly flexible and innovative and will often turn their hands to virtually any subject.  The reality, certainly in the prisons where I am based, is that most learning happens at Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, levels 2 and 3.  Most of our focus is on the more modular learning QQI awards.  Frequently, because this is adult basic education, teachers will turn their hands to virtually any subject to ensure it is facilitated.  It becomes more challenging if there is a need to facilitate a leaving certificate maths class and there is no maths teacher available.  There are recruitment challenges then, but this is an issue across the entire education sector.  There are many reasons for this.  In Dublin, the cost of living is certainly a significant factor in attracting teachers to employment in this area.<\/p> <p>  Opportunities could be presented by digital learning.  Sweden, for example, has a fantastic e-learning programme.  My understanding is that a teacher is based in a computer classroom in a prison.  The learners are all online but they are taking classes with a teacher in another prison somewhere else in Sweden.  The teacher co-ordinating the room could be a geography teacher but the students might be online with a maths teacher from a prison elsewhere in the country.  It is a fantastic way of delivering classes.  It would not replace face-to-face learning, but it would complement it.  It would also help to address the shortage of staff in certain areas in prison education centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022070500002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":386,"content":"<p>What about the physical infrastructure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022070500002#W00300","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":387,"content":"<p>On the physical environment, and again I am not familiar with every prison, but the physical environment in the older prisons is not ideal.  I can speak for the situation in Mountjoy Prison, where classroom space is at a premium.  It is a difficult challenge for the head teachers to manage timetabling classes in rooms big enough to facilitate them.  In the earlier session, it was mentioned that the music classrooms are tiny and can barely accommodate one or two people.  Therefore, improvements are needed in the physical infrastructure we are working in.  That said, the teachers do wonderful things in their classrooms to make them as welcoming a learning environment as possible.  While the physical spaces are small, there is a great sense of learning in the classrooms because of the way the teachers have decorated and presented them.<\/p> <p>  Turning to resources and learning materials, we are well provided with those in respect of books and those types of materials.  Regarding technological resources, our education centres in Dublin have had some fantastic widescreen TVs installed in the classrooms and those are linked with our computer systems.  It allows us to broaden the way we provide education.  One thing prison education teachers have been training in as part of continuous professional development, CPD, is universal design for learning, UDL.  Core to that approach is the ability to be able to provide learning materials in many ways.  In that regard, then, we are well resourced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022070500002#W00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":388,"content":"<p>It occurs to me that prison is a very structured environment.<\/p><p>There may potentially be a case of a prisoner who might have for the first time taken on education in a determined way.

It is a challenge because of a multitude of other factors that exist outside of education.  Addiction is a major challenge, as is homelessness.  I work as a guidance counsellor.  I have often asked where person was going to be based when they were due to be released.  Initially, the motivating factor for that was to establish where a person might be living to facilitate him or her to do a course.  Now, when I am asking it is primarily to ascertain whether he or she has accommodation.  Frequently, the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  There are challenges, as I said, in pursuing education upon release.  They mainly arise outside the actual education sphere.  We have pre-release programmes.  We carry out individual pre-release planning with students.  This might start 12 months or more before they are released.  Frequently, people have an ambition to take on a level 4, level 5 or level 6 course.  They need to be working away at the earlier levels with us in the prison.  We always have an education plan for all our students.  Part of that would involve post-release planning and linking them in.  It is not just a matter of making applications, but also of linking them in with other colleges they might wish to attend.<\/p> <p>  We do a great deal of work with the Pathways Centre.  Even if everything is in place, the process of being released back into the community is a very challenging and difficult one to manage for our students.  This is especially the case if they have been in prison for a long time.  There needs to be a transition programme for them.  The Pathways Centre is fantastic at providing that.  We also link them in with many other agencies, such as Jobcare and Care After Prison, which provide practical supports that are needed before education can even be considered.  For example, trying to open a bank account is a major challenge if you do not have photo identification.  If you have been in prison for a number of years, you do not have a driver&rsquo;s licence and you do not have a passport.  Some students with whom I have worked with have never had either.  We link them in with services such as Care After Prison, which physically go into the banks with them and help them to work out the very practical issues which need to be in place before somebody can really engage in continuing with their education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022070500002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Crowe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022070500002#X00300","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":392,"content":"<p>At the outset, I am delighted to be on this committee.

To date, there has been no formal, structured analysis of the levels of learning difficulty.  It is all anecdotal.  In the UK there has been a more structured analysis of this aspect of the matter.  There are two kinds of responses, concerning people who have been assessed formally and people with self-declared learning difficulties.  In our experience as teachers, we meet people in both categories.  We meet people who are aware that they were diagnosed as children with an issue, such as dyslexia.  There are also people who feel that they could never learn in school and could never engage with the process, but they always wondered if something was there.  This is particularly the case for older people.

If somebody has a difficulty or a challenge or has had negative learning experiences, it is important to have time with them.  Sometimes they can be quite strong in their perceptions of what education should be.  Therefore, as teachers we are led by the students.  I teach maths.

Due to protection arrangements, we have different landings so we cannot provide a full week of classes to students in those situations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022070500002#Z00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":409,"content":"<p>Can Ms Byrne outline some of the actions from the strategy that have yet to be delivered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022070500002#Z00600","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":410,"content":"<p>That is a big question.

One area where we have a major impact is that we help people cope with imprisonment.  Education is a safe space.  It is a positive place.  We hear all the time that people did not know this and that they only came to school because they wanted to get out of the yard or stay away from people.  When they come to school, they find themselves in a new space that they never experienced before.  It is quiet and bright.  There is art on the walls and there are books available.  People talk to you differently and some people do not wear uniforms.  For the morning they are in school,, prisoners feel that they are free and are not in prison and can cope with the day.  They also do subjects that challenge their brain.  We do creative arts, general subjects, exams, meditation, mindfulness and well-being classes, all of which are part of the junior cycle curriculum and would be part of any education programme.  That is a major area.<\/p> <p>  Developing an appetite for lifelong learning is hugely important and, as Ms O'Connell said earlier, we are very aware of that.  A journey of a thousand miles starts with one step.  When we meet, greet and walk together with prisoners, we tell them that we can help them to address this.  People come to school for all kinds of reasons.  This may be the first time they have had the opportunity to take the lead in their learning.  Even if we have this conversation with them and they are moved from our prison or released the next day, that is part of developing an interest in lifelong learning because they have taken a step in that direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022070500002#Z00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Mr. Stephen O'Connor mentioned the long relationship with Open University and it is great to hear that two people have graduated in environmental sciences.

My colleague, Ms Kelly-Desmond, and I will give the opening statement together.  Home for Good would like to extend our thanks to the Committee for the invitation to present on the right to housing and particularly the ongoing engagement of committee members and the committee as a whole on this important topic.  As the committee is aware Home for Good is a coalition of organisations and individuals who believe that constitutional change is needed as an essential underpinning for any programme to tackle our housing and homelessness crisis.  Many of our members are advocates from front-line organisations and through that work, we understand how important a right to housing is for those experiencing housing exclusion, homelessness and for those living in inadequate, unsafe, insecure or overcrowded accommodation.  More generally, as citizens we understand the importance of a home as the fundamental social and economic infrastructure of our society.  The meaning of home became abundantly clear during the Covid-19 pandemic, which starkly demonstrated the importance of an adequate home to keep ourselves and our families safe.  We advocated for a redoubling of efforts to assist those in housing distress during and subsequent to the pandemic.  We are more certain than ever of the need to amend our Constitution to ensure that the necessary policies can be implemented to end the housing and homelessness crisis in Ireland.  The last number of months have seen an unwinding of Covid-19 restrictions in the area of housing, as many areas of life return to some version of normal.  What we have seen in housing, however, is a return to crisis.<\/p><p>Homelessness in the past six months has increased by 16% and we now have more than 10,000 people living in emergency homeless accommodation, including more than 3,000 children.  The cost of housing and rent has continued to grow and supply has constricted further.  In the first three months of this year, 1,132 notices to quit have been issued, the highest number since data collection started in 2019.  There were 3,818 eviction notices issued since the Covid-19 ban on evictions was lifted last April.<\/p><p> The recent heightening of the housing crisis has had a number of driving factors but we firmly believe the seeds of this crisis were sown in the belief that \"a home\" is not understood as central to our social infrastructure and it is not a right for individuals and families in Ireland.  More generally, the lack of balance in our Constitution has facilitated the development of a housing system based on financial commodification to a level that now undermines the capacity of too many people to participate fully in society.<\/p><p> Home for Good has welcomed the recent support for and the developments towards a referendum on the right to housing, particularly the launch of the Housing Commission, which has included a sub-committee tasked to bring forward wording for a referendum on housing.  The Housing Commission is due to present its deliberations on a referendum on housing in the coming months.  Housing in Ireland is truly in a state of crisis at all levels and a referendum on the right to housing cannot be delayed.  We hope that the recommendations from this upcoming report lead to timely progress towards a positive referendum on the right to housing.<\/p><p> Home for Good wants to ensure that two key actions are taken as next steps to progress the right to housing.  There should be a referendum called as soon as is practical after the commission publishes its report.  To ensure this, we hope the commission in its report will includes a positive proposal for wording for a referendum on the right to housing.  From our perspective, this would ideally build upon the work that Home for Good has done in this area, but we of course remain open to engagement with the commission.<\/p><p> The sense of urgency for a referendum on a right to Housing is driven by the ongoing housing crisis and we cannot afford postponement.  In 2018, during his time as Taoiseach, the current T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar, declared a national homelessness and housing crisis in Ireland.  More than four years later, we have over 10,000 people living in emergency homeless accommodation, record high rental costs and an increasingly unstable housing market.<\/p><p> The next issue is why we need a referendum on the right to housing, and Ms Kelly-Desmond will speak to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Wayne Stanley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":434,"content":"<p>We have spoken for a few minutes about the level of the housing crisis and I will speak to why we feel specifically that a referendum on a right to housing is essential in addressing the crisis.<br\/><br\/>At a really basic level, the Constitution is a statement of fundamental values of the people of Ireland.  It shapes Government policy and legislation and it provides an important bedrock of protection for basic rights that transcends individual Governments or particular developments of the day.  <br\/><br\/>People experiencing ongoing housing insecurity in the turbulent market we have are failed by a gap in our Constitution as it addresses housing.  Currently, the Constitution is fundamentally imbalanced towards private property rights without any equivalent right to housing being recognised either explicitly or implicitly.  This means the starting point of Government policy and legal analysis around the regulation of land and property is very much from the perspective of a property owner&rsquo;s right.  There are restrictions in the Constitution relating to property rights with respect to the common good and in particular scenarios, it is very much a secondary perspective.  In simpler terms, the way housing is addressed under the Constitution now is very much through the lens of being a commodity and asset rather than as something essential for people in meeting their fundamental rights.<br\/><br\/>The imbalance in the Constitution has proven repeatedly to fail people in need of housing in this country perpetuating issues like the high levels of vacancy and dereliction that we see across the country.  It increases land hoarding and it has contributed to the housing crisis on many levels.  That said, including a right to housing in the Constitution will not fix the housing crisis overnight; it has an enormous potential, however, to be a catalyst for change.  It would be a profound statement by the people of Ireland through a referendum that they do not accept an endemic housing crisis as a normal or natural state of affairs.<br\/><br\/>Including a right to housing in our Constitution would place an onus on the State to develop and implement policy and practice to ensure the right to adequate housing is met and it is available to people in Ireland, now and into the future.  As political and policy actors, members of the committee have a unique understanding of the capacity for issues, no matter the importance, to fall between stools of responsibilities.  Recognising a right to housing through the Constitution would bring a very clear message to all levels of Government that a guiding principle in their actions must be the consideration of how to meet a right to housing.  In more practical terms, this means a renewed respect for the need for housing to be accessible, affordable and available to people, and to meet the different levels of need we have in society.  That may be through universal design principles for people with disabilities, housing for people who are part of our aging population or dealing with families of different sizes and constitutions.<br\/><br\/>Home for Good wishes to work closely with this committee and the Housing Commission in a process to reach wording for a constitutional amendment that could recognise this right in a meaningful and impactful way.  Ultimately, it is about bringing about a referendum that can be won to have such a right recognised.  In closing, I will read into the record the proposed amendment that Home for Good has formulated.  It would be the insertion of a new Article 43A stating:<\/p> <blockquote> \t1. The State recognises, and shall vindicate, the right of all persons to have access to adequate housing.<br \/><br \/>2. The State shall, through legislative and other measures, provide for the realisation of this right within its available resources. <\/blockquote> <p>I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife Kelly-Desmond"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":435,"content":"<p>Is that wording exactly the same as what Home for Good provided to us last year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#D00300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":436,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife Kelly-Desmond"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":437,"content":"<p>Very good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#D00500","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to give evidence this morning from London.  I apologise for not being able to attend the meeting in person.  Let me begin by giving the committee some idea of my claimed areas of expertise before speaking for a few minutes on the right to housing as it is understood in international human rights law.  I will also speak more specifically about proposals to introduce a right to housing into Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and my take on those proposals.<\/p> <p>  I lecture, teach and research comparative constitutional and human rights law at University College London.  I have also served for ten years between 2006 and 2016 as a member of the European Committee on Social Rights, the Council of Europe expert body that monitors how Ireland and other countries are complying with their obligations under the European Social Charter, including those provisions of the charter, such as Article 16 and Article 31, which protect the right to housing.  I was also vice president of the committee for four years in that period.<\/p> <p>  I will turn to the right to housing as it is understood in international human rights law.  Article 11 of the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, a key UN human rights instrument, recognises the right to housing as an integral part of the right to an adequate standard of living in general.  The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the expert UN committee in the area, has two general comments on this.  They are General Comment No. 4 and General Comment No. 7 from the 1990s, and these clarify the meaning of the concept of a right to housing.  It defines the right as an entitlement to live somewhere in security, peace, and dignity.  It treats several factors as indicative of \"adequate housing\", including legal security of tenure, availability of support services, affordability, habitability, accessibility, location and cultural adequacy.  Cultural adequacy is relevant for consideration with members of the Traveller community and others, for example.  It is emphasised that the right should be secured on a non-discriminatory basis.<\/p> <p>  When I was a member of the European Committee on Social Rights, it interpreted the equivalent provisions of the European Social Charter in similar terms, emphasising in particular the obligation on states to make steady progress towards giving effect to the right to housing; maintaining meaningful statistics on needs, resources and results; undertaking regular reviews of progress; paying regard to vulnerable individuals; and focusing on the need to ensure adequate, affordable and secure tenure.  In the committee's monitoring of the position in Ireland, conclusions of non-conformity were made as late as 2019 with respect to the lack of a supply of adequate housing for vulnerable families, especially local authority housing, and inadequate protection of Traveller families with respect to housing, including regard to eviction conditions.<\/p><p>The committee also expressed concern about the adequacy of housing supply more generally.  I have outlined the right to housing as it has been interpreted in international human rights law and as expert bodies have interpreted that right, paying particular attention to the context of Ireland.<\/p><p> Let me turn now to the issue of the potential inclusion of a right to housing in the Irish Constitution.  Various constitutions across the world include a right to housing through some provision relating to a right to housing.  Provisions either specifically focusing on the right or talking in more general terms about the social obligations of the state are quite common.  Most European countries, for example, have at least some provision in their constitution that covers the right to housing to some degree.<\/p><p> There is an interesting debate in the academic literature about the pros and cons of having a right to housing in one's constitution.  I will quickly give the committee the pros and the cons as they have emerged in the academic debate and then conclude by giving my specific personal view on these issues.<\/p><p> The major potential concerns about having a right to housing in a constitution is the fear that rights rhetoric will not necessarily translate  into effective action.  Another concern is that constitutionalising such rights could raise expectations that the State might, in practical terms, might struggle to meet even with the best of intentions.  It might also have undesirable legal consequences.  It could, for example, result in litigation beginning to distort housing priorities and other problems like that.  Those are the major concerns about having a right to housing in a constitutional instrument such as Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  <\/p><p> There are, however, various pros, some of which have already been put before the committee in this afternoon's session.  The right to housing can serve valuable political and symbolic statements, affirm the importance of such rights and can act as a prod to state action.  They can rebalance a tendency for constitutional rights to be interpreted as being all about limiting state power and protecting private property, which has been a particular problem in the context of the Irish Constitution, particularly Article 43 on property rights.<\/p><p> Having a right to housing in a constitution can also open up room for some limited judicial and legal protection of such rights, namely, through the form of reasonableness view where manifestly inadequate state action may be exposed to legal challenges in the courts.<\/p><p> Adding together all of those pros and cons, my own view is that good arguments can be made in favour of constitutionalising the right to housing even if its added value will probably be limited, incremental and catalytic, rather than radical and transformative in isolation.  Any such constitutional provision will need to be supplemented by legislation, which in legal and practical terms will do much of the heavy lifting.<\/p><p> I will conclude by noting that when I spoke at a conference in University College Dublin, UCD, last month that was organised by the Housing Commission, I recommended that the commission consider drafting a possible referendum proposal that would affirm the right to housing as a fundamental right, make it clear that the primary responsibility for securing enjoyment of this right lies in the hands of the legislative and executive branches of the State; provide that a manifest failure by these branches to take due regard of this duty can be reviewable by the courts; and require the Government to prepare regular action plans on how it is implementing the right through proposed legislation and other measures.  In my own view, such a constitutional provision would echo and reflect Ireland's international human rights obligations and secure better enjoyment of the right to housing within Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Colm O'Cinneide","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O'Cinneide.

I am delighted that this is at least the second time that this committee has met to discuss the right to housing since being established, which reflects the importance that this committee places on that right.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to granting a right to housing and, as part of the Housing for All policy, the establishment of the Housing Commission.<\/p> <p>  Like many members here, I attended the conference at UCD which was organised by the Housing Commission.  The conference helped to move the debate on and it is good that this committee has set aside time for this  discussion today.  The public consultation on a referendum on housing in Ireland is now open and invites members of the public to make a submission by Friday, 2 September.  We should all encourage the members of the public to make a submission.<\/p> <p>  Professor O'Cinneide has clearly set out the delicate balancing act required when setting people's expectations as to what can be achieved by inserting a right to housing in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  He talked about the European Social Charter and the review of previous housing initiatives.  It struck me, having read that, that it did not review the initiatives under Housing for All and I ask him to confirm that for this committee, as that would be important.  The Housing for All plan has commenced and is far from complete but it marks a very significant change in the State's approach to the delivery of housing.  It is important for this committee to understand that when Professor O'Cinneide referenced criticisms, whether those criticisms reviewed Housing for All and its commitments.<\/p> <p>  Professor O'Cinneide has said the value of having a commitment and an objective in the Constitution or Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann is largely symbolic but balanced his comment by saying that it can act as a catalyst.  I ask him to elaborate on how it has been used as a catalyst for change in other jurisdictions.<\/p> <p>  I commend Home for Good and all its members, who are in the trenches on a daily basis trying to help people who struggle with the housing crisis and emergency.  One of its delegation clearly said that \"including a right to housing in the Constitution will not fix the housing crisis\".  The delegation has recognised that changes have been made to housing policy.  What tangible good would the right bring to  the people who are in the grips of the housing crisis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#E00300","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her excellent questions.  In respect of her first question, she is right that in its 2019 conclusions, the European committee noted that Housing for All had been introduced and was being implemented.  The committee effectively reserved its decision in respect of that and asked the Irish State to keep it updated about progress.  It did not make any findings about the wider housing situation in Ireland pending information on how Housing for All has been rolled out.  The 2019 conclusions, effectively, suspend any opinion on the implementation of Housing for All and note that the strategy was introduced to engage with the housing problems in Ireland.  The committee's conclusions noted that inadequate housing for vulnerable groups and inadequate protection for Traveller families, in particular, are a long-standing problem.  The 2019 conclusions relate to earlier conclusions that had run through for most of the 2010s.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked the key question of how would a right to housing, if included in the Constitution, act as a catalyst for change.  The last thing that anyone wants is to have a constitutional dead letter, to have something nice inserted in the Constitution that just sits there but does not do much good.  My own view, which is based on research into comparative developments in this area in Europe and the wider world, is that there are two general ways in which a right to housing can act as a catalyst.<\/p><p>I will use the simple categories of \"political\" and \"legal\" to illustrate the two ways.  Politically, a right to housing can act as a focus for political change.  The symbolic statement that this right is important, that it is a constitutional priority, means that it can be invoked by political parties, NGO groups, trade unions and others to push for change, and it also acts as a focus within the legislative branches of parliament.  It is quite striking to me, for example, in studying how equivalent institutions to these work across continental Europe, that there is often a strong focus on what are known as the social-state provisions of continental European constitutions.  I refer to the provisions of the Italian state constitution or the social-state provisions of the German constitution that commit the state to advancing social progress.  Having constitutional provisions there in relation to something like the right to housing can act as the focus for legislative review and scrutiny, which then in turn can feed down through the state processes in general.<\/p><p> The second aspect is legal.  Having a right to housing means that the courts can take it into account when, for example, interpreting property rights.  It can help to rebalance or compensate for any excessive focus on private property rights that might hamper a more reasonable statewide housing strategy.  It can also empower the courts to deal with manifest failures by the state of blatantly inadequate housing such as clear manifest failure by local authorities to do the job they should be doing in respect of housing or clear failure by Departments to take the action they should be taking.  In other words, a right to housing can have catalytic effects in both the political and legal spheres.  It is not just a matter of law and lawyers.  In fact, in many ways, if it all works according to plan, its primary effect may actually be in the sphere of politics, administration and policy.  That would be a good thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Colm O'Cinneide","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O'Cinneide.

Senator Fitzpatrick is correct: this is the second hearing in this D&aacute;il but in fact we have been discussing the matter for six years, since 2016.  The special D&aacute;il Committee on Housing and Homelessness had a very significant discussion of these issues.  This is the third programme for Government that has a reference to a referendum on housing or the right to housing.  Hopefully, it will be third time lucky this time round.<\/p> <p>  I will make a couple of comments and then ask some questions.  I have always been of the view that our Constitution is not as restrictive as some people claim, in particular those politicians who hide behind the Constitution as an excuse not to do things.  Therefore, it is important to put on record that there is more latitude within the Constitution to take action with respect to property rights to meet housing need than some people believe.  Rachel Kenny, among others, has publicly made that point very eloquently.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, I am strongly in favour of holding the referendum.  The sooner it comes the better.  If we have a cross-party Government and Opposition campaign supported by civil society, that is the best outcome for all of us.  We are all eagerly awaiting the recommendations of the Housing Commission.  Like Senator Fitzpatrick, I too would encourage people to log on to its website and to get involved in the public consultation because that is very important.<\/p> <p>  Professor O'Cinneide has given the most eloquent case for the value of it.  It is important that as a committee and as politicians we do not overstate it.  I remember when the Mercy Law Resource Centre, which has done considerable research work on this, came before the committee many years ago, one of the phrases that it used that stuck with me was if we get the referendum and we secure the right to housing in the Constitution, we are not going to have a queue of people around the Custom House the following day looking for their keys to a free home.  That is not what it means.  We do need to say that because some of the people who do not like the idea will misrepresent it as that.  The phrase the centre went on to use was about placing an obligation in the Constitution on governments to progressively vindicate and realise that right, in particular for those with the greatest level of housing need, into the future.  That is the way we need to think about it.<\/p> <p>  Likewise, it is only one of many tools, and it may not even be the most important, but given the declining housing situation for large numbers of people, the more tools that we have in the toolbox the better.  I reiterate our support for the Home for Good wording.  If the Housing Commission comes out and strengthens the wording on the basis of even more legal advice, and we have a single recommendation from the commission, that is the best possible opportunity for all of us.  Then it is a question of setting the date and running the campaign.<\/p> <p>  It would also be important to have the conversation.  Marriage equality, while primarily about advancing the rights to marriage equality for the LGBTQI communities, also had the profound effect of an important national conversation.  We urgently need that conversation about housing and what housing and home means to us as a society, whether it is an investment category and a financial asset or a public good.  If it is conducted in the right way, the referendum debate in and of itself, could be hugely beneficial to us as a society.<\/p> <p>  My question, which leads on from Senator Fitzpatrick's, is to go back to Home for Good in the first instance and continue those practical examples of the benefits and merits.  Perhaps one of the questions the witnesses could address, which Professor O'Cinneide did not mention in his list of negatives but was often used during the convention on socioeconomic rights back in 2014, is that somehow putting the right in the Constitution takes away from the Oireachtas our right to decide the best way to vindicate that right.  I ask the witnesses to respond to that.<\/p> <p>  If I could push Professor O'Cinneide further, he very neutrally set out the pros and cons but he came out in favour of the side of an appropriately worded amendment.  Could he perhaps give us a little bit more critique of the weaknesses of the negative arguments, or the arguments against it, either in his own opinion or in terms of the academic literature?  I would welcome a little more detail on how those arguments are critiqued by advocates of a constitutional right to housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#F00500","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":448,"content":"<p>The second question to us, which was the argument that it takes away from the political system, is very important so I might hand over to Ms Kelly-Desmond to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Wayne Stanley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":449,"content":"<p>Something that is important to bear in mind about the right to housing is that while it is a new right for us to recognise in the Constitution, it still fits into an existing constitutional framework, which has a very long history in the State.  We have a very strong and robust court system with a lot of respect for the separation of powers.  There is no reason why the right to housing would be different to any other right, whether socioeconomic or otherwise, in terms of the courts overstepping their role.  When we look at the way the courts have approached the right to education in this country, which is the most comparable right we currently have, they have very much come at it from the perspective of a principle-based approach to pointing out where the State is failing at a high level and leaving it back to the appropriate organs of the State to address how we achieve that right on a practical level.  The right to housing should be framed in such a way that it is about the State creating the conditions for the right to be vindicated, not about reframing it as a legal issue.  It would very much be the position of Home for Good that it is not a substantial concern and that there is nothing to suggest there would be court overreach.  That would be going against the history that we have of how the courts have dealt with constitutional issues up to now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife Kelly-Desmond"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I always enjoy such interaction because when I was a law student and beginning my academic career, I used to be a sceptic about socioeconomic rights and consitutionalising them, so I am a convert, having thought and read a lot about it.<\/p><p>Consequently, I am always happy to share my journey with the committee.  The major weaknesses of the negative arguments of not constitutionalising this come back to the fact that constitutions are important documents.  They are supposed to steer the exercises of State power by all organs of the State.  They are supposed to ensure that we the people provide a guidance framework for the organs of the State to exercise their powers.  Therefore, what is in the Constitution is supposed to be important, because we have signed up to it and constitutionally endorsed it.  If the Constitution contains a right to housing, it sends a significant signal.  If the Constitution does not have such a reference, it is lacking that messaging.  I know that may sound slightly intangible but this then becomes an important factor for courts and other bodies dealing with complicated issues about housing policy, questions of priorities and the scope of legal powers.  If courts have to ask whether it is reasonable for the State to be taking this action to advance housing policy, their job becomes easier if the Constitution states something about the right to housing.  The job of Departments becomes easier if a Minister can point to a right to housing in the Constitution.  The jobs of committees, such as this, becomes easier if the Minister can be called in and asked what he is doing to implement a constitutional article on the right to housing.  It becomes more crystalised and clearer.  The absence of that, which is what the <i>status quo<\/i>does not have, is a problem.  The major concern with leaving things as they are, in not having a right to housing, is precisely the fact that it leaves a void in the Constitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Colm O'Cinneide","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives from Home for Good and Professor O'Cinneide for being with us.  As Senator Fitzpatrick said, it is timely to have this discussion now because the Housing Commission recently launched its public consultation process seeking the views of the public on this issue.  It runs throughout the summer until 2 September and it is important that people engage with that process.  I urge the witnesses to contact all stakeholders they deal with on a regular basis, as we all will do, to encourage them to have their say.  The consultation process will build on the housing conference that was about a housing referendum, which was held in May.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, a referendum on a right to housing is a commitment of the Government and is contained in the programme for Government.  I am certain the referendum will happen.  By the Housing Commission setting the wording of a referendum at such a high priority shows the Government's commitment to the cause and its determination to follow through on it.<\/p> <p>  I previously worked on the wording of the children's referendum.  I know how challenging, frustratingly slow and lengthy is the process of getting constitutional wording correct.  It needs to be legalistic, watertight and understandable, that is, something people can communicate about freely.  It will spark a national debate and rightly so.  It will shape democratic decisions around one of the most - if not the most - important publications we have; Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  We all know that housing affects everyone and we do cross-party work in this committee because we appreciate that.  Housing affects those who own their home and those who do not, those who rent homes to others and those who have no home whatsoever.  That is why we need to make sure we get this right.<\/p> <p>  Home for Good has presented the committee with a wording twice.  What feedback, if any, did the group receive from the Attorney General, the Minister, the Housing Commission or both on the proposed wording?  Professor O'Cinneide outlined some concerns about this.  I also have a concern, which others have raised, in that people may see this as some sort of a silver bullet that will solve the housing crisis overnight.  We know it will not.  What will solve the housing crisis is getting the balance between supply and demand right and, when that is done, making sure there is affordability in the market for everyone.  Housing for All is setting us on the path to achieve this.<\/p> <p>  Professor O'Cinneide said that by not having this reference, it would leave a void in the Constitution, which is interesting.  I agree with him that having such a reference in the Constitution would provide a focus for political change and legislative reform, as well as being a symbolic statement.  What would this right mean to people, landlords, homeowners, renters and those who are homeless on a practical level?  How should we communicate this to people so that they fully understand it?  Mr. Stanley may wish to contribute to this.  I know he said earlier that he had practical examples, which I would love to hear, because they will help to shape the debate and make sure the right messages are out there and that the right result is had by this referendum.

Hopefully it will receive a good and wide hearing and response.<\/p> <p>  By way of a practical example, I referenced research that looked at countries with similar commitments in responding to homeless and housing-led responses to homelessness, which were Scotland and Ireland.  In Scotland, the language used and the legal commitment was around a right to housing and in Ireland, the commitment was constructed in a way that was closer to a charity model of providing services to people who were in need.  The researcher found, in talking to people who were recipients of those service, that the people in Scotland who recognised it as a right, had a sense of ownership and engagement with service providers and local authorities.  They felt it was their right and they wanted to know how it was going to be vindicated whereas in the Irish context, people were very grateful for the services they got.  While a local authority or agency might appreciate an appreciative customer, the person who feels that it is his or her right, is someone you work with to vindicate that right.  That in a broader citizenship context is the way we should go.<\/p> <p>  All of us in this room and most of the politicians I have engaged with on this committee are working very hard to try to progress housing on the ground and the changes we can make.

We are not saying that all of them included things that Home for Good would support or anything like it, but it is to point out they were rejected on the basis of being unconstitutional in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavin Elliott"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":465,"content":"<p>The only additional point I will make is it is worthwhile considering where we would be now, if we had that constitutional right in place from 2008 to 2011.  Some decisions were made that people recognised at the time were controversial.  There was an insertion into the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, legislation around there being a public good element to it that, in my view, was never really progressed.  Certainly, when we read the presentations of NAMA to this committee, its overarching ambition was to ensure that it achieved a profit that was returned to the State.  The public good of housing was never a part of its thinking in any truly substantive way.  If we had a constitutional right to housing, the thinking on that would have been different or, at least, the potential for thinking on it would have been greatly increased.  That goes back to the fact this will not be a silver bullet that will drive things, but it will change the culture.  In times of crisis, and leading up to times of crisis, that will be very important to the way we think about housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Wayne Stanley"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I have other questions, but I see Professor O'Cinneide nodding in agreement with what Mr. Stanley said.

There is a lingering legacy of a few questionable Supreme Court decisions from the 1980s that hang like a miasma over this area and they can be exaggerated.  That is true.  I also think that what often matters when it comes to legal constitutional analysis is risk and uncertainty rather than the rights and wrongs of a specific legal question.  What happens, and what has happened in Ireland for quite some time, is a general air of uncertainty prevails about the freedom of State action in the housing sphere, including the State's capacity to regulate and act.  That uncertainty can have a paralysing effect, often inside Government and when the Government defends its actions against external political criticism.  There can be interdepartmental discussions and if there is uncertainty and legal risk, that can prevent things moving forward.  One of the principal potential advantages of putting a right to housing in the Constitution is that it reduces the legal risk and the legal uncertainty.  That can be quite important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#H01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Colm O'Cinneide"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I will return to the Home for Good representatives very briefly.

I believe we should have a constitutional provision for that right, but it then raises the issue of how that right is vindicated.  That is empowering in itself.  That is what it is all about and that sense of empowerment is the kernel of this.  How can people vindicate their rights?  It is empowering to the citizen and to the people.  All of us in Ireland are very proud of our Constitution.  Something is always being cited as being in the Constitution - which is the bible for us - and, therefore, it is good.<\/p><p>In his submission, Professor O'Cinneide states: \"There are some reasons to be sceptical about constitutionalising social rights, such as the right to housing.\"  He continues, \"Rights rhetoric often does not translate over into effective action\".

The gap between reality and practice can be a problem.  It can cause discontent, disillusionment and anger.<\/p> <p>  The second problem is the risk of unintended legal consequences.  This is always a risk.  My view is that these can be overstated, especially in a jurisdiction like Ireland where the courts are very consistent in how they interpret and apply legislation on constitutional provisions.  One can have unanticipated legal consequences, such as middle-class, quite privileged litigants being able to afford very expensive senior counsel to challenge a particular provision relating to a right to housing.  That is a potential risk.  I think it can be overstated.<\/p> <p>  The third potential problem relates to the creation of uncertainty.  There is an abstract constitutional provision.

Vindication can come in different forms, including political and legal.  There is often a tendency to think that because it is in the Constitution, it must be legal.  The Constitution was never designed to be just legal.  I will come to the political side in a moment.  Legal avenues are potentially opened if there is visibly a condition of totally inadequate housing supply.  For example, where housing accommodation for a disabled member of a family might be utterly inadequate and the State is manifestly screwing up and failing to act.  In that situation, there is potentially room for legal action.  One can talk to an advice agency such as Free Legal Advice Centres and to civil society organisations to try to help in that respect.<\/p> <p>  An often-neglected aspect of this is the political aspect.  There is something concrete in that a person can go to a Deputy, Senator or even to the Ombudsman, as well as other similar complaint structure, to say what is happening.

It cannot be too granular or detailed but it also has to get across the substance of what is intended.  The phrase \"adequate housing\" comes from the international context.  Professor O'Cinneide has already touched on this and he is extremely familiar with this area.  The phrase comes from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  There has been a lot of discourse at international level about what it could mean and what elements it could include, such as things like security of tenure, affordability, accessibility and those various criteria.  The most important thing about the term \"adequate housing\" is that it allows space for the organs of the State to determine, at a particular time and in a particular context, what \"adequate\" means for society at that time.  It would make this a living provision that can continue to evolve as time goes on.  It provides a framework for how the State must consider this but it leaves the actual detail of it up to the organs of the State to decide at a particular time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#K00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife Kelly-Desmond"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.

That is where I come up against the difficulty of that wording around \"adequate housing\".  It is not that I have a difficulty with it; it is about understanding it.  The biggest issue when we get to a referendum will be being able to explain to the public what we are inserting into the Constitution.  We have seen many times before that where there is uncertainty among the public about what they are voting for, they will vote against it.  There is no surer thing than that.

It is necessary to be very clear about this.  The right to housing, as set out very clearly in international human rights law, is not an entitlement to a State subsidy.

It is important to recognise the State already has lots of definitions in statute of what adequate housing is with respect to minimum standards, overcrowding, etc.  In some senses, while we can argue whether those standards are adequate, there are some already there.  For example, the State has been found to be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights with respect to the conditions it leaves its own tenants living in, especially in council flat complexes.  This is because of the very inadequate standard of such accommodation, which often does not meet the minimums the State has itself set.  That is worth recognising.<\/p> <p>  It is also worthwhile to go back to one of the recent insertions on rights we introduced, namely, the rights of the child.  One of the things that wording refers to specifically is the right of the child to an education.  The Constitution does not say whether it is private education or public education, or whether it is funded by the household or by the State.  That is not the job of the courts.  The job of the courts is to say that this right is not being realised and that the Government must work out how best to do it.  While I am a strong advocate of public housing, as the Senator knows, there is nothing stopping a Government saying it is going to vindicate this right through a set of measures that are about activating private sector supply.  This is really about putting pressure on the Government to progressively realise and vindicate that right but the policy prescriptions are entirely a matter for the Government.  The crucial thing is that the Government must act.  We cannot emphasise that enough.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked really good questions about where this was not done in the past.  Two instances strike me.  At the start of the very significant upsurge in rental costs in 2014-15, Deputy Kelly was the Minister.  As people will remember, he wanted to peg rents to inflation.  The idea was that because inflation was relatively modest at the time, that would have allowed a certain degree of certainty and affordability for landlords and tenants.  Two arguments were used by Fine Gael, which was the coalition partner of Deputy Kelly's party at the time.  The first was that it did not want to negatively impact on private sector investment in the rental sector.  The second was the Constitution.  If we had linked all private sector rents to inflation in 2015, we would be in a much healthier position today.  We would not have the spiralling rents that have gone up since that time but we also would not have the two-tier rental market where some properties have constrained rents and others do not.  There is a good example of where the Constitution was used by some as an argument not to take a course of action that, with the benefit of hindsight, it would have been very wise to take.<\/p> <p>  More recently, the current Minister has said, and I have no reason to doubt him, that the advice from the Attorney General is that a ban on increases in rents in the private rental sector outside of Covid would be unconstitutional.  Very eminent constitutional law professionals like Dr. Rachael Walsh of TCD have disagreed.  However, if you had the right, as has been outlined by others, and you could balance that right, it could make those types of actions eminently easier and again help us to stop the rising rents at present.  It is really important for those of us who have been arguing for this for a long time to emphasise it is not a silver bullet, a key to a free home or a change overnight but it is about that kind of impetus for change.  While we can agree or disagree with the merits of the Government's housing plan, the Government would argue that it is doing what this constitutional right would be advocating.  Therefore, it should be quite comfortable with having that right in the Constitution.  Those of us who take a more critical view of Government policy can argue to the contrary but I think all of us can agree the right is crucial.<\/p> <p>  I have another point to emphasise.  There is such a strong degree of consensus emerging in this meeting I do not want to break it in any way.  However, it is important to emphasise that the programme for Government does not commit to a referendum on the right to housing.  The wording is it commits to a referendum \"on housing\".  I get the sense we are edging ever closer to a referendum on the right to housing.  Notwithstanding some of the questions today, which were all legitimate ones, that would be a very good thing.<\/p> <p>  My last question is probably more for Home for Good, although it would be helpful if Professor O'Cinneide has a view on it.  Let us put to one side the legal arguments and imagine the commission recommends we hold a referendum and gives us a wording.  The big issue then is the campaign.  What is the best way to convince people of the merits?  Do our guests have thoughts, from their own involvement in or reflections on previous referendums, on what we would do post a positive recommendation from the commission and a positive agreement at Cabinet to move forward with a referendum?  How do they think such a campaign should unfold?  What would be the role of civil society versus the political parties, etc.?  If there are any observations our guests would like to share with us at this stage it would be very helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#L00500","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":502,"content":"<p>One of the things that is helpful, and Senator Cummins raised some of it, is to build a consensus.  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's suggestion around doing some of the work on what this will look like in reality will be important.  We have experienced consensus in this committee and in our broader consultations with political parties around the commitment that is there around the right to housing and the referendum.  I would like it if we could see that consensus in the campaign, in order for the public to see that the political system sees the benefit of it.  As we come to that wording, there should be a process.  One of the things that is unfortunate about the commission is that it is sitting and thinking.  The conference in UCD was very welcome and helped to move us forward, so this is not a criticism of the commission in any way.  That kind of process of deliberative democracy, which involves talking these things through and questioning the wording, is really important.

I thank all our guests for their contributions here and for their work.  A majority of members on this committee support a right to housing in the Constitution.  That has happened because of campaign groups like those present and in response to effectively ten years of undersupply and dealing with the fallout of that.  The Government is committed to a referendum on housing, as has been said, but certainly within this committee and I can say within Fianna F&aacute;il, there is a majority of people who believe in a right to housing.<\/p> <p>  When explaining it to people, for all of the concerns that are there, I often use the phrase that we are inserting a balancing right to housing because we have extremely strong rights around private property.  This gives the Government more options by providing a balancing right to housing.  That seems to have been convincing to some.  There is always an argument about whether the different Attorneys General are more or less conservative but giving Governments more tools in their toolbox to deal with the issue of housing is something that can be supported.  I thank our guests for all that and for the contributions they have made.<\/p> <p>  There is a job now for the commission.  It is going to be really important in presenting the legal cases and particularly in articulating some of the concerns.  The wording and the deliberative stuff will happen in this committee.  We cannot have a referendum without having a Bill coming though the Houses.  That will have to come through these committees, so that will come.<\/p> <p>  My worry in all this is the red herrings.  The majority of people in my constituency voted against the children's rights referendum.  That was not because they were opposed to the rights of children but because red herrings, or let us call them concerns, were raised and people gelled with them.  We must start voicing some of those concerns and dealing with them in a pre-emptive way rather than waiting for them to happen through a campaign.<\/p><p>We have seen where things arise in a campaign and campaigns are not ready to address them.  They can take legs.  I am concerned that the issue of racism against the Travelling community could be used in the course of a referendum.  That could play into a debate.  We have to deal with those kind of issues in advance.  In many ways the good work the witnesses have done has got there.  Only civil society groups will be able to lead the way on some of those issues and Government and the Ministers, Departments and politicians.  We know from the debate around referendums that civil society groups have been important.  The fear on this is that people will support it.  That would put us in a very weak position.  We are actually not prepared for those red herrings that arise.  If we go into a referendum thinking it will be passed that leaves us open to the very real possibility that it will not pass.  Have the witnesses given any consideration to those type of issues?  For example I imagine a campaign to frighten landlords could be successful in spreading not just the concerns people might have about big institutional landlords but also people who might have one house, or family members of people who might have one house.  Has any work been done in that space about the red herrings?  The ways in which different countries have vindicated this right are fascinating.  If we can provide ways to bring those examples into the public mind such as the way it is done in South Africa and elsewhere, that will help play into a debate and prepare the public for what is going to be a more difficult campaign than we expect.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#L00800","speaker":"1568","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":506,"content":"<p>The Deputy raised many important questions, as indeed all the members have.

In regard to preparing for the referendum, at the recent international conference, FEANTSA came over and Ms Kelly-Desmond spoke in a session which looked at previous referendums in Ireland and how some of the learning from those might translate into advocating for a right to housing indeed across Europe.  We had a particular eye on Ireland.  Marriage equality was one issue that was raised.  If a person was against marriage equality the polling at the time would have told them that if they took a particular tack &ndash;  on a particular concern or red herring &ndash;  that 70% of the public was going to vote against marriage equality.  A person on that side would have felt very secure in the way that Ireland was going to vote.  We are conscious of that.  There is a good deal of positive polling on the right to housing.  That is welcome.  It is a better position to be in rather than having it the other way around.  However as the Deputy raised we are conscious that the polling can be soft.  In the context of a referendum things can get away from you.  We have to prepare for that and as a group we are thinking that through.  We have already started the thinking on it and building that broad civil society coalition will be an important part of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Wayne Stanley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":507,"content":"<p>There are two types of red herring.  One is the fact that there are undoubtedly bad actors who will come up with things they know not to be true and use them as a way to try to convince people to vote in a certain way.  The second is that other people may be genuinely scared.  They may misunderstand what it means.  They may be worried about their own homes or about the family farm, any of those sorts of issues.  Those people are easier to address because you can explain to them that this does not mean what they might think it means, or that it might be a positive thing for the family farm.  It does not mean the State is going to take your home away.  The bad actors who have cropped up in all recent referendums will be difficult to combat, certainly on social media we see that all the time.  As with previous referendums it is that engagement of individuals and people telling their stories, probably not organisations such as ours but individuals who are suffering through the housing crisis actually saying &ldquo;this is what this could mean for me&rdquo;.  That is what has been successful.  The previous referendums were not necessarily won by the organisations that were running them, or supposedly running the campaign group.

Whether you are a homeowner or whatever your situation is it is a right that adds to your rights, it does not take away from them.  Another important point the Deputy mentioned is around it being a balancing right.  Private property rights are there.  They are strong and they are not going anywhere.  They will continue to be there to protect the interests of people who are concerned about their property ownership in whatever context.

It occurs to me that the focused questioning we had in this evidence session is in a way exactly what is needed in this type of referendum.  We need to ask the demanding questions about what this right will do, what this proposed referendum will do, what changes will it action and what is the significance of it and how is it going to affect individuals.  They are precisely the difficult and demanding questions that need to be answered.  They cannot just be smoothed over.  The discussion today is a good test run for all of this.  It is precisely those demanding questions that need to be flagged in a referendum.  If they are not flagged, debated and discussed openly they will come in anyway.<\/p> <p>  There are a few points to be made on international comparisons.  There are very interesting concrete examples from countries such as South Africa but also from various European countries such as Finland and France of the right to housing generating concrete changes for the better.  France had a massive housing crisis in the 2000s.  It introduced legislation on foot of the constitutionally recognised right to housing and it actually had an impact. There are lessons to point to.  I will make two more general points from my time on the European Commission of Social Rights examining how the right to housing was being fulfilled throughout Europe.  First of all there is a diversity of ways to give effect to the right to housing.  There is no single, fixed right or wrong model especially when it comes to a mixture of social housing and private housing.  Different horses for different courses.  That is an important point to make.  Also important is the need to have flexibility so that State responses to housing crises and changing global financial and economic conditions are not too hemmed in by concerns about private property rights.  You need that flexibility which the referendum will help to give.  However you also need that focus, that sustained attention over time, both the good times and the bad times, on the need to provide secure housing for the population of Ireland.  That is something the referendum can give.  Sustained focus over time plus flexibility in State responses are two important points to add to the conversation.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Colm O'Cinneide"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":510,"content":"<p>Listening to the last round of contributions the recurring theme is the need to build consensus.

There will be different groupings.  We know them.  Many of them are on the political landscape already.  They will use this potential referendum to bring about different focuses and different arguments in a politically very cynical way.  We need to have our eyes wide open in that regard.  People talk about defining housing.  I get a bit uncomfortable when the most basic of things have to be explained to people.<\/p> <p>  The issue here is the need to build consensus.  I acknowledge Mr. Stanley, Mr. Elliott, Professor O'Cinneide and Ms Kelly-Desmond for their work and other people who have engaged with us.  We have come a long way.  Traditionally, we had people with megaphones on the streets talking about rights in the Constitution but with nothing thought out other than the suggestion of tapping into the anger and discontent of the citizen.  That is not the responsible way to deal with such matters - end of story.  There are different political narratives and political agendas, and we have to be always mindful of that.  That is the reality.  We know that and acknowledge that.<\/p> <p>  How, then, do we move forward?  It is back to the empowerment of the citizen.  I know that no one here is suggesting this, but it would be crazy to suggest that a constitutional referendum would somehow suddenly sort out our ills not necessarily next year but in three years' time.  It will not.  We need to be clear all along that this is about providing an impetus and focus on the issue.  This will ultimately empower the citizens if they agree to the proposal, and I hope they do, and then also empower them to seek to vindicate that right.  It has to be as simple as that.  It must be another power in the Constitution that is dearly valued and held to and that can be suddenly put up politicians and policymakers, whoever they may be, who are told: \"This is now a right in our Constitution.\"  People could maybe poke at them and say: \"Remember this, boy?  This is what it is about.\"  That in itself would be empowering.<\/p> <p>  My question is about building the consensus.  It should be remembered that the programme for Government, on page 120, under the title \"Constitutional Reform\", not under housing, states that the Government will hold a referendum on housing.  That is all it says.  That is a promise, which is fair enough, and I believe that the Government will do that.  We know that this Government has two and a half years or, at the very best, three years left in government, so if this referendum is to happen, it will happen before then.  That gives us a pretty tight timeline, which allows us to get organising ourselves now, not in six months' time.  There may be very different players on 15 December.  I am not suggesting there definitely will be.  In a few lines, simple messages or take-homes for us, how do the witnesses feel we can partner with them, not lead above them, in building this consensus?  They might each give a brief response.  We have three minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#N00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":513,"content":"<p>That sort of consensus-building will be vital.

The addition of that tool, while it will not stop evictions or stop landlords from leaving tomorrow, will create an impetus and a recognition of housing as a fundamental right as part of the social and economic infrastructure in a way that is not there at the moment and that will perhaps work as a leveller to ensure we do not end up back here.

There is very little correlation between a constitutional change and significant economic effects.  Again, I emphasise that the constitutional stage is only one part of a wider set of responses.  As ever, if you mess up your housing policy and legislation, it can have unintended economic consequences in the same way as it can have unintended legal consequences.  My own sense is that the referendum is unlikely to have those effects if the referendum campaign is conducted with a certain degree of honesty and clarity.  The insertion of a right to housing in the Constitution is not going to immediately change much directly in the law, particularly when it comes to private parties of landlords.  The negative effects you are talking about are much more likely to come from errors in legislation and policy mistakes later on in the process but that could happen today.  In other words, it is more of a potential issue when it comes to policy design rather than at the constitutional stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Colm O'Cinneide"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":525,"content":"<p>It is important that the messaging is right and that we allay people's fears.  We need to explain where landlords will stand and that people do not have to have such a fear regarding their rights.  The other point I would make is that we are in a serious housing crisis, which is detrimental to landlords.  No landlord wants to evict somebody into homelessness.  Somebody being evicted in the first instance is not a crisis unless that person has nowhere else to go, which is the situation we are seeing on a daily basis because of the crisis.  A better and more structured housing system that works in a more rational way would be better for landlords, together with everyone else.  Getting that message out is really important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife Kelly-Desmond"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":526,"content":"<p>Regarding the knock-on effects of policy instruments, and I know we are deviating slightly, and evidence of negative intervention in the market, I have done some reading about Berlin, where they looked at intervening with regard to the rental market.

I could not provide much of value about that example.  There is the general point here that it can have unintended consequences and housing brings its own issues like every other aspect of economic and social policy.  I would emphasise the potential role of a referendum in actually freeing up the State to able to deal with all sorts of unintended consequences because some unintended social consequences have been playing out very recently.  These social consequences have been building up for the past decade or more of inadequate or slow State responses.  There are different forms of unintended consequences to be concerned about.  By balancing out some of the pro-property pressures that can often work in favour of inertia, the balancing amendment involving a right to housing referred to by Deputy McAuliffe can in a way free up State policy to be more flexible and responsive and to be quicker to respond to these changing social conditions.  In one way, it has the potential to free up State responses to these problems as they develop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Colm O'Cinneide"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":528,"content":"<p>Some of us would argue that it is poorly designed policy with respect to the private rental sector that has led to the crisis in that sector and all of the unintended consequences that flow from that but we will debate that another day.  One could say that there is a case to be made that private sector landlords might see the right to housing in the Constitution as a positive thing.  One complaint of landlords is that the failure of the State to provide an adequate supply of social and affordable housing has led to an over-reliance on the private rental sector to meet a range of housing needs it was not designed to meet.  Landlords often complain to this committee that the solution to the homelessness crisis is more social housing.  Therefore, if it is presented in the right way, they might see this as a benefit in stabilising the housing system overall in a way that might be conducive to good landlords complying with the law etc., but that is a debate we can have at a later stage.<\/p> <p>  I am really interested in the fact that Professor O'Cinneide said there is some research around the positive impact of legal or constitutional rights to housing in a number of jurisdictions.  If he was in a position to share by way of an email to the committee links to any academic papers or articles he thinks would be useful for us to read, that would be really interesting because those are the kind of tangible things we would be very keen to promote.  <\/p> <p>  We spoke about the children's referendum.  One of the problems with that referendum is that the result was taken for granted from the outset.  It was a very lacklustre campaign.  Everybody thought \"who is going to be against enshrining the rights of children in the Constitution?\" and we were all caught off guard even though the entire political system was in favour of that referendum.  The lessons of marriage equality and repeal in particular show that you take nothing for granted.  You have a positive message and convince people of the merits of the argument not just by the human stories but door to door.  Let us not forget that this debate started in earnest in 2014 with the constitutional convention on social and economic rights.  After open and informed public deliberation, including strong arguments for and against, 84% of people voted in that convention to enshrine the right to housing as one of a number of social and economic rights.  That gives me great confidence because what it says is that if the debate is open, transparent, honest and sincere with people about what this can and cannot do and we listen to people's genuine concerns and respond to them in an intelligent way, reasonable people will do what reasonable people always do and vote the right way.  The constitutional convention should give us some comfort in that regard.  I am not really looking for a response.  I want to end on that because we often forget that there has already been a very extensive public deliberation on this matter.  It was instituted by the Acting Chairman's party.  It gave us some very good research and documentation.  People should go back to that report, which was published in 2014, because it is a really important starting point for us after almost a decade of debate around this.  If Professor O'Cinneide has anything he thinks the committee should read, could he send it on because some of us would be very interested to see that?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#O00600","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":529,"content":"<p>If Professor O'Cinneide forward it to the committee, it will go into formal correspondence for Tuesday's meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#O00700","speaker":"1647"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656975600,"counter":530,"content":"<p>To follow on from the point made by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, housing is a problem across Europe so Ireland is not unique.

I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  It goes back to tapping into and supporting people who want this to be a success.  However consensus building was talked about earlier.  We cannot see that in isolation from the political climate in which we live.  We have 10,000 people in emergency accommodation today.  The criteria are quite strict for emergency accommodation.  We have a national housing crisis.  The Government has said there is a crisis.  There is no dispute over that any more.  There was a battle for years over whether or not we had a crisis.  We are now at a stage where we all accept there is a crisis.  We are singing from the same page.  We have to look at it in that context and in the cycle of this Government.  On this commitment for a referendum as I said earlier, we are on a countdown time now.  Of course people are aggrieved about housing.  Why would they not be?  People who are working, people who earn &euro;45,000 and &euro;50,000 a year are aggrieved because they cannot access housing.  People who work here in Leinster House and have to travel many miles to work are aggrieved because of housing.  People who work here and cannot afford to pay rent are travelling 50, 60 and 70 miles a day to come to Leinster House to work.  I know these people; they exist.  These are the real issues.  Therefore it is also going to be a barometer of the opinion polls.  We know where the political parties stand on those polls.  I envisage this will be quite a tense period of engagement.  It will become a plebiscite or a vote of confidence in the Government.  That is the nature of these mid-term elections or referendums.  I hope it is not an angry one.  People have to be robust and engaging because it is a real issue of concern.  We have to be very careful about it.  As politicians we can only lead from the front and be responsible in terms of our communication.  Today's exchange was a classic example of how we can engage and share.  Let us not forget that if there was an opinion poll tomorrow, there may be a very different political situation.  Were this plebiscite or referendum to take place, I believe it would be a very protracted and angry one, and understandably so, in regard to housing.  There is a lot ahead of us but ultimately if we explain it, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said it is about example, being positive and bringing those stories to the front.  We have a hell of a lot of work to do.  If I were leaving here today even just teasing this out we have much more work to do than we even imagine we have.  It is going to be an enormous task.  It is a Government commitment to hold a referendum on housing and I presume this is going to be the nature of it and we have a lot of work to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022070500002#P00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1656975600,"counter":533,"content":"<p>As there are no other members indicating it gives me great pleasure to thank our witnesses, Mr. Stanley, Ms Kelly-Desmond, Mr. Elliott and Professor O'Cinneide.
