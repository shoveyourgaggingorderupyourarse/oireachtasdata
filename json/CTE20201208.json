This is a perfect situation for a dialogue.<\/p> <p>  As always, we thank the Chair and members of the committee for inviting us.  Joining me remotely are council members Dr. Martina Lawless, Professor Michael McMahon and Ms Dawn Holland, as well as our chief economist and head of secretariat, Dr. Eddie Casey.  We hugely value our engagement with the Oireachtas and see these meetings as an important part of our work.<\/p> <p>  As committee members knows, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is an independent body established under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.  Its mandate is to endorse and assess the official macroeconomic forecast, assess the budgetary projections, assess compliance with the fiscal rules and assess the fiscal stance.  This focuses on the overall fiscal stance rather than on individual tax measures or spending items and priorities.<\/p> <p>  The council's fiscal assessment report was published last week and assesses budget 2020.  In terms of the economic outlook, Covid-19 continues to have a major impact on the Irish economy.  The budget projections imply a 6% decline in real modified gross national income, GNI*, this year, followed by a muted 2% recovery in 2021.<\/p><p>November&rsquo;s Covid-adjusted unemployment rate remains high, at 17.4% for those aged between 25 and 74.  However, the outlook has improved since the spring.  The domestic economy recovered strongly in the third quarter.  Consumption has rebounded and multinational enterprises have supported activity.<br\/><br\/>For budget 2021, the Government assumed that a vaccine would not be widely available until at least 2022, and that trade between the UK and the EU would be based on a hard Brexit.  This was prudent, given the uncertainties and risks involved.  However, it did not factor in a tightening of the Covid restrictions, as we saw in October.  The budget forecasts cover just one year ahead, compared with the normal five-year horizon.  This gives an extremely narrow picture as to how today&rsquo;s policies might impact on the economy and on public finances.  While medium-term projections are uncertain, they help to promote medium-term oriented fiscal policy.  A return to five-year forecasting is essential for next April&rsquo;s stability programme.<br\/><br\/>In our report, we developed three scenarios to 2025 to help frame some of the medium-term challenges that Ireland faces.  The extended budget 2021<i><\/i>projections would see the economy recover to pre-crisis levels of activity by the end of 2022.  A milder scenario, with an effective vaccine next summer, and perhaps we have got closer to that, and an EU-UK free-trade agreement, could see the economy recover to pre-crisis levels somewhat earlier in 2022.  By contrast, a repeat waves scenario, with further level 5 restrictions necessary in 2021 and 2022, could see the recovery delayed until well into 2023.<br\/><br\/>The outlook remains highly uncertain and the impacts of the crisis might be felt for a very long time.  Sectors such as retail, hospitality, transport and the arts are especially vulnerable to the pandemic.  Counties more reliant on tourism and hospitality have also been worst affected, especially in the western and Border regions.  The impact of Brexit also is still unclear and could be much different from what is assumed.  Ireland is also exposed to international tax policy changes.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the public finances, Covid-19 has led to massive Government spending on job supports, health responses and measures to stimulate demand.  Tax revenues have fallen sharply in some areas, notably VAT.  Yet corporation tax and income tax have fared better than expected.  A very large deficit close to &euro;20 billion, or approximately 10% of GNI*, is likely both this year and next year.  This will lead to a sharp rise in the debt-to-GNI* ratio, which was already at high levels pre-crisis - the sixth highest in the OECD at the time.<br\/><br\/>The council assesses that the Government&rsquo;s decision to continue to borrow to support households and businesses through the Covid-19 crisis and to provide stimulus is appropriate, including up to &euro;12 billion of supports in temporary stimulus for 2021.  These measures should help to lessen the lasting damage of the economic crisis, and ultimately lead to a more sustainable path for Government debt.  The council welcomes the use of contingencies in budget 2021<i><\/i>to cope with any additional costs of Covid-19 and Brexit and the use of the recovery fund, which has not been fully allocated at this point.  Temporary and targeted supports should fall out of spending as the need for emergency measures diminishes and as the economy recovers, although there is some risk that some temporary spending may become permanent.<br\/><br\/>Budget 2021<i><\/i>also includes substantial, permanent increases in Government spending of at least &euro;5.4 billion, however.  Rather than being temporary and targeted, these will remain after the pandemic has passed.  They are surprisingly large in the context of past budgets.  Since 2015, budgets have included packages closer to an average of &euro;3.5 billion a year.  The permanent increases could even be as high as &euro;8.5 billion as it is not possible to ascertain the nature of some of the increases in non-Exchequer elements of the public finances.  This reflects ongoing transparency problems in areas outside of the Exchequer that have traditionally not been the focus of the Department in budget discussions.<br\/><br\/>The council assesses that permanent increases in spending without identifying sustainable funding is not conducive to prudent budgetary management.  To be clear, the council is not opposed to increased spending itself, and the debt-financed stimulus at the moment is appropriate.  However, there is no sense from the budget of how the lasting increases will be financed sustainably over the medium term.  The programme for Government rules out tax increases and spending reductions over large parts of the tax base and existing spending.  The risk is that this will tend to lead to larger deficits and leave debt on a riskier path.<\/p><p> Looking ahead, the council&rsquo;s simulations suggest that Ireland&rsquo;s budget balance by 2025 will be in deficit of between 2% and 3% of GNI* in the extended budget scenario.  Assuming interest rates remain reasonably favourable, debt ratios, although high, should fall over the medium term except in a repeated wave scenario.<\/p><p> The &euro;5.4 billion of core spending increases planned for 2021 will slow the pace of debt reduction.  They will add to the deficit even by 2025 and they will contribute to debt being higher than it would have been otherwise.<\/p><p> The Government faces a number of significant challenges once the economy is on a path to recovery.  Fiscal adjustment may be needed to put debt on a safer path and there are long-standing pressures on the public finances.  These include Ireland&rsquo;s rapidly ageing population, which is set to add approximately &euro;850 million a year to Government spending to 2025, measures to address climate change, reducing the over-reliance on corporation tax, which now amounts to &euro;1 in &euro;5 of Exchequer revenue, and fulfilling ambitions to upgrade the public services.<\/p><p> The Government must use its medium-term strategy in April 2021 to deliver credible plans.  This should include five-year forecasts; details on non-Exchequer areas; plans for sustainably financing the large increases in permanent spending; proper costing of major reforms such as Sl&aacute;intecare; and an explanation of how budgetary plans would change if revenues fall short.  Three reforms would also help: debt targets set in GNI* terms; tools to save temporary receipts such as unexpected corporation tax; and setting sustainable growth limits for spending.<\/p><p> I thank the members and we look forward, as always, to their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barnes.

A disorderly Brexit would increase that and bring it to almost double and there would be many differences across sectors in particular that we would be concerned about.  The agri-food industry and the domestic SME sector would be particularly exposed, both because they trade more with the UK than the larger multinationals, which make up a lot of our total exports, and because they often export products such as agricultural products or food products, which would attract the highest tariffs under either the EU's tariff regime for imports or the UK's universal tariff, which it would apply to Irish exports going there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martina Lawless"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>In the time I have-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#D00700","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607385600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>As time grows shorter in terms of the negotiations, there is also less time for firms to prepare in terms of documentation and setting out tariffs and more risk that there are less customs-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martina Lawless"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Can Dr. Lawless hear me?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#D00900","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607385600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I am sorry.

The question of scarring effects on the economy, particularly transport and accommodation, is something about which we are very concerned.  Some of these sectors have been very badly hit.  We know the Government has put in a lot of support but ultimately we do not know how long those companies will be able to last under these conditions and we do not really know how quickly consumers will start travelling again.

We should also look at the overall role of the Government, as measured by the general Government.  This is how the fiscal rules are specified, which is one of the reasons we are so interested in it.  The part that is not covered by the Exchequer is some 20% of the total so it is very big but up until recent years, basically not very much was happening there so it did not have a large impact on the kind of fiscal aggregates at which we look.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>To which area of spending is Mr. Barnes referring?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#E00600","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607385600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>That is a very good question.  This is basically local government, commercial semi-State bodies and extra-budgetary funds.  Collectively, they add up to quite a bit.  Until recent years, there was not a great deal of action happening there.  This arose in the previous budget and this year as well.  Quite a lot of the increase is coming through in these areas.  We lack two things.  We lack actual information on where the money is being spent.  What we receive is a net figure that gives the overall number but it does not tell us where it is coming from.  There are some offsetting amounts between spending and revenue.  We have asked the Department of Finance to provide us with a much clearer picture of the numbers.  The Department is working on this, which is good news.  It would also be good to understand more about what is going on.<\/p><p>Quite a lot of it is probably capital investment.  It would be good to know what the investment plans are so that we and others can factor those into budgetary projections.  It is an issue that has arisen over the past couple of years that basically relates to local government, semi-State bodies and a few other things.  We are asking for more transparency in terms of numbers and understanding what the underlying story is.  <\/p><p> Regarding the Deputy's final question about the areas where the budgetary framework could be strengthened, it is very good that the Government plans to look at the medium term in April.  As we have said, it will face a number of challenges and we believe those challenges may be easier to manage with some measures to strengthen the fiscal framework.  We focused on three.  One is having a target for the debt-to-GNI* ratio.  Obviously, in a period when debt is very high and needs to be brought down, it is natural to target the debt-to-GNI* ratio, particularly a few years ahead where the Government will have a bit of time to control the dynamics.  Regarding one particular concern, previous Governments have had a debt target but, in our view, without very much commitment.  It was also specified in terms of GDP, which is not the appropriate measure of national income, so this really needs to be measured in these terms.  Under European rules, the debt rule is done in GDP terms, which does not make a lot of sense for Ireland and does not give it an accurate picture.  The second area is around a rainy day fund.  We also talked about a prudence account in the past.  These are ways of essentially building up precautionary buffers for future shocks.  It would also be a very good way of saving the excess corporation tax receipts and helping to smooth that over time.  This is a relevant measure to consider after this year where the Government is clearly trying to stimulate the economy in 2021.  The third measure is the kind of control of spending in normal times.  The expenditure ceiling system has not worked that well.  We have also had periods in the past couple of years where expenditure growth has been a bit too fast relative to the speed of the economy so strengthening the domestic controls around that would be helpful.  We also make one or two other suggestions as well.  These could be very helpful measures for the Government to consider as it sets out its medium-term plan in the autumn.  It could put these measures in place that would strengthen the institutional framework as well just announcing what it plans to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>What is the largest single risk to the economy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#F00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607385600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>In the short run, it is Covid while in the slightly longer run, it is Brexit.

This is very much a question for the Government.  Deputy Farrell referred to the increase of &euro;5.4 billion up to &euro;8 billion, which is a very large increase in the context of recent budgets.  It is also quite a large increase if one looks at it relative to the sum potential tax changes.  Clearly, things such as the sugar tax raise a very small amount relative to that.  It may well be desirable on public health grounds, but it is not something that radically changes the picture in Government revenue.<\/p> <p>  The imposition of the carbon tax, again, can be very helpful in reducing emissions, which is a goal that we all support.  On the other hand, those revenues have already been allocated to specific things.  Again, it does not provide a general solution for supporting further spending.  If one looks at the increase in PRSI rates, the estimate from Revenue is that this would bring in another &euro;750 million per year.  It is important to view this as context for looking at the impact of these increases in spending.  Of course, the economy will grow over the coming years also, which will provide additional revenue.  At the same time, the costs of standing still, which is the cost of the Government continuing to provide the same services taking into account the costs of paying higher wages, higher welfare rates or maintaining welfare rates in real terms at their existing levels, and the costs of ageing, which will add another &euro;850 million per year on average to public spending, will eat up a lot of the space that growth will create.  It will probably eat up more than the amount that additional growth will generate over some of these, once we get beyond the recovery.  It is a challenging environment and there are difficult choices to be made in terms of increasing spending and perhaps reviewing spending in existing areas.  One thing we call on the Government to look at is to strengthen the spending review process.  That does some good work, but it could be made into a genuine process for looking at whether Government spending is prioritised and delivered in the most effective ways.  There are some very hard choices coming around taxation and spending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barnes for that.

I am interested to hear if he is familiar with how other EU jurisdictions have oversight of non-voted expenditure, which could help inform the committee on how to improve transparency in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I am also quite interested in the whole issue of capital expenditure.  We are being told that there will be an extra billion euro here, there and everywhere for capital expenditure but what it really boils down to is  &euro;9.3 billion in 2020 and it will be increased to &euro;9.8 billion in 2021.  We are aware of how important capital expenditure is in having a significant multiplier effect.

On the general Government figures, this is an issue that comes up in a lot of countries.  Ireland in some ways has better transparency than other countries.  We have a fairly precise idea in terms of providing information on the gross spending there and on a number of other things, including a thing called the \"walk\", which allows one to move from the Exchequer to the general Government figures.  There is a clear idea of how to do that.  The Department of Finance is looking at it.  We look forward to the Department making progress on that issue and hopefully reporting back to the committee on that.<\/p> <p>  On capital spending, the Deputy is absolutely right.  We view capital spending as being very important and it has a very big multiplier.  It also has a long-term benefit in increasing the capital base of the economy, providing a framework for structures for public services in the future and, potentially, to support growth.  We welcome that this was part of the budget.  Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell is right that the increase allocated in the budget was not huge but we must bear in mind that capital spending in Ireland has been growing very fast in recent years and is now at quite high levels by EU standards.  That was very lucky.  It takes a lot of time to plan capital spending and it just happened that Ireland was ramping up capital spending at the right time.  The right thing to do is look at the level of capital spend during this crisis much more than to look at the change.  In the past in Ireland we have seen that capital spending has been slashed during crises.  This current situation actually represents progress in moving towards better fiscal policy.<\/p> <p>  Another issue in the context of capital spending, which we see a little bit from the Exchequer numbers from last week, is delivery.  On our assessment it looks that capital spending this year will be less than planned.  This raises big questions about delivery for next year also.  Maybe the priority should not be to keep making ever-bigger promises about what the spend will be, which I am not sure would be helpful.  What would be helpful is to make sure that the money already planned to be spent actually does get spent.  The quality of the capital that comes out of this will be very important too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the time but I do want to come in again.  The report also notes that Ireland faces a threat from changes to the international tax system.  A number of these changes have been enacted in recent years and more are coming down the line.  We have had the OECD's base erosion and profit shifting initiative and the EU's anti-tax avoidance directive.  Other proposals for EU corporate tax harmonisation and a digital sales tax are still being deliberated.  Which of these, in Mr. Barnes' view, is likely to have the biggest impact on the economy's overall budgetary balance in the long term?<\/p> <p>  The Fiscal Assessment Report refers to Ireland's over-reliance on corporate tax and states: \"The funding of Ireland&rsquo;s public services and supports has become increasingly dependent on corporation tax receipts.\"  In the view of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, how fiscally sustainable is Ireland's low-tax model in light of threats from demographic changes, changes to the international tax regime, relocation risks posed by the concentrated nature of our corporate tax base and the longer-term trends of secular stagnation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#H00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607385600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>We follow the potential tax policy changes very carefully.  It is, obviously, complicated on the political front in the context of what is going to happen and what is going to be agreed.  There are also domestic considerations.  The new Administration in the United States of America, for example, could also have an impact.  It is very hard to have a good assessment of what the impact of that will be.  Much of the revenue relates to a few companies in a few sectors.  Their tax planning is very complicated and it is very hard to say exactly how any of this will play out.  This cuts both ways.  It could be that ultimately revenue increases, but it could also fall.  It requires a cautious approach.  This is what the council is arguing for here.  The council has a measure of excess corporation tax.  This looks at historical and across-country trends.  We are seeing, given how much Ireland raises, how much of that fits with those longer-term patterns and how much of it seems to be unusual.  This suggests that quite a lot of these revenues cannot be explained in that way.  As this dependency is increased over time, we really think that, as part of the recovery in the medium term, there needs to be a plan to reduce Ireland's reliance on this.  We are in a very risky situation.  This money is being spent on public services and if it was to disappear quickly, which it could, it would leave a big hole in the public finances and that would lead to a painful adjustment.<\/p><p>We therefore think it is much more appropriate that we anticipate that and that we do not spend it all now, excepting the short term, as there will be big pressure in the next two years.  Beyond that, however, in the medium term we should not count on spending as much of this revenue as we are spending at present.  We need a plan to reduce our reliance on it.  The rainy day fund or prudence account could be a very good way of doing so.  There are big questions about the sustainability of this model, and that pressure will add to the other points the Deputy made, including the point that in the medium term there are other things that are not sustainable.  For example, more action is required on climate change, which is likely to have a fiscal cost.  Ageing is accelerating at quite a fast pace.  We have a young country now but that will not last all that long.  In fact, our population is already ageing quite quickly.<\/p><p> There are therefore a lot of pressures which will all essentially come due at the same time, once we have moved beyond the Covid crisis and, it is hoped, the medium-term impact of Brexit.  All these things will need to be addressed.  This is why the choices are very difficult.  It is not just a question of getting back to budget balance.  There is a whole set of issues as to how we get there that need to be addressed at the same time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Mr. Barnes is very welcome.  I wish to pick up again on the issue of spending this year.  A significant quantum of resources, as Mr. Barnes referred to in his post-budget commentary, now looks like being a permanent expenditure across a range of different spending heads, particularly in health.  To me, this is really a commentary on the deficiencies Covid-19 has exposed in our public health service.  As much of that expenditure now will be repeat expenditure, it is now essentially in the base.  There is a very clear question as to how we provide the resources to pay those bills over the next few years.  Mr. Barnes very pointedly refers to this in his analysis.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Barnes also refers to the fact that the tax base is disproportionately dependent on volatile corporation tax receipts.  We know the Government made a political choice not to have the adult, grown-up conversation we need to have in this country about diversifying our tax base and ensuring that those who have the most may pay more in the context of our economic growth, our economic recovery and investment in the public services on which we all depend.  In light of the political straitjacket the Government has talked itself into, as far as Mr. Barnes is concerned what are the options in terms of diversifying the tax base to provide the resources we need to support the public services we demand and on which any modern, decent society should insist?  Does he believe, for example, that wealth taxes have a role to play?  Wealth has not been tapped and wealth taxes have not been identified as a priority by this Government or the previous one.  Does he have a view on the evolution, for example, of property taxes in this country?  We know, and all the evidence shows us, that the vast majority of wealth in this country is held in assets.  Successive Central Bank reports have indicated that but there are untapped resources there that are required to resource our services going forward.  I would like to hear Mr. Barnes's view on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#J00200","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607385600,"counter":44,"content":"<p>That was a very interesting and wide-ranging set of questions.  Health is a big issue to focus on in the public finances.  As the Deputy notes, there has been a lot of temporary spending on health because of Covid-19 and it was very important that that was done.  As he said, there is a risk that some of that could become permanent spending.  We are not completely away from the kinds of pressures we saw in recent years.  A striking figure is that the permanent health spending next year, taking out the Covid part, will be 30% higher in cash terms than it was five years ago.  That is a very significant cash increase in health spending.  As we know, and as we have discussed in our previous reports, most of that spending came about in an unplanned manner.  It was not originally budgeted for and came about through supplementary budgets and then was locked into the base.  There is also the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare on the horizon.  That is estimated to cost &euro;3 billion.  Some of that, apparently, is in this year's budget.  It was not very clear to us how much of that has been done.  There has been no up-to-date costing of the implementation of that reform since, I think, 2017.<\/p><p>A lot of things have changed since then.  That is one of the reasons we think that, as part of the package in the spring, it would be good to have a good costing of that.<\/p><p> Health, of course, is one pressure among many others.  As Deputy Nash noted, and as we have noted, the programme for Government essentially makes commitments not to increase taxes on approximately a third of the tax base.  It also commits not to cut or adjust spending on approximately half of the expenditure base.  It is therefore a very restrictive document.  This is why it is important for the Government to clarify how it will prioritise these issues and address them going forward.  As for the public finances and how these pressures can be reconciled, the choices are unfortunately very clear.  One is higher taxation; another is adjustments on the spending side.  Whether that comes through reprioritising certain programmes or increasing the efficiency of certain activities, those are basically the choices.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council recognises that none of these choices are easy, but these are essentially the choices the country, the Government and everyone faces.  In that context we do not have specific views about wealth taxes or any other way of achieving such an adjustment.  That is really a choice for the Government and the political system.<\/p><p> As I noted earlier, the tax commission has an important role to play in coming up with ideas and proposals of ways of increasing the effectiveness of the tax system, making sure it is fair and contributes to growth.  As I also noted, the spending review process could be strengthened.  At the moment it is very much an analytical and technical exercise.  It is good work but very technical work.  In other countries, such as the Netherlands, they use it as a way to prioritise government spending and to consider the efficiency of what is done.<\/p><p> A third pillar in this regard - the council has engaged on it in the past week - is the pensions commission.  As I said, pensions is partly a long-term issue about the public finances but it is also a short-term issue.  Every year between now and 2025, ageing will on average add another &euro;850 million to the spending base.  This is a lot of money, so those things need to be considered.  In that context, we were concerned about the change in the legislation on raising the pension age in the beginning of next year.<\/p><p> I will make one very specific point about taxation.  We do not have general views about different tax instruments.  One thing worth noting is the fact that property values for the purpose of the property tax have not been updated as planned.  This is one area where a plan was in place which has not been implemented.  It will be important to get back to that if that is what the Government intends.  There is a risk otherwise - we have seen this in many countries - that if the properties are not revalued for the property tax, it never gets done and the tax base suffers as a result.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I have two more observations and questions.

Regrettably, the very propitious lending environment we are in at the moment is not being exploited enough by the Government in terms of borrowing at very low rates for long-term capital investment.  It is very underambitious to simply decide to spend an additional &euro;500 million over the next 12 months, given the deficiencies we have in our public infrastructure and our social infrastructure - for example, in public housing.  Does Mr. Barnes think it would be wiser to invest more now, on top of the &euro;500 million, on top of what is already committed, to unleash the economic potential and address some of the social and public infrastructural gaps we have at the moment, particularly in the context of housing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#K00200","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607385600,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Let me start with that question.  As I said in a reply to an earlier question, we would focus less on the increase in public investment this year and more on the level of investment.  This happens to be a period during which public investment has been ramped up a lot in Ireland.  By international standards our level of investment is now pretty high.<\/p><p>The fact that it has not increased much is not too much of a concern.  The good news is that there is a lot of money going into the economy through investment and we welcome that, both in respect of its contribution to stimulus and to wider public objectives.  Therefore that is appropriate.  <\/p><p> As to whether we should borrow more and what it should be spent on, these are very much political questions.  The Deputy is right to say that this current interest rate environment is very favourable.  The Government is borrowing a lot of money at long maturity, and is locking in those low rates.  These actions are all consistent with the strategy that has been set out.  Whether it should be doing more is a difficult question and some of it relates to the capacity of the economy and of the Government to take that money, to commit to spending it on capital projects and to do so wisely.  We are not in a good position to make a judgment on that but overall, we welcome the high level of investment.  Even though interest rates are very low, public debt is very high and that is a concern.  There are constraints and money still must be used wisely; it is not as though it is free money.  <\/p><p> On the issue of the Exchequer returns, we issued our report last week before the Exchequer returns  and we were looking at a deficit of a little more than &euro;20 billion this year.  The Deputy is right that the Exchequer returns had quite a lot of news in them and there are quite a few moving parts involved.  One is actually the shortfall on capital spending and it looks like there will be an underspend on the budget for the year as a whole.  As there has been less spending than was built in as a contingency for the level 5 restrictions, it looks a though that spending will come in lower.  Tax receipts through income tax and corporation tax have also been lower, so there are quite a few moving parts to the returns, but we would agree with the Deputy that the budget deficit will come in smaller than anticipated.  I would have thought that around &euro;18 billion or &euro;19 billion would be a reasonable figure.

In respect of the lower bound, it is hard to say but it could be as low as &euro;18 billion.  I do not imagine, however, that it could be much lower than that.  Again, there are many uncertainties and health spending could still be quite high in December.  We do not know what kind of costs linked to Covid or to the effects of the regular flu season are going to be incurred.  There potentially are other payments that were missing in the returns, so it is unclear at this stage.  There could have been greater transparency on the Covid spending.

It is very important that borrowing is undertaken in 2020 and 2021 because that will stimulate the economy.

The Covid crisis, as the Deputy noted, has had very complex and differentiated effects.  For example, some people have experienced very difficult circumstances and may have lost their jobs, income or businesses while other people have continued to be paid and have not spent very much.  In its wake, we know there have been a lot of savings in the economy, so there is a legitimate question about whether such measures are may be warranted.  Obviously, anything that would help to reduce the long-term pressure on the public finances would help to make the economy less vulnerable and would be desirable.

Borrowing entails borrowing from those who have surplus money, at interest, to make up for the lack of money available to finance necessary expenditure in health or capital expenditure, for example.  In the case of wealth taxes, instead of borrowing the money at interest from those with a surplus, one takes it from them.

That makes a major difference in terms of the number of people affected and the amount of money raised.

A lesson we have learned from Covid is that, if we scrimp on health spending, particularly on capacity, staffing and so on, it can have more dire economic consequences in a health emergency.  To a significant extent, our requirement to close down large sections of the economy was linked to the low level of capacity within our health service.  That is a calculation that we must start thinking about.  We might believe that we should reduce spending because it is fiscally prudent but it might suddenly catch up with us in a major way because we do not have the health capacity, thereby costing us more.  Have the witnesses an opinion on reconsidering the relationship between these two matters in terms of whether it is more fiscally prudent to have the health infrastructure, which might cost more initially but save us in the long run?<\/p> <p>  In terms of reviewing our expenditure and so on, I am interested in tax expenditures and the fact that we do not examine them closely enough.<\/p><p>Do the witnesses believe it would be important to examine those tax expenditures closely and make a comparison?  This committee and its predecessor have heard evidence from an economist - it may have been one of the witnesses, but I cannot remember - that, in general, direct expenditures tend to be better than tax expenditures.  What is gained from direct expenditure is more quantifiable whereas tax expenditure is more indirect and can often be a runaway train without anyone being sure what we are getting from it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#N00400","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607385600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I will let Professor McMahon answer the Deputy's first question.  To give him a little notice to think about it, I will answer hiss second question now.<\/p> <p>  The area of tax expenditures is important.  People tend to focus a great deal on tax rates, but much of what matters is the tax expenditures.  They get less attention and are typically a little less transparent.  I am not sure that I would generalise completely across all of them.  They are a legitimate instrument but, as Dr. Lawless stated, they should be examined as part of the general tax package.  One of the main risks is legitimacy.  Often, these tax expenditures are regressive.  I agree that they comprise an area to consider in terms of strengthening and broadening the tax base in the years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607385600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>The question of how to balance the issue of total capacity and how expenditure is directed towards specific types of capacity within health or any other part of the economy is a difficult one and certainly one on which I would defer to the health experts.  I will give an analogy.  One fact that is always rolled out when a little bit of snow falls and Dublin Airport or Heathrow Airport close is that the airport in Helsinki, which suffers far greater snowfall, has not closed in 30 years or something like that.  It is a calculated decision.  The infrastructure required to keep an airport open despite heavy snow is expensive.  If it is only going to be rolled out for three days every two years, it is probably not the right thing to do whereas shutting down is sometimes the most prudent action even though it is disruptive at the time.<\/p> <p>  In the health sector, the decision is even more complicated than that.  The questions that Covid has exposed relate to capacity in specific areas, in particular intensive care.  We know that this is not an area that can be easily adjusted flexibly because specialist equipment, specialist hospital areas and specialist staff training are required.<\/p> <p>  Reverting to the earlier discussion, there are legitimate questions to be asked about what the right balance in spending is.  I am not an expert on health spending, but in my own capacity, it is not obvious to me that, if we were having this conversation two years ago, we would be talking about expanding capacity in the health sector.  It is not obvious to me that we would have expanded it in areas that Covid could then have drawn upon, for example, intensive care.  It is a difficult matter and how we assess the probability of these events occurring and where we would put the extra capacity are important questions.  Where other countries have handled this well, capacity and testing made the greatest initial difference in the crisis in the ability to stay open.  For example, South Korea quickly got mass testing programmes up and running and was able to get results from tests quickly, and it was done in a cost-effective way.  It meant that people were tested more frequently and outbreaks were more contained.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is raising important questions.  When a spending review takes place, the adult conversation that one of his colleagues referred to will have to take place about the right ways in which to manage these risks.

Can the witnesses give particular advice on this double whammy?  I have advice that I wish to give as well.  I am one of those who spent at least four or five years before the economic crash raising questions in the Houses.  On the basis that it was not wise to suggest the country was going into a slide, as it would cause a rush on banks and all financial situations, we resorted to asking questions on whether the economy was keeping good economic fundamentals in mind.  The reply I always got was \"Yes, it was\".  That was not the case and was everything and anything but.<\/p><p> In this particular situation, I believe we need to be cautious about how we spend and be much more mindful of what other countries are doing for recovery than we were at any time in the past.  Any extra taxation must be weighed against the degree to which that will encourage confidence in our economy, given that we have an open economy, are highly dependent on exports and are a small fish in a very big pool full of many predators.  Is it wise to go for an early restoration of balance in spending in preference to retrenchment or austerity at an early stage?

Hopefully, with the vaccine the resolution of the Covid crisis is more predictable and closer than we might have thought last spring.<\/p> <p>  One of the important things that we and others have shown is that the sectors that are hit are very different.  That is probably better than the same sectors being hit twice, in the sense that the shock is spread more over the economy.  It would be good if that second shock could be avoided as much as possible.<\/p> <p>  On fiscal rebalancing and the path ahead, we talked about different phases in our report.  We are in a joint phase at the moment where some sectors are still very locked down and disrupted.  Areas like transport and accommodation are really suffering a lot, as are some other parts of the domestic economy.  Also, the unemployment rate in a broader measure is still at 16% and is likely to remain quite high, plus there is a greater weakness in demand.  That is going to be the challenge during 2021 and that is why we welcome and support the measures and stimulus that have been provided in budget 2021.  That is why we think it is appropriate. <\/p> <p>  Further ahead, as the shocks unwind, the economy must adjust.  Using our five-year scenario, and this is why it is useful to do a five-year forecast rather than a one-year forecast like the Department of Finance did in the budget, we see the extended budget scenario.  We take the budget numbers and roll them out to 2025, assuming no policy changes, and end up with a deficit of approximately 2.5% of national income at that point.  We then did another exercise and asked, while the level of debt would be much higher, what would one need to bring debt to the same downward path as it was in 2019.  In that scenario, we see there is a need for some fiscal adjustment.  It is important to say, which we said last spring and now say again, this is nothing like the severe austerity that we saw from 2008 to 2010.  It is a very different situation and that partly reflects, as the Deputy has said, the better fundamentals of the economy going into this crisis, so that is welcome.<\/p><p> We see that there is likely to be some need for fiscal adjustment.  In the mild scenario that we have, if things work out very well, it might not be all that big.  If things were to work out worse it would be bigger.  We see that there probably is a need for some fiscal adjustment but we think it is very manageable.  What complicates it is the fact that there are a number of other factors going on at the same time.  One is the need to reduce reliance on corporation tax.  Another two relate to dealing with climate change and ageing.  A lot of other pressures will need to be dealt with.  It is not just a question of getting back into balance but getting to the right sorts of level.<\/p><p> The Deputy is right that Ireland needs to be very mindful of what other countries do in terms of growth in corporation tax and the kind of things where Ireland is either competing or reliant on what happens in other countries.  At the moment we still are in quite a complex environment for international trade on which Ireland depends heavily as well.  There are a number of issues that Ireland needs to navigate and manage well.<\/p><p> Another issue is public debt.  As we have seen in the past the costs of being viewed as a relatively weak country can be very high.  In the current environment, where the ECB is running a very supportive policy and Ireland is very much within the pack, this is a manageable concern.  We also know that a lot of the debt has been issued for very long horizons.  Even if interest rates were to rise rapidly that would not actually show up in the public finance numbers for some time but it would show up eventually.<\/p><p> There are a number of things that Ireland needs to look at, and what we argue for in our report, which are really medium-term issues.  We do not see that there is a need for a sharp adjustment.  We think that this should be done in a managed way that has a minimal impact on growth but helps the economy to get back on track and puts the debt ratio on a downward level thus bringing it back to a level that is more sustainable, less vulnerable to shocks plus, potentially, gives Ireland the ability to absorb another shock of the sort that we have seen in the past because we have seen how valuable it is to be in that position.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Is it possible to allow and encourage economic recovery to be the central factor in proportionate debt in respect of total debt and annual borrowing ratios?

Growth should bring the tax base up significantly and as a significant part of both narrowing the budget deficit and increasing the GNI*, the ratio can be lowered that way but probably not quite enough.

It is a very good question.  The answer to the narrow question is that, as many people have stated in terms of public debt, it is very helpful for a country not to be perceived as being worse than other countries.  That is what happened from 2008 to 2010 and it was very costly.  This time, there is stronger European support and Ireland's experience is similar to that of many other countries.  That reduces our short-term concerns around the level of debt.  In some ways, if Covid had not come along and we just had to deal with Brexit which, obviously, affects Ireland more than it does other countries, we might have been more concerned about the financing than we are.  The fact that all countries are essentially in a similar boat in terms of debt provides some short-term reassurance.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised a key question with regard to the long term.  These levels of debt are extremely high by post-Second World War standards, much higher than we have seen previously.  On the other side, interest rates are probably at their lowest level in recorded history.  That is a very interesting combination.  Some of the best minds in economics are thinking about that question but have not really reached a firm conclusion.  In terms of the public finances, what we do know is that even if interest rates were to rise quite quickly, it would take time for that to feed into the public finances because of the long maturity of the debt.  Obviously, it would not help, but we would have a little time.  In terms of long-term sustainability, if interest rates did go back to a much higher level, that would change the medium-term and long-term outlooks and, of course, would also affect how we think about the short term.  The truth is that we do not really know how all of this will play out.  It does raise very big questions.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy stated, it raises intergenerational questions.  We give a significant amount of consideration to public debt, but we should not forget that the State pension is not funded; it is a pay-as-you-go system.  There are significant commitments that have been made for future generations as well.  The sustainability of the pension system is also a big question and may partly be related to the low interest rate environment.<\/p> <p>  I do not know whether my colleagues, who are probably among the best minds in economics, have more insights on the issue.

I do not think I will go out to dinner every single night when the public health situation improves in order to make up for the fact that I missed out on many nice evenings in restaurants in 2020.  It is very difficult to know how people will behave in that regard.  It does create a risk that people will spend those savings.  I think we can already see that a little in the figures.

From the perspective of IFAC, if there is a permanent or longer-lasting change that results to the welfare system from those programmes, that would need to be reflected in the public finances.  Obviously, it is important in terms of the public finances that once the recovery comes, we move out of the current phase.<\/p> <p>  On corporation tax, it has surprised us that it has lasted this long.  In fact, it has increased so much in recent years that even Mr. Coffey, who is a great expert on these things, may have been surprised.  There are two issues.  One is the year-to-year short-term volatility, which may be linked to a company making more or fewer profits.  It can have a big impact.  Even if one looks to this year, our view is that corporation taxes can easily shift by &euro;2 billion or &euro;1 billion from month to month.  That is quite volatile but, in the wider scheme of things, it is not a significant issue.  The real issue is about the longer term.  It is very complex to understand what is happening.  It is on the tax policy side and it is also to do with the companies.  We know that much of this money probably comes from companies in pharma or digital.  Those companies have all done quite well during the Covid crisis.  However, something could happen that means they do less well, which would have an impact on Ireland.  It may be that, for whatever reason, they decide to structure their tax affairs differently, which could have an impact.  That is why IFAC is still very cautious on this issue.

Unfortunately, aspects of the rules under the Fiscal Responsibility Act are framed in terms of GDP.  That is really what we were pushing against.<\/p> <p>  The second point raised by the Deputy is a very good one.  It relates to the appropriate level of the debt ratio we should have bearing in mind that interest rates are especially low.  I made two observations earlier and I will elaborate on them because they are relevant here.  It is a reasonable question and one we plan to think about more - many people are thinking about it carefully.<\/p> <p>  One thing is clear.  We do not know that interest rates are going to stay this low forever.  They could fall further and become increasingly or ultimately negative.  They could increase as well.  We simply do not know.

It is also a good target because it is not too volatile.  My concern is that if we simply looked at interest payments, which are low, we would miss this point about the riskiness of the position we are in.<\/p> <p>  The position of Ireland is not the same as a country like the United States.  Ireland is a far smaller economy and far more dependent on external capital.  Its economy is far more volatile too.  Ireland is dependent on far fewer activities than the US.  Ireland has been lucky in recent decades in its growth experience.  We expect that to continue to a degree but it may not happen.  Ireland, therefore, has to be far more cautious than the US, Germany, France or Italy for that matter.  That is an important point.<\/p> <p>  The second point is that there are limits to looking at the debt ratio.  This is why the council published its long-term sustainability report this summer.  Basically, the report showed that if we got debt on a downward path but nothing was done about pensions and increasing health costs, then essentially the debt ratio would fall to not much below 100% of GNI*.  Then, from the mid 2030s it would start to pick up.  These pension issues are big as well.  It would be a mistake to focus too much on the debt without taking into account these big long-term fiscal pressures that may come from an ageing population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I was going to come to pensions.<\/p><p>I was going to say in respect of post-Covid challenges there is a section of the report dealing with demographic changes.

Really, secular stagnation is a concept relating to the global economy or the advanced countries within the global economy.  Ireland's trajectory may be different.  The reason we see slower growth is essentially that there is lower productivity in the world.  Ireland has reached higher levels of productivity and so its ability to catch up is reduced.  Ireland will also have an ageing population and that will play into growth as well.  It may be that growth simply ends up being lower.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Ryan said, one of the tools that can be used to improve the outcomes of society and long-term fiscal sustainability is an increase in growth.  Obviously, there are many policies that many people have recommended in that sense.  I do not believe we have specific views about that.  Obviously, continuing to invest in education and innovation and continuing to make Ireland an attractive place for businesses and investment are all part of it.  Beyond that we do not have a specific view about how that could be achieved.<\/p> <p>  It is important to remember that growth is not necessarily the solution that people sometimes believe it to be for the public finances.  It could help, but one of the problems with growth or one thing that goes along with many forms of growth is that if wage growth is high as well, it increases the cost of providing public services.  There tends to be a natural offset between the two.  The long-term sustainability of the public finances may be less dependent on growth than many would assume.  This is because in practice wages and welfare rates are likely to track growth.  If there is higher growth, everyone gets higher income, which is a good thing.  However, that does not necessarily generate large amounts of additional fiscal space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":88,"content":"<p>My thanks to Mr. Barnes for that.

The council maintains this forecast is based on a no-policy-change basis.  We know that employers' PRSI contributions in Ireland are low by EU standards.

More people are reaching pension age because of the demographic trends we have had in the past.  Many people were born in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  As those people reach retirement age there will be major challenges, as noted by Deputy Ryan, in terms of pension sustainability.  There are several solutions.  In fact, the menu is fairly well defined.  One option is to find the money somewhere else in terms of general increases in taxation or reductions in spending.  Within the pensions system or related to it, one option is to raise PRSI contributions.  Another thing would be to adjust the level of pension benefits.  Yet another option would be to raise the retirement age.  A one percentage point increase in PRSI would raise approximately &euro;750 million.  If we relied on that instrument only, we would have to raise PRSI rates by a significant amount to finance the pension system or address the pensions problem in that way.  We will need a broader approach.  As we said in our long-term report, we believe raising the pension age gradually and partially to reflect rising life expectancy would be a natural way of adjusting for this.  It could be done in such a way that people spend the same share of their lives in terms of working and retirement.  The amount of time people could expect in retirement would also be increasing but it would not be increasing as fast as if we held it fixed.  We believe that is an important part of any package, because that is essentially where many of the pressures are coming from.<\/p><p>Tackling that pressure at source is probably a key part of pensions sustainability.  We will see what the Commission on Pensions comes up with.  I am sure it will consider these issues very carefully.<\/p><p> What is striking is life expectancy at 65.  The length of time one can expect to live to the age of 65 is rising by one year every five years.  If we look to our children, they will be living at least five years longer than us or less, depending on which way we are going.  These are major changes.  I do not think we realise that looking at it every year but life expectancy is increasing very fast.  That is where many of the pressures in the public finances will come from and that would seem a key part of any package to address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#U00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I have some questions.

Could he unpack that for me, so to speak, and explain what that looks like in terms of local government and commercial semi-State bodies?  I presume that when he refers to extra spending he is talking about Supplementary Estimates.  In that context, I am on the health committee, which had a meeting last week.

The areas we are trying to look at are local government spending and teasing out exactly where the spending is going in that sector.  Thankfully, the Department has published a bit more information on that but because it is still very limited, we cannot say how much of the spending that has been ramped up this year will be permanent versus temporary.  In addition, non-commercial semi-State bodies are also included.  If we think of all of the IT companies, technological universities, RT&Eacute; and Irish Rail, those are the types of bodies whose spending from year to year is fairly predictable but every now and then we could see a sudden ramp-up for whatever reason.  We do not know why it has increased this year but we suspect that it is probably linked to investment plans.  That could be a temporary increase or a long-lasting one.  We just do not know.<\/p> <p>  There are other parts as well, including what are referred to as extra budgetary funds.  The Chairman is probably aware of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, which is a large fund that was set up with a commercial mandate to invest in the domestic economy to boost growth.  There is spending from that as well that could be identified in general Government expenditure but we do not know how much.  There are many unknowns and as we said, it is up to one fifth of all Government spending so it is very large.

During the Supplementary Estimate process at the health committee last week, the Minister accepted that a considerable proportion of the spending will add to the base year on year.  I do not forecast a good answer for this budgetary oversight committee if we cannot unpack something like non-voted expenditure over the lifetime of a Government.<\/p><p> Mention was made earlier of the spending review process in its current format and how it is utilised in other jurisdictions as a way to prioritise spending but also to consider obsolescence.

A number of countries do it in different ways.  The Netherlands is the outstanding example of how to do it.  Currently, we have a process where IGs, the evaluation service, could be used more effectively.  It did much good work on forecasting and describing what is going on in the public sector, which we do find useful, but it is not the same as the kind of process we would see in the Netherlands.  The Netherlands look very closely at different programmes.  Different countries can do it different ways.  All the spending can be tested at the same time or have a regular programme of going through it.  It is important to look at the priority areas.  One of the aspects I recall from the past is that sometimes the areas that were taken out for reviews were not the obvious areas we would look at.  They were areas that were quite small and where one would think the scope for significant savings was quite low.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman said, there are two aspects of this.  One is to look at the way spending is allocated between different activities and the other one is to look within activities to see whether there is scope to do things differently.  In this tougher fiscal environment that we will be in choices will be more difficult.  If there is scope on the spending side we might spend less money on activities that are lower priority and that may reflect priorities set a long time ago and see where there is scope to increase cost efficiencies.  It is very useful to use that scope because it then freezes up resources for other areas and, from our perspective, it reduces the pressure on the public finances to borrow more just because we can find the money through what we are doing already.  My understanding from other countries is that those kinds of reviews are most effective.  It is easier to do things to do with prioritisation or setting the parameters of existing policies.  It is much harder sometimes to go into the nitty-gritty of the efficiency.  The Dutch example is very useful.  They have significant expertise in doing this.  They ask some hard questions of themselves about what they are doing.  That kind of process would hugely strengthen the public finances in general.  One of the mechanisms through which that works would be through strengthening the oversight procedure.  It would give the committee the analysis it needs to ask the questions it wants to ask.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barnes.

In the short run, for this year we have had exceptional circumstances under the EU rules.  That has been very welcome.  It looks as if that will continue next year, which is also appropriate.  Where we go to after that is a big question.  In principle, the rules will come back into play.  Ireland is likely to be in an excessive deficit procedure at that point.  It looks as if they will still go into this procedure despite the fact that there are exceptional circumstances.<\/p> <p>  Exactly how all that will look in one year or two years' time is very hard to tell, both in terms of how the EU might look at its rules and the way it might enforce them, but also in terms of some of the technical issues such as the way it measures the structural balance.  It is very hard to know where that will be.  The EU looks at issues in GDP terms.  For Ireland, that means the rules apply in a slightly different way from other countries.  One of the issues we are mindful of is that it may be that the rules are not too loose for Ireland at that point, partly because of this GDP issue and perhaps because of other issues.  We do not know whether that will be the case but it is a risk; there is a risk on the other side as well.

It is difficult to predict exactly what the rules will be but what is done should be the spirit of those rules.  That is why the council promoted a principles-based approach to implementing the rules.  The debt ratio should be thought about in this context.  It is a good target.  Particularly in the context where the debt ratio is very high, it is a very good objective.  It is also something that moves in a relatively predictable way.  As a medium-term target, it is quite good.  In light of this, the Government can set intermediate objectives through its budgets.  It can show how it plans to get to that level of the debt ratio.  It can be a good focal point for policy over the coming years.<\/p><p> There have been a couple of attempts at having a debt target in recent years.

It is a great idea for the committee to consider such matters.  There are three aspects on which it should be seeking information regarding the budget.  Better, clearer costings on the spending side are desirable.  Every year, just before the budget, we get a ready reckoner from the Revenue Commissioners.  It gives a really clear sense of how much a 1% increase in the standard income tax rate and other such measures would raise.  On the spending side, however, there is much less information.  I am aware that people get this information in dribs and drabs from the Department but it would be better to have something along the lines of what the Revenue Commissioners produce, which is very transparent.<\/p> <p>  A second point concerns the walk.  We have mentioned the so-called walk from the Exchequer spending, which is what many of the budgetary publications have focused on traditionally, and the question of how one gets from there to the extra fifth of spending in general government terms, which is the wider measure we are interested in.  That expenditure should be presented in gross terms.  It is really useful for us, members and others to see in very clear gross terms what exactly is being spent and the revenue being taken in.  All we have at the moment is a net picture, which does not allow us to understand the goings-on.<\/p> <p>  On a somewhat self-promotional point, the standstill scenario we develop at council level is a really useful tool for understanding what is happening the budget from year to year.  We are aware that there will be major increases in spending linked to public services already provided and the public service payments and social welfare payments that we provide.  It is a question of how much extra the Government would be spending on those types of categories if it were to do nothing in its budget in 2021.  The question is linked to determining the demographic changes and the general rates of inflation in the economy.  If prices and wages were rising, what would it cost to increase public sector wages in line with those increases, and how much would it cost to raise social welfare and pension payments in line with them?  If that clear picture were provided by the Departments, we would have a really good sense of how much space would be left over for new measures given general growth in the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2020120800002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eddie Casey"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":101,"content":"<p>That is interesting.

At that point Vote 45 for this Department was established and &euro;2.3 billion was moved from the Department of Education in line with the functions that transferred to this Department along with approval of some &euro;173 million in additional funding for the Vote.  It was highlighted to the committee at that stage that the intention was to return to seek consideration of additional funding required for a once-off student support initiative.  The idea was that this would be dealt with subsequently through the Supplementary Estimates process and this is reason we are here today.  The 2020 Supplementary Estimate currently before the committee relates exclusively to the additional &euro;43.5 million expenditure from the Vote in 2020 to implement the once-off Covid-19 student assistance fund for the academic year 2020-2021 announced as part of budget 2021 and agreed at the Government meeting of 17 November.<\/p> <p>  The Department has been conscious of the impact the pandemic has had on our students.

This level of uncertainty and the additional pressure on our third level students have been difficult and require significant financial, operational and well-being supports.  In recognition of the challenges facing third level students, the Government has approved once-off funding to provide additional financial assistance in this academic year.  This is projected to cost some &euro;43.5 million based on current estimated student numbers.  To pave the way for addressing this uncertainty and pressure, financial and mental, on our students a range of measures have been provided in 2020 through this once-off ring-fenced additional funding provision.  This once-off fund in 2020 will provide financial assistance at this unprecedented time to approximately 170,000 students in our third level sector.  This funding builds on the measures announced as part of Covid financial supports for the sector in July.  Elements of this funding assisted students through the provision of laptops for disadvantaged students and increasing the student assistance fund.<\/p> <p>  The Department has engaged intensively with the Higher Education Authority, Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, and key stakeholders such as the Irish Universities Association, the Technological Higher Education Association and Technological University Dublin in developing this process.  As part of this process it has been critical to acknowledge the limited timeframe for distribution of this funding in 2020 and the necessity that existing processes need to be utilised.  Officials in the Department continue to engage with these stakeholders in the roll-out of the funding.  Measures are being put in place to mitigate the risks of duplicate payments and to ensure appropriate levels of governance in line with the guidelines for SUSI and the higher education providers.<\/p> <p>  This once-off ring-fenced funding allocation for 2020 will not have any long-term impact on SUSI grant provision or other student services and will not alter the review of SUSI which is being developed.  The Covid student assistance fund will provide financial assistance to all full-time third level students in publicly funded institutions in recognition of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Therefore, in cases of more than one third level student per family, each student will be entitled to receive the full &euro;250 amount.  I thank the committee again for its consideration of this Supplementary Estimate and I am happy to engage on any issues which members wish to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2020120800002#A00400","speaker":"1493"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":115,"content":"<p>As I said at the outset, the first questioner is Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh.

It was inevitable that the full amount has not been spent given the Covid context.  We are also aware of the programme for Government commitments on the need for housing and the need to retrofit housing, leading to an increased need for tradespeople in the coming years.  This is outside today's discussion and the Minister of State may not be able to provide detail on it.  Are we planning ahead to address that shortage in tradespeople?

I do not have the exact amount for mental health supports but I think it was &euro;3.4 million to fund additional mental health supports in each of our institutions through their support services to engage additional psychologists and counsellors to provide extra capacity for students, particularly in the pandemic year.<\/p><p>Our agricultural colleges were raised in this committee and in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  The agricultural colleges do not come under our remit but come under the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine.  In recent days, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine has made &euro;200,000 available for a hardship fund for students attending agricultural colleges to cover mental health supports and the purchase of IT equipment or Internet connectivity.

A &euro;3,000 incentive is being offered to employers to take on an apprentice, with I believe &euro;1,000 on signing on and &euro;2,000 after a year - it might be <i>vice versa<\/i>.  That incentive has been very popular and has been extended to the middle of next year when it will be reviewed.  It has been quite attractive in encouraging employers to take on apprentices.  I believe about 700 apprentices have been engaged through that incentive to date. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2020120800002#C00900","speaker":"1493"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I welcome this funding, which represents a positive development.  Earlier the Minister of State mentioned an additional &euro;20 million for SUSI grants.<\/p><p>That is certainly welcome but, on a connected matter, will the threshold regarding the amount of money students in part-time work can earn be increased?  I understand it is currently &euro;4,500, which is very low.  This also leads to a disincentive for students to find part-time work to help fund their education.  The Minister of State may not have that information here today but I would be grateful if it could be provided in writing.<\/p><p> On the issue with which we are presented today, students who get the SUSI grant get a top-up of &euro;250 while students who do not get that grant get a credit note of &euro;250.  There is a difficulty with that.  A constituent contacted me on this matter.  It is welcome that the students will receive this payment of &euro;250 before Christmas but my constituent raised the issue of qualifications for this payment.  It has been stated that this money will be given via a top-up in the SUSI maintenance grant or by way of credit note for students who are not in receipt of this payment.  The student concerned will receive a &euro;250 credit note which can be used for on-campus services or any outstanding fees to be paid to third level institutions.  This year alone, this student has paid a &euro;224 student levy contribution to the National University of Ireland, Galway.  He also pays rent of &euro;475 a month in Galway.  He is therefore not in a position to use that once-off student support grant of &euro;250, which would be of great help to him.  <\/p><p> The sense I get from him is that, by giving some students the &euro;250 cash sum on top of the regular maintenance grant, another barrier to education has effectively been created.  Most students, regardless of the SUSI fees grant, will have their fees paid off by now either with money earned working full time throughout the pandemic or with a loan they have secured.  Campuses around the country are closed and there is little to no hope of colleges reopening after Christmas.  On top of this, for final year students like my constituent, a &euro;250 credit note will not mean much as such students may not be returning to full-time education next year once they graduate.  Will the Minister of State look at this issue to see if something can be done in the interest of fairness?  The &euro;250 is obviously very welcome but, in order to improve the situation for some students such as my constituent, I would be grateful if the Minister of State could look at the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2020120800002#C01000","speaker":"1592","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

By giving students who are not in receipt of a SUSI grant a credit against their next semester fees, future fees or other on-campus charges, we are trying to avoid having to create a whole new payments system and all of the grief involved in obtaining technology, setting up a system, the tendering process and hiring.

We are now putting an emphasis on this aspect of education, which was previously swamped in the larger Department.  The traditional Department of Education can now focus on the primary and secondary sectors and on other bits under its remit while we can speak to the Minister, Deputy Harris, and to the Minister of State regarding this specific area.

I do not want to put the Minister of State in the position of making predictions with regard to how we should proceed but there are certainly a number of pinch points in the system.

Meanwhile, there is a feeling that there is too great a burden on the individual student or on his or her family.<\/p> <p>  As was alluded to earlier, those of our political persuasion have a vision of free education or education funded exclusively by the taxpayer.  The previous Government ruled out any sort of student loans scheme quite strongly.

There is no quick fix or easy answer.  It is not as simple as saying that a given ideological position is much better than any other.  I remember when this idea first came to the fore, which I myself benefited from, the argument was made that families who would have spent money on third level education would spend it instead on fee-paying schools to which they would not previously have had access.  The argument was that it would only benefit the middle class and that it would not open third level education up to a whole cohort of students who had previously been locked out.  It is arguable whether that was actually the case.  <\/p> <p>  As to the future funding of third level education generally, will the Minister of State comment as to how effective this new Department will be in driving that debate?

One of the matters mentioned by the provost and president was that when it comes to deciding whether remote learning should take place, the decision is to be made by the individual lecturer.  Obviously, individual lecturers should have a significant say in this regard but I am concerned that they would have ultimate control over whether students come back on campus or continue with remote learning.  Fortunately, this is an historic day because we have seen the first people on the island vaccinated against Covid-19.  I hope that early next year we will have vaccination rolled out, which will ensure people who are less vulnerable, such as young students, can get back on campus.  What is the view of the Minister of State, the Department and the officials on trying to ensure that we get more people back on campus?  Is it an important priority for them?

I caution everybody on their optimism.  When the vaccine starts to roll out here, and the indication seems to be that it will be early in the new year, we will all have to avail of two doses two weeks apart.  We will be doing the equivalent of vaccinating the population twice, so it will be a big logistical operation.

By way of introduction, I am a principal officer in the EU and international planning regulation section within the planning division of the Department.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mr. Paul Lemass, assistant secretary of the housing policy legislation and governance division, and Mr. Paul Hogan, principal planning adviser in the Department, who is visible on the video link.  Mr. Lemass will give a short opening statement on the proposed amendments relating to the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2020, and Mr. Hogan will also be available, if required, to answer questions on the practical operation of section 11(3)(b) provisions.<br\/><br\/>I will briefly outline the two main elements of the Planning and Development Bill 2020, as passed by the Seanad last week, as well as referencing the two further amendments to be introduced on Committee Stage.  One of those relates to planning legislation and amendments to substitute consent provisions, which I will address, and the other relates to residential tenancy provisions, which will be addressed in Mr. Lemass&rsquo;s opening statement.  These amendments will also require a modification to the Long Title of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>As per the supplementary briefing note circulated to the committee, the Planning and Development Bill 2020 has been brought forward as a matter of urgency in light of the present Covid-19 pandemic to ensure the necessary protections are in place to safeguard the operation of the planning and building control systems.  The purpose of the Planning and Development Bill 2020, as passed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann, was twofold.  First, it amended section 11(3)(b) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which is the principal Act, in respect of the mandatory requirement to hold public meetings on a proposed development plan at the early issue stage.  Second, the Bill allows the Government to make orders during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic to extend certain statutory periods applying under the Planning and Development Acts and Building Control Acts.<br\/><br\/>The Bill will amend section 11(3)(<i>b<\/i>) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to replace the mandatory requirement to hold public meetings on a proposed development plan at the &quot;issues stage&quot; of the process, which is before any draft plan has been produced, with the positive obligation for planning authorities to consult with members of the public, in such manner as they consider appropriate, and to invite submissions in writing from members of the public on a proposed development plan.  Following a Government Committee Stage amendment in the Seanad, which was made for the avoidance of doubt, this public consultation by the planning authority shall include the public holding of a meeting or an online public meeting.  In other words, as part of a planning authority&rsquo;s statutory obligation to consult with the public in respect of the commencement of the two-year draft development plan process, some format of public meeting will always be required under section 11(3)(<i>b<\/i>) at the initial pre-draft stage of the development plan process, by way of either a public meeting attended by the public in person or an online public meeting.<\/p><p>Once the Covid-19-related public meeting restrictions have passed, a planning authority could hold both an online meeting as well as an in-person meeting if it wished.<br\/><br\/>This amendment is immediately required to address present restrictions on public gatherings during the pandemic, which may impact on the progression of development plans during the pandemic.  It is also in line with the modernisation agenda for the planning system, to improve accessibility and inclusiveness through increased online activity and to ensure continued flexibility in communicating with the public at the initial pre-draft stage of the development plan process, and will therefore be a permanent amendment.<br\/><br\/>I now move to emergency periods in section 3, as passed by the Seanad.  The purpose of this provision is to allow the Government to make orders, during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic, which would extend certain statutory periods applying under the Planning and Development Acts and Building Control Acts.  This contingency measure is urgently required so that public participation elements of the planning regime, and certain decision making and enforcement systems of the building control regime, are not compromised in the event that further waves of Covid-19 infections may necessitate a further period of stay at home travel restrictions, or indeed may critically impact on the operation of individual planning authorities.This measure broadly mirrors the recently expended section 251A of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as inserted by section 9 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020, which was in turn modelled on similar provisions in section 251 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 that covers the Christmas period.  That extends the timelines of the planning Act from Christmas day through to new year&rsquo;s day.  That happens every year.  <br\/><br\/>However, the present provision includes new flexibilities as follows.  More than one extension period order may be made within the confined operative period for this general scheme, which is due to end on 9 June 2021, by virtue of it being linked to the operation of Part 3 of the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020; extension orders can now be applied not only to the whole country, but to specific administrative areas as required; and the Government, at the request of the Minister, may choose which statutory periods, in which specific legislative provision, they require to extend rather than applying the extension to all periods under the Planning Acts and the specified provisions of the Building Control Acts.<br\/><br\/>In terms of which legislative periods might be extended, an order could, for example, apply to the Planning Acts and not the Building Control Acts, or <i>vice versa<\/i>, or, if required, an order might apply to specific periods within Acts, particularly those with public participation objectives, such as the public consultation periods in planning applications, planning appeals, or in the adoption of statutory plans, such as city or county development plans, local area plans or variations to those plans.  That would have to be decided at the time a decision would be made, assuming the legislation is passed.  <br\/><br\/>The recently expended section 251A of the Planning and Development Act 2000 introduced a similar disregard provision for statutory periods during the first lockdown earlier this year, in which case the Government Order made under section 251A lasted for 8 weeks, from the end of March until 23 May 2020 and applied to all relevant statutory periods in the Planning Acts as well as to specified provisions in the Building Control Act.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that while this proposed legislation may never be used, it is still an essential temporary safeguard that is urgently needed for as long as the pandemic persists, to provide an agile and flexible process to ensure that the integrity of the planning and building control systems are maintained in the event of further waves of infection.<br\/><br\/>I will conclude on the proposed Committee Stage amendments relating to substitute consent provisions in the Planning and Development Acts.  As I set out last week at a session with the committee online, in order to the comply with the findings of the Supreme Court judgment of 1 July 2020, it is necessary to amend the substitute consent provisions at Part XA of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to provide for &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; to be considered in an application for substitute consent at section 177K of the Planning Act, along with the necessary ancillary provisions to ensure additional public participation, where required, is facilitated with respect to the consideration of exceptional circumstances at the leave to apply stage, as well as on the wider application.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, following the introduction of these highly technical proposed amendments, any new applications for substitute consent which are made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la must demonstrate exceptional circumstances and, in turn, the board must be satisfied that such circumstances exist, while also complying with the existing public participation requirements of sections 177K and 177H of the Planning Act and prescribed by regulations under section 177N.<\/p><p>Section 177K of the Act, which relates to the decision of the board on substitute consent, will also be amended to provide for additional public participation where required on exceptional circumstances and on the wider application where an application for substitute consent is currently pending before the board.  This legislation will deal not only with new applications but applications currently before the board upon the enactment of these amendments.  This is to ensure that applications for substitute consent which have already been submitted to the board but not yet decided are subject to a requirement to satisfy that exceptional circumstances exist so that applicants are given the opportunity to provide any further information to this effect and so that the public, prescribed bodies and those who have already made submissions on the application are notified of, and can make submissions on, the application, including on whether exceptional circumstances exist in this regard. <br\/><br\/>The introduction of these technical amendments to existing substitute consent provisions is a matter of urgency, noting that these provisions will facilitate the earlier resolution of the terms of the EU Court of Justice judgment in case C-261\/18, the Commission <i>v.<\/i>Ireland, which found against Ireland.  This case followed on from case C-215\/06, also known as the Derrybrien Wind Farm case.  In this regard, it is noted that the power of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to issue a decision on the Derrybrien Wind Farm substitute consent application currently before it has been called into question following the Supreme Court judgment.  It is further noted that the State must pay fines of &euro;15,000 per day to the European Commission as a result of the judgment in case C-261\/18, which effectively is the follow-on Derrybrien case, which judgment was published in November 2019, until the terms of that judgment are met.  For information, since the judgment was issued the State has paid a lump sum fine of &euro;5 million to the Commission in respect of this case, as well as a further &euro;2.745 million in daily fines relating the first six month period since the judgment date.<br\/><br\/>The introduction of these technical amendments to substitute consent provisions is a matter of urgency for the planning system in general and is not just to do with Derrybrien as it as a vital element of a functioning economy which needs to have measures in place as soon as possible that are legally compliant with the EIA directive to facilitate applications to seek to regularise the planning status of large scale developments, which are subject to EIA, in exceptional circumstances, if required. <br\/><br\/>Mr. Paul Hogan and I will endeavour to answer any questions that the Chairman or committee members might have with respect to the three planning elements of the proposed Bill and Mr. Paul Lemass will endeavour to answer questions on the residential tenancies element of the Bill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly and I invite Mr. Lemass to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#D00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607385600,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for this opportunity to further brief them on the proposed D&aacute;il Committee Stage amendments to the Planning and Development Bill 2020 in relation to proposed additional protections under the Residential Tenancies Acts.  I am accompanied by Mr. Liam Smyth, assistant principal, from the rental market policy unit, who is connecting remotely to this session.  I would like also to recognise the tremendous support and forbearance that this committee, and its predecessor, has afforded the Department since March in introducing urgent, complex and significantly enhanced tenancy protections during the pandemic.  This will be the fourth time in 2020 that the Oireachtas has been asked to make legislative changes relating to the Residential Tenancies Acts, namely, Part 2 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 in March providing a moratorium on evictions and rent increases during Covid-19 to 1 August; the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 in July providing more targeted tenancy protections for those in rent arrears due to Covid-19 to 10 January - up to end November 2020 - 348 tenant declaration have been made to gain the protections under this Act; the Residential Tenancies Act 2020 in October to protect tenants from evictions when people&rsquo;s movement is restricted to within 5 km of their homes; and the proposed Part 3 of the Planning and Development Bill 2020 in December to again, provide targeted tenancy protections, subject to certain conditions, for those in rent arrears due to Covid-19 to 12 April.<\/p> <p>  The proposed new provisions will operate, subject to certain conditions, from 11 January 2021 to 12 April 2021 to provide enhanced protections for those tenants who are facing rent arrears due to Covid-19 and, as a result, are at risk of losing their tenancy.  Similar to the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020, if a tenant&rsquo;s ability to pay rent has been impacted by Covid-19 and the tenant meets specific criteria, new procedures and protections apply under these new provisions.  Tenants who follow these procedures cannot be required to vacate their rental accommodation before 13 April 2021 and are not required to pay any rent increase in respect of the period ending 12 April 2021.  Where a tenant makes the required written declaration to the RTB and his or her landlord to avail of the enhanced tenancy protections from 11 January 2021 to 12 April 2021, he or she will be required at the same time to serve a notice on the RTB requesting it to assist him or her to obtain advice from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS; and within five days of making the declaration, the tenant will also be required to serve a notice on their landlord requesting a consultation to agree rent payment arrangements.<\/p><p> New conditions apply to these new tenancy protections that are designed to better balance the legal rights of tenants and landlords, taking account of the Constitution.  The opportunity is being provided in this Bill to allow a landlord to make a counterdeclaration to disapply the new protections on foot of the financial hardship that they would cause for the landlord.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for facilitating this briefing and both Mr. Smyth and I will answer any questions that members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Lemass","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lemass.

It is racing away from us a little, but we have had the benefit in the Seanad of having had the Bill come through, so I appreciate the time and support that the Department officials have given us in the Seanad.<\/p> <p>  I am concluding that, at heart, these amendments are looking to assert a couple of values for the public, one being the value of public participation, public information, and protecting their rights and participation in the planning process, which is all very valuable.  On the requirement around the county and city development plans, it is important that the legislation would assert at a very early stage in the statutory process, in fact at the pre-draft stage in the process, the requirement on every local authority to have a public meeting to consult the public.  The Bill, in this instance, reflects our evolving environment and asserts the facility of an online meeting.  It is important that we recognise that a development plan process lasts two years.  There is a pre-draft consultation and a report on that, there is a draft plan and consultation on that, and there is a plan and there is consultation on that.  It is very important that we do not ignore all of the other elements of consultation that take place and that are conducted, both formally and informally, by the elected members with the support of the executive functions of the local authorities.  The extension of the Covid periods for the planning and building regulations process is practical and valid.<\/p> <p>  On the third element, the substitute consent, this has gone on since July.  Is it purely down to the fact that a Government had not been formed that this matter has not been dealt with?  It is coming up to &euro;10 million of a cost for the State.  Will the witnesses clarify whether there was no earlier opportunity for the State to deal with this matter?<\/p> <p>  I support the contention that anybody applying for retrospective permission for a project that required an environmental impact assessment has acted with a level of disregard and negligence that needs to be criticised and called out.  It is welcome that it will have to be demonstrated that there is an exceptional need and qualification for the project to be considered.  Will the witnesses also talk through how the public will engage in having their say?  In those instances the public good will have been largely ignored if the project has gone ahead without an environmental impact assessment that should have been a requirement.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the residential tenancies amendments, the extension to 3 April of the ban on evictions and the ban on rent increases is very welcome.  It was mentioned that there had been 340 tenant declarations under the previous legislation.  Is that the latest number to date?  Will the witnesses confirm that for the tenants who are unfortunate enough to find themselves in these circumstances and who want or need to make a declaration, they will be able to do that via email using plain English and will not need to engage the services of a legal professional, be it a solicitor, public notary or anybody like that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#E00300","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

The judgment was issued by the Supreme Court in July.  We engaged immediately with the Office of the Attorney General.  We have been working with it in terms of drafting and getting legal advice and we continue to do so.  Off the top of my head, 11, 12 or 13 other judicial reviews followed immediately after that case, so we were addressing those issues.  As I mentioned, it had been our understanding from the Attorney General that because this was directly implementing the provisions of the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive, we would be using a regulation under the 1972 Act to which I referred that is used to transpose directives.  It was not until Thursday of the week before last that the Attorney General advised us to go into primary legislation.  To answer the Senator's question, it was following much the same course.  If it had gone through the 1972 regulations, it would have been done around now anyway.  We are conscious of it every day that goes by in terms of fines we have to pay.  I do not know whether that answers the Senator's question.  In effect, it was moved into this legislative process on legal advice.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of how the public can engage in substitute consent generally, the best way of explaining it is that it is effectively a form of planning application, for want of a better comparison.  It is where the developer has to put forward a remedial environmental impact assessment report which, in effect, takes into account what went before.  The developer submits it to the competent authority, namely, An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is like a normal application in that there are site notices and newspaper notices and members of the public get to engage.  That is what we were building into the provisions.<\/p> <p>  It is very complicated to read, but even for applications that are currently in the system there are two steps or stages as it currently stands in the context of substitute consent.  One is that there first has to be an assessment of whether the circumstances are exceptional.  If the board agrees they are exceptional, it goes to the next stage, which is the substantive piece.  We are now retrofitting back into the first step that there has to be public participation and it would bring it forward into the second step that there has to be consideration of exceptional circumstances.  In effect, if a member of the public already submitted information on an application that is currently before the board, they will get a second chance when this legislation goes through.  The best way of describing it is that it is like a normal planning application, for want of a better comparison, in terms of public participation rights and the fact that people can write to the board and the board must take account of their views.  I hope that answers the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607385600,"counter":199,"content":"<p>On the protections which run to 12 April, we have had 348 notices to the end of November, so the figure is relatively up to date.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of how a tenant can make the declaration, email is provided for.

A person does not have to fill in two separate pieces of paper; it will all be on one piece of paper.

This is the fifth year in a row in which, in the final two weeks before the summer recess, very substantial planning and residential tenancies amendment legislation has been dropped into existing Bills that are before the D&aacute;il.  There are several problems with that.  None of the points I will make are a criticism of either of the officials who are present.  They are experiencing these problems in as acute a way as members of the committee are experiencing them.  These are incredibly technical matters.  The job of the committee is meant to be to scrutinise this legislation in the public interest to make sure it does what the witnesses are telling us it does and that it does not have unintended consequences.<\/p><p>The lesson of the Derrybrien case is that if proper scrutiny had been introduced when the original legislation was being passed by this House, we would not have paid possibly &euro;10 million in fines so far.  I will come to it in questions, but I expect that the fines will reach many multiples of that figure by the time the matter is resolved.  In my view, it is really unacceptable for members of the committee to be given very detailed technical amendments.  I have been told in an email that I have just received that we must submit our amendments to this Bill on Thursday of this week, and we are going to be asked to complete all Stages of the Bill - Second and Subsequent Stages - in a single day, on Wednesday of next week, which means that the guillotine procedure will be used and we will have a very small amount of time available to us.  We have been denied the opportunity to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny or even time to inform ourselves by engaging with others, so I want to state my extreme dissatisfaction at this situation.  <\/p><p> This may also be a lesson to us in respect of two Bills that we are currently considering, namely, the water environment (abstractions) Bill 2020 and the marine planning and development management Bill 2020, because with both of those Bills, sectoral opinion have raised significant concerns about potential non-compliance with the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive and the Water Framework Directive itself, and the issues are very similar to those we are dealing with here - public participation and compliance.  We are being asked to assist in fixing a problem and we are being given a tiny amount of time to do it.  If we make a mess of this, millions more euro of taxpayers' money will be paid out in fines on this or future cases, so the stakes are exceptionally high.  My specific questions relate to substitute consent because my colleague, Deputy Gould, will deal with the other sections of the Bill.<\/p><p> I ask the witnesses to provide greater clarity as to why the Attorney General only suggested at the last moment that this needed to be done by way of primary legislation and not through a statutory instrument.  Was the Attorney General consulted earlier, and was there originally Attorney General support for a statutory instrument and what changed?  If we pass this Bill in the next two weeks, can the witnesses tell us when will the board be expected to make a decision on the Derrybrien case, and what is the anticipated total amount of fines that will be incurred by the State between last October when the fines kicked in at &euro;15,000 per day, and when a decision is made?  Can they tell us how many other substitute consent applications are currently in the process and will be affected by this?  Also, what happens with the substitute consent applications that were approved under the old regime?  Are they now open to legal challenge or in any way undermined because of the Supreme Court judgment?  <\/p><p> I want to be very clear on the issue of public consultation.  If this Bill is passed, does that mean that for all of the current pending substitute consent applications with the board, there will now be a new round of public consultation in all of those, and will all documentation and information that has been submitted, whether in public or private session today to the board, be available in respect of them?<\/p><p> I am still trying to understand the exceptionality test, therefore, I ask the witnesses to explain that to me in plain English.  Is it now that there is public participation in the first phase, and will public participation continue in the second phase in the exceptionality test?  I ask the witnesses to talk us through that in more detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#F00400","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607385600,"counter":202,"content":"<p>On the first question, concerning the decision to move from a statutory instrument to primary legislation, it was a decision of the Attorney General with whom we were engaging throughout on a daily and weekly basis.  Our focus was on drafting, and my understanding is that a legal decision was made as a matter of prudence, to reduce the potential for future judicial reviews.  The original legislation was introduced by way of primary legislation, so my understanding is that was the thinking behind the decision.<\/p> <p>  On the question of how long the Derrybrien case will take, as it currently stands, there are no specific timelines for An Bord Plean&aacute;la and there are no statutory timelines.  There are statutory objective periods in all cases for An Bord Plean&aacute;la, generally of 18 weeks.  Our Minister is prohibited from getting involved in any case under section 30, but in terms of information, my understanding is that in the Derrybrien case the application was lodged by a company owned by ESB in August, and An Bord Plean&aacute;la had indicated it on its website that it was due to decide on the case in January, so that is a timeframe of around about six months.  It is not for me to anticipate how long the board is going to take, but given that there would have to be a further public participation element to it, one might extrapolate from that, that it might be the middle of next year before a decision is made.<\/p><p>As I set out in the briefing note there are in and around 15 applications that have not yet been decided at the leave stage, and there are some 20 applications that are pending in the second, substantive stage.

I think the matter relating to planning is clear.<\/p> <p>  There are two stand-alone processes.  In a situation where a tenant makes a declaration and a landlord makes a counterdeclaration, the tenant has applied for certain protections and the landlord, who also claims to be suffering from hardship, wants to resist the granting of this protection.  It does not go any further than that.  The landlord can pursue an eviction through a separate process called a \"notice of termination\".  The notice periods for that process are prescribed.  If a landlord does not subsequently make a notice of termination, the tenancy is not terminated.  The protection for the tenant, the notice periods and the ability to raise a dispute as part of a termination process continue to apply.  If a declaration is made by a tenant and a counterdeclaration is made by a landlord, the landlord may then wish to pursue a notice of termination.  He or she would then have to give the required notice period.  If the tenant feels the landlord is not being fair, he or she can, for this or any other reason, raise a dispute relating to the notice of termination.

Generally speaking, these things are discussed and negotiated at council level.  The problem, as it stands, is that the only option is a public meeting and that format is not particularly suitable to a stage of the process where no proposals are being put forward.  In addition, it tends to give rise to two groups of people.  One group are people looking for something, typically landowners, who may wish to have a rezoning and that cannot even be considered at this stage of the process.  Also, there tend to be people who may be engaged by a planning issue that may have nothing to do with the development plan and, again, they can be frustrated by this stage of the process too.  The public meeting format does not necessarily focus on the issues at hand.

I have been involved in three county development plans.  I am sure most of those present have been involved in a development plan at some point.  I am very unhappy with this amendment.  I will focus on section 2 of the Bill which relates to section 11 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the county development plans issue because although there has been reference today to this being done by consensus, these things do not happen by consensus.  The reality of my experience tells me otherwise.  One must remember this is the earliest stage of a development plan and is exclusively an executive function.  It is not a reserved function at that point of a county development plan.  There is no reserved function at that stage.  I have engaged with councillors across the 31 councils in the past two weeks and I heard the same story from them.<\/p> <p>  I wish to acknowledge the enormous work of the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  It prepared an amazing digest of the Bill that clearly sets out and addresses this issue.  I will be asking the officials to confirm that analysis.  The Bill has not been passed through the Houses, so, as of today, it is obligatory to have a public meeting.  One could call them town hall meetings for these purposes.  I do not have any difficulty embracing technology, which is marvellous.  I think we can have both.  That is where we are losing this argument slightly.  One can have the public town-hall type meetings.  While I would argue that they are beneficial, this should be a matter of negotiation.  That is what happened in the past on numerous occasions.  The public arrive at meetings and the council officials go through the various plans and infographics and tease out the issues.  That is good and positive.  I think online meetings are also good.  It is possible to have both.  However, I am advised that the situation as of today is that under the currently operating legislation it is obligatory to have a public meeting.  I ask the officials to confirm whether that is the case.  Let us have no ambiguity about this issue.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kelly made the valid point that nowhere else in the legislation is there reference to a public meeting.  There is reference to it in this section, although I see that it relates to the reserved aspects of the matter in terms of the early stage of development.  Could a reference to an obligatory public meeting be inserted elsewhere in the legislation, possibly that relating to another part of the development plan process?  It is an important issue.<\/p> <p>  We want ownership of this plan and for people to engage with it.  We do not want a situation whereby the decision to hold a public meeting is made at the discretion of the unelected chief executives of local authorities.  Many committee members have spoken for years about giving greater powers to local people and local communities, yet this provision is going to be taken out of the legislation and that will make it the right solely of chief executives and their executive in each local authority to decide whether to hold a public meeting.  I do not have a difficulty with any other aspect of the Bill.  It is important that we have public participation and engagement and that people are encouraged to take part in the process.<\/p> <p>  I do not like terms such as \"troublemakers\" or \"difficult people\".  There was a suggestion in the Seanad during the passage of the Bill through that House that some difficult people were turning up at public meetings.  So what if they are?  Most Oireachtas Members are difficult people.  We were politicised by issues and we became difficult and challenged people and got ourselves in here.  Are we going to shut it down now?  I want to facilitate people in engagement.  I am old enough to have been involved in the Wood Quay protests.  People, particularly young people, mobilised on that issue, as did environmentalists.  Why should people not be mobilised and have public rallies or robust debates about our towns, communities, future, the planning of our future, challenging environmental issues such as water, and all the diverse elements that form part of a county development plan?  <\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Lemass, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Hogan for their engagement.  I feel strongly on this point.  I am not hung up on the point in the process at which a public meeting is facilitated, but it should take place at a point when it is important that it be held.<\/p><p>There is no point having public meetings if people cannot effect change.  They must be held according to a timeline where people can feed into it.<\/p><p> It has come to my attention that some of the sitting county managers lobbied strongly to have this element changed.  I have prepared a series of detailed freedom of information requests which will go into the Department tomorrow.  It is important to flush that out.  It only makes me more concerned if chief executives have been lobbying for its removal.  That is the kernel of the problem.  There has to be shift to empower the elected members.  I do not want it to be a choice between political members and the executive.  It should be in legislation that there must be a public town hall type meeting.  I am interested in the officials' response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#L00200","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607385600,"counter":247,"content":"<p>It might be more useful to ask Mr. Hogan to respond from his professional experience, mostly on interactions with the County and City Management Association, CCMA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607385600,"counter":248,"content":"<p>The public meeting format is ineffective at this stage of the process.  What is much more useful is what already happens, namely, the provision of information on what the issues for the future might be.  People do not find that is something they can easily relate to in a public meeting format.  It is much more effective as a one-to-one exhibition or engagement.  That is what happens and is what is also used at later stages when there is a draft plan.  When there is no draft to discuss and it is just issues and what might happen in the future, it can be very difficult to mobilise interest from the public over the course of different evenings or weekends, as must be the case when there is a sole reliance on public meetings.  To catch as many people as possible, there must be quite a wide spread of times, formats and locations.  It does not work as effectively as intended in the legislation.  Having an element of choice is the way forward.<\/p> <p>  I am not aware of lobbying.  That did not come to me.  The matter was discussed in the context of engagement with the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, over a response to Covid and the fact that the provision was effectively holding up progress on a plan which had a ticking timeline, where people could not gather to meet, and therefore this had to be addressed.  It is an opportunity to widen the scope of the engagement at the early stage.  I do not share the view that there is an \"us and them\" situation between the elected members and the county and city managers at this stage of the process.  It is a very open and non-controversial stage in the process, or at least it should be, because people are just trying to understand the issues.

I will begin by finishing my response to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question in terms of how exceptionality is considered.  It is set out in the existing provisions at section 177D(2), which states that in considering whether exceptional circumstances exist, the board shall have regard to (a) whether regularisation of the development concerned would circumvent the purpose and objectives of the environmental impact assessment directive or the habitats directive; (b) whether the applicant had or could reasonably have had a belief that the development was not unauthorised, which goes to the intent of the applicant; (c) whether the ability to carry out an assessment of the environmental aspects of the development for the purpose of an environmental impact assessment or an appropriate assessment and to provide for public participation in such an assessment has been substantially impaired; (d) the actual or likely significant effects on the environment or adverse effects on the integrity of a European site resulting from the carrying out or continuation of the development; (e) the extent to which significant effects on the environment or adverse effects on the integrity of a European site can be remediated; (f) whether the applicant has complied with previous planning permissions granted or has previously carried out an unauthorised development; and (g) such matters as the board considers relevant.

There is no public participation in the first stage.  The key change is the introduction of the exceptionality at the second stage where there is public participation.  It is important to make that clear.<\/p> <p>  On engagement with the Commission, we have been engaging with it on these changes.  It is important to note that European law is implemented at national level.  This change is further to a Supreme Court case and not a European Court of Justice case.  This is about the Irish national Supreme Court judgment and that court's interpretation of this legislation.  We are, through the Attorney General, responding to that judgment.

On the issue of safeguards and timeframes, by its definition, the Bill extends existing timeframes.  The whole point of it is that if there is a set period, the Bill extends that period in parallel to the point that there is a new lockdown.  By definition, the extending period relates to the lockdown period.  Its very nature is to ensure that public consultation is preserved.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question on timeframes.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the specificity of various areas, it is absolutely the case that confusion could arise.  As I stated, the provision was not just included to cater for situations where there is a prohibition on members of the public moving freely, there is also the potential of individual authority members being struck down by Covid infection such that they cannot comply with the process.  That is one example we would envisage.  For example, a planning authority may not be able to work through its statutory objectives because its members are infected or have to stay at home or whatever.  As members are aware, in the previous lockdown it was used for the entire country.  I would argue it worked well because it was widely known about by all elements of the planning sector.  We had wide engagement with environmental NGOs and through planning institutes and local authorities.  It was widely publicised not only on our own websites, but also through sectors that are involved in planning generally.  In terms of communication, we will be doing that again.  I do not know whether the Deputy is familiar with what happened on the last occasion.  We do have the good experience of having done this before.  Circulars were sent to all local authorities.  The main point of information was on our public website.  We have a large Covid section for members of the public.  Local authorities also took it upon themselves to put it on their websites.  In some cases, local authorities put notices on their doors.  Mr. Hogan and his team drafted frequently asked questions that were also put online.  To answer the Deputy's question, we will do what we did before, which is to ensure that as wide a populace as possible understands this issue.  The key point in terms of interaction with members of the public is that they are not being restricted.  Their engagement is being elongated.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about e-payments.  That is a different issue.  Other amendments to the planning Acts are being progressed in terms of e-planning.  That is coming in due course.  On e-payments, the whole point is that the Bill allows for the extension of the public participation period when there is a lockdown.  If a person needs to pay &euro;20 to lodge an objection but there is a lockdown, that period is extended such that they can do so when the lockdown ends.  I hope I am explaining it clearly.  I again point out that we used this process before.  All statutory provisions in the planning Acts were extended by eight weeks this year and that will work its way through the system.  It is widely known about by those involved and certainly by all the local authorities.  As I stated, the information is available on all the relevant websites, including local authority websites.

One concerns the balance of rights between the landlord and the tenant.  The second concerns the public consultation issue, which we have been discussing for the last while.  If the landlord and the tenant are both experiencing hardship, who loses out?  How is that determined?  Mr. Lemass gave an explanation when Senator John Cummins asked whether a tenancy is protected when a counter-declaration is made.  I understand that if a landlord makes a counter-declaration and then issues a notice of termination, it is up to the tenant to raise a dispute.  How is that determined?  If a tenant's rights are protected under legislation, how do we see him or her through this process?  It can become quite technical and cumbersome.<\/p> <p>  My second question concerns public consultation.  I do not believe there is anything sinister in this proposal.  I think it is a reaction to Covid-19 and the need for public safety.  However, in any situation we must avoid unintended consequences.  We do not want to give the impression, rightly or wrongly, that we are limiting public engagement or the autonomy of elected councillors.  It is quite clear from the contributions made today and in the previous debate in the Seanad that there are serious concerns around this.  We should reflect those concerns in the language.  A sunset clause should be attached to the either-or provision in this Bill.  That provision is there to get us through Covid-19.  When we are living in a Covid-free world - soon enough, please God - it should be allowed to lapse.  Failing that, we should add a caveat to make it clear that it is a decision presented by the executive and approved by the members of the council.  We should trust them to get this over the line and to determine what is in the best interests of their electorate and how best to consult them.  <\/p> <p>  A previous speaker noted that this is the only part of the public consultation process that is prescribed by legislation.  I worry that this might create a precedent for public consultation throughout the development plan.  Mr. Lemass and I worked on the development plan previously.

In 2016, some 470,000 people were renting.  On 23 November, there were 352,000 people on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  Why do the witnesses think that only 348 tenant declarations have been made?  Does someone whose income has been affected by Covid-19, and who can prove it, need to be in rent arrears to avail of a freeze on rent increases?  Must people in that situation consult with the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and follow the other steps?  Are we essentially forcing people into rent arrears and putting their tenancies at risk, when these provisions could instead be made available without those requirements?<\/p> <p>  The planning consultation provisions of the Bill are due to last until June 2021.  Why are the tenancy protections to end in April, and why is provision not given to the Minister to extend those protections, if necessary?  Why was the five-month exemption from rent arrears chosen?  How was this timeframe reached?  Unlike tenants, who must provide evidence of rent arrears, why are landlords automatically considered to be relevant persons if they are receiving any Covid-19-related social welfare payments?  Employers can also subsidise the EWSS up to people's full incomes, yet no provision deals with landlords receiving payment under this scheme, but who have suffered no loss of income.  <\/p> <p>  On the balancing of rights regarding a ban on evictions, I believe this Bill will give the landlord more rights than the tenant in respect of situations where the landlord is receiving any Covid-19-related payment.

On the question regarding why there have been only 348 self-declarations by tenants, all I can tell the Deputy is that we asked, and funded, the RTB to write to all landlords and tenants to make them aware of these protections.<\/p><p>We sent out in the neighbourhood of 400,000 notices because there were 300,000 tenancies but about 100,000 landlords involved.  We wrote to all of the people involved to make them aware of these protections.  That is out there.  We publicise it quite heavily through the RTB, online and in the media but also by writing to registered tenants and landlords and making them aware of it.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked why more people are not availing of the protection.  I can only refer him back to the research the ESRI conducted for us in the middle of this year which pointed to the fact that the temporary payments, plus the decline in consumption patterns because of the lockdown, would have affected the build-up of arrears in the short term.  We then came out of lockdown but later went back into lockdown.  It is borne out by figures that suggest average national savings have gone up and people's wealth has gone up that little bit.  There may be something in all of that because the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and other payments are helping people get through this period.  I cannot say definitively.  I can only speculate based on that evidence.<\/p><p> As regards when the tenant can declare, this part applies to a situation where there is a significant risk of the tenancy of the dwelling being terminated by the landlord.  It is not any more specific than that.  It applies if a tenant feels at risk of arrears and at risk of a tenancy being terminated as a result of them.  The arrears may not have occurred yet but the tenant may know that in the weeks and months to come, because he or she is not working or because of certain financial challenges, he or she is at risk.  That is the situation.  It is a self-declaration but the person has to be accurate in what he or she says in the assessment and it is an offence to make a false declaration.  It is up to the tenant to make that declaration.<\/p><p> Regarding why tenants have to have recourse to MABS, the new provisions require them to request the RTB to facilitate engagement with MABS.  One of our concerns is that there were 348 declarations at the end of November but only seven people had recourse to MABS.  MABS is there to help people.  We want to be sure that people put together workable arrangements with landlords that will endure well beyond these protections.  Someone may have a problem now and may need protection until 11 January, or 12 April, as it is hoped the date will soon be, but that will not be long coming around.  We are keen for people to engage with MABS so they can put in place longer term and more sustainable arrangements.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked about landlords who might have no loss of income and landlords in receipt of the PUP.

I direct the Deputy to the judgment of the RTB in one of the Tyrrelstown cases where it overruled an eviction because it was able to demonstrate that the landlord was still in receipt of rent and would not, therefore, be suffering hardship.  We have consulted the RTB on these protections and they are intended precisely for situations like the Tyrrelstown case where the landlord was prevented from proceeding with the termination because it was demonstrated that the landlord had adequate income and was not suffering the hardship claimed in the declaration.  That is on the record of the RTB as a judgment in the case of what is known as the Tyrrelstown amendment.  We envisage a similar approach here.

Then they are expected to notify the RTB and pass on the data to MABS.  I imagine there are general data protection regulation, GDPR, issues on this and I query that measure.  Has there been consultation with MABS about the additional work it would be required to undertake?  MABS is already very oversubscribed.<\/p><p> There is an attempt to balance landlord and tenant rights.  I would accept that if there was more work around tenants' rights, but the Bill's purpose is about preventing people from having to move during periods of restriction.  I cannot visit my mother in her home today.  That is the environment we are in.  It is not a project about balancing landlord and tenant rights.  We really have not thought out the details of some of the requirements.  Take the expected enactment of legislation on 19 December.  The RTB will write to all those impacted to alert them of their need to lodge an application with the RTB and then MABS, which they must do in five days.  This would mean the RTB sending letters to tenants between 19 December and Christmas Eve.  That is bizarre timing, if nothing else.<\/p><p> Actions are to be taken within five days of the commencement of the Bill on 11 January, that is 16 January, is a short period.  Most places reopen on 2 or 3 January.  It gives a very short time for people who have previously applied for an exemption and who might get a letter from the RTB before Christmas telling them to contact the RTB and apply to MABS by 16 January.  The timing has not been thought out.<\/p><p> I am very concerned by the answers given to Senator Cummins about the measures being disapplied.  The Bill is about giving tenants certainty that they will not have to move around during periods of restriction.  It appears that certainty can be extinguished simply by a landlord making an application.  If a landlord makes a submission to the effect that the rent is his or her sole income, then the tenant no longer has the certainty that he or she cannot be evicted.  I accept that other recourse is given under the normal notice period, but the main provision there is time.  There are no additional rights.<\/p><p> I have no issue with the balancing landlord and tenant rights but that is a longer term project and what is needed here is certainty for tenants.  The five-day period is too short, as are the timelines for the Christmas period, which do not take account of the holiday season.  Data transparency is an issue.  Where a tenant fails to provide the RTB and MABS with the required information and the landlord submits that is the case, then the new protections disapplies.  How does the landlord know?  This Bill is trying to do things that are part of a bigger project.  It will have to be amended.

That is the logic behind the timing.<\/p><p> On the five days to respond requirement, when a declaration is made there are two actions, namely, a declaration is made to the RTB and also a request to the RTB to put the person in touch with MABS.  This happens immediately.  The RTB on receipt of the declaration puts the applicant in touch with MABS.  Separately, the board requests that the applicant engage with the landlord within five days to consult on an arrangement.  The purpose of this is to put an obligation on people to make that happen.  It is not that the agreement has to happen within the five days but a person must engage within five days.  Part of the concern is that with 348 declarations we have only had recourse to seven people going to MABS.  There is an uncertainty as to what others are doing.  We do not know if they have reached agreement or not.  The GDPR issues will be addressed because the applicant, as the tenant, makes the request.

This is where I am going with my question.  Mr. Lemass mentioned that only seven tenants have been referred to MABS.  I refer people to MABS on a weekly basis, and it could take two or three weeks for them to get a meeting, with the process in place.  MABS does fantastic work, but the problem is that people are waiting two or three weeks at the moment to get a meeting, and more people will be using MABS under the protections provided in this legislation.  It is going to put more pressure on MABS, particularly when it comes to getting the information back to tenants in the case of a dispute.  Again, it comes back to the rental issue that we have here.  What supports are available for MABS?  I believe that there is going to be a bigger uptake in this regard as we go forward, because we have not got to the end what is happening at the moment.  This legislation is going to open the floodgates and more people will be going to MABS.  There is a lack of understanding on the part of tenants of where they can go for help and what they have to do.  It will put more pressure on organisations such as MABS.

I accept the Deputy's point that there may be a two to three week delay, which may not be unreasonable in some circumstances.  However, the point of this legislation is that a tenant would have to contact the landlord with a view to working out an arrangement.  As part of that contact, it would be entirely reasonable for the tenant to say that he or she is engaging with MABS as part of that process, and that he or she will conclude the arrangement with the landlord after he or she has engaged with MABS.  MABS could point a tenant in this situation towards rent supplements, for example, and uptake in this support has increased by around 10,000 - I do not have the exact figure, but it is of that order - since the Covid pandemic began.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#W00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Lemass"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":303,"content":"<p>We have gone over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#W00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":304,"content":"<p>The Chair gave everyone else three or four minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#W00300","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":305,"content":"<p>We are on the clock and more people want to come in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#W00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":306,"content":"<p>It will take me 30 seconds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#W00500","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":307,"content":"<p>Go ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#W00600","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":308,"content":"<p>We have just come out of level 5 restrictions, and people have been under the misimpression that they do not have to pay rent.

On the public consultation, it should be noted that public participation and attendance feature in all stages of county development plan sessions in local authority chambers and in submissions, and access is available online.  I have always defended the importance of public access and participation in respect of all planning matters.  The greater the public participation, the greater the likelihood that the outcome from that process is going to be more acceptable and better for all involved.  It does not unduly concern me that a public meeting may now be online or in a town hall, church hall, or wherever it may be.  In fact, I know from working with my own forward planning section in Wicklow, that it may now be possible to have four public meetings in one day, whereas before, it may have taken a week for planners to do this.  Therefore, we must consider the balance between the positives it brings and the perceptions of the negatives it brings, including that some people may not have access to online meetings, although I believe Internet access has improved during lockdown.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Hogan referred to the guidelines for local authorities in development plan processes.  Will that also include guidance on how to conduct a public meeting, and will the facilities, the technical resources and supports be there for local authorities to embrace this straight away?  In general, the move to e-planning is a very positive one, because the planning and development consent processes generate so much paperwork and many files.  The online and e-planning approach is the way to go, provided that each local authority can provide the same standard.  On some local authority websites, the planning system is very hard to navigate, whereas with others, it is much easier to read, and some people prefer to have those paper files in their hands.  Will the guidelines for the local authorities cover the public meeting at the issue stage of the development plan process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#W00800","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607385600,"counter":310,"content":"<p>What we are basically saying is that when that choice is there, it should be in the context of an overall consultation programme, and the guidelines will mandate planning authorities to set out what their consultation programme is at the beginning of the process.

It takes the pressure off having to exclusively have meetings in person.  It is very difficult at times when there is an event on.  Often, people have asked me if I did not know there was a match on the night of a meeting, which might seem like a very small thing but can happen regularly on a Tuesday or Wednesday night when one is trying to hold consultation meetings.  It can be very disheartening for people who turn up and find there are very few people there to discuss the issues.  We think the \"either or\" option is a good idea.  It does not limit it to one or the other.  It does not make that leap from the current system to e-planning without considering the ability to do both.
