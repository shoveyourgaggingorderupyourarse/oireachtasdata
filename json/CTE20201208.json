By way of introduction, I am a principal officer in the EU and international planning regulation section within the planning division of the Department.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mr. Paul Lemass, assistant secretary of the housing policy legislation and governance division, and Mr. Paul Hogan, principal planning adviser in the Department, who is visible on the video link.  Mr. Lemass will give a short opening statement on the proposed amendments relating to the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2020, and Mr. Hogan will also be available, if required, to answer questions on the practical operation of section 11(3)(b) provisions.<br\/><br\/>I will briefly outline the two main elements of the Planning and Development Bill 2020, as passed by the Seanad last week, as well as referencing the two further amendments to be introduced on Committee Stage.  One of those relates to planning legislation and amendments to substitute consent provisions, which I will address, and the other relates to residential tenancy provisions, which will be addressed in Mr. Lemass&rsquo;s opening statement.  These amendments will also require a modification to the Long Title of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>As per the supplementary briefing note circulated to the committee, the Planning and Development Bill 2020 has been brought forward as a matter of urgency in light of the present Covid-19 pandemic to ensure the necessary protections are in place to safeguard the operation of the planning and building control systems.  The purpose of the Planning and Development Bill 2020, as passed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann, was twofold.  First, it amended section 11(3)(b) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which is the principal Act, in respect of the mandatory requirement to hold public meetings on a proposed development plan at the early issue stage.  Second, the Bill allows the Government to make orders during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic to extend certain statutory periods applying under the Planning and Development Acts and Building Control Acts.<br\/><br\/>The Bill will amend section 11(3)(<i>b<\/i>) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to replace the mandatory requirement to hold public meetings on a proposed development plan at the &quot;issues stage&quot; of the process, which is before any draft plan has been produced, with the positive obligation for planning authorities to consult with members of the public, in such manner as they consider appropriate, and to invite submissions in writing from members of the public on a proposed development plan.  Following a Government Committee Stage amendment in the Seanad, which was made for the avoidance of doubt, this public consultation by the planning authority shall include the public holding of a meeting or an online public meeting.  In other words, as part of a planning authority&rsquo;s statutory obligation to consult with the public in respect of the commencement of the two-year draft development plan process, some format of public meeting will always be required under section 11(3)(<i>b<\/i>) at the initial pre-draft stage of the development plan process, by way of either a public meeting attended by the public in person or an online public meeting.<\/p><p>Once the Covid-19-related public meeting restrictions have passed, a planning authority could hold both an online meeting as well as an in-person meeting if it wished.<br\/><br\/>This amendment is immediately required to address present restrictions on public gatherings during the pandemic, which may impact on the progression of development plans during the pandemic.  It is also in line with the modernisation agenda for the planning system, to improve accessibility and inclusiveness through increased online activity and to ensure continued flexibility in communicating with the public at the initial pre-draft stage of the development plan process, and will therefore be a permanent amendment.<br\/><br\/>I now move to emergency periods in section 3, as passed by the Seanad.  The purpose of this provision is to allow the Government to make orders, during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic, which would extend certain statutory periods applying under the Planning and Development Acts and Building Control Acts.  This contingency measure is urgently required so that public participation elements of the planning regime, and certain decision making and enforcement systems of the building control regime, are not compromised in the event that further waves of Covid-19 infections may necessitate a further period of stay at home travel restrictions, or indeed may critically impact on the operation of individual planning authorities.This measure broadly mirrors the recently expended section 251A of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as inserted by section 9 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020, which was in turn modelled on similar provisions in section 251 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 that covers the Christmas period.  That extends the timelines of the planning Act from Christmas day through to new year&rsquo;s day.  That happens every year.  <br\/><br\/>However, the present provision includes new flexibilities as follows.  More than one extension period order may be made within the confined operative period for this general scheme, which is due to end on 9 June 2021, by virtue of it being linked to the operation of Part 3 of the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020; extension orders can now be applied not only to the whole country, but to specific administrative areas as required; and the Government, at the request of the Minister, may choose which statutory periods, in which specific legislative provision, they require to extend rather than applying the extension to all periods under the Planning Acts and the specified provisions of the Building Control Acts.<br\/><br\/>In terms of which legislative periods might be extended, an order could, for example, apply to the Planning Acts and not the Building Control Acts, or <i>vice versa<\/i>, or, if required, an order might apply to specific periods within Acts, particularly those with public participation objectives, such as the public consultation periods in planning applications, planning appeals, or in the adoption of statutory plans, such as city or county development plans, local area plans or variations to those plans.  That would have to be decided at the time a decision would be made, assuming the legislation is passed.  <br\/><br\/>The recently expended section 251A of the Planning and Development Act 2000 introduced a similar disregard provision for statutory periods during the first lockdown earlier this year, in which case the Government Order made under section 251A lasted for 8 weeks, from the end of March until 23 May 2020 and applied to all relevant statutory periods in the Planning Acts as well as to specified provisions in the Building Control Act.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that while this proposed legislation may never be used, it is still an essential temporary safeguard that is urgently needed for as long as the pandemic persists, to provide an agile and flexible process to ensure that the integrity of the planning and building control systems are maintained in the event of further waves of infection.<br\/><br\/>I will conclude on the proposed Committee Stage amendments relating to substitute consent provisions in the Planning and Development Acts.  As I set out last week at a session with the committee online, in order to the comply with the findings of the Supreme Court judgment of 1 July 2020, it is necessary to amend the substitute consent provisions at Part XA of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to provide for &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; to be considered in an application for substitute consent at section 177K of the Planning Act, along with the necessary ancillary provisions to ensure additional public participation, where required, is facilitated with respect to the consideration of exceptional circumstances at the leave to apply stage, as well as on the wider application.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, following the introduction of these highly technical proposed amendments, any new applications for substitute consent which are made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la must demonstrate exceptional circumstances and, in turn, the board must be satisfied that such circumstances exist, while also complying with the existing public participation requirements of sections 177K and 177H of the Planning Act and prescribed by regulations under section 177N.<\/p><p>Section 177K of the Act, which relates to the decision of the board on substitute consent, will also be amended to provide for additional public participation where required on exceptional circumstances and on the wider application where an application for substitute consent is currently pending before the board.  This legislation will deal not only with new applications but applications currently before the board upon the enactment of these amendments.  This is to ensure that applications for substitute consent which have already been submitted to the board but not yet decided are subject to a requirement to satisfy that exceptional circumstances exist so that applicants are given the opportunity to provide any further information to this effect and so that the public, prescribed bodies and those who have already made submissions on the application are notified of, and can make submissions on, the application, including on whether exceptional circumstances exist in this regard. <br\/><br\/>The introduction of these technical amendments to existing substitute consent provisions is a matter of urgency, noting that these provisions will facilitate the earlier resolution of the terms of the EU Court of Justice judgment in case C-261\/18, the Commission <i>v.<\/i>Ireland, which found against Ireland.  This case followed on from case C-215\/06, also known as the Derrybrien Wind Farm case.  In this regard, it is noted that the power of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to issue a decision on the Derrybrien Wind Farm substitute consent application currently before it has been called into question following the Supreme Court judgment.  It is further noted that the State must pay fines of &euro;15,000 per day to the European Commission as a result of the judgment in case C-261\/18, which effectively is the follow-on Derrybrien case, which judgment was published in November 2019, until the terms of that judgment are met.  For information, since the judgment was issued the State has paid a lump sum fine of &euro;5 million to the Commission in respect of this case, as well as a further &euro;2.745 million in daily fines relating the first six month period since the judgment date.<br\/><br\/>The introduction of these technical amendments to substitute consent provisions is a matter of urgency for the planning system in general and is not just to do with Derrybrien as it as a vital element of a functioning economy which needs to have measures in place as soon as possible that are legally compliant with the EIA directive to facilitate applications to seek to regularise the planning status of large scale developments, which are subject to EIA, in exceptional circumstances, if required. <br\/><br\/>Mr. Paul Hogan and I will endeavour to answer any questions that the Chairman or committee members might have with respect to the three planning elements of the proposed Bill and Mr. Paul Lemass will endeavour to answer questions on the residential tenancies element of the Bill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly and I invite Mr. Lemass to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#D00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607385600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for this opportunity to further brief them on the proposed D&aacute;il Committee Stage amendments to the Planning and Development Bill 2020 in relation to proposed additional protections under the Residential Tenancies Acts.  I am accompanied by Mr. Liam Smyth, assistant principal, from the rental market policy unit, who is connecting remotely to this session.  I would like also to recognise the tremendous support and forbearance that this committee, and its predecessor, has afforded the Department since March in introducing urgent, complex and significantly enhanced tenancy protections during the pandemic.  This will be the fourth time in 2020 that the Oireachtas has been asked to make legislative changes relating to the Residential Tenancies Acts, namely, Part 2 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 in March providing a moratorium on evictions and rent increases during Covid-19 to 1 August; the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 in July providing more targeted tenancy protections for those in rent arrears due to Covid-19 to 10 January - up to end November 2020 - 348 tenant declaration have been made to gain the protections under this Act; the Residential Tenancies Act 2020 in October to protect tenants from evictions when people&rsquo;s movement is restricted to within 5 km of their homes; and the proposed Part 3 of the Planning and Development Bill 2020 in December to again, provide targeted tenancy protections, subject to certain conditions, for those in rent arrears due to Covid-19 to 12 April.<\/p> <p>  The proposed new provisions will operate, subject to certain conditions, from 11 January 2021 to 12 April 2021 to provide enhanced protections for those tenants who are facing rent arrears due to Covid-19 and, as a result, are at risk of losing their tenancy.  Similar to the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020, if a tenant&rsquo;s ability to pay rent has been impacted by Covid-19 and the tenant meets specific criteria, new procedures and protections apply under these new provisions.  Tenants who follow these procedures cannot be required to vacate their rental accommodation before 13 April 2021 and are not required to pay any rent increase in respect of the period ending 12 April 2021.  Where a tenant makes the required written declaration to the RTB and his or her landlord to avail of the enhanced tenancy protections from 11 January 2021 to 12 April 2021, he or she will be required at the same time to serve a notice on the RTB requesting it to assist him or her to obtain advice from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS; and within five days of making the declaration, the tenant will also be required to serve a notice on their landlord requesting a consultation to agree rent payment arrangements.<\/p><p> New conditions apply to these new tenancy protections that are designed to better balance the legal rights of tenants and landlords, taking account of the Constitution.  The opportunity is being provided in this Bill to allow a landlord to make a counterdeclaration to disapply the new protections on foot of the financial hardship that they would cause for the landlord.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for facilitating this briefing and both Mr. Smyth and I will answer any questions that members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Lemass","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lemass.

There is quite a lot going on in this Bill at this point.  Talk about project creep.  It is racing away from us a little, but we have had the benefit in the Seanad of having had the Bill come through, so I appreciate the time and support that the Department officials have given us in the Seanad.<\/p> <p>  I am concluding that, at heart, these amendments are looking to assert a couple of values for the public, one being the value of public participation, public information, and protecting their rights and participation in the planning process, which is all very valuable.  On the requirement around the county and city development plans, it is important that the legislation would assert at a very early stage in the statutory process, in fact at the pre-draft stage in the process, the requirement on every local authority to have a public meeting to consult the public.  The Bill, in this instance, reflects our evolving environment and asserts the facility of an online meeting.  It is important that we recognise that a development plan process lasts two years.  There is a pre-draft consultation and a report on that, there is a draft plan and consultation on that, and there is a plan and there is consultation on that.  It is very important that we do not ignore all of the other elements of consultation that take place and that are conducted, both formally and informally, by the elected members with the support of the executive functions of the local authorities.  The extension of the Covid periods for the planning and building regulations process is practical and valid.<\/p> <p>  On the third element, the substitute consent, this has gone on since July.  Is it purely down to the fact that a Government had not been formed that this matter has not been dealt with?  It is coming up to &euro;10 million of a cost for the State.  Will the witnesses clarify whether there was no earlier opportunity for the State to deal with this matter?<\/p> <p>  I support the contention that anybody applying for retrospective permission for a project that required an environmental impact assessment has acted with a level of disregard and negligence that needs to be criticised and called out.  It is welcome that it will have to be demonstrated that there is an exceptional need and qualification for the project to be considered.  Will the witnesses also talk through how the public will engage in having their say?  In those instances the public good will have been largely ignored if the project has gone ahead without an environmental impact assessment that should have been a requirement.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the residential tenancies amendments, the extension to 3 April of the ban on evictions and the ban on rent increases is very welcome.  It was mentioned that there had been 340 tenant declarations under the previous legislation.  Is that the latest number to date?  Will the witnesses confirm that for the tenants who are unfortunate enough to find themselves in these circumstances and who want or need to make a declaration, they will be able to do that via email using plain English and will not need to engage the services of a legal professional, be it a solicitor, public notary or anybody like that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#E00300","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

The judgment was issued by the Supreme Court in July.  We engaged immediately with the Office of the Attorney General.  We have been working with it in terms of drafting and getting legal advice and we continue to do so.  Off the top of my head, 11, 12 or 13 other judicial reviews followed immediately after that case, so we were addressing those issues.  As I mentioned, it had been our understanding from the Attorney General that because this was directly implementing the provisions of the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive, we would be using a regulation under the 1972 Act to which I referred that is used to transpose directives.  It was not until Thursday of the week before last that the Attorney General advised us to go into primary legislation.  To answer the Senator's question, it was following much the same course.  If it had gone through the 1972 regulations, it would have been done around now anyway.  We are conscious of it every day that goes by in terms of fines we have to pay.  I do not know whether that answers the Senator's question.  In effect, it was moved into this legislative process on legal advice.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of how the public can engage in substitute consent generally, the best way of explaining it is that it is effectively a form of planning application, for want of a better comparison.  It is where the developer has to put forward a remedial environmental impact assessment report which, in effect, takes into account what went before.  The developer submits it to the competent authority, namely, An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is like a normal application in that there are site notices and newspaper notices and members of the public get to engage.  That is what we were building into the provisions.<\/p> <p>  It is very complicated to read, but even for applications that are currently in the system there are two steps or stages as it currently stands in the context of substitute consent.  One is that there first has to be an assessment of whether the circumstances are exceptional.  If the board agrees they are exceptional, it goes to the next stage, which is the substantive piece.  We are now retrofitting back into the first step that there has to be public participation and it would bring it forward into the second step that there has to be consideration of exceptional circumstances.  In effect, if a member of the public already submitted information on an application that is currently before the board, they will get a second chance when this legislation goes through.  The best way of describing it is that it is like a normal planning application, for want of a better comparison, in terms of public participation rights and the fact that people can write to the board and the board must take account of their views.  I hope that answers the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607385600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>On the protections which run to 12 April, we have had 348 notices to the end of November, so the figure is relatively up to date.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of how a tenant can make the declaration, email is provided for.

This is the fifth year in a row in which, in the final two weeks before the summer recess, very substantial planning and residential tenancies amendment legislation has been dropped into existing Bills that are before the D&aacute;il.  There are several problems with that.  None of the points I will make are a criticism of either of the officials who are present.  They are experiencing these problems in as acute a way as members of the committee are experiencing them.  These are incredibly technical matters.  The job of the committee is meant to be to scrutinise this legislation in the public interest to make sure it does what the witnesses are telling us it does and that it does not have unintended consequences.<\/p><p>The lesson of the Derrybrien case is that if proper scrutiny had been introduced when the original legislation was being passed by this House, we would not have paid possibly &euro;10 million in fines so far.  I will come to it in questions, but I expect that the fines will reach many multiples of that figure by the time the matter is resolved.  In my view, it is really unacceptable for members of the committee to be given very detailed technical amendments.  I have been told in an email that I have just received that we must submit our amendments to this Bill on Thursday of this week, and we are going to be asked to complete all Stages of the Bill - Second and Subsequent Stages - in a single day, on Wednesday of next week, which means that the guillotine procedure will be used and we will have a very small amount of time available to us.  We have been denied the opportunity to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny or even time to inform ourselves by engaging with others, so I want to state my extreme dissatisfaction at this situation.  <\/p><p> This may also be a lesson to us in respect of two Bills that we are currently considering, namely, the water environment (abstractions) Bill 2020 and the marine planning and development management Bill 2020, because with both of those Bills, sectoral opinion have raised significant concerns about potential non-compliance with the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive and the Water Framework Directive itself, and the issues are very similar to those we are dealing with here - public participation and compliance.  We are being asked to assist in fixing a problem and we are being given a tiny amount of time to do it.  If we make a mess of this, millions more euro of taxpayers' money will be paid out in fines on this or future cases, so the stakes are exceptionally high.  My specific questions relate to substitute consent because my colleague, Deputy Gould, will deal with the other sections of the Bill.<\/p><p> I ask the witnesses to provide greater clarity as to why the Attorney General only suggested at the last moment that this needed to be done by way of primary legislation and not through a statutory instrument.  Was the Attorney General consulted earlier, and was there originally Attorney General support for a statutory instrument and what changed?  If we pass this Bill in the next two weeks, can the witnesses tell us when will the board be expected to make a decision on the Derrybrien case, and what is the anticipated total amount of fines that will be incurred by the State between last October when the fines kicked in at &euro;15,000 per day, and when a decision is made?  Can they tell us how many other substitute consent applications are currently in the process and will be affected by this?  Also, what happens with the substitute consent applications that were approved under the old regime?  Are they now open to legal challenge or in any way undermined because of the Supreme Court judgment?  <\/p><p> I want to be very clear on the issue of public consultation.  If this Bill is passed, does that mean that for all of the current pending substitute consent applications with the board, there will now be a new round of public consultation in all of those, and will all documentation and information that has been submitted, whether in public or private session today to the board, be available in respect of them?<\/p><p> I am still trying to understand the exceptionality test, therefore, I ask the witnesses to explain that to me in plain English.  Is it now that there is public participation in the first phase, and will public participation continue in the second phase in the exceptionality test?

The original legislation was introduced by way of primary legislation, so my understanding is that was the thinking behind the decision.<\/p> <p>  On the question of how long the Derrybrien case will take, as it currently stands, there are no specific timelines for An Bord Plean&aacute;la and there are no statutory timelines.  There are statutory objective periods in all cases for An Bord Plean&aacute;la, generally of 18 weeks.  Our Minister is prohibited from getting involved in any case under section 30, but in terms of information, my understanding is that in the Derrybrien case the application was lodged by a company owned by ESB in August, and An Bord Plean&aacute;la had indicated it on its website that it was due to decide on the case in January, so that is a timeframe of around about six months.  It is not for me to anticipate how long the board is going to take, but given that there would have to be a further public participation element to it, one might extrapolate from that, that it might be the middle of next year before a decision is made.<\/p><p>As I set out in the briefing note there are in and around 15 applications that have not yet been decided at the leave stage, and there are some 20 applications that are pending in the second, substantive stage.  If this legislation goes through then the new legislation will apply to all of those, requiring a further round of public participation, and certainly for those who have already gone through their own public participation stage in the substantive stage, if that makes sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>What sort of fine would we expect in the Derrybrien case if it was to go to the middle of next year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#H00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607385600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Again, it is &euro;15,000 per day.

They engaged in webinars and videos.  Importantly, they also offered the opportunity for in-person one-to-one meetings.  It was not a case of either-or.

I think the matter relating to planning is clear.<\/p> <p>  There are two stand-alone processes.  In a situation where a tenant makes a declaration and a landlord makes a counterdeclaration, the tenant has applied for certain protections and the landlord, who also claims to be suffering from hardship, wants to resist the granting of this protection.  It does not go any further than that.  The landlord can pursue an eviction through a separate process called a \"notice of termination\".  The notice periods for that process are prescribed.  If a landlord does not subsequently make a notice of termination, the tenancy is not terminated.  The protection for the tenant, the notice periods and the ability to raise a dispute as part of a termination process continue to apply.  If a declaration is made by a tenant and a counterdeclaration is made by a landlord, the landlord may then wish to pursue a notice of termination.  He or she would then have to give the required notice period.  If the tenant feels the landlord is not being fair, he or she can, for this or any other reason, raise a dispute relating to the notice of termination.  That dispute then goes to arbitration through the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, which has been hearing disputes on a range of matters for years.  There is a safety net in place for a tenant whose landlord chooses to block any declaration.  The dispute process also provides a safeguard for the landlord by determining whether a declaration has been made in the correct manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Lemass"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>However, the declaration in the legislation we passed in October provided immediate protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#J00300","speaker":"1647"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607385600,"counter":37,"content":"<p>That is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Lemass"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Mr. Lemass is essentially saying that this immediate protection still applies.

Generally speaking, these things are discussed and negotiated at council level.  The problem, as it stands, is that the only option is a public meeting and that format is not particularly suitable to a stage of the process where no proposals are being put forward.  In addition, it tends to give rise to two groups of people.  One group are people looking for something, typically landowners, who may wish to have a rezoning and that cannot even be considered at this stage of the process.  Also, there tend to be people who may be engaged by a planning issue that may have nothing to do with the development plan and, again, they can be frustrated by this stage of the process too.  The public meeting format does not necessarily focus on the issues at hand.

I have been involved in three county development plans.  I am sure most of those present have been involved in a development plan at some point.  I am very unhappy with this amendment.  I will focus on section 2 of the Bill which relates to section 11 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the county development plans issue because although there has been reference today to this being done by consensus, these things do not happen by consensus.  The reality of my experience tells me otherwise.  One must remember this is the earliest stage of a development plan and is exclusively an executive function.  It is not a reserved function at that point of a county development plan.  There is no reserved function at that stage.  I have engaged with councillors across the 31 councils in the past two weeks and I heard the same story from them.<\/p> <p>  I wish to acknowledge the enormous work of the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  It prepared an amazing digest of the Bill that clearly sets out and addresses this issue.  I will be asking the officials to confirm that analysis.  The Bill has not been passed through the Houses, so, as of today, it is obligatory to have a public meeting.  One could call them town hall meetings for these purposes.  I do not have any difficulty embracing technology, which is marvellous.  I think we can have both.  That is where we are losing this argument slightly.  One can have the public town-hall type meetings.  While I would argue that they are beneficial, this should be a matter of negotiation.  That is what happened in the past on numerous occasions.  The public arrive at meetings and the council officials go through the various plans and infographics and tease out the issues.  That is good and positive.  I think online meetings are also good.  It is possible to have both.  However, I am advised that the situation as of today is that under the currently operating legislation it is obligatory to have a public meeting.  I ask the officials to confirm whether that is the case.  Let us have no ambiguity about this issue.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kelly made the valid point that nowhere else in the legislation is there reference to a public meeting.  There is reference to it in this section, although I see that it relates to the reserved aspects of the matter in terms of the early stage of development.  Could a reference to an obligatory public meeting be inserted elsewhere in the legislation, possibly that relating to another part of the development plan process?  It is an important issue.<\/p> <p>  We want ownership of this plan and for people to engage with it.  We do not want a situation whereby the decision to hold a public meeting is made at the discretion of the unelected chief executives of local authorities.  Many committee members have spoken for years about giving greater powers to local people and local communities, yet this provision is going to be taken out of the legislation and that will make it the right solely of chief executives and their executive in each local authority to decide whether to hold a public meeting.  I do not have a difficulty with any other aspect of the Bill.  It is important that we have public participation and engagement and that people are encouraged to take part in the process.<\/p> <p>  I do not like terms such as \"troublemakers\" or \"difficult people\".  There was a suggestion in the Seanad during the passage of the Bill through that House that some difficult people were turning up at public meetings.  So what if they are?  Most Oireachtas Members are difficult people.  We were politicised by issues and we became difficult and challenged people and got ourselves in here.  Are we going to shut it down now?  I want to facilitate people in engagement.  I am old enough to have been involved in the Wood Quay protests.  People, particularly young people, mobilised on that issue, as did environmentalists.  Why should people not be mobilised and have public rallies or robust debates about our towns, communities, future, the planning of our future, challenging environmental issues such as water, and all the diverse elements that form part of a county development plan?  <\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Lemass, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Hogan for their engagement.  I feel strongly on this point.  I am not hung up on the point in the process at which a public meeting is facilitated, but it should take place at a point when it is important that it be held.<\/p><p>There is no point having public meetings if people cannot effect change.  They must be held according to a timeline where people can feed into it.<\/p><p> It has come to my attention that some of the sitting county managers lobbied strongly to have this element changed.  I have prepared a series of detailed freedom of information requests which will go into the Department tomorrow.  It is important to flush that out.  It only makes me more concerned if chief executives have been lobbying for its removal.  That is the kernel of the problem.  There has to be shift to empower the elected members.  I do not want it to be a choice between political members and the executive.  It should be in legislation that there must be a public town hall type meeting.

When there is no draft to discuss and it is just issues and what might happen in the future, it can be very difficult to mobilise interest from the public over the course of different evenings or weekends, as must be the case when there is a sole reliance on public meetings.  To catch as many people as possible, there must be quite a wide spread of times, formats and locations.  It does not work as effectively as intended in the legislation.  Having an element of choice is the way forward.<\/p> <p>  I am not aware of lobbying.  That did not come to me.  The matter was discussed in the context of engagement with the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, over a response to Covid and the fact that the provision was effectively holding up progress on a plan which had a ticking timeline, where people could not gather to meet, and therefore this had to be addressed.  It is an opportunity to widen the scope of the engagement at the early stage.  I do not share the view that there is an \"us and them\" situation between the elected members and the county and city managers at this stage of the process.  It is a very open and non-controversial stage in the process, or at least it should be, because people are just trying to understand the issues.  It is in everyone's interest to get the information out there, both publicly and online, and that will continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I will leave some time to allow for an answer to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's last question, where we had run out of time.  Will the exceptional circumstances grounds be available to access electronically as part of public participation?  It is one of my concerns.  The officials have spoken of the benefits of online meetings, but the planning process is generally not online, particularly as it relates to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I have other concerns around applications for strategic housing development, SHD, applications and websites being taken down, making it impossible to go back and trawl through things electronically.<\/p> <p>  Will the substitute consent be enough to satisfy the Commission?  Is that the Attorney General's advice?  Is that why we have decided to do this in primary legislation?<\/p> <p>  Returning to online public meetings, it is very clear in the Bill and the debate in the Seanad that the question is about the use of the word \"or\".

Executives and city and county managers are quick to quote legislation, the powers of same and what is required under that legislation.  This legislation references the term \"online or\".  I ask the witnesses to clarify if new issues can be introduced by people at the pre-draft stage of the development plan process.  Most of my amendments to a development plan were ruled out of order because they had not been introduced at the pre-draft or issue stages.  I would like clarification on that issue.<\/p><p> On the ban on evictions, my understanding from the witness's response to Senator Cummins's questions is that one disapplies the other in the case of a registration.  This is not actually a ban on evictions.  It is a dispute resolution mechanism to allow for address of disputes around arrears as opposed to it being a ban on evictions.  If that is the case, we should probably stop using the language of \"ending a ban on evictions\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#M00400","speaker":"1672","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607385600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I thank Senator for her questions.  I will begin by finishing my response to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question in terms of how exceptionality is considered.  It is set out in the existing provisions at section 177D(2), which states that in considering whether exceptional circumstances exist, the board shall have regard to (a) whether regularisation of the development concerned would circumvent the purpose and objectives of the environmental impact assessment directive or the habitats directive; (b) whether the applicant had or could reasonably have had a belief that the development was not unauthorised, which goes to the intent of the applicant; (c) whether the ability to carry out an assessment of the environmental aspects of the development for the purpose of an environmental impact assessment or an appropriate assessment and to provide for public participation in such an assessment has been substantially impaired; (d) the actual or likely significant effects on the environment or adverse effects on the integrity of a European site resulting from the carrying out or continuation of the development; (e) the extent to which significant effects on the environment or adverse effects on the integrity of a European site can be remediated; (f) whether the applicant has complied with previous planning permissions granted or has previously carried out an unauthorised development; and (g) such matters as the board considers relevant.  Those considerations have been in existence since this legislation was first introduced in 2011 and they will continue in operation.<\/p> <p>  I have had a look back at my notes and I think I may have given an incorrect response earlier in regard to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question on public participation.  There is no public participation in the first stage.  The key change is the introduction of the exceptionality at the second stage where there is public participation.  It is important to make that clear.<\/p> <p>  On engagement with the Commission, we have been engaging with it on these changes.  It is important to note that European law is implemented at national level.  This change is further to a Supreme Court case and not a European Court of Justice case.  This is about the Irish national Supreme Court judgment and that court's interpretation of this legislation.  We are, through the Attorney General, responding to that judgment.  We are very aware of where it arose from, namely, the original Derrybrien judgment.  I am not sure if I have answered the Deputy's question.  We are very aware of the genesis of this process.  There have been numerous engagements with the Attorney General on this particular point.<\/p> <p>  Senator Moynihan asked if the substitute consent will be online.  The answer is \"Yes\".  It is addressed in one of the amendments we have proposed but I do not think it is referenced in the draft we sent last week.  It is with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  In the version that comes through to the D&aacute;il there will be a proposal to mandate that these proposals be available online in addition to being available at the offices of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I think I have answered most of the questions.

On the issue of safeguards and timeframes, by its definition, the Bill extends existing timeframes.  The whole point of it is that if there is a set period, the Bill extends that period in parallel to the point that there is a new lockdown.  By definition, the extending period relates to the lockdown period.  Its very nature is to ensure that public consultation is preserved.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question on timeframes.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the specificity of various areas, it is absolutely the case that confusion could arise.  As I stated, the provision was not just included to cater for situations where there is a prohibition on members of the public moving freely, there is also the potential of individual authority members being struck down by Covid infection such that they cannot comply with the process.  That is one example we would envisage.  For example, a planning authority may not be able to work through its statutory objectives because its members are infected or have to stay at home or whatever.  As members are aware, in the previous lockdown it was used for the entire country.  I would argue it worked well because it was widely known about by all elements of the planning sector.  We had wide engagement with environmental NGOs and through planning institutes and local authorities.  It was widely publicised not only on our own websites, but also through sectors that are involved in planning generally.  In terms of communication, we will be doing that again.  I do not know whether the Deputy is familiar with what happened on the last occasion.  We do have the good experience of having done this before.  Circulars were sent to all local authorities.  The main point of information was on our public website.  We have a large Covid section for members of the public.  Local authorities also took it upon themselves to put it on their websites.  In some cases, local authorities put notices on their doors.  Mr. Hogan and his team drafted frequently asked questions that were also put online.  To answer the Deputy's question, we will do what we did before, which is to ensure that as wide a populace as possible understands this issue.  The key point in terms of interaction with members of the public is that they are not being restricted.  Their engagement is being elongated.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about e-payments.  That is a different issue.  Other amendments to the planning Acts are being progressed in terms of e-planning.  That is coming in due course.  On e-payments, the whole point is that the Bill allows for the extension of the public participation period when there is a lockdown.  If a person needs to pay &euro;20 to lodge an objection but there is a lockdown, that period is extended such that they can do so when the lockdown ends.  I hope I am explaining it clearly.  I again point out that we used this process before.  All statutory provisions in the planning Acts were extended by eight weeks this year and that will work its way through the system.  It is widely known about by those involved and certainly by all the local authorities.  As I stated, the information is available on all the relevant websites, including local authority websites.

If the landlord and the tenant are both experiencing hardship, who loses out?  How is that determined?  Mr. Lemass gave an explanation when Senator John Cummins asked whether a tenancy is protected when a counter-declaration is made.  I understand that if a landlord makes a counter-declaration and then issues a notice of termination, it is up to the tenant to raise a dispute.  How is that determined?  If a tenant's rights are protected under legislation, how do we see him or her through this process?  It can become quite technical and cumbersome.<\/p> <p>  My second question concerns public consultation.  I do not believe there is anything sinister in this proposal.  I think it is a reaction to Covid-19 and the need for public safety.  However, in any situation we must avoid unintended consequences.  We do not want to give the impression, rightly or wrongly, that we are limiting public engagement or the autonomy of elected councillors.  It is quite clear from the contributions made today and in the previous debate in the Seanad that there are serious concerns around this.  We should reflect those concerns in the language.  A sunset clause should be attached to the either-or provision in this Bill.  That provision is there to get us through Covid-19.  When we are living in a Covid-free world - soon enough, please God - it should be allowed to lapse.  Failing that, we should add a caveat to make it clear that it is a decision presented by the executive and approved by the members of the council.  We should trust them to get this over the line and to determine what is in the best interests of their electorate and how best to consult them.  <\/p> <p>  A previous speaker noted that this is the only part of the public consultation process that is prescribed by legislation.  I worry that this might create a precedent for public consultation throughout the development plan.  Mr. Lemass and I worked on the development plan previously.

In 2016, some 470,000 people were renting.  On 23 November, there were 352,000 people on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  Why do the witnesses think that only 348 tenant declarations have been made?  Does someone whose income has been affected by Covid-19, and who can prove it, need to be in rent arrears to avail of a freeze on rent increases?

Why are the tenancy protections to end in April, and why is provision not given to the Minister to extend those protections, if necessary?  Why was the five-month exemption from rent arrears chosen?  How was this timeframe reached?  Unlike tenants, who must provide evidence of rent arrears, why are landlords automatically considered to be relevant persons if they are receiving any Covid-19-related social welfare payments?  Employers can also subsidise the EWSS up to people's full incomes, yet no provision deals with landlords receiving payment under this scheme, but who have suffered no loss of income.  <\/p> <p>  On the balancing of rights regarding a ban on evictions, I believe this Bill will give the landlord more rights than the tenant in respect of situations where the landlord is receiving any Covid-19-related payment.

We publicise it quite heavily through the RTB, online and in the media but also by writing to registered tenants and landlords and making them aware of it.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked why more people are not availing of the protection.  I can only refer him back to the research the ESRI conducted for us in the middle of this year which pointed to the fact that the temporary payments, plus the decline in consumption patterns because of the lockdown, would have affected the build-up of arrears in the short term.  We then came out of lockdown but later went back into lockdown.  It is borne out by figures that suggest average national savings have gone up and people's wealth has gone up that little bit.  There may be something in all of that because the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and other payments are helping people get through this period.  I cannot say definitively.  I can only speculate based on that evidence.<\/p><p> As regards when the tenant can declare, this part applies to a situation where there is a significant risk of the tenancy of the dwelling being terminated by the landlord.  It is not any more specific than that.  It applies if a tenant feels at risk of arrears and at risk of a tenancy being terminated as a result of them.  The arrears may not have occurred yet but the tenant may know that in the weeks and months to come, because he or she is not working or because of certain financial challenges, he or she is at risk.  That is the situation.  It is a self-declaration but the person has to be accurate in what he or she says in the assessment and it is an offence to make a false declaration.  It is up to the tenant to make that declaration.<\/p><p> Regarding why tenants have to have recourse to MABS, the new provisions require them to request the RTB to facilitate engagement with MABS.  One of our concerns is that there were 348 declarations at the end of November but only seven people had recourse to MABS.  MABS is there to help people.  We want to be sure that people put together workable arrangements with landlords that will endure well beyond these protections.  Someone may have a problem now and may need protection until 11 January, or 12 April, as it is hoped the date will soon be, but that will not be long coming around.  We are keen for people to engage with MABS so they can put in place longer term and more sustainable arrangements.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked about landlords who might have no loss of income and landlords in receipt of the PUP.  If a tenant feels that a landlord's declaration is unfair and the landlord is proceeding to terminate the tenancy, the tenant can raise a dispute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#R00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Lemass","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":95,"content":"<p>That is not the question.

I direct the Deputy to the judgment of the RTB in one of the Tyrrelstown cases where it overruled an eviction because it was able to demonstrate that the landlord was still in receipt of rent and would not, therefore, be suffering hardship.  We have consulted the RTB on these protections and they are intended precisely for situations like the Tyrrelstown case where the landlord was prevented from proceeding with the termination because it was demonstrated that the landlord had adequate income and was not suffering the hardship claimed in the declaration.  That is on the record of the RTB as a judgment in the case of what is known as the Tyrrelstown amendment.  We envisage a similar approach here.  If a dispute is raised and the landlord claims hardship, he or she has to demonstrate that hardship.

Why was 1 August chosen rather than 1 April?  People might have been in receipt of the PUP between April and August and built up arrears but are not now covered by the Bill.<\/p><p> The question of why landlords and tenants were covered by the same penalty for false declarations has been covered.<\/p><p> The five-day period in which the tenant must respond to a notice to quit is far too short.  Then they are expected to notify the RTB and pass on the data to MABS.  I imagine there are general data protection regulation, GDPR, issues on this and I query that measure.  Has there been consultation with MABS about the additional work it would be required to undertake?  MABS is already very oversubscribed.<\/p><p> There is an attempt to balance landlord and tenant rights.  I would accept that if there was more work around tenants' rights, but the Bill's purpose is about preventing people from having to move during periods of restriction.  I cannot visit my mother in her home today.  That is the environment we are in.  It is not a project about balancing landlord and tenant rights.  We really have not thought out the details of some of the requirements.  Take the expected enactment of legislation on 19 December.  The RTB will write to all those impacted to alert them of their need to lodge an application with the RTB and then MABS, which they must do in five days.  This would mean the RTB sending letters to tenants between 19 December and Christmas Eve.  That is bizarre timing, if nothing else.<\/p><p> Actions are to be taken within five days of the commencement of the Bill on 11 January, that is 16 January, is a short period.  Most places reopen on 2 or 3 January.  It gives a very short time for people who have previously applied for an exemption and who might get a letter from the RTB before Christmas telling them to contact the RTB and apply to MABS by 16 January.  The timing has not been thought out.<\/p><p> I am very concerned by the answers given to Senator Cummins about the measures being disapplied.  The Bill is about giving tenants certainty that they will not have to move around during periods of restriction.  It appears that certainty can be extinguished simply by a landlord making an application.  If a landlord makes a submission to the effect that the rent is his or her sole income, then the tenant no longer has the certainty that he or she cannot be evicted.  I accept that other recourse is given under the normal notice period, but the main provision there is time.  There are no additional rights.<\/p><p> I have no issue with the balancing landlord and tenant rights but that is a longer term project and what is needed here is certainty for tenants.  The five-day period is too short, as are the timelines for the Christmas period, which do not take account of the holiday season.  Data transparency is an issue.  Where a tenant fails to provide the RTB and MABS with the required information and the landlord submits that is the case, then the new protections disapplies.  How does the landlord know?  This Bill is trying to do things that are part of a bigger project.  It will have to be amended.

That is the logic behind the timing.<\/p><p> On the five days to respond requirement, when a declaration is made there are two actions, namely, a declaration is made to the RTB and also a request to the RTB to put the person in touch with MABS.  This happens immediately.  The RTB on receipt of the declaration puts the applicant in touch with MABS.  Separately, the board requests that the applicant engage with the landlord within five days to consult on an arrangement.  The purpose of this is to put an obligation on people to make that happen.  It is not that the agreement has to happen within the five days but a person must engage within five days.  Part of the concern is that with 348 declarations we have only had recourse to seven people going to MABS.  There is an uncertainty as to what others are doing.  We do not know if they have reached agreement or not.  The GDPR issues will be addressed because the applicant, as the tenant, makes the request.

This is where I am going with my question.  Mr. Lemass mentioned that only seven tenants have been referred to MABS.  I refer people to MABS on a weekly basis, and it could take two or three weeks for them to get a meeting, with the process in place.  MABS does fantastic work, but the problem is that people are waiting two or three weeks at the moment to get a meeting, and more people will be using MABS under the protections provided in this legislation.  It is going to put more pressure on MABS, particularly when it comes to getting the information back to tenants in the case of a dispute.  Again, it comes back to the rental issue that we have here.  What supports are available for MABS?  I believe that there is going to be a bigger uptake in this regard as we go forward, because we have not got to the end what is happening at the moment.

I accept the Deputy's point that there may be a two to three week delay, which may not be unreasonable in some circumstances.  However, the point of this legislation is that a tenant would have to contact the landlord with a view to working out an arrangement.  As part of that contact, it would be entirely reasonable for the tenant to say that he or she is engaging with MABS as part of that process, and that he or she will conclude the arrangement with the landlord after he or she has engaged with MABS.

On the public consultation, it should be noted that public participation and attendance feature in all stages of county development plan sessions in local authority chambers and in submissions, and access is available online.  I have always defended the importance of public access and participation in respect of all planning matters.  The greater the public participation, the greater the likelihood that the outcome from that process is going to be more acceptable and better for all involved.  It does not unduly concern me that a public meeting may now be online or in a town hall, church hall, or wherever it may be.  In fact, I know from working with my own forward planning section in Wicklow, that it may now be possible to have four public meetings in one day, whereas before, it may have taken a week for planners to do this.  Therefore, we must consider the balance between the positives it brings and the perceptions of the negatives it brings, including that some people may not have access to online meetings, although I believe Internet access has improved during lockdown.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Hogan referred to the guidelines for local authorities in development plan processes.  Will that also include guidance on how to conduct a public meeting, and will the facilities, the technical resources and supports be there for local authorities to embrace this straight away?  In general, the move to e-planning is a very positive one, because the planning and development consent processes generate so much paperwork and many files.  The online and e-planning approach is the way to go, provided that each local authority can provide the same standard.  On some local authority websites, the planning system is very hard to navigate, whereas with others, it is much easier to read, and some people prefer to have those paper files in their hands.

He would have to engage with both the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and then make the recommendation to the Government.  It would then have to decide whether to do it on every individual order.  The answer to the Chairman's question is \"Yes\".  If a local authority wants to engage with the Minister, that is how it would happen.  The previous lockdown was a reaction to the initial health restrictions that were issued.  We have specifically put in the flexibility to allow for that and it is clearly stated that if there were an issue with a specific local authority or building control authority, they could bring it to the attention of the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020120800002#X00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1607385600,"counter":131,"content":"<p>On the substitute consent, it appears we are raising the bar in the process of applying for substitute consent.

I am repeating some questions but during Covid, planners were working from home and local authorities were told to keep as few people as possible in buildings.  That was part of what Covid was but it had a huge knock-on effect on pre-planning meetings and people going in to local authorities to get information.  That is a huge issue, even for development plans.  In Carlow, our development plan will be extended to the middle of next year or longer.  There are major issues with communication but also with going in for pre-planning or to talk about a development plan.  These are life-changing issues.  Local authorities are dealing with people's livelihoods, whether through businesses or housing or so on.  It is so important that we get this right and I have a huge fear about going online.  Many people I know, particularly elderly people, do not want to do online meetings.  We should not be encouraging that.<\/p><p>It important to sit in front of a planner or someone in a local authority to get information, whether about a development plan or a house someone is building.  We need to look at that and we should not encourage online meetings.  I am not a firm believer in those.<\/p><p> I want to talk about the issue of landlords and tenants.  Like previous speakers, I work very closely with MABS.  We have an excellent MABS branch in Carlow, as well as the RTB, to which the witnesses say they give funding.  There, again, is another issue.  Many of the staff, in fairness, are working from home due to Covid and they are doing their best.  They are excellent.  I could not fault any of the staff.  Is there an issue with information coming from the Department and letting tenants know their rights?  I think there is.  I am concerned that there have only been seven referrals to MABS.  That is a worry and a concern in the sense that we need to make sure tenants know their entitlements.  As regards the five days' notice, it is coming up to Christmas and local authorities, MABS and the RTB will be closed.  I always find, as I am sure others do too, that when something happens it always happens around Christmas and it is so hard to contact someone about it.  We need to be very aware of giving timescales and a date for people.  The Department needs to look at that.<\/p><p> Is there a ban on evictions for local authorities?  This issue came to my attention recently.  I am sure there is when we are in a situation with Covid-19 but it is something with which I was dealing and it is important that local authority tenants know that too.  It has not been communicated.  It is so important that there is information and awareness and we work through MABS, the RTB and our local authorities, which are all under pressure with Covid-19 and trying to do their best.  We need to make sure we get this right because it is so important.  There is such a short timescale for this and it would make a huge difference.
