Are the minutes agreed to?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The first session will be with the Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion, Deputy Josepha Madigan.  The second session will be with F&oacute;rsa, the trade union, and a representative group of special needs assistants, SNAs.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and her officials to discuss the need for revised criteria for the qualifications of special needs assistants.<\/p><p>As for the format of the meeting, I will invite the Minister of State to make a brief opening statement for five minutes, which will be followed by questions from members.  Each member will have a five-minute slot because the Minister of State has to leave at noon.  We have about 55 minutes.  I ask members and the Minister of State to stick rigidly to their five-minute slots.  If I interject, it is because I want to give every member an opportunity to ask their questions.  As everyone will be aware, the committee will publish the opening statement on its website following the meeting.<\/p><p> I remind Members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  That applies to all members.<\/p><p> I thank the Minister of State for attending.

I am accompanied by Ms Martina Mannion, assistant secretary for special education and inclusion; Mr. Mark Bohan, principal officer, external staff relations; and Ms Andrina Donovan, assistant principal officer, special education section.  The topic before the committee is the revised qualifications for special needs assistants.<\/p> <p>  I would like to acknowledge the important work and significant role of SNAs in schools in supporting some of the country&rsquo;s most vulnerable children.  The work and commitment of SNAs ensure that children with special educational needs, SEN, can attend school and participate in school life to the fullest possible extent.<\/p> <p>  As Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion, I am committed to making a difference for students who have special educational needs as part of an inclusive education system.  Children with SEN should be supported to access the education system.  As a Government, we fully recognise the importance of an inclusive and all-embracing education system.  Never is it more important than in the case of children with special educational needs.  I fundamentally believe that our most vulnerable children in society must be prioritised.<\/p> <p>  Government policy on supporting children with special educational needs aims to ensure that all children with special needs can have access to an education appropriate to their needs.  Our policy is to provide for inclusive education and to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special needs into ordinary mainstream schools.  Where pupils require more targeted interventions, special class or special school placements are also provided.<\/p> <p>  Working collaboratively with teachers and parents, SNAs ensure that children with special educational needs are educated alongside their peers in mainstream class settings, special classes and special schools.  Being able to access education in an inclusive way is key to living life to its fullest.  In doing so, we are helping these children to grow, develop and be as independent as possible.  The work of an SNA with children with special educational needs is key in this regard and we have evidence of this from the National Council for Special Education&rsquo;s, NCSE, comprehensive review, which was undertaken in 2018.<\/p> <p>  That review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs, including referencing the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at level 5 of the national qualifications framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The policy advice was considered by the Department.  It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.<\/p> <p>  A public procurement competition was held for the development and delivery of a new national training programme for SNAs.  The contract was awarded, as the committee knows, to University College Dublin, UCD, school of education, in conjunction with the UCD school of nursing, midwifery and health systems.  UCD has a strong reputation in the world of education and training.  It brings with it a wealth of experience and research knowledge in the training and has very strong quality assurance arrangements for its programmes.<\/p><p>Feedback from programme participants is a key feature of this quality assurance process.  This is a major educational initiative, which will enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs who are crucial to the inclusion of students with additional care needs in the education system.  The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA.  The programme began in January 2021 recruiting the first cohort of 500 SNAs.  A second cohort of approximately 900 SNAs is currently completing the programme with recruitment under way for a third cohort to begin in September 2022.  That has a target recruitment of 1,000 SNAs.<\/p><p> This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in schools and is tailored to their needs.  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs.  Part of that consideration will include accreditation.  Officials in my Department have recently received two reports of the programme from UCD, namely, a report of review on the SNA programme conducted by the teaching and learning committee in UCD school of education and an evaluation report.  The reports are under review and will inform our consideration on accreditation.<\/p><p> On the minimum qualification, I am aware of F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s campaign to have the minimum essential qualification for SNAs reviewed.  The Department has communicated to F&oacute;rsa that it is open to reviewing the position.  However, the Department is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract proposed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement should be carried out and implemented first.  There has been initial engagement between the Department and F&oacute;rsa on the matter and the issues of the scope and actual approach of the review are being considered by the Department.<\/p><p> This year, the Department of Education will spend over 25% of our total educational budget.  By the end of the year, there will be 19,169 SNAs, which is an increase of 81%.<\/p><p> I do not want to go too far over my time so I will conclude.  Providing support and training for SNAs is a major priority for me and the Department.  I am happy to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062100002#B00200","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

The role was created almost 40 years ago and over that time, it has evolved enormously.  SNAs play a crucial role and I hope this hearing and the review of minimum qualifications can be a new beginning for them in the Irish education system.  The importance of the SNA role is underlined by the fact that every Deputy and Senator is inundated each year with queries from schools and parents who are unhappy at the allocation of SNAs for their school compared with what the children in the school needs.  It reflects the feeling among schools that they are under severe pressure.  They are unable to ensure that children can reach their fullest potential if they do not have an adequate allocation of SNAs.<\/p> <p>  Over the past four or five years, an additional 1,000 or 1,500 SNAs have been announced every year.  That is one element in the budget that I have welcomed.  However, I made the point to the Minister of State last week that the number announced is usually not realised.  Around 800 SNAs are usually recruited.  Part of the difficulty is that the job is not attractive enough for people to either enter as a career or stay in, despite how rewarding it is in several respects.  That is one issue we need to crack.<\/p> <p>  I note the comment in F&oacute;rsa's opening statement that the Minister of State with responsibility for special education had indicated to F&oacute;rsa, through her private secretary, that she was open to considering the accreditation of the UCD programme but that F&oacute;rsa had not been informed of any further developments.  The Minister of State commented on two reports she will review which will inform considerations on accreditation.  That seems to at least indicate an openness to the accreditation question, which I welcome.  Will the Minister of State like an opportunity to expand on that?  Is she keen to see accreditation happen?<\/p><p>What type of timescale does she have in mind for that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062100002#C00300","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments.  In terms of the allocation of SNAs generally, there was provision for an allocation of 1,165 in budget 2022.  For the information of the Deputy and the committee, 623 of those SNAs have so far been allocated, with the balance of 542 to be allocated by the end of the year.  That probably will be done through the exceptional review process and there will be posts for special schools and special classes.<\/p> <p>  On accreditation, as I said in my opening statement and as I have said before at this committee and in exchanges with the Deputy in the D&aacute;il Chamber, one of the first things we wanted to do, following the comprehensive review the NCSE did of the SNA scheme, was to make sure we put training in place, which we did.  I referred to the UCD course, in which 3,500 SNAs will take part.  As it is the first instance of this programme, it is important that we take time to review the course and its outcomes.  Part of the consideration under that review will be looking at accreditation of SNAs.<\/p> <p>  Two reports have come in to us, the first being the review of the SNA programme, which was conducted by the teaching and learning committee within the UCD school of education.  The second report was an evaluation based on data gathered from the first cohort of students who completed the programme.  The feedback of these SNAs who participated in the course is going to be extremely important.  Both reports are under review by officials at present and they will inform our consideration of accreditation.  It is important to say that.

I have put it to her before that this is putting the cart before the horse.  Surely the contract should reflect the work that is being done at this time.  It would be most logical to have an independent review of the current qualifications, which could have been begun some time ago, in order to inform a future contract.

To a certain extent, over the years they may have been undervalued and I want to change that, but there is a process that needs to be followed through.

As the Minister of State herself said, those students with special educational needs in many cases would not survive without the support of SNAs.  One thing that is important as part of any contract is that there is a requirement that the SNAs would specifically focus on the needs of those students with special educational needs and, in other words, that they are not seen as part of an overall staffing cohort within a school.  I ask for the Minister of State's view with regard to that specific provision within the contract, namely, that the focus must be on the students with special educational needs as opposed to more general duties within the school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062100002#E00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>That is a very pertinent point.  Clearly, children with the greatest level of needs need to be looked after, and that is the role of the SNA.  It is primarily at the discretion of the school management authority how it deploys the SNAs within the school, but it is vital they are used for that purpose and only that purpose.  It can be difficult to be prescriptive as to exactly the role of an SNA is.  There is a primary role around, for example, feeding and primary care issues like that, and then there are more secondary roles around classwork, tidying desks and that sort of thing, but it is important they are treated with they respect they deserve and that the teachers treat them in that manner.  They are recruited specifically to assist schools in providing the necessary non-teaching services to pupils with special educational needs.  The SNA contract does set out the duties but, as I said, there can be flexibility around that.  The most important thing is that the children's additional needs receive the support from the SNA and the SNA is not used for any purpose other than that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062100002#E00300","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>That is critical.

It is that we treat people in the same way, that they get the same access and that we have special supports in place.

I would also like information on the budgets.<\/p> <p>  As with so many roles in society, qualifications are a way to acknowledge the work and effort made by people.  The work of SNAs, as with healthcare assistants, can go unseen.  SNAs work with teachers in the classroom and with principals and they are integral part of a school.  They may be a new addition to the teaching staff in a school.  Many courses, particularly those provided by education and training boards, recognise prior learning.

I congratulate F&oacute;rsa and the individual SNAs who have brought this conversation to the heart of the Houses of the Oireachtas today.  It shows the power of joining a union.  The tag line or slogan the SNAs are using is \"Respect for SNAs\".  In my work in this area over several years, the lack of respect has become clear to me.  I wish to link this back to the basic requirements.  In an individual school, for example, the teachers can often be called by their second names while the SNAs will be called by their first names.  This is a clear message to everybody in the school regarding who is deserving of more respect.  Everybody can see and hear that and the children, more effectively and profoundly, can see that.  It does not happen in every school, but it is the case in many schools.  It would be \"Mr. Kehoe\" or \"Ms Dolan\" and then \"Bernie\" or \"Michael\".  This sends a strong message.<\/p> <p>  SNAs have told me that the continuing professional development, CPD, available to teachers is not available to them.  We have had the conversation around the allocation for next year only being released on 31 May.  There are other issues in the system regarding July provision and the different rates of pay for doing the same job.  On a day-to-day basis as well, SNAs are tasked with doing some pretty menial jobs in the classroom or school setting.  Much of this is based, I believe, on the connection between the basic requirements to become an SNA and their status in the school and in the system.  Therefore, this situation does not just depend on how a teacher or a school treats SNAs.  It is about how the Department treats them.  Would the Minister of State accept there is a link between the day-to-day disrespect some SNAs have experienced and this minimum requirement issue?<\/p> <p>  To give the Minister of State time to answer my questions, my other query concerns whether she is in a position to say she wants to get the accreditation recognised and change the minimum requirements for SNAs, and that she will go through a process of a review.  Is it her stated objective, as the Minister of State, to change these things?  I ask this because there are two types of ministerial responses in my experience.  One type of response from a Minister or Minister of State is passive and states there is a review and he or she will see what happens after that.  The other type of response from a Minister or Minister of State, however, states the outcome he or she wants and, while he or she will listen to what the Department is saying, he or she fundamentally believes the accreditation needs to be recognised and the minimum requirements need to change.<\/p> <p>  Those are my two questions.

Of course, if a Minister or Minister of State expresses a view, then it means that makes a difference.  It cannot, however, change everything.  I have, however, made it clear to the Department that I do think we must look at the minimum qualifications and at the issue of accreditation.  This is important.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the parity of esteem issue the Deputy spoke about, as he is aware, there is an industrial relations forum in place that provides a structured process to manage any industrial relations issues that arise in this sector.  That forum provides a dedicated channel for F&oacute;rsa to raise matters of interest or concern.  There is a sectoral aspect to this context, which the union has used in the past.  F&oacute;rsa has sought a range of additional leave for SNAs through the industrial relations mechanisms and the Department is engaging with the union on these claims as well.  The fact that one public service grade has access to certain leave or other conditions of employment, however, does not automatically mean other grades should.  Each claim is examined on its own merits and in the context of the impact on the system of increased leave in respect of cost.<\/p><p>The fact one particular public service grade has access to certain leave or other conditions of employment does not automatically mean other grades should.

I also get the point about them being called by their first name rather than their surnames.  Perhaps guidance could be given around that.  Circulars exist but perhaps they could be revisited so it could be emphasised with schools that there should be respect for SNAs at all times.  Neither principals nor staff would be in the position to look after the children with additional needs without the SNAs, who are an integral part of the process.  To a certain extent they are perhaps the most important part of looking after children with additional needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062100002#G00300","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>If there is time remaining, I will give people an extra minute or so to come in again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062100002#H00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for appearing before the committee and her opening statement.  In preparing this morning, I had a look at Circular 30\/14, which is still the central circular in terms of SNA allocation.  It speaks a little to Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's point, which is about the professionalisation of this workforce.  I do not for a second question the professionalism of any of the SNAs with whom I have worked, who were exemplary in their professionalism.  It is a question of how they are treated within schools and how their roles are understood.<\/p> <p>  I had a look at that circular from 2014, which cited a review from the then Department of Education and Skills that found the deployment of SNAs in schools had, in practice, moved away from the objectives originally envisaged, which were to provide for children's care needs, and had moved towards SNA involvement in behavioural, therapeutic, pedagogical, teaching and administrative duties.  I wonder if we held that review today would there be any less confusion around the roles that SNAs play within schools.<\/p> <p>  One of my concerns is that we are seeing expansion of SNA numbers, which is extremely welcome, but we saw a retrenchment in 2011.  That review was titled a value for money and policy review.  We found the number of SNAs being cut because we began to perhaps more strictly define or implement criteria under which SNAs were employed in schools.  One of the worries I have if we do not professionalise and put this career on a more solid professional footing is that we could lose people from our schools again.<\/p> <p>  I have reviewed some of the primary care needs.  I know members of F&oacute;rsa will come before the committee and SNAs will speak about what they do in schools.  To give a flavour of the work, I point out \"administration of medicine\".  What a huge responsibility that is to put on somebody.  There is also reference to assistance with toileting and general hygiene, including catheterisation.  I have had SNAs contact me who feel that is a big request for somebody who really does not enjoy a great deal of security, either in terms of tenure or pay and conditions.  There is also reference to assistance with moving and lifting children and the operation of hoists and equipment.  Some of the duties we ask SNAs to carry out in our schools carry huge responsibility and are very onerous.  There should be a reflection of that.<\/p> <p>  My time is short and I am using much of it.  Will the Minister of State tell me more about the course being run out of UCD?  Will she detail the intake and educational background of SNAs coming into the course.  F&oacute;rsa has provided some figures about the level of qualifications within the SNA workforce but there is no detail as to whether these are specifically education-based.  Who are the people turning up to this course?  How long is the programme?  We could compare or contrast different benchmarks in qualifications so where would I find myself with a course of this length?<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister of State provide some detail on what is included in the curriculum of the course?  When the SNAs emerge from this course what will they have been trained in?  Does this speak to our understanding of the role within schools?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062100002#H00300","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>It was the first national training programme for SNAs.

What concerns me when I hear other committee colleagues talk of how SNAs may be undervalued within a school is not so much the treatment of the SNAs, although that is important, but it signifies the school in question undervalues the children with special needs.  That is why it is very important we introduce policies to ensure SNAs are treated equally and respectfully.<\/p> <p>  The committee is particularly interested in two issues and, in fairness, the Minister of State has dealt with them.  One is the system of accreditation and the other is the raising of the minimum essential qualifications for SNAs.  I am aware of the Minister of State's views but is there a hesitancy within the Department or elsewhere in government to the introduction of these measures, whether it is accreditation or the increase in essential qualifications, because it will necessarily or probably increase costs?

It is my hope that we will have an agreement on the terms of reference for the inquiry this week.  Those children have been failed over and over again.<\/p> <p>  I want to raise the issue of accreditation with the Minister of State.  I would argue that no review is needed.  The fact that training is not accredited should be addressed immediately.  At the time, the decision to deliver the course through UCD struck me as an unusual approach.  I say this because to my understanding UCD as a university is not able to offer courses that will potentially lead to accreditation below a level 8.  UCD no doubt has the expertise to deliver the high-quality training programmes.  It had to deliver a lot in its development of the content of the course.  Yet, the delivery is a separate question.<\/p> <p>  I raised this issue with the Minister of State in the past, after the first intake of the SNAs onto the training course.  She informed me that a public procurement competition was held and that accreditation by the national framework of qualifications, NFQ, was not a requirement.  This strikes me as a substantial oversight.  This is despite the fact that one of the key recommendations in the 2018 review by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, was for the training programme to be introduced at a minimum of a level 5 on the national framework of qualifications.   The Government even addressed the issue of formal qualifications in the terms of reference of the review.  What was the rationale for not including accreditation in the procurement process that was won by UCD?  Is UCD able to offer accreditation at level 5 or level 6 that would be appropriate?  Does the Minister of State believe that this can be worked around, or is it necessary to deliver the training of SNAs in a different setting?  Has that been addressed?  Is the current agreement with UCD a barrier to providing the training where the accreditation could be offered?  There will be 1,000 SNAs going through the ten-month programme in September.  We need to look at all options that are available in order to attach an accreditation to the course before then.

Certainly if there was an appetite for a similar type of programme, now that the precedent and the model has been set, it is something that could be looked at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062100002#M00500","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Especially with the ETBs and a link in with technological universities across the country, it could be good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062100002#M00600","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":72,"content":"<p>That issue of it being a scheme is of central importance.

We welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue of the minimum essential qualifications required to become an SNA.<\/p><p>All occupations are to a great extent defined and perceived according to the qualifications required to enter that particular workforce.  The required essential qualification for SNAs has not been reviewed or changed since 1979.<br\/><br\/>Our delegation includes SNAs who are best placed to inform the committee of the reality of the work carried out by SNAs in our schools for thousands of students who rely on their SNA to complete their education alongside their friends and peers.  Once I have concluded this opening statement, the four SNAs before the committee can explain the reality of their daily working life in different school settings.  We hope this will provide a valuable insight for them into the complex role of our SNAs.<br\/><br\/>The development of the role of the SNA started in 1979 when the then Minister for Education, John Wilson, established the child care assistant scheme.  In 1979, the focus was on labour market activation, encouraging women to re-enter the workforce in a caring role to assist students with special educational needs in schools.  The entry requirements were set at three D-grade passes in the then junior certificate.  It is likely the qualification bar was set at this level to facilitate women entering the workforce, regardless of educational background or achievement.  While this initiative was the first tentative step along the developmental pathway our SNAs have followed since, it was perhaps unfortunate the initiative was described as a scheme.  In 2022, 43 years later, the categorisation of SNA support as a statutory scheme is still in place.  This description reflects the perceptions of some that our SNAs are carrying out menial work where no formal educational achievement is required to carry out the role.  It implies precarious employment, which is still a problem, and the use of the term is derogatory and demoralising for SNAs.<br\/><br\/>In the early years of the 21st century, we saw an unprecedented growth in the number of students with special educational needs in schools and an expansion in the number of SNAs. In 1999, there were 300 SNAs.  By 2004, that number had increased to 5,800 and in 2022, provision has been made for 19,000 SNA posts.  However, the minimum essential qualification has still not been reviewed, changed or modernised.<br\/><br\/>F&oacute;rsa is not alone in asking for a review of the qualification.  The list of stakeholders who believe the time has come to change the <i>status quo<\/i>includes management bodies, the Irish Primary Principals' Network, IPPN, the teaching unions, the Second-Level Students' Union, a range of academic experts and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  All of us believe the role of the SNA has developed to the extent that a new qualification to enter the workforce is required.<br\/><br\/>It is important to examine the level of academic achievements of the existing SNA workforce before forming a firm opinion on future requirements.  In 2015, the National University of Ireland, Galway, published research on the training needs of special needs assistants in the Border, midland and western Region.  This research highlighted that from 2012 onwards, the NCSE had been calling for mandatory training for SNAs.  NUIG recommended that a level 7 qualification become mandatory for SNAs, leading to a level 8 qualification to be obtained during employment through career development.  It has announced that such a programme will continue to be available during the next academic year.  F&oacute;rsa recently surveyed more than 4,000 SNA members on the level of their educational qualifications.  Approximately 80% of respondents stated they held qualifications at Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, level 5 or above.<br\/><br\/>The NCSE's Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme, which was published in 2018, found that SNAs were in many instances expected to meet more complex needs without any training, qualifications or clinical oversight.  It recommended that this work, along with the desired greater focus on the provision of therapies and building social skills, should only be carried out by trained staff who had benefited from an educational programme set at least at QQI level 5.  In response to the NCSE review, the Department consulted F&oacute;rsa on the development of the first national SNA training programme.  The programme was delivered by the UCD school of education.  Despite the first cohort of 500 students completing the programme in February 2022, the course remains unaccredited.  SNAs completed this complex programme, consisting of 80 hours of teaching with written assessments, without any academic recognition of their achievements.<br\/><br\/>In April 2021, UCD published its preliminary evaluation report following completion of module 1 of the programme.  The data, which are set out in this opening statement, show that at the start of the programme 98% of students had already progressed beyond the minimum qualification stipulated by the Department of Education and that 62% of the students had already progressed to a level 6 QQI qualification or higher award.  Recently, the Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion indicated to F&oacute;rsa she was open to considering the accreditation of the programme.  Until today, we had not been informed of further developments.  Perhaps we might discuss the Minister of State's comments later in the session.<\/p><p> In summary, the role of our SNAs should not be described as a scheme nor should they be described as a vocational workforce who do not need professional standards.  The role of the SNA is somewhat unique in that it covers both the health and educational needs of young people.  During the pandemic attempts were made to redeploy SNAs into the health sector.  It is abundantly clear the HSE would never agree to employ someone to carry out the range of complex duties required of an SNA in a healthcare setting when the limit of the required educational achievement is set at only 3 D level passes in the junior certificate.  The labour market implications of revising the qualification can be managed through a transition process lasting several years.  Conferring a more professional status would make the role of the SNA a more attractive career option.  <\/p><p> The committee will hear this afternoon that we have yet to find a school that does not state in an SNA job advertisement that a qualification at a level much higher than the minimum is not desirable.  The expectations of parents and students also matter.  The parents of a child with additional needs want their SNA to form a bond and to be empathetic and caring.  They also have an expectation that the SNA has appropriate education and training to meet the needs of their child.  Finally our request and pending claim with the Department is for an expert review of the minimum SNA qualification with agreed terms of reference and a commitment from the Minister to implement the recommendations.  SNAs have been waiting a long time to have their say.  They have been waiting for 43 years for proper recognition, which simply will not be achieved without a change to the minimum essential qualification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062100002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andy Pike","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I have been a SNA in a special school for the past 15 years and I love my job.  Every day it can be vastly different and it always keeps us on our toes.  Over my time there I have worked with wonderful children who have additional needs but no matter what challenges some of the children may face, our school community is committed to keeping the needs of each child at the centre of all that we do.  That is why in our school, and in schools throughout the country, SNAs cater for much more than care needs on a day-to-day basis.  We help to carry out speech and language, occupational therapy and physiotherapy programmes.  We help the children to access the curriculum through resources, games and extra help.  We help with programmes such as Literacy Lift Off, Edmark and many others.  We support children emotionally and partake in positive behaviour sports strategies.  We work together as a team to ensure that all our children receive an excellent education and to help them reach their full potential.  We can do this because we are supported by the school to partake in learning opportunities and accredited courses that will support and enhance the lives and education of those children with whom we work.  Our school is not unique.

As Mr. Pike said, 43 years ago the educational standard to become an SNA was three grade Ds at group or intermediate certificate level.  By the 1990s, a movement was growing towards having children with additional educational needs integrated into mainstream schools.  Today, there are 19,000 SNAs.  In 2018, there were about 930,000 students in primary and secondary schools, of whom one in four had an additional educational need.  This is 230,000 students.  We ask the Department to stop referring to these 19,000 employees as a \"scheme\" or to SNAs as \"SNA resources\".  We are an integral part of the education system.  Inclusion for all students is a stated ambition of the school inclusion model and we expect to grow in number and expertise in the years to come.  The range of conditions for which SNAs are employed is great and includes complex medical, physical, sensory, cognitive, social, communication, behavioural and neurological conditions.  Some of the conditions include autism, Down's syndrome, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, diabetes, visual and auditory impairment, cystic fibrosis and fragile x.  The list goes on and it is not exhaustive.<\/p><p>For SNAs to provide the support that students in their care need then they must have a comprehensive understanding of complex conditions.  For the successful inclusion of these students, they must have the necessary skills to support them.<\/p><p> SNAs in many schools are very far from being respected.  This is largely due to the perception that they do not have a high level of education.  It is entirely unacceptable for the Department of Education to persist with this assertion that the current academic standard of three Grade Ds is sufficient to work as an SNA.  It is nothing short of insulting to the students that the Department deems it unnecessary for SNAs to have a qualification that reflects the level of care and support required for these students to succeed in school.  The Department is fully aware of this and allows a situation to prevail where it does not have to acknowledge the academic standards required to meet the needs of the students with additional educational needs while at the same time knowing that schools will only employ SNAs who have relevant qualifications.  This is a very disingenuous position for the Department to hold. <\/p><p> It is long past time for the educational standards to be revised upwards.  SNAs have always known this.  Teachers and principals know this too.  Parents and students deserve it.  Finally, the Department also knows it and has done for a long time.  The Minister for Education, and the Minister of State who has responsibility for special education and inclusion, both need to do the right thing.  Raise the minimum qualification and show SNAs the respect that they have deserved for so long. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062100002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catriona Galster","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I have been an SNA for 22 years in a mainstream school.

We address the children's needs and prevent exclusion from the classroom, and any distress caused by them not having the coping skills through no fault of their own.  I work alongside the teacher and assist her with modelling self-regulation skills, co-operative play and promoting self-esteem.<\/p> <p>  The zones of regulation are used daily in our room and they are an important tool for all children.

After this, we bring the children to the sensory room.  Depending on the children, my colleagues and I may offer to separate the best care possible to meet the high needs of the children.  We meet back in the classroom and do one-to-one work with them, which varies depending on the individual needs that range between general assistance to accessing the curriculum.

This gives rise to a lot of discontent and a lot of menial work being allocated.  We have a situation where half of schools have realised they need to be a little more respectful towards SNAs but we still have a job to do as a union to persuade the other half of the sector to follow suit.  We do not run a survey because if we did, the number of people complaining that they are not respected would be pretty high.  Going on the complaints that come through to the union office, we are looking at approximately half and half.  Perhaps that is being a bit optimistic.  The specific focus we want SNAs to have is on students with additional educational needs and the complex needs the committee has heard about.  When we hear the Department and the NCSE mention that SNAs could be an all-school resource we worry that the message going to principals means they could be allocated work that has nothing to do with meeting the needs of students with additional educational needs.

According to a survey conducted by UCD, 2.14% of the 500 SNAs are working with the minimum educational requirement.  This represents those who attained three grade Ds in the junior certificate.  A total of 60% work with QQI levels 5 and 6.  SNAs are highly skilled professional workers.  It quite insulting to suggest that a course run in conjunction with the Department of Education would not be accredited.  The 500 SNAs who started the course believed it would be accredited.  Having graduated from UCD in February, it is simply not good enough to find it is not accredited.  A total of &euro;2.4 million was invested by the Department in the course.

That is part of the problem with the qualification.  In the school, the teachers are all educated to a minimum of level 8, yet there is a huge disparity in the educational requirement for SNAs.

This is to their credit.<\/p> <p>  The opening remarks placed great emphasis on the classification of the SNA role as being part of a scheme.  I had previous conversations with Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan in meetings about this issue.  It is front and centre as part of the problem.  While the Minister of State gave a level of comfort regarding the work that is ongoing to deal with the essential accreditation we spoke about and the basic requirements, I was a bit taken aback by her apparent surprise that the classification of the role as a scheme was problematic.  She said that it was dealt with by circular, as if circulars cannot change, evolve or be reissued.  Therefore, the emphasis the SNAs have placed on this scheme, when compared with the response from the Minister of State, is the biggest thing I took away from this session.  <\/p> <p>  I ask Mr. Pike and Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan to flesh out the issue concerning the scheme and its classification.  Regarding my comments around the late date for the allocation of SNAs, namely, 31 May, the issue of CPD that teachers get but SNAs do not, July provision, the different rates of pay and the individual stories in schools, that we also know about, do all these issues lead back to the lack of certainty found in these roles and to the lack of respect for them?

This is the case for the students because over the years the scheme has resulted in SNA supports being withdrawn from students.  The parents have appealed, but the exceptional review process has a success rate that is very low in respect of the overall number of appeals submitted.  The impermanence for the SNAs themselves stems from this being insecure and precarious employment.  The people in these roles do not know from year to year if they will have a job.  We were hoping that a new front-loading approach, which would give at least three years of certainty, would be introduced, with negotiation and agreement, at some stage, and potentially this year.  Apparently, this cannot now happen and SNAs are therefore still in a quandary.  They are part of a scheme where resources can be provided and then taken away.  Where an SNA post is lost, there is no redeployment mechanism.  There is a redundancy scheme, but there is no right to keep a post.  Almost uniquely among our 350,000 public servants, therefore, we have this group of SNAs in insecure, impermanent and precarious employment.<\/p> <p>  I turn now to the July provision and the interesting issues the Deputy raised in this regard.<\/p><p>I will hand over presently to my colleague, Ms O'Mahony, to speak further on this.

That is a very disrespectful way to treat not just a few people but the entire workforce.  We must find a better way of handling it next year.  It would be different if there were a redeployment scheme whereby someone who is losing a post in a school would have the certainty that as more posts are added to the system, there will be a job for him or her not too far away.

I will be killed stone dead if I do not remember all their names.  There was Vicky, Kathleen, Sandra, Fionnuala, Ciara and Eileen but I am sure I have forgotten somebody.  The very first year I taught after becoming qualified, I had an SNA in my classroom, but I was given no direction or education in terms of how to work with that person.  As far as I was concerned, I had another educator inside the classroom but there was no guidance given to me on how I was to structure that person's working day.  How the role of the SNA works in practice is very dependent on the relationship with the teacher.  I will not ask the SNA witnesses to comment but I am sure they found their working situation changed from year to year as the teacher changed.  Teachers are quite constrained in how they can make use of the talent of the person who is in the room with them and what they can ask that individual to do within the guidelines of the description of the job.  If we really allowed SNAs to fulfil their role as professionals within the education system, we could derive a lot more benefit from the role.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of specific questions for Mr. Pike on some of the statistics he gave us regarding the level of qualifications in the SNA workforce.

It is essential that we provide an accreditation but we have to make sure it is at the right level.<\/p><p> On a more general question, how does one choose to be an SNA at this point?

In order to belong and to feel connected to others, there must be mutual respect.  There is no place for hierarchies.  There is certainly no place for schools where a significant number of staff are made to feel they are very firmly at the bottom of the ladder and that is where they are going to stay, or that they are a resource to be used at the discretion of the principal in order to carry out a variety of inappropriate or meaningless tasks which have nothing to do with students.  That is something I know drives SNAs crazy.  Inclusion must encompass full understanding among staff and students of the different roles the staff members have and a greater respect for the need for all staff to work together in order for that inclusive school to prosper into the future.

All of us in this room know we do far more than that and, without us, the children would not be able to access the curriculum or attend school.  We saw that, as Ms Jordan mentioned, throughout Covid-19 and trying to work with these children through lockdowns.<\/p> <p>  The crux of the matter, and at times I feel the Department of Education forgets this, is that the reason we are here is for the children with whom we work.  We want to give the best care possible to those children.  All we want is for them to be able to come to school and be supported by an SNA.  The respect element comes in when we are left time and again waiting to find out whether we have jobs and whether children have school places in September.  Without our crucial role in a classroom, many children in this country would not have a school place, and that is a fact.  Most parents, if not all, would back us on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062100002#Z00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Linda O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":133,"content":"<p>From Ms O'Mahony's assessment as an SNA and with respect to the children for whom she is responsible, where would they be in their educational development if they did not have an SNA available to them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062100002#Z00800","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I am in a special school and we work as part of a team.

As Mr. Pike said, the concern is the when, the time and how long this will take.  To put it from the child's perspective, at the moment, the expectation any child can have when he or she accesses the curriculum and gets the support of an SNA is that the SNA would have three Ds in the junior certificate.  That is the expectation.  However, the reality on the ground, as shown in my examples, is that they are required to have FETAC level 5 or 6 and they must engage in continuing professional development, CPD.  There are disparities with what is happening on the ground throughout the country.  We need to standardise that.  We need to look towards future-proofing the service.  I do not need to labour the point.  We know the evolution of special education from 1979 to now.  It does not mean it stops here.  This could be the beginning of something where we could lead the way and have a world-class service.  We are not going to do that if we ponder too much over a minimum qualification when we know the reality on the ground is dramatically different from it.<\/p> <p>  To respond to a couple of things that were covered around the view of unskilled labour, we have had SNAs on to us in the past week who have been asked to clean fish tanks, clean out lockers, laminate things, mop floors and things like that.  This has taken the SNAs away from the role they should have with the children.  It breaks down goodwill in the school and damages relationships.  A lot of that would be solved by putting in a minimum education qualification which would set the tone of respect they deserve.<\/p><p>While the vast majority of schools have very much come on board and have shown over the years that they have evolved and value their SNAs, this would eliminate the potential in those areas, which are minor but still create significant problems.<\/p><p> On the piece around continuous professional development, how can SNAs continuously develop and look to enhance their role and move with the times when there is no standard from which they are moving or that that standard is so low?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062100002#AA00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Lambert","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lambert.

First, I welcome all of our guests to the committee today and it is an absolute privilege to be involved with the respect for SNA campaigns, if even at a small level.  Some 43 years on, we are all more open now around disabilities in Ireland.  We are no longer ashamed at having a child who has a disability or want to shy away from it.  I understand that the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, was in all of the newspapers looking to establish educational centres for people with additional educational needs.  We know that putting the Traveller community into boxes has never worked and we also know that putting people with disabilities or with extra educational needs into such boxes does not work either.<\/p> <p>  Speaking to Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan, I have a qualification but I do not see myself as someone who has completed a scheme.  I completed a qualification in Ballyfermot College of Further Education for ten months, like Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan did, where we studied junior growth and development, psychology, etc., and how to work with young people in an educational setting.  Kathleen Noone was in charge of the course, it is still available in Ballyfermot College of Further Education and it was brilliant.  I completed the course in 2010.  <\/p> <p>  I went on to work in a school in Ballyfermot for nearly two years and I know I am giving myself credit in saying this but it was great to work with that young person.  I was not just a carer but was also an educator, that is, someone that young person could speak to.  I became an SNA because when I was ten years of age I lost my mother and a few days after that I was in an accident.  I had SNAs myself from time to time when I was in bad places, although I do not usually speak about that publicly.<\/p><p>Times have changed in our society and we need to change with them.  We need to recognise SNAs as professionals.  We also need to avoid labelling young people who are assigned SNAs.  We now have 19,000 SNAs in our country and we must respect them by recognising their profession.  It is not an easy course to do.  In terms of mainstreaming equality for young children to enable them to reach their full potential, sometimes there can be barriers in our school settings and the SNAs help to break down those barriers.  I know that from personal experience.  <\/p><p> It is the right thing to do and I urge the SNAs here not to give up hope because community development work was only recognised as a profession relatively recently.  That said, I have no doubt that the witnesses will be back here next year looking for SNAs to be recognised as a profession.  Unfortunately, the political will is not there yet but the witnesses have run a brilliant campaign.  It is important to continue to put pressure on the Department.  Of course, a review needs to be done but we need to recognise SNAs as a profession first.<\/p><p> If there are any outstanding comments that the witnesses would like to make on the record, they have a minute to do so.

There is a standard approach for how we treat teachers.  It does not make any sense for the work plans for SNAs to be decided on a school-by-school or teacher-by-teacher basis.  It is not just about the accreditation but also about standardised contracts and terms and conditions.  The pandemic has shown us that SNAs are invaluable.  We have seen that other things can change and that many people can work from home, including teachers but the one cohort for whom we needed the schools to be open was children with special needs.

All of our members who are SNAs, and there are many thousands in F&oacute;rsa, will recognise Senator Flynn as a friend.  I am not going to make too many comments about the proposed SEN centres.  There has been a lot of discussion around that.  It is our policy to try to deliver and support an education system that is really inclusive but we do not see the establishment of SEN centres as being necessarily inclusive.  The problem of children with additional educational needs not being able to find an appropriate school place is a very real one but we do not necessarily think that the SEN centre is the way to resolve that problem.  While we would be critical of the Department of Education on a daily, if not hourly, basis from time to time, I am not at all certain that all of the fault lies with the Department.  A lot of schools that do not want to accept students with additional needs should have a damned good look at their own policies and their consciences.  It should not be the case that they worry that providing school places for students with different educational needs will lower the tone or the academic standing of the school.  Senator Flynn used the term \"mainstreaming equality\".<\/p><p>It is the best way that I have ever found of looking at equality issues because every decision an organisation makes is viewed from the perspective of how we can increase equality and equity and what will be the consequences of what we do for disadvantaged groups.  That is mainstreaming equality and it is central to everything we do.  At the moment, many schools have to be given a wake-up call by the Minister, through the enactment of legislation, to get them to take seriously their responsibilities to provide school places to members of the Traveller community, students with additional education needs and anyone else who needs a place, rather than adopt a selective admissions policy which does so much damage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062100002#CC00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andy Pike","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly also asked questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062100002#DD00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":152,"content":"<p>The standardised approach the Senator advocates is something we would agree with.

In schools that are administered by education and training boards, SNAs, as well as teachers, can stand for election to become the staff representative on the board of management, which is great, but that is not the case in independent schools.  A change to statutory arrangements is needed to allow that to happen.  Under the handbook, only teachers can stand to become members of the board of management in a school.

In many ways, the difficulty can be getting independent schools to adhere to that contract or at least its principles.  There is too much flexibility and independence in independent schools that enables them to step outside the terms of the contract.  There is very little accountability because of the way the employment relationship is structured with the Department of Education in a kind of tripartite system.<\/p> <p>  The point about disparities was mentioned and it is important.  We have been very clear that we are not saying that just because a particular public service grade gets a benefit or entitlement, it should automatically apply to SNAs.  However it should apply to them when there is no objective justification as to why it should not.  An example is bereavement leave.  SNAs currently receive significantly less bereavement leave compared with that enjoyed by other civil and public servants.  There is no difference between the grief an SNA in a school will experience when he or she loses a loved one, whether it be a partner, parent or a member of his or her extended family, and that of a teacher colleague who can get more bereavement leave.  However, the teacher and SNA both get less bereavement leave than the civil servant who might be sitting in a Department office.  If we want to talk about inclusion, we need to lead by example and eliminate these disparities where they have no justification.  If there is a legitimate and objective justification, that is fine and one stands over that principled position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022062100002#DD00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Lambert"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I was taken aback by the statement that a SNA had to clean out a fish tank.

Over the last few months, the committee has heard from me, D&oacute;chas members and their partners about the war in Ukraine, the humanitarian crisis affecting people in the region, and the impact on global food prices, which is particularly affecting those in low-income countries.  The disruption to food, fuel and fertiliser markets has exacerbated an existing food crisis in the Horn of Africa and in west Africa, which has been driven by conflict, climate shocks and economic pressures.  I am joined today in person by Mr. Paul O&rsquo;Brien, CEO of Plan International Ireland, Ms Mary Van Lieshout, deputy CEO of Goal, Mr. Colm Byrne, humanitarian manager with Oxfam Ireland, and virtually by Oxfam&rsquo;s regional director for west Africa, Ms Assalama Sidi.<\/p> <p>  Before I hand over to my colleagues, let me give an overview of why this year&rsquo;s pre-budget submission and our engagement with the committee today is crucial.  Last week D&oacute;chas members held a briefing to sound the alarm on famine in the Horn of Africa.  We were heartened to see many Oireachtas colleagues present and engaged.  The figures are stark.  Some 23 million people are at risk of severe hunger; 350,000 children are at risk of death in the coming months in Somalia alone; and one person dies from hunger every 48 seconds.  Equally horrifying is the fact that up to 38 million people are at risk of hunger in West Africa and I am very grateful Ms Sidi can join us today to talk though what is happening in that region.<\/p> <p>  It is incomprehensible in 2022 that we are in a situation where the risk of famine is a reality for hundreds and thousands of people, especially children.  However, the deadly combination of climate change, conflict and the economic impact of Covid-19 has left lives hanging in the balance.  The situation is not just affecting those living in traditionally arid landscapes or those in conflict affected communities.  Its reach is much greater and far wider.  I was briefed by one of our members, Brighter Communities Worldwide, in Kenya last week.  Everywhere they work, they are seeing people moving closer and closer to food insecurity daily as a result of fields that were not sown due to the cost of inputs; irregular rains, so the growth is not there; and then rising prices.  The price of flour in Kenya has almost trebled in six months and this is not sustainable.<\/p> <p>  There is action that can be taken however.  As a rich nation, Ireland can lead by example both internationally and domestically.  As will be illustrated in our submission, our overseas aid programme is not keeping pace with the need or indeed the targets Ireland has committed to.  To this end, D&oacute;chas is recommending incremental targets to 0.7% from 2023 to 2030.  Increasing Ireland&rsquo;s investment in overseas development assistance, ODA, in 2023 to meet 0.37% of GNI would put the country on track towards 0.7% and move Ireland into the top ten donors of the OECD development assistance committee, DAC.  <\/p> <p>  We recognise the pressure on budget 2023 and on the Irish people given the impact of the global food crisis, rising inflation and the subsequent cost of living increases.  However, we urge that Ireland shows support and solidarity to those in crisis-affected communities, through our commitment to and delivery of overseas development assistance.  Research has show that 77% of Irish people believe ODA is vitally important and is a way for Ireland to clearly demonstrate its global solidarity, shared humanity and respect for human rights.  It is imperative that we acts urgently on four key areas.  These are hunger, climate, conflict and Covid-19.  Increasing our investment in these key areas allows Ireland to leverage its knowledge, influence, reputation and expertise on a global stage and to tackle structural and root causes through very practical action.  <\/p> <p>  We are asking the committee members, and all Oireachtas Members, to support our call to action and the recommendations set out in the D&oacute;chas pre-budget submission.  We recommend scaling up our ODA investment in 2023 and beyond to meet the commitment to spending 0.7% of GNI on ODA by 2030.  We ask that we ensure we release flexible multi-year funding to meet the current humanitarian appeals for the Horn of Africa and west Africa regions.  We ask that we advocate at the UN Security Council for accountability for those who seek to use starvation as a weapon of war.  We ask that we support the scale up of investment in social protection programmes and sustainable livelihoods to protect and strengthen hard-won development gains.  We ask that we act to protect World Food Programme supply chains and that we do more to lower CO2 emissions and to support climate adaptation measures.  We need political action and we need leadership.  Every day of delay exacerbates human suffering, increases the scale of the crisis we are seeing and raises the cost of the response.  <\/p> <p>  I will now hand over to Oxfam&rsquo;s regional director for west Africa, Ms Assalama Sidi, after which I and my colleagues will welcome committee members' input and any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022062100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane-Ann McKenna"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McKenna.<\/p><p>I welcome Ms Sidi.

It is a real honour and opportunity for Oxfam to be before such an audience and to speak about west Africa and the food crisis that is happening right now.<\/p> <p>  In west Africa, 27 million people were suffering from hunger already in April.  The likelihood of this number growing to 38 million is high if nothing is done.  While we are seeing support here and there, we are afraid that target will be met and I will develop on that point.<\/p> <p>  This crisis is actually an historic high in terms of increase.  It is an increase of 40% from June to August 2021 - that is a year.  Between 2015 and 2020, the number of people in need of emergency food assistance nearly quadrupled from 7 million to 27 million.  Right now, 6.3 million children under five are acutely malnourished.  That is an increase of 28% from last year.<\/p> <p>  In west Africa, especially in countries where we are observing conflicts of differing natures, communities are abandoning their agricultural land.  This is not only due to conflicts but also due to droughts and flooding.  Of course, climate change is behind the droughts and the recurring flooding that we are seeing in west Africa.  As the committee members all will be aware, west Africa is not part of the world which is polluting but it is being crucially hit by climate change effects from pollution.<\/p> <p>  Some 61 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection in west Africa in 2022.  Unfortunately, in the case of any type of humanitarian crisis, girls and women suffer the most.  We witness all types of gender violence.  In the Sahel, as food becomes scarce and conflict persists, more girls are forced into early marriage and, of course, are victims of all types of violence, including sexual abuse.<\/p> <p>  It is important to share some of the underlying root causes of this crisis and the structural factors of the food crisis.  Earlier I mentioned climate change.  Climate change is threatening already fragile livelihoods and will continue to negatively impact the food system.  All west African countries are countries with a high level of vulnerability to climate change but, of course, unfortunately, a low level of readiness.  Under a business-as-usual scenario worldwide, climate change is projected to be higher in west Africa than the global mean with a rise in average temperatures of 3&deg;C to 6&deg;C by 2101.  The Sahel is the most likely to experience the largest changes with an increase of extreme weather events and the depletion of water.<\/p> <p>  In addition to climate change, any time we watch media we see the conflicts in the Sahel, in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.  Protracted conflicts and displacement is a vulnerability multiplier for the food and nutrition crisis in central and Sahel Africa.  Violent conflicts continue to limit humanitarian space while increasing the number of displaced persons in the region and the negative impact of conflict dynamics on the protection of civilians and on their access to infrastructure that is critical for their survival and well-being, including humanitarian assistance, cannot be overstated.  We, as humanitarian actors, have difficulties accessing those people in need and providing them with the assistance that they require.<\/p> <p>  Other aggravating factors include cereal production.  This year, in Sahel, it has been declining steadily.  For instance, in Niger, where I am currently based, the production has decreased by approximately 36% from last year.  This, of course, makes food stock run out very fast and the hunger season starting very early.  Normally, in this region, the hunger season starts in May or June but this year in October and November we already saw people suffering and leaving because of the food crisis.<\/p> <p>  Of course, there is also the residual effect of Covid-19.  While west Africa did not suffer from this pandemic as the other parts of the world, it is important to remember that with a global world, any difficulties in trade in one part of the continent could affect all the others.  West Africa has been suffering from the residual crisis of Covid-19 because of the high importation of goods from countries, such as China and European countries.<\/p> <p>  Another important factor is the crisis in Ukraine.  The crisis in Ukraine is likely to make the situation dangerously worse.  We are seeing commodity prices increasing already and the trend is worrying for us.  The price may cause a decrease in wheat availability for six countries.  Six of the west African countries rely on Ukraine and Russia for wheat importation.  They import 30% to 50% of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine.  One of the most concerning aspects is that many donors have already indicated that they may cut funding to Africa to finance the reception of refugees in Europe.  We have seen cases of countries in Europe which have taken such a grave commitment.<\/p> <p>  The asks would not be different from what my D&oacute;chas colleague says.  Donors are slow to disburse the urgently needed funds for a timely response.  More than two months after the EU high-level conference to address the food and nutrition crisis in the Sahel, the average funding for the UN humanitarian response plan is below 20%.  For instance, for countries such as Burkina Faso, it is 15%.  For Chad, it is 16%.  For Mali, it is 11%.  Oxfam urgently needs &euro;35.6 million to support 1.1 million during the three months of the rainy season in west Africa.  Without timely long-term assistance, the vulnerable population will be forced to take negative action that especially affects girls, such as early marriage and dropping out of school, and, of course, impoverishing families.  Donors need to ensure their response to the Ukrainian conflict is funded by additional funds that do not jeopardise funding for other, less visible crises such as the one happening in west Africa.  Other countries, such as Norway, have already committed to do this.  Of course, we must continue to address the growing humanitarian needs while investing in the root causes of the inequality, poverty and poor governance.  I will stop here.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for this opportunity.  It is a great honour to speak about west Africa because for weeks and months, west Africa was not really on the radar.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022062100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Assalama Sidi"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Sidi.

They highlight a stark and real crisis that, unfortunately, is not unfolding; it is happening before our eyes.  The call has to go out again that the world must act.  We have no option.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the four key areas that Ireland needs to act on.  There is an onus on the world to act.  I reiterate the four are hunger, climate, conflict and Covid.  Coming out of our last major crisis here in this country which was Covid, the vaccine inequality is real and still hard hitting.<\/p><p>I heard of the experience in west Africa but that is not a shared experience.  Covid may not have hit as badly in west Africa as elsewhere but it is still a major challenge.  I reiterate my call for vaccine equity right across the developing world.<\/p><p> I will not go through all of the points because I agree with everything the witnesses have outlined.  I also have some specific questions.  I agree that the onset of the brutal and barbaric war in Ukraine has had an impact, obviously in Ukraine but also right across the globe.  Starvation should not be used in any circumstance as a weapon of war.  Unfortunately, we are seeing this with more than 22 million tonnes of grain locked and held hostage in this game of chess being played out by Putin.  It is absolutely grotesque.<\/p><p> We also had gross underfunding of the World Food Programme before the onset of the Covid pandemic.  Many projects are being cut in Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan, Uganda, and down through Mali, Mozambique, the Republic of Congo, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.  The list is endless.  Reference was made to some other projects that are also being cut in Yemen.  There is a crisis in funding for food programmes.  I fear the situation in Ukraine will be used by donors to divert funding elsewhere, in all probability to buy weapons of war.  That is understandable given the brutal conflict in Ukraine, but I appeal to nations to provide additional funding.  Critical programmes such as this should not be cut.<\/p><p> I would like to get some comments on a broader issue.  We heard some commentary about not cutting critical funding.  Will our guests comment on the needs the challenges around funding that has been cut in other programmes?  Will they also touch on the situation with Covid and the need for vaccine equity, including the impact this issue is having?  I agree with all of the witnesses' asks, none of which I will challenge.  I thank them very much for attending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022062100002#C00600","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Brady.  I will defer to my colleague Mr. Byrne on the impact of the funding cuts.  One of the effects we are seeing is with the suppliers to the World Food Programme.  The ration portions are getting smaller and what is being distributed is getting smaller.  It is getting more expensive to give the same amount of food.  This is directly impacting people on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022062100002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane-Ann McKenna"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I acknowledge Deputy Brady's support for the Overseas Development Institute, ODI.  It is a very important expression of support for us as a group, for the NGO community at large and for our partners on the ground.<br\/><br\/>More broadly, on the question of funding, I will just put the issue in very practical terms.  As the supply goes down, the price of food goes up, and as the price of food goes up, households are simply unable to meet their basic food requirements.  It is a very simple economic equation.  As the Deputy has rightly described, the problem right now is a perfect storm.  We have disruption of food production at the global level, a global climate crisis and the very localised experience of communities which have an immediate lack of access to water and the basic means of survival.<br\/><br\/>I want to put this into perspective.  This is a political choice.  We have had plenty of warnings about this food crisis.  It is a perfect storm and it has certainly been accentuated by the conflict in Ukraine, but we have had plenty of warnings.  This is the fifth failed rainy season in east Africa and west Africa.  Last year, the number of people in need and in acute crisis was estimated to be 10 million.  This year, the figure has more than doubled to 23 million people.  It has doubled because we failed to act early.  The statistics we have suggest - and we feel very confident in this - that if we respond early, we rapidly reduce the cost of humanitarian response.<br\/><br\/>I do not want to get too caught up in the numbers.  It is not just about reducing the cost of the humanitarian response.  Our estimates suggest that every &euro;1 invested in preventing a crisis saves &euro;3 in launching a humanitarian response.  We all agree that prevention is better than cure.  Humanitarian aid is a <b>B<\/b>and-Aid.  It is hugely expensive and it does not address the root causes of the problem.  When we delay in responding to the problem, it gets bigger and when the problem gets bigger there is more conflict over resources.  When there is more conflict over resources there is more population displacement.  With more population displacement, there are more people in need, and on and on we go in this downward spiral of really negative experience.  It is not just at a country or regional level; it goes right down to the individual household level.<br\/><br\/>The one thing I would really like to highlight is that every &euro;1 we spend in prevention prevents &euro;3 needed for the cure.  This is at a time when we have never been more concerned about financial prudence.  The opportunity is there.  There is a political will that if we release funding early, we can prevent this crisis.  When we come here, we are often asked whether we have any good news.  Currently, the answer is &quot;Not now&quot;, but the opportunity is to create good news and make good news.  We talk about a three C's of Covid, climate and conflict.  I would add a fourth C, complacency.  We will not be forgiven if we delay any further.  We will not be forgiven by our communities and the partners we work with if we make more excuses to divert overseas aid for other purposes, particularly for domestic needs in the European environment.  I must underline that we have an opportunity to correct what is already a great injustice and a great wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022062100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh has indicated that he must leave the meeting, so we will allow him to speak after Deputy Cowen, before returning to the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022062100002#D00400","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

The witnesses are making a pitch to the Government to respond, insofar as it can, in the ongoing budgetary process, which is eagerly awaited on many fronts, not least with the demands on the Exchequer to meet the response that is necessary as a result of Covid and war and the impact of war on the cost of living.  Thankfully, we have never failed in our duty and responsibility in the area of overseas aid, from many difficult times through to the even more difficult times we currently face.  As my colleague from Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputy Brady, noted, there is an onus of responsibility not just on us but also on the wider European Union and the world's powers to respond accordingly.<\/p> <p>  I hear and acknowledge what the witnesses have said.

I hope to be speaking in the D&aacute;il on some of these issues during the pre-European Council statements shortly.  As a result, I apologise if I have to leave straight away after receiving the witnesses' answers.<\/p> <p>  I very often try to understand these matters through the prism of the strategic development goals because they comprise a multifaceted, cross-departmental way of understanding them.  It was said that, owing to Covid, we lost ten years of progress on the sustainable development goals.  I wonder how much more we are losing due to the conflict in Ukraine.  The goals that jump out are goal 1, which is to have no poverty.  How quickly we are travelling backwards on this.  Goal 2 is to have zero hunger.  Goal 5 relates to gender equality.  As Ms Sidi said, it is always women and girls who suffer most in conflicts.<\/p> <p>  I will try to be reasonably brief.  I will outline two concerns I have and then ask three questions.  The two concerns were outlined by previous speakers.  There is genuine concern that our overseas development aid expenditure will be directed towards our Ukrainian response.  A very clear message has to go out, including in our pre-budget preparations, that we must retain a significant proportion of our overseas development aid for the work in the least-developed countries.  We can be rightly proud of this work in Ireland.  My second concern is that an emergency response is absolutely required in the Horn of Africa.  I fully accept Mr. Byrne's comment that if we spend early, we will spend less.  We are at a point where an emergency response is absolutely necessitated, but we have to make sure that does not undercut our long-term response, of which Ireland can be rightly proud in terms of its overseas development aid expenditure.  We cannot afford to lose that type of progress because, in the longer term, we need to build capacity in our partner countries, particularly on social protection measures and aspects of gender.<\/p> <p>  My three questions may not relate 100% to our own budget preparations.  One of the great failures of COP26 was loss and damage.  Ahead of COP27, which will happen on the African continent, what moves would the delegates like to see emanating from the Irish State to prepare the ground for something significant and meaningful regarding a loss-and-damage facility?  My second question is related.  Where can we make progress on climate finance?  I am not just talking about leveraging our own overseas development aid but also about building a climate finance facility that will be fit for purpose to do the job.  Third, how can we leverage the UN Security Council seat?  I am acutely aware that we hold the pen on the conflict and hunger file.  Has there ever been a time when that has been more pertinent and important?<\/p> <p>  I have a fourth question.  I have talked a little about gender.  There must be an emergency response.

Much to our shame, we are having an impact on what other people are living with.  Our actions are having a very real and tangible impact on other people's ability to simply stay alive.  The disproportionate impact of climate change, whether it involves conflict, drought, flooding or the need for humanitarian aid, needs to be called out.  It needs to be carried out in area 4  If possible.  Ultimately, the potential global impact is much greater than what most people realise.  Our actions and other people's suffering have potential on a global scale, and the response needs to be global.<\/p> <p>  Deputy John Brady mentioned a very good example of where the global response failed, and that was in respect of access to vaccines when required.  We must not allow that again.  Mr. Byrne mentioned simple economics earlier.  Another simple economic fact is that one cannot do more with less; it is just not possible.  One may stand still for a period but certainly will not be able to do more.  More needs to be done.<\/p> <p>  I have a specific question for Ms Sidi.  I may have misheard her when she referred to a hunger season.  I would like her to correct me if I picked her up incorrectly.  We have four seasons in our world.  Have we now got to the point where hunger lasts for a season as an everyday eventuality in people's lives?  Seasons last for three months.  Is this issue planned for?<\/p> <p>  The question I have is in some ways rather simple but it is important to ask it.  There has been talk of the UN Security Council.  Last April, there was the on-boarding session that Ireland hosted at the Security Council to develop a greater understanding of conflict and hunger.  It is important to do that work but understanding an issue and taking action to address it are very different.  From an Irish perspective, I see a need for us to act immediately to address the problem facing us.  Also, we have a very important role in prevention and long-term intervention.  Regarding the response to the threat multipliers, irrespective of whether they relate to nutrition, hunger or security, is there a greater or new role emerging for Ireland in addition to the existing one and the aid already made available?  How do we harness the knowledge and influence we have to meet the new and emerging needs?<\/p> <p>  The delegation was absolutely correct to call out the disproportionate impact on women and children.  Very often, they are the first to be impacted upon, but they are also the last to benefit from any positive and meaningful change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022062100002#E00300","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I apologise to Senator Ardagh.

Many people probably do not know there is such a crisis in the offing.  It is probably up to us, as public representatives, to let people know there is a catastrophe coming down the road.  It is really upsetting.  It seems so far away.  The way it is being spoken about, it seems as if it is a case of them and us.  It is amazing how something small that we can do can have such a great impact if we put the funds in place.  However, it is important to have a better public awareness campaign on the crisis in the Horn of Africa.  As others have said, politicians' focus is on the war in Ukraine.  The funds follow the public sentiment, unfortunately.

I also thank the members for their questions.  It is great to hear that there is such receptivity to the issues we are raising, even though many of us feel quite powerless in this situation.  We are extremely proud of Irish overseas aid development, the work done by Irish Aid and the way Irish Aid acts as a donor.  We do not have tied aid and we have great flexibility.  Even at the time of Covid, Irish Aid showed great flexibility in allowing the agencies to repurpose money in order to deal with the Covid crisis.<\/p> <p>  I also want to talk about the hunger crisis.  I am 37 years in the sector at this stage.  I went to Kenya in the mid-1980s, which seems fad&oacute; fad&oacute;, as my daughter would say to me.  This is the worst crisis we have faced.  I do not ever remember a crisis cutting right across the whole of Africa.  Ms Sidi spoke about west Africa and we are talking about the Horn of Africa, east Africa and the Sahel.  We did not even mention Afghanistan and women.  We have not even mentioned places like Haiti and so on.  I do not think we have ever seen a crisis as large at a time when aid budgets across many countries are under so much pressure.  We have talked about the Ukraine crisis, the availability of wheat and oil and what that has done for food availability.  There is also the money issue.  A lot of European donors are cutting their overseas aid budgets and doing exactly as people feared by putting the money into dealing with the Ukrainian refugee crisis in their countries.  That has a worrying impact.  The numbers are so great there and that is the big challenge.<\/p> <p>  What we are starting to talk about here is also very interesting.  It is a question of empathy.  Are we losing our empathy as a nation?  I am very encouraged by the words I am hearing from the members of this committee but there is an issue with the media.  There has been a huge focus on Ukraine.  It is impossible for us as aid agencies to get the media to look at this crisis and present it as the crisis it is, that is, one of the biggest crises to face us in our generation.<\/p> <p>  It is very easy to go into the millions of people and children so I might give some anecdotal evidence instead.  I was talking to our country director in Somalia yesterday and she told me stories of women having to make choices as to which child they feed that day.  I have never heard that before.  I have also heard of young girls being very worried when they see their mothers having a chat with a man on the street, because they are worried that conversation will revert to marriage and that they will be married off before the night is done.  We are seeing those coping mechanisms coming into play.  Ms Sidi has talked about the length of the hunger season and things coming earlier.  We are seeing coping mechanisms coming much earlier.  We have a massive crisis on our hands.  In previous crises, we were confident that if we got the money we might be able to deal with them.  With this crisis, we are not so confident because the price of food is going up and the availability is going down.  When we look at famine in different countries, we always look at two issues.  One is access to food.  Sometimes by putting cash in people's hands, they can go and buy food.  The other issue is availability and whether food is available on the local market.  It is about getting the combination of those two things right.  People have to have access through money in their pockets but food also has to be available at a price that is reasonable for people.<\/p> <p>  I could go on about the hunger season because it is a very interesting question.  Ms Sidi will talk about that as well.  In my 37 years, people talking about a hunger season is something we got used to.  The hunger season is essentially the time between the last harvest and the new harvest coming in.  People in different places have coping mechanisms to deal with that.  In some places I have seen people resort to making local brew and things like that to numb the hunger at that period.  In some places that period is getting longer for people.<\/p> <p>  I know there are questions around the sustainable development goals, SDGs.  For us as agencies the SDGs have almost gone off the agenda a bit.  I hate saying that because they are so important.  That is probably because we have realised we are going to struggle to meet those exact ones that were mentioned, namely, goals 1, 2 and 5.  Those are the ones relating to eradicating poverty and hunger and getting gender equality.  I saw a figure recently stating that it will take 137 years to get gender equality at the current pace of progress.  I am sorry I could not be more positive but that is the reality we are facing and dealing with at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022062100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":196,"content":"<p>That is a pretty stark presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022062100002#F00400","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I might bring in Ms Sidi on the question about the hunger season.

It is a good question.  We talk about the hunger season or lean season.  Of course, the word \"hunger\" is stronger.  In west African countries, especially in the Sahel area, a food crisis is not something new.  For decades, people in west African countries, especially in the Sahel part, lived at least a hunger season.  That hunger season, as described by my predecessor, is the time between the last harvest and the new one.  This year, the Covid crisis has made both the world and west African countries more fragile and some of the coping mechanisms community members use are no longer available.  It could be something as simple as communities gardening or using tree leaves in a positive way.<\/p><p>There are good tree leaves that some communities use to cope before reaching the next harvest season.  Due to climate change in the Sahel region, fewer trees are growing and, due to less food growing, many community members are cutting trees and selling them to cope.  It is a vicious circle.  To be succinct in my answer, we are seeing the lean or hunger season starting earlier and lasting longer.<\/p><p> Regarding the question on gender, this is what we have witnessed for years.  Unfortunately, it is growing worse.  The conflict situation is making it worse.  Climate change is not new in this part of the world, but conflict is a new factor.  During times of conflict, men are the ones who go to battle or are the ones who are targeted by extremist violence in west Africa and the Sahel.  In either case, women find themselves being abandoned and must find solutions for feeding their children.  Sometimes, this means leaving the community, going from one village to another and exposing themselves to all types of gender-based violence and sexual violence.  I would not insist on girls marrying early.  It is already a major issue in countries like Niger, where more than 70% of girls are married before their 18th birthdays.  Unfortunately, during conflicts and food crises, girls are sometimes more likely to get married even earlier as a coping mechanism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022062100002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Assalama Sidi","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Deputy Clarke asked how we could harness our knowledge and expertise and, given all of the threat multipliers, about what Ireland could do in this context.

D&oacute;chas has welcomed the Taoiseach's commitment to providing an extra &euro;225 million in climate financing by 2025.  We agree with the Deputy that this amount needs to be in addition to existing ODA commitments.  We have discussed a separate finance stream for loss and damage to be committed at COP27 in support of low-income countries.  A number of the points that the Deputy has raised are points for which D&oacute;chas is advocating, so Ireland will be showing real leadership at COP27.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting to have Ms Sidi here from Niger.  One of the unsung successes of Ireland's term at the UN Security Council, where we have a further six months, was the Irish and Nigerian resolution on the connection between climate and conflict.  We came very close to winning that resolution, through which there would have been overall understanding across the General Assembly of the connection between climate and conflict and its impact on hunger.  The resolution did not go through because of petty politics at the Security Council, but that does not mean that that time was wasted.  Ireland, along with Niger, can stand proud for building that consensus behind the scenes and for nearly getting a new resolution on the issue.  This kind of leadership from our time on the council is very important.  Ireland needs to continue speaking to UN Security Council Resolution 2417 on climate and security.  When we depart the Security Council, we do not depart leadership at the UN.  We can leverage that time, just as other former members of the Security Council did with Ireland, sharing their knowledge and experience of the difficult issues and how to bring them a step closer to success.  There is much more that can be achieved on the foot of these two years at the Security Council.  I just do not want people to see our departure as an end.  It is only the beginning of taking advantage of consensus building, which is important in our multilateral relationships.<\/p> <p>  My final comment is on the questions relating to Covid and vaccine equity.  We are aware that the committee has supported vaccine equity.  D&oacute;chas has called for vaccine equity since the beginning of the pandemic.  We are well aware that vaccination and booster rates in the global south are far behind the global north's.  The longer it takes vaccines to reach the global south, the longer we will have new variants emerging and vaccine hesitancy, fuelled by misinformation, taking a deeper hold.  Vaccine equity cannot be more urgent than it is.  Despite this, the discussions at the World Trade Organization that concluded this week did not go far enough.  We need to see the transfer of technology to the global south.  We need to see much more courage being shown in answering the call from the public, this committee and the Seanad on supporting vaccine equity.  This pandemic will not go away until we are all safe.  None of us is safe until we are all safe.<\/p> <p>  I hope that I have answered at least three parts of the many questions that were asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022062100002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Van Lieshout"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I might ask Mr. Byrne to speak about loss and damage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022062100002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane-Ann McKenna"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh for that question.  I share the sense of helplessness that everyone feels, but I also share the sense of opportunity for Ireland to act that Ms Van Lieshout underlined.<\/p> <p>  Regarding loss and damage, I will first set out the current state of affairs.  The wealthiest 1% are responsible for twice the carbon emissions of the world's poorest 50%.  When we talk about loss and damage, we are talking about redressing an imbalance in the global system.  Most of the people who are affected by climate change are in the global south.  To put it in perspective, they are estimated to number approximately 3.6 billion, or almost half the planet.  We are seeing a widening gap between climate pledges and climate action.  We are not just discussing targeting countries, but also corporations that are responsible for carbon emissions.<\/p> <p>  To be practical, I will offer some simple pointers about what we can do.  First, we can reduce carbon emissions.  There is a responsibility on us all to do this.  Second, we can provide grants for adaptation, for example, water conservation, drought-resistant crops and better quality seed.  Third, we can target women, noting their particular responsibility for decision making within the household, including household food production.  By this, I predominantly mean domestic food production, but women also do the large bulk of hard agricultural labour, which is often unpaid.  They also have responsibility for childcare and caring for disabled and sick family members.<\/p> <p>  Regarding climate finance, Ms Van Lieshout has welcomed the &euro;225 million contribution from the State.  Many calculations suggest that Ireland's contribution could even be as high as over &euro;800 million.  Importantly, the &euro;225 million should be over and above ODA that has already been committed.<\/p> <p>  There has been a great deal of discussion around the establishment of a loss and damage fund in advance of COP27.  Notably, COP27 is being held in Cairo this year, a part of the world that is very familiar with the impacts of climate change and water shortages.  We are asking for the establishment of a non-voluntary loss and damage fund that is based on the principles of justice and equity and is guided, not by the interests of donors, but by the interests of those who need this funding the most.<\/p><p> In terms of targets for COP27 and reducing carbon emissions, we should also look to revise our targets conscious of the need to respond at speed and at scale.  I underline what Ms Van Lieshout said.  It is really important to acknowledge that Ireland was very active and very outspoken at the Security Council in trying to secure a resolution that recognises the links between climate change and conflict.  That resolution was not successful but the opportunity now is for Ireland to remain active on that file and to pass the baton to those who will be on the Security Council in the years to come.  This battle goes well beyond the Security Council but we should underline that climate change now is a very serious threat to international peace and security.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022062100002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I have a question about tackling the climate emergency and how that relates to the witnesses' projections in the introduction to their submission and their path to the goal of 0.7% in 2030.

I am very concerned that there is a real risk of normalising the abnormal where copying mechanisms become so ingrained in communities they become the norm despite the fact that they were anything but for previous generations.  If we see a cutback in aid donations and in tandem with that, a cutback in development aid programmes, there are people who are hungry and at risk of dying but there are also communities and societies that will not truly benefit from any loss or damage fund.  Let us imagine that loss and damage will be agreed at the next COP and that a price or value will be put on it.  That money would simply go back into communities and it would bring them back to where they were beforehand.  There would be no substantial, meaningful benefit from that level of funding.  In terms of the difficulties experienced in respect of access, because aid needs to be delivered in a timely fashion and to a proportionate scale, is there is a risk that accessing medical aid could be withdrawn?  We focused on food today but food is not the only aid delivered to countries.  Aid comes in very different shapes and sizes.

Her description of making what is very abnormal and very negative coping mechanisms normal is a really interesting way of looking at it.  Let us be clear.  Food is only one part of an overall package.  You need medicines to go with it.  Even at the very severe end of treating malnutrition, you are treating with a cocktail of drugs, particularly in the case of severely malnourished children, so it is not just about food and making sure it is the appropriate food.  The overall mantra from a humanitarian would be that it is the humanitarian imperative, which is fundamentally about saving lives and easing suffering.  If you get into chats with some of us, that is really what we would look at.  It is about saving lives and easing suffering.  That is mostly about food, having the right food that is locally available and making sure people can access that in sufficient quantities.  The real challenge with the Ukraine crisis is the availability of wheat and sunflower oil, which were being used to feed significant proportions of populations, particularly around east Africa but also in areas like Lebanon and Egypt.  The other side of it is the funding that is being diverted into defence budgets, particularly by the countries in eastern Europe and even central Europe.  We have seen what Germany is doing in terms of its defence budget and what Finland is having to do with its defence budget.  I have heard some talk here, and I know this committee is concerned with defence as well, about the need to look at defence, although I know it is not as related to the issue of Ukraine compared with some of those other countries.

It is not always just about money but the opportunity to walk in solidarity with people and join them where they are.  All of us are affected by the global food security crisis in one way or another, but standing up and walking tall in partnership with people experiencing crisis is an extraordinarily important gesture and a major source of hope.<\/p> <p>  There is the aid target of 0.7% of gross national income.

So does the committee.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the work of Irish Aid and all of the associated agencies and the leadership of the Department of Foreign Affairs in this regard.  I acknowledge the most positive contribution of D&oacute;chas and all of the NGO development organisations under its umbrella.  We propose to draft a brief report in the form of a submission to the Government, the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This is to outline to them in the context of the budgetary preparations, if indeed it is necessary to do so, the need to ensure, in the words of Mr. O'Brien, that Ireland continues to punch above its weight in circumstances that are most challenging.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge what Ireland continues to do at the UN Security Council.  In particular I reference what Ms Van Lieshout said, that perhaps not all of the resolutions are successful but that is not to say they are meaningless.  At a number of levels, there remain opportunities for us to strongly commit and to influence.  I acknowledge what Ireland is doing on the International Fund for Agricultural Development.  Often we hear of the need to address the causes rather than the symptoms.  Sometimes this is even more challenging when we hear statistics on record drought.  Nevertheless it is important that we share our leadership in the area of expertise in these pursuits.  There is the work Ireland is doing on Nutrition for Growth in terms of funding and expertise.  There is also the good and positive relationship between Ireland and the World Food Programme and the many Irish experts who are part of the World Food Programme.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for sharing their concerns with us.  This meeting has been timely.  It is very important that we hear from the witnesses on the very serious challenge that lies ahead in attempting to tackle the multiple crises across the continent from the Horn of Africa to west Africa.

The NDA incorporates a centre for excellence in universal design, UD, promoting UD in the built environment, products, services and information and communications technology.  The centre also informs our work to provide independent and evidence-informed advice to the Government on disability policy and practice.<\/p> <p>  UD is the design and composition of an environment in order that it can be accessed, understood and used by all, regardless of their age, size, ability or disability.  A UD approach involves a diverse range of users in the design process from an early stage.  Through our work to develop guidance, policy advice, continuous professional development and award schemes, we promote UD as an essential aspect of architectural quality.<\/p> <p>  The 2016 census tells us 13.5% of the population in Ireland had a disability, with one in four households containing at least one person with a disability.  Most disability is acquired and the majority of people aged over 80 have a disability.  The last census also tells us that one in eight households had at least one child under the age of four.  UD in the built environment has benefits for families with young children as well as for disabled and older people.<\/p> <p>  Implementing UD in the built environment is an important aspect of Ireland's commitments under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, as ratified by the State in 2018.  Under Article 4(4), Ireland undertakes to promote the development of universally designed facilities, which should require the minimum possible adaptation and the least cost to meet the specific needs of a person with disabilities.  The right to live in accessible communities is also articulated in Articles 9 and 19 of the convention.<\/p> <p>  The European Accessibility Act promotes accessibility and removal of barriers, preferably through a UD approach, to ensure access for disabled people on an equal basis with others.  UD is also referenced in a number of national strategies, including the Project Ireland 2040: National Planning Framework, Housing for All, the National Housing Strategy for Disabled People and the Housing Options for our Ageing Population policy statement.<\/p> <p>  Part M of the building regulations sets out the minimum requirements for access and use in new buildings and extensions and material alterations to existing buildings.  At present, the minimum requirement is for dwellings to be visitable, rather than liveable, for disabled people.  We welcome that a number of local authorities are setting targets in their development plans for a percentage of homes in new developments to be UD homes.  However, we have advised that a review of Part M should be carried out, with priority given to Part M for dwellings.<\/p> <p>  We are currently finalising work in conjunction with the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland looking at the initial cost of building UD homes and informing a longer term cost-benefit analysis.  A preliminary key finding from our analysis and consultation is that the allowable floor area for dwellings is critical to enable key UD features to be incorporated.  At present, the target floor area for social and affordable houses is too small to allow for the achievement of the UD home or UD home+ levels.<\/p> <p>  Some houses in the private market are being delivered with a suitable floor area for UD home level design, which we believe presents an opportunity for implementation.  In addition, there are opportunities to achieve the UD home level in apartments where there is a requirement for the floor area to exceed the minimum area by 10%.  However, we note that build-to-rent apartments are exempted from this requirement.  We have also advised that 10% of new housing stock should be designed to UD home+ or wheelchair-liveable standards.  We are currently working with the Irish Green Building Council to support the incorporation of UD homes into its home performance index certification scheme.<\/p> <p>  UD also has application in projects in the public realm, including our shared civic spaces, to ensure that the design of these spaces does not disadvantage particular groups or impede their access to these amenities.  We have worked with disabled people to audit the walkability of individual towns, identifying gaps to inclusion and participation in how our roads and streets are built, designed and maintained.  The NDA notes that the recent pandemic has led to some significant changes in how some urban spaces are laid out and accessed.  In some cases, these changes have created further barriers for those with disabilities rather than removing them.  In some cases, the changes seem to have been implemented without adequate consultation or engagement with disabled people and their representative organisations and the NDA takes this opportunity to remind the committee that the principle of meaningful engagement is also enshrined in the UNCRPD.<\/p> <p>  Whether it is in the home or in the shared built environment, UD can most readily be achieved when built into planning and design processes from the outset, in particular by being enshrined in our public procurement processes.  Incorporating UD at the start of a project is more cost-effective than trying to introduce it at a later stage, and UD also reduces the need for costly and wasteful retrofitting of buildings at a later stage.  It is therefore an approach that supports economic, environmental and social sustainability.  The NDA and the centre for excellence have produced technical guidance and codes of practice and supported the development of standards, all of which can inform the UD of our public spaces and buildings and our housing.  We are happy to answer any questions the committee might have on our work or our advice to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aideen Hartney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Age Action is grateful for the opportunity to speak before the committee about UD in new projects and public realm planning.  Age Action is Ireland's leading advocacy organisation on aging and older people.<\/p><p>We advocate for a society that enables all older people to participate and to live full, independent lives, based on the realisation of their rights and equality, recognising the diversity of their experience and situation.<\/p><p> Today I will speak briefly on taking a rights-based approach to universal design; universal design as a means of enabling ageing in place; the affordability of universal design; and the ambition of universal design policies.  Age Action takes a rights-based approach to advocating for older persons.  Similarly, universal design needs to be understood as a means of guaranteeing people their fundamental rights.  There are approximately 48,000 people with dementia in Ireland, and this is expected to double by 2030.  Just over one in five persons aged 65 or older is affected by frailty, which means that their body is less able to resist injury or illness.   Of those aged 65 and over, 35.2% have a disability and others have mobility issues.  The ability of these people to exercise their rights depends on their homes and communities being universally designed.  Taking a rights-based approach to universal design means recognising the lived experiences of these older persons and the serious affronts to equality and non-discrimination that their unmet need represents.<\/p><p> When it comes to ageing in place, which is the overwhelming desire among older persons, universal design is key.  Universally designed homes are as suitable to raise a young family in as they are to grow old in.  Yet, ageing in place also depends on where the home is situated.  We know that 40% of people aged 65 or older do not have a driving licence, and 40% of people aged 65 or older live in rural areas with limited transport options.  Housing and planning policy must work in tandem with transport policy to implement universal design.<\/p><p> Turning to the affordability of universal design, just over half of all older people have an income in the bottom 40% of society, and half have savings of &euro;5,800 or less.  Just over a quarter of employers, managers or higher professionals aged 65 or older experience disability.  In contrast, over 35% of manual workers and 42% of unskilled workers aged 65 or older do so.  Age Action estimates that 10% of older households cannot afford housing adaptation works to increase accessibility.  For many people, the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability are the only option available to make their homes safe and useable.  A recent Private Members' motion on these grants highlighted that they are not affordable and that there are associated unacceptable delays.  Age Action has heard from older people about feeling sick and wanting to give up when they go through all the effort of applying for these grants, only for nothing to come of it.  More people must be entitled to these grants, with a greater proportion of their costs covered.  If universal design measures were implemented in the initial construction phase, often there would be no additional cost.  Limiting cost barriers to the construction of universally designed homes will in part depend on wider reform of the housing sector to achieve affordability, as well as the introduction of universal design building standards that make it the new construction industry norm.<\/p><p> Finally, Age Action is concerned about low ambition in implementing universal design.  One of its advantages is its ability to be mainstreamed.  Everyone has a right to move and interact safely and independently not only in their own homes but in the homes of others and in their communities.  Universal design promotes positive ageing, but there is no positive ageing without social inclusion.  One of the actions of the Housing Options for our Ageing Population policy statement is to ensue that 30% of new housing is universally designed in five years' time.  That target is inadequate.  Similar to the successful building energy efficiency regulations, building regulations should progressively realise a full implementation of universal design, with which all new buildings must be compliant.  These new standards should be matched with mechanisms to ensure they are being met.  In the interim, there needs to be education about universal design so people building or buying homes understand its importance.  If universal design is not universalised, we will instead have to continuously, arduously and expensively adapt homes to meet the needs of persons whose circumstances we are capable of anticipating based on the lived experience of older people now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Lally and Ms Carthy to make their opening remarks, on behalf of the Irish Wheelchair Association.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#C00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting us in today to discuss universal design.  We are calling on the Irish Government to amend section 3 of Part M the Building Regulations 2010 on access and use to raise accessibility standards for homes, so that all wheelchair users can access and use every area of their home from the wardrobe to the cooker.  The Government must raise the mandatory baseline standards of wheelchair access in all new homes to incorporate all levels of access guidance as set out by the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, including UD, UD+ and UD++.  Believe it or not, Part M of the Building Regulations 2010 requires housing to be visitable for a wheelchair user, but not liveable.  There is a requirement to provide level access to a habitable room and a toilet at entry level.  If one considers a typical Irish three-bed semi-detached house with a small toilet under the stairs and the bedrooms upstairs, it is not wheelchair liveable.  A consequence of the current Part M regulations is the lack of availability of wheelchair liveable social housing and private housing in the community, resulting in wheelchair users being homeless, involuntarily living with family, friends or in nursing homes, not having control over their lives, and not having choices equal to others in society.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Wheelchair Association is a community of people with physical disabilities across Ireland, founded on the belief that everyone should be able to live a life of choice and equality.  Our services support people with physical disabilities to live independently, and our campaigns demand equal rights and opportunities for people with physical disabilities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosaleen Lally"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":231,"content":"<p>The work of the Irish Wheelchair Association is underpinned by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with a Disability, UNCRPD, which was ratified by Ireland in 2018.  Article19 recognises the right of disabled people to live in the community and to have the opportunity to choose their place of residence.  Furthermore, Article 28 includes the right of disabled people to access public housing programmes. People who have a mobility impairment and who are, or may become, full-time wheelchair users require appropriately designed and future-proofed housing that is located within mixed tenure sustainable housing developments that are perceived to be safe, in locations of people's choosing, and situated in close proximity to services, transport, family and friends.  Currently, new dwellings are merely designed to be visitable under Part M of Ireland&rsquo;s Building Regulations 2010.<\/p> <p>  Article 31(2) of the UNCRPD on statistics and data collection states \"The information collected in accordance with this article shall be disaggregated, as appropriate, and used to help assess the implementation of States Parties&rsquo; obligations under the present Convention and to identify and address the barriers faced by persons with disabilities in exercising their rights.\"  Currently, many local authorities cannot readily provide the number and type of wheelchair liveable housing units required in their area. The new social housing application form was launched by the Department in April 2021 and renewed further in quarter 1 of 2022.  For the first time the form contains a specific field for the requirement of wheelchair liveable housing.  Going forward, this valuable information, and associated software programmes such as ihouse, will facilitate ease of access to information on the number of wheelchair liveable houses required.  However, all housing applications approved before April 2021 did not have this specific field.  Therefore, local authorities have to review individual application forms, together with supporting documentation and reports, to establish how many wheelchair liveable housing units are required.  If a local authority does not know the number and type of wheelchair liveable houses required, it is very difficult for it to plan with housing developers and social housing providers for the future, or to report on progress.  The information on housing needs should be readily available for the public to inform housing planners and housing developers in each area.  The Irish Wheelchair Association has representatives on 29 of the 30 housing and disability steering groups, where many local authorities state that they do not have the resources to retrospectively review existing approved social housing applicants to establish how many wheelchair liveable houses are required.  This is a once-off project that needs to be completed as a matter of urgency to support planning, design and delivery.  Currently, there are no statistics on the number of permanent wheelchair users in Ireland.  The question is not covered in the Irish census.  The data, when cross referenced with existing data, would greatly inform planning and delivery of infrastructure and services for the future across many areas including the built environment, the great outdoors, transport, education, health, employment, and so on.  It is too late for the 2022 census, but action must be taken to ensure that the question is included in future censuses. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Joan Carthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":232,"content":"<p>The introduction of the new housing strategy for disabled people is welcome, but it does not go far enough to make a difference.

That means people with disabilities will be left behind once again.<\/p> <p>  According to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission report, Discrimination and Inequality in Housing in Ireland, people with disabilities are more than twice as likely to report discrimination relating to housing.  They are over 1.6 times more likely to live in poor conditions, such as living in damp housing, not having central heating and living in unsuitable neighbourhoods.  According to the report, more than one in four homeless people have a disability.  The Think Housing, Build Accessible campaign calls for the amendment of Part M of the Building Regulations 2010 to raise the baseline accessibility standards.  The technical guidance documents need to be updated to include guidance for wheelchair-liveable housing, including UD+ and UD++ standards.  Adequate provision of fully wheelchair-liveable homes must be included in the Government&rsquo;s ambitious housing programme.  <\/p> <p>  In the National Housing Strategy for Disabled People 2022-2027 emphasis is placed on providing more equal access to housing for disabled people with integrated support services.  It also promotes their inclusion in the community and aims to give people appropriate choices and control over where, how and with whom they live.  It all sounds great.  Theme 1 of the strategy on accessible housing and communities references 50% of the new pipeline delivery being reserved for disabled people in each local authority, which means it should be wheelchair liveable, meeting the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design's UD home recommendations.  However, UD homes are not necessarily wheelchair-liveable homes, whereas UD+ and UD++ are wheelchair-liveable standards.  For example, a person using a powered wheelchair requires a 900 mm opening on all doors and a 2,400 mm turning circle to be able to turn around in his or her chair in every room in the house.  Basic UD guidance for doors is 800 mm, thereby excluding access for a powered wheelchair.  UD guidance for a turning circle is 1,500 mm, which also excludes powered wheelchair users from living in such homes.  UD guidance does not provide for wheelchair-liveable housing.<\/p> <p>  In the UK, the Part M document provides detailed guidance on three categories of dwellings: visitable dwellings, as we have in Ireland; accessible and adaptable dwellings; and wheelchair user dwellings.  The guidance set out in the Irish Part M document falls well short of that contained in the UK document, only catering for visitable dwellings.  The aim of the new Housing for All policy is that \"Everyone in the State should have access to a home to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard and in the right place, offering a high quality of life.\"  If all social and private houses continue to be built in accordance with the current standards of Part M of the Building Regulations 2010, there will be no provision made for wheelchair-liveable homes.  Local Government will have to continue to retrofit the existing stock and will also have to increase the budget for the housing adaptation grants for people with a disability, which is a foolish and false economy.  The Government must review Part M to ensure that wheelchair-liveable homes are included in the 9,500 new social houses planned annually for the next five years.  Money does not appear to be an issue.  Part M policy is the barrier for wheelchair users.  The cost of building homes to a higher accessibility standard is lower at design stage than retrofitting at a later stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosaleen Lally"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Lally and Ms Carthy.

We are happy to be here with representatives from the National Disability Authority, Age Action and the Irish Wheelchair Association.  We routinely, and on an ongoing basis, co-operate and work on this issue and other issues related to housing.  The right to a home is one of the most fundamental human rights.  To break it down into very practical terms, without a secure or fixed abode, people are going nowhere.  They cannot participate in society in any decent way.  They are locked out of participation.<br\/><br\/>Developing sufficient universally designed and wheelchair-liveable housing is essential to realise the right of disabled people to live independently in their own homes, in line with article 19 of the UNCRPD, which is a very thoughtful and well-written article.  I invite members to look at it.  Without a home, people cannot access their other rights and the capacity for ordinary living.  A home is a necessary retreat for people from the world around them.  At the same time, it is their launching pad into the community and the opportunities it should provide, including accessible public transport, public libraries, schools, etc.  It is key.<br\/><br\/>The National Housing Strategy for Disabled People 2022-2027 is an opportunity to realise disabled people&rsquo;s right to a home.  The strategy and the open consultation process have been praised by disability groups.  However, as we all know, paper and ink are one thing, and the success of the strategy will depend on its implementation and the building of homes in the right places and spaces for people.  The implementation plan must have clearly defined targets.  For example, the strategy states that 50% of new pipeline delivery in each local authority will meet universal design standards.  The implementation plan must break down the proportion of these houses that will meet UD++ standards, and will be wheelchair liveable.  The strategy will also fail if sufficient resources are not put in place to deliver it.  The implementation plan must commit to the necessary funding needed to deliver on the strategy.  Budget 2023 is coming up soon.  That is the next and necessary available opportunity to provide such funding.  The current Government is now halfway through its programme and does not have many budgets left ahead of it.  The clock is ticking in that regard.<br\/><br\/>On the need to join up housing and other supports, the right to a home must operate in tandem with the capacity to exercise other rights.  Cross-departmental and cross-agency working and collaboration are absolutely essential.  Without them, the housing strategy will be a dead duck.  That collaboration is required; it is not an add-on.  Many people with disabilities end up in the ludicrous position of being told they cannot receive personal assistance services from the HSE without a home, and they will not be offered a home by their local authority without a guarantee that they will receive services.  The book is called <i>Catch 22<\/i>, but this is real life for people on a regular basis.  The inability to deliver accessible, universally designed and wheelchair-liveable housing, along with supports, is the driver of the over 1,300 people under the age of 65 who are living in nursing homes.  If the issue is not resolved, the number of people with disabilities leaving the community and going into congregated settings, such as nursing homes, will continue to rise.<br\/><br\/>On the Housing for All policy, accessible housing for people with disabilities cannot and should not be seen as something separate from the right to housing for the general population.  These issues have to be dealt with in tandem.  We should not be dealing with one after the other.  The lack of housing for people with disabilities is part of the housing crisis.  The issue existed well before the 2008 bust.  It continues, and is now worse after Covid.  If people with disabilities do not benefit from the investment in housing, Ireland will fail in its UNCRPD obligations.  Housing being built under Housing for All must include the appropriate levels of universally designed and wheelchair-liveable housing to meet people's needs.  Sadly, to date people with disabilities have not been sufficiently included in efforts to address the housing crisis.  It is a point that has been made by others already.<\/p><p>The waiting times for people with disabilities on the housing waiting list have increased rather than decreased.  On Part M of the building regulations, the Disability Federation of Ireland, along with our coalition partners of the Irish Wheelchair Association, have a campaign, Think Housing Build Accessible and we fully back them in the need to have reformation of Part M of the building regulations to ensure higher wheelchair accessibility standards, which is essential.  Under current regulations, housing must be suitable for wheelchair users to visit but not to live, whereas the definition of a house is somewhere people live, not somewhere they visit.<\/p><p> To wrap up, just over 5,000 people with disabilities are now on the social housing waiting list and I am sure that is a minimum number of those who have need.  There are those in intellectual disability congregated settings, 1,300 in nursing homes and others living in family homes when it is well past the best by date for adults to be doing that.  Accessible homes, along with necessary social care supports, are needed as a basic thing to make real progress.  We are in the fifth decade since Ireland set up a programme - the disabled person&rsquo;s grant - in the 1970s to start to tackle this.  Some of those on this committee, off the top of their heads, can tell me how many hundreds of thousands of homes have been built since then, some with grants from the Government and so on.  We now find ourselves in an awful situation because we did not get on with making homes accessible in the past.  I also ask members to think housing when they are attending their other committees because housing is the gateway to living in the community, and any other committee that members are on is a related area.  I thank members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Thank you.

We appreciate their time.  I also thank them for the contributions they made to help the Government produce the national housing strategy for disabled people, which was agreed earlier this year.  It is very important that we have a strategy.  I accept the criticisms.  I have heard them and they are not news to me, but it is important to have a baseline and to at least have a strategy as something to aspire to.  Mr. Dolan spoke correctly about housing being a fundamental human right.  Without adequate secure housing that meets a person's personal needs, it is very hard for them to go to school, college, training or work, or to take their place in society and in their community.  There is no dispute about that and no dispute at this committee on that issue.  We have not only aspire to championing that ambition, but making it a reality.  Housing for All goes that way and is a good step in the right direction.  The national housing strategy, which emphasises equal access and has an objective of promoting inclusion of disabled people in communities, is important.<\/p> <p>  The issues raised by the witnesses on wheelchair-liveable UD and the Part M regulations are part of a technical discussion but, in practical terms, it makes a huge difference and can have huge benefit for people's quality of life and living standards.  I have had the opportunity to meet with the Irish Wheelchair Association and I thank its representatives for the submissions they have provided me with.  As a committee, we should be putting in our report a strong recommendation to the Department supporting the amendment.  It is important that the committee not only hears the request, but endorses and supports it, and that we do what we can to progress that.<\/p> <p>  On the issues regarding local authorities, I was honoured to be elected to Dublin City Council for years.  It is great that, since 2021, they are starting to capture in a field the requirement for wheelchair-accessible and wheelchair-liveable accommodations.  However, I do not accept the local authorities&rsquo; suggestion that they cannot capture it on historic applications.  I would like to hear about this from the experience of the witnesses and their members.  Anybody who is on a housing list has been on it for a couple of years, unless they joined since 2021.  They will have been on it for at least five years and every two years they are required to reconfirm their need for housing.  What I do not understand is whether the local authorities are saying that when they are doing that process and sending out those letters, they are not capturing that information.  I would be interested to know if that is the experience of the witnesses.  Again, as a committee, we need to take this up with the City and County Management Association and local authorities because there is no excuse for that information not being captured.<\/p> <p>  That will deal with social housing.  It is correct that we are committed to 10,000 new-build social homes for the next ten years but we also have affordable homes and private homes.  Every local authority has committed to doing a housing needs assessment for the first time, and that is meant to capture housing need of all descriptions.  I could not believe it when I heard that the census was not capturing this information.  It is such a massive missed opportunity, not just for housing, where it is important, but also for many other social infrastructure and social services.  Again, I suggest that a recommendation the joint committee will make in its report is that future censuses capture that information.<\/p> <p>  I am almost out of time.  I ask the witnesses is for them to come back on the question around the local authorities.  Is this what they are saying, namely, that when they are getting people to reconfirm their need, they are not capturing that?  In terms of UD, I believe we should circulate all of the very technical information on the differences between UD and wheelchair-liveable accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#E00300","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Does somebody wish to answer the question on local authority information gathering?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#E00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Our information to date, and what we are being told at most of the steering groups, is that they do not have that information to hand and they do not have the resources.

This is the fundamental difference between the Part M document and a wheelchair-liveable home.<\/p> <p>  One of our wheelchair users is a disabled mother.  We are currently supporting her in a house that is built in compliance with Part M.

There is a terrible sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>for most.  The witnesses were with us many years ago to have exactly the same conversation.  A number of people on our side of the discussion made the point that we were in the middle of a deep housing crisis and that the focus was on the need to increase supply.  If we did not ensure that it was the right kind of supply to meet the needs of all sections of society, the problem would remain.  Little has changed in that intervening period with regard to the issues the witnesses are asking us to raise with the Minister.  Senator Fitzpatrick makes a good point about a concerning issue, which is that updating housing needs assessment documentation is now an annual exercise for everybody on local authority lists.  Local authorities have become very sophisticated.  All the Department has to do is instruct them to include a set of questions.  That would fix the problem.  It is about to do so with Traveller ethnicity as part of the Traveller accommodation strategy and absolutely needs to do so in this respect.  Therefore, in addition to the CCMA, the Minister needs to instruct the local authorities to include this, because it would clean up the problem.<\/p><p>We now have a housing need and demand assessment, HNDA.  This is meant to be a valuable tool where local authorities have evidence for making decisions on all types of planning applications for all housing, whether it is social, affordable or private housing.  We have to start to integrate the conversation we are having about social housing and UD into the housing need and demand assessment.  Therefore, as well as strongly supporting Senator Fitzpatrick's sensible suggestions, we need to raise the HNDA with the Minister and how it can be worked in.  If a local authority planning department makes a decision on a private application at the moment, it is not allowed to ask if it meets the needs of existing and projected future households, including the needs of people with disability or mobility challenges.  That has to be addressed.<\/p><p>The data issue is frustrating because if one does not have the data, one does not have enough information for the targets.  Even if we have a 10% target, as Dr. Hartney said, the difficulty is that people do not have the luxury of being able to move house often, so I ask Dr. Hartney if 10% is really enough.  If people have a local authority allocation, then their life circumstances change, they have an acquired disability and are in a wheelchair, then they can apply for a transfer, but they could be waiting for up to ten years for that transfer.  My other question for Dr. Hartney is about the net and gross floor space.  In January, the Department published its design manual for quality housing.  The section on housing for people with disabilities is short and vague.  Was there much engagement with the Department in advance of the publication of that manual?  If Dr. Hartney amended that, what floor space would be required?  It seems quite weak on that.<\/p><p>The committee should hear more about what liveability means.  I ask them to address human beings rather than dimensions.  I also ask them to talk us through the things that people cannot do, because the so called UD in Part M is not universal at all.  The witnesses gave some good examples, but explaining that further would be useful.  Are any UD+ or UD++ buildings being constructed as part of our new housing stock?  Did I understand correctly that there are none?  Are there some?  Do we have any information with respect to that?<\/p><p>A big challenge, which Ms Carthy made a point about, is that we have to move to good quality, mixed tenure housing developments.  It is virtually impossible for a local authority housing manager to combine a mixed tenure scheme that would also have homes that are liveable for wheelchair users.  When designing a scheme, one does not necessarily have specific people in mind.  The requirements in the Department's design manual mean that an occupational therapist's report is needed for a designated occupant of that property.  That is the opposite to what we are talking about.  We are saying that we want to have varied stock.  If any witnesses have concerns or experience relating to the challenge of putting together a mixed tenure scheme to address general needs, be liveable for wheelchair users, and so on, that would be useful.  A strong recommendation relates to the need for a mixed tenure point of contact in the Department in order that a housing manager who wants a mixed scheme that includes the kind of housing Ms Carthy was talking about would be able to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#F00400","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I will make an overarching point on terminology, then I will ask my colleague to give technical answers to the questions.

A house built using UD can be adapted readily, easily and in a cost-effective way if the needs of the person living in it change over time, whereas UD+ is designed from the outset to be wheelchair-accessible.  It is important that we are all clear on that terminology.  The potential for confusion and crossfire between technical specifications is one reason that we think it would be helpful and important if a standard could be developed in this space.

We see adequate space as an essential aspect of architectural quality when talking about UD.  In the work we have been doing on housing, we find that the biggest barrier to delivery seems to be target floor areas that are too small.  Without the provision of an occupational therapist's certificate, the Department will not fund units bigger than the target floor areas.  From our point of view, this is about making UD in housing mainstream, not thinking about general needs, people with disabilities and people who are ageing, in order that UD becomes part of the way we design all our housing.  The issue of target floor areas is key and funding for it needs to be addressed.  In much of the consultation we have had with approved housing bodies recently, they have told us they want to build UD homes, but they cannot get funding for the additional floor area needed for homes that are liveable for wheelchair users.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Ruth O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":249,"content":"<p>How much extra floor area is in question?

As a designer, it is difficult to build outside minimums.  It is virtually impossible.  I have never been able to understand why our regulations are set at minimums.

It is great to see Mr. Dolan back in the Houses.  I fully support universal design.  I was a director of Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind for many years.  One thing that struck me was that there are a number of issues in terms of disabilities and there are many forms of disability.  There was always an issue with colleagues having wheelchair users coming to see them and not being able to see them.  There are also issues with the inappropriate design of accommodation.  One client told me that his day room or living room had no window.  He was told he was blind so it would not affect him.  What a ridiculous thing to say.  He developed eczema and other conditions because of the lack of light and ventilation.  We have come a long way from that.  His dog was expected to live in the same circumstances and it also developed eczema and stress-related issues because of lack of ventilation and light.<\/p> <p>  A very high percentage of people with disabilities are unemployed.  That is through no fault of their own because many of them have great skills.<\/p><p>They cannot get work and they are spending a lot more time at home or, invariably, in libraries or anywhere they can get access to.  It is still not easy to get access in many public spaces.  Home is critical to us all.  Mr. Dolan talked about home and our place.  It is our safe space.  However, when one has a disability and one is unemployed, home is particularly important.  Therefore I fully support universal design.<\/p><p> I am currently building a house and I did not find there was any engagement or proactive approach from my planning authority about universal design.  It disappointed me but, mind you, I did not find they were involved in issues such as retention of rain water or harvesting off the roof, which I myself put in.  Many planning authorities are not proactive.  They might have a commitment to policy but they are not proactive about it.  They do not engage, and I have checked this with other people.<\/p><p> I suppose there are two or three issues the witnesses might share their views on.  We had a meeting with our own local authority, which is D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, on Friday, with all the local Oireachtas Members.  We were told about the steering groups and that these were critically important in each of the 31 authorities.  Our guests might share with me their experience in how they are interfacing with that.  Usually directors of housing, I would say, would chair those groups.  <\/p><p> On the issue of how we quantify, do we know really what the quantity is?  Mr. Dolan, in his submission, referred to a number a little over 5,000 people on social housing.  Do we have a definitive number there that we can validate in terms of the number of individuals or family units that require housing for people with disabilities?  That is something we must keep the focus on.<\/p><p> On Part V, the best way to make this intervention is at the planning stage where one is sitting down in preplanning and bringing in developers to set out their preplanning schemes, particularly in ground-floor apartment units.  These are ideal if they are developed into the design.  One maybe has more flexible balconies so that one can access the building without coming through the main building, and also access to the garden.  Gardens and open spaces are critically important if one has a disability and is on-site much of the time.  <\/p><p> There is something important I want to talk to Dr. Hartney about.  In terms of the public authorities' and State agencies' responsibility and obligations under the European accessibility Act, under the Code of Practice on Accessibility of Public Services, information proved to public bodies and disability impact assessments, the State is obliged under Public Sector Duty and Our Public Service 2020.  These are key issues that Dr. Hartney touched on in her submission, although not in any great detail because of time.  She, or, for that matter, anybody else, might touch on that.<\/p><p> The issue of congregated settings is one we have talked about for years.  We have many young people with disabilities - Mr. Dolan summed it up well - who are effectively in nursing homes.  It is a crazy situation.  How is that progressing?  Much work and planning was meant to be done on emptying out congregated settings.  I am familiar with some of the attempts by the Cheshire Homes with its clients.  How is that going, where would they like to see that going or where would they like to see that ramped up?<\/p><p> Those are some issues they might touch on.  Dr. Hartney might kick-off and then, maybe, Mr. Dolan and anybody else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#G02500","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  There are obligations in legislation and policies, as the Senator says, at present and I suppose the challenge is to ensure that public bodies are aware of them.  Certainly, in our own work, in monitoring compliance, for example, as the Senator says, with the code of practice, there can be challenges in ensuring that public bodies are aware of them.  However, they also only extend to public bodies and the private sector is not mandated by that.  We would argue that is where the public leads should show leadership.<\/p> <p>  The European accessibility Act is only in the process of being transposed and then there is a three-year timeframe for implementation.  It will be a while before we see any of the benefits realised from that legislation.<\/p> <p>  In terms of disability impact assessments, we would regularly advise that this is an essential part of any major project, not only in the built environment; anywhere there is expenditure and an impact on the public that should be done.  However, it seems to sometimes go under the radar and unnoticed by those public authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aideen Hartney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for his lovely welcome.  I do prefer asking the questions than being at the other end answering them.<\/p> <p>  An excellent point was made by the Senator about unemployment and disability.  According to the most recent census, 22% of people with disabilities were in employment whereas the corresponding figure is over 53% for the rest of the population.  The home, on that basis, is the place one lives much of one's life.  If one has gone past the age of working, that is even a bigger issue.  Therefore, it has to be comfortable and spacious.  I acknowledge the importance of a garden and or an accessible open space and other places one can be where other people are as well.<\/p> <p>  Young people in nursing homes and congregated settings is where the housing issue runs into the problems we see in other areas.  We made the point earlier that the HSE will say that until one has the accessible living unit there is no point in it doing the personal assistant, PA, piece, and the local authorities are saying it is the other way around.  It is that catch-22 that I referred to earlier.  One should remember that the person with a disability will be somewhere.  He or she will be in an accessible, comfortable home in the right location or squeezed into a house - I am not calling it a home - that he or she cannot fully operate in - that might be the kitchen, the upstairs or the different elements of it, where the person is always pulling things aside to get from A to B, and is not comfortable; in a nursing home; or, in the case of many of the people with intellectual disability, in congregated settings.<\/p> <p>  People are still in congregated settings.  Young people went from the community into nursing homes.  They did not spend their young years in a nursing home.  That happened because of the lack of a suite of measures - an accessible comfortable home in the right location and a suite of practical instruments, including personal assistants and access to various therapies.<\/p> <p>  There are commitments, from strong to not so strong, in the programme for Government around some of these things.  The capacity review, in terms of pumping extra funding into the disability services, itself can be a slow burn but an important game-changer around this issue, but one cannot get away from the square metre or square foot, whatever language, old-fashioned language or new, one wants to use.  One does not live in a virtual house.  One lives in a house and one has to be able to put one's elbows out.  That is it.  There is no other way around it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt Mr. Dolan but we are well over time on that slot.

Therefore, I thank our guests for coming here and sharing so many different lenses with us.<\/p> <p>  I have lots of questions and lots of comments.  Maybe I will start with Dr. Hartney.  I liked what Dr. Hartney was talking about when it came to walkability studies and audits of streetscapes because it is a basic question to ask how do we make sure that the public realm is publicly accessible.  I would like to learn a little more about them.<\/p> <p>  I was particularly struck by Dr. Hartney's phrase \"meaningful engagement\".  That is the nub of everything.  When we as Government, agencies, Departments, officials, public representatives or committees engage, we need to make sure that it is actual \"meaningful engagement\", that it is two-way communication, that we are hearing the feedback that we are getting and that it is not an exercise that must be undertaken.  It is an exercise that should be undertaken to inform policies and to make better outcomes for people.  Dr. Hartney captured that well in her opening statement.<\/p><p> Turning to Ms Lally and Ms Carthy, I did not realise wheelchair use was not being captured by the State.  It is really interesting that there is no information on this in the census and therefore nothing in the CSO.  Obviously, we know statistics and we hear them but presumably they come from DPOs working in the area.  Is that something that has ever been asked?  Is there resistance from the CSO to including it in the census?  Is that something the IWA believes we can look at between now and the next census?  We are too late for the one that has just been done but it would make total sense that we should at least be able to quantify the situation in order to ensure our policies adapt accordingly.<\/p><p> On the housing adaptation grants, Ms Murphy gave us some good information on that.  Does she know what the most commonly drawn-down grant is used for?  It will probably vary by local authority and presumably be dependent on the age of a house but it might be good information for us to know if we are to enhance those grants in any way.<\/p><p> Mr. Dolan has given us quite a lot of information and ideas around the national housing strategy for disabled people with respect to ensuring it is the way in which disabled people can access their right to housing.  Something that has come up for me from a number of constituents is people who are working but finding it very difficult to obtain mortgages.  Is that something that has ever come to his attention and has he any views on it?  Those are my few questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#H00500","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I am going to make a quick point on the data even though the Deputy did not ask it of me.  Then I will hand to Ms O'Reilly on the walkability.  There are ways of crosscutting the data in the census to get some estimates but it is true there is not an empirical figure out there.  One of the things we have been working with the CSO to request and advise on is a post-census survey called the national disability survey.  One was done in 2006 and we have been approaching the office to see if one can be done after the 2026 census.  It would be very useful and valuable in capturing some of that information.  All the information we use on wheelchair and assistive technology usage unfortunately dates from the 2006 survey, so it is getting quite old and long in the tooth now.

There has been an awful lot of talk about local authorities and public housing in the context of universal design and where the gaps are.

I ask our contributors where they see the main gaps in the provision of universal design for people who are having their need met through the private sector, whether they are in the rental sector, buying in the private sector, or on HAP.  What difficulties are they having?  Also, has anybody dealt with private developers on getting portions or doing best practice for any large private developer for universal design?

The IWA is an approved housing body and we are currently working with Mayo County Council on a development that is due to start next year.  The council approached us to see if we would be interested in buying a part of the site, initially, last year.  It would be one corner of the site for us to build wheelchair-livable housing on.  We always prefer pepperpotted developments so we did not take it.  The council came back to us and asked if we would like to take another version.<\/p><p>To make a long story short, we all agreed that rather than us taking the site and having architects and designers in there, Mayo County Council would build on the site and work with us on the planning for the eight houses to best practice access guidelines and standards.  The very novel design for us is that there is an interlinking personal assistant, PA, room which interlinks two houses.  The HSE loves this because one PA can work with two tenants for overnights and things like that.  It has been a very good project.  The HSE was involved from the outset.  We were conscious, like somebody else said, that this is a catch-22 situation.  If somebody gets a house, they cannot apply for a PA until they have the house.  We have a young man in Dublin at the minute in that very situation - we have a house for him but he cannot get a PA service and it may be six to eight months before he can get one.  He is now fearful that he will lose the house.<\/p><p> The Mayo project is example of a very good cross-communication between all of the Departments.  When we went to the HSE, it said that it had 28 people who needed housing, some of whom were in nursing homes.  When we went back to it and asked if they were all approved on the social housing waiting list, only two of them had actually been approved.  A very significant amount of work was involved in going back to get everybody onto the social housing waiting list.  This is another issue.  Our Think Ahead, Think Housing campaign encourages and supports people with disabilities to get onto the social housing waiting list.  People do not think ahead with regard to the length of time it can sometimes take to get a house, which could be ten years.  We are trying to support people.  Without a doubt, we know that people with disabilities are greatly underrepresented on the social housing waiting list because it is such a bureaucratic and hard system to go through.  This development in Mayo, where we almost have received approval from the Department to go well beyond the 10% floor space, is very much a trial project.  If it works, hopefully it can be replicated across the country where these types of houses can be provided and the plan can be used in other local authorities.  I return again to the point that until Part M is reviewed and the regulations are in place so that there is no confusion, that will be the only way it is going to work in the private sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#J04000","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosaleen Lally","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I wish to add-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms R&iacute;ona Morris"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":327,"content":"<p>A large proportion of properties within cities will be build-to-rent properties.

I work in construction and have worked in that sector all of my life.  I have seen first-hand the building of houses for people with disabilities and how the regulations and planning process have changed throughout the years.<\/p> <p>  The implementation of the planning regulations is being enforced to a greater extent in the counties than in the cities.  In a county, when one is building a house, if it is a one-off house or a housing estate, the tendency is to build a bigger house in any event.  These include bigger bathrooms.  All of the doors have 1 m spaces for access into the house.  Work is done on the stairs and the landing.  The work is being done not only for people with disabilities but also for people who are getting older in life and will need help in any event.<\/p> <p>  I have seen the changes.  When I go into a city, I see that every inch is being availed of.  There is no inclusion for people with disabilities.  I am lucky to live in Granagh, near St. Joseph&rsquo;s Foundation, where people with and without disabilities are catered for.  I can see what can be achieved when people with disabilities are integrated into the community.  People with disabilities should not be put in a corner but should be integrated into the community because of what they can offer to us and we can offer to them.<\/p> <p>  From a building perspective, people came to me and said they wanted to build properties for people with special needs.  They contacted the local authority to say they had serviced sites, with wheelchair-accessible footpaths, to build on.  These sites were on bus routes and had everything within the area.  The local authority told these people that it had nobody on the list for a house that was designed for people with disabilities.  That shocked and surprised me.  If I had not heard this information first-hand, I would not have believed it.<\/p> <p>  With the ageing community we have now, all houses should be adapted on the ground floor for disability living, regardless of whether those living in them have a disability at present.  There should be a wet room downstairs and everything should be focused on disability.  This involves increasing the door width from 900 mm to 1 m.  That will accommodate door access into any house.  If one uses a stairs but wants to use a stairlift, one has to allow a further 100 mm for the stairlift to work.  If a person needs a carer, the carer could live upstairs, the person in need of care could live downstairs and they could cohabit.  No forward-thinking is being done for the sake of a couple of inches in a living area for the likes of this.  No family in this country knows whether tomorrow morning, someone in the family - even a child - will have an accident.<\/p> <p>  When builders are building a house in a rural area, they build a sitting room downstairs and ensure it is accessible to a bathroom in case there ever has to be a changeover, for example if someone has an accident and is confined to living downstairs, or if an elderly parent wants to live with the family.  People who are building their own houses put in all of these adaptions because they can see what may be required, but our local authorities do not.  The Government through its legislation does not cover this.  As a building contractor, I cannot understand this.  It is only a matter of widening the door by 100 mm and increasing a bathroom downstairs.  If you have a 1,000 sq. ft house, it just means you are making one room slightly smaller.  I am 100% behind anything that promotes adaptions to all houses.  I do not think it should be 10%; I think all houses should be adapted because at least then you are adapting for the future.  That means you do not have to put 10% aside because you will have 100%.  Everyone should be obliged to adapt their house.<\/p> <p>  From the Chairman&rsquo;s own electrical background, he will be aware that the regulations for switches in houses have changed.<\/p><p>They are down at a certain level.  Those type of things have changed.  Why can we not move small pieces that will make every house adaptable?  Whether it is a one-storey or a two-storey building, it does not matter.  You just make a small amendment.  That might mean you do not even have to change the square footage but only to move a wall 4 in. or 5 in. or 100 mm to make the regulations easier for anyone.  That does not only work for people with disabilities but also for our ageing population and for everyone.  I commend everything the witnesses are doing.  I will be with them 100%.  If they have a list of people looking for them in Limerick, please contact me and I will work to help in any way I can.  People come to me who want their house adapted for people.  I want them integrated into the community because no one should be left outside, no matter what.  Everyone should be integrated and work with each other.  I am happy that the people I am involved with are integrated with us.

Prior to that, the only time she left her room was to come in to our day service two days per week where she had met the tenants, seen the houses and formed her dream.  We moved her out of the nursing home during Covid.  She had never seen the house she was moving into.  The community had got together and furnished and painted the house for her.

Deputy &Oacute; Broin made the point about local authorities and    the point was made that when people fill in the housing assessment and renew it every year or two years, depending on the local authority, that information should be gathered.  We are a bit late into the learning stream but it is never too late to learn or to implement this data-collecting information so we can plan.  This is all about planning.  Listening to the witnesses, I think what they are looking for from us is that, when it comes to universal design and making homes for people in wheelchairs, we plan for that now.<\/p> <p>  A contribution was made earlier about the Government's projected target of delivering 33,000 homes per year for the next God only knows how long.  We reckon the figures should be bigger.  That is an even bigger issue again.  We could have had a percentage of those delivered now.  Someone commented on adaptation grants.  I was a councillor for years in Cork City Council.  There was one adaptation grant for social housing and one for private housing.  We are spending a huge amount of money adapting houses.  If we had spent a fraction of that on planning and delivery when those houses were being built, it would have saved the country money.  Leaving out the humanity of it and looking at it from a financial point of view, planning now for universal design and UD+ or UD++ makes economic, financial sense.  More important, for the person involved in makes sense.  Ms Lally gave an example of a lady in Mayo.  Her life was completely changed.  That example shows the huge difference it can make.<\/p> <p>  Ms Lally spoke earlier about the standards in the UK meeting the needs of disabled people   Why we do not have that here?  What do we need to do?  Is that what we should copy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#L00400","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":344,"content":"<p>Concerning the UK, Part M is in the building regulations there as well and they have three categories of accessible standards in those Part M regulations.  There is the visitable standard we have here.  They also have lifetime adaptable homes, the next standard, which are universal design homes ready to be converted, if need be, as we grow older.  Then they have the standard for fully wheelchair-liveable housing.  That empowers local authorities in the UK to look at demand in their area.  As planning comes in from developers, it empowers them to say they need certain percentages of wheelchair-liveable, future-proof and visitable housing.  The technical guidance is there clearly in the regulations and there is no confusion.  In Ireland, we only have the basic standard of wheelchair-visitable housing.  For anything above that, confusion reigns across the country.  Even architects do not fully understand what universal design is.  Our concern is universal design is being used as the key to solving all the problems.  Universal design is in the strategy and mentioned across the board.  We know universal design does not meet the needs of all wheelchair users.  That is another concern.  The last concern is the time this will take.  We are concerned it will be pushed out and pushed out.

For that to be understood in the 31 local authorities, everyone needs to implement the same standards.<\/p> <p>  Another issue I encountered in Cork during the pandemic was that many places were made available for outdoor dining.

It is a problem we are having right across the country; it is definitely not only in County Cork.  There are standards in place but they are definitely not being adhered to when it comes to our public realm and outdoor dining, which I suppose has been at the forefront.  As a disability organisation, we understand that businesses have to try to recoup money that was lost through Covid-19 and if outdoor dining is the thing that helps that, we are not against it.  However, it must be done in a way that still facilitates people with disabilities as pedestrians and as consumers.  People think that once it is outdoor dining, it is accessible.  That does not necessarily stand.  It still can be inaccessible.  What is actually happening is that it is driving people with disabilities back into their homes.  They are not becoming part of the community.  They are finding it increasingly difficult to get around their towns and cities.  Our towns and cities are so old that they are very inaccessible at the best of times.  If businesses are now adding to that with street furniture without the right standards and restrictions applied to them, it will constantly drive people with disabilities back into their homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#M00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Joan Carthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Carthy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#M00200","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Gould.

Can someone explain to me how an extra 10% or 20% does not mean extra cost?  I think this is the crux.  Deputy Duffy started to drill into this.

If a private developer has bought private land then increasing the overall floor space will cost but that can be mitigated.  For social housing, there should not be a significant extra cost in this instance.  For example, in most cases social housing, where it is developed directly by a local authority, is on land that has an historic value rather than a market value.  So 10% does not increase the overall development cost by 10% and is only a relatively marginal increase.  Moreover, local authorities can recoup those costs in different ways.<\/p> <p>  If I understood Ms O'Reilly correctly, the problem is the minimum floor sizes within the social housing standards of the Department clearly need to change.  Whether there is an extra cost for that is a secondary issue and I suspect that the cost would not be that significant but that depends on the project.<\/p> <p>  Earlier I asked Ms Lally and Ms Carthy to talk us through these things a little more.  Please do not assume that we know anything about any of these things and give us an idiot's guide to liveability.  I ask for that because it is important that we put on the record what we exclude people from doing by having the restrictive Part M.  In everyday terms, if the witnesses do not mind, please talk us through some of those things.<\/p> <p>  Earlier Dr. Hartney made a good point and I ask both Ms Lally and Dr. Hartney to clarify the following.  Universal design is a little like affordable housing.  I mean everybody thinks that they know what it means yet everybody talks about something else.  At the end of this meeting ,it would be useful if witnesses clarified what is meant by the various phrases that we have talked about.  For example, Part M, which is the minimum standards, and the universal design, UD+ and UD++ standards.  Please assume that we are idiots and explain what these terms mean because it is important that we understand.<\/p> <p>  Ms Lally mentioned Britain.  How do Part M, UD, UD+ and UD++ standards relate to what happens in Britain?  She said that the UK's equivalent to Part M has three categories: visitable dwellings; properties that are easier to adapt; and liveable dwellings.  I presume that if the Minister were to announce a review of Part M, what the witnesses really want is a Part M with multiple parts.  I mean that there would be a minimum standard for certain types of properties and higher standards for other types of properties.  I ask the witnesses to tell us what they would like to see at the end of the review, and not just get a review. <\/p> <p>  I think that in addition to a review of Part M we want an addition made to the design manual for quality housing that includes a chapter setting out a bunch of designs. I say that because I understand that the Housing Agency has some research funding at the minute and it is working with some Traveller organisations to consider standardised designs for culturally appropriate Traveller-specific accommodation to be developed for local authorities.  I presume that one of the things we want to come out of the review is not just a revision of Part M, we want every local authority manager to have a manual that lists five, ten, 12 or 15 types of UD, UD+ and UD++ standards and acts as a design tool.  I invite the witnesses to tell us what recommendations they would like us to put in our report.  I suggest that Ms Carthy, Ms Lally and Dr. Hartney treat me like an idiot but do so for the benefit of the committee and explain and outline. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#N01000","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I will start by describing the reality of what liveable housing means for a wheelchair user.

We came before the committee recently to speak about this.  It is a missed opportunity in terms of giving older persons the opportunity, choice and control in their own lives to put their houses on the market if it works for them.  There might not necessarily be a large number of homes made available under it when we take into consideration the quality of the homes and other family commitments.  From our perspective on the rights of older persons to make their own decisions and have the most options available to them we see it as a missed opportunity.<\/p> <p>  I want to return to the Deputy's earlier question on housing adaptation grants.  I agree with everything Ms Morris said.  Even outside of the means testing and the maximum grant size there can be hidden costs such as getting in an architect for a consultation.  It can turn many older persons off.  There are other barriers.  Older persons may wait a long time to get reports from occupational therapists or to see occupational therapists in order that they can show the local authority that they have a need.  The situation for older persons in their homes is that they must juggle many competing needs, often with limited resources, energy and ability in terms of vital repairs, energy efficiency, mobility aids and adaptation grants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#O01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":409,"content":"<p>What Ms Murphy has described is what I hear from constituents who come to me looking for health and support.

In the airport, there are signs for the persons with restricted mobility service.  It is not a free service, but the person who uses it does not pay extra for it.

There is that issue of creep, as the Chairman called it.  When restaurants and pubs are allowed to put out tables and chairs, they do so within that minimum space they are given, which is wrong to start with.  We have to take into account the space that will be needed for someone to sit at a table once all the chairs are pulled out and so on.  That is the space that should be defined in the standards, not just how much space a table and chairs take up with nobody sitting there.  A bit of both is going on.  As I said earlier, in many cases, our streets are just too small, so the authorities are looking at pedestrianising some spaces, which is a great idea in theory but it has to be done right, with, as we said previously, meaningful consultation with people with disabilities.  The areas being designated for outdoor dining have to be accessible for a person not only as a pedestrian but also as a consumer, and that is not happening.  Just because we say there is outdoor dining, people assume it is going to be accessible but it is absolutely not in many cases.  As many chairs as possible are put into small spaces, which means a wheelchair user or somebody with a mobility aid cannot make his or her way around them, or somebody with a visual impairment will fall over them in the street.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022062100002#P01900","nonspeaker":"Ms Joan Carthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I have seen some photographs on Twitter where all the tables and chairs are out and there is a tiny space for pedestrians to pass through.<\/p><p>In addition, there is quite an issue of the privatisation of what was once public space.

It is not just about physical access.  Michael Nicholson, the director of services, is the senior person on the management team of the county council.  That model has been considered by others.

While CAB acknowledges the positive intentions behind the advancement of the Bill, it has concerns that those intentions may not be realised under its terms.  The Proceeds of Crime Act is a statutory scheme which essentially provides for the freezing and confiscation of assets which have been proved on the civil standard to be the proceeds of crime.  No prior conviction is necessary.  If CAB can provide evidence which, on the balance of probabilities, persuades the High Court that an asset is the proceeds of crime, then that asset shall, subject to an exemption for injustice, be confiscated.  Belief and hearsay evidence are, to a limited extent, permitted in such applications.  Proceedings taken under the Proceeds of Crime Act are referred to as &quot;in rem&quot;.  In basic terms, this means they are taken against the property itself as opposed to from the person in possession or control of the asset.  This has significant implications within the context of the EU restrictive measures against Russia and Belarus which seek to freeze assets on the basis of the identity of their owner and not on the basis of their provenance.  It appears that the Bill at least in part seeks to confiscate assets seized under the restrictive measures.<br\/><br\/>The concerns of CAB in relation to the efficacy of the Bill are twofold.  First, the Bill presupposes the existence of an identifiable category of assets which have been acquired by or in connection with conduct &ndash; amounting to or in connection with a gross human rights abuse, as defined in the Bill - which is a recognised offence in this jurisdiction but not in the jurisdiction in which it was committed.  In the absence of any clear examples, CAB has significant doubt as to whether such a category of assets exists.  While CAB recognises assets can be acquired through a limited number of offences which can take place in connection with gross human rights abuses - for example, corruption - this is almost certainly going to be recognised as a criminal offence <i>per se <\/i>in the jurisdiction in which it occurred.  The dual criminality provision under the Proceeds of Crime Act as currently drafted does not require the home jurisdiction to acknowledge a specific offence or offences as having taken place, it merely requires corruption <i>per se<\/i>to be recognised as a criminal offence in that jurisdiction.  The Bill will have no practical benefit in such circumstances.  Second, even assuming such a category of assets intended to be targeted by the Bill exists, it is the view of CAB that the evidential challenge of proving the occurrence of criminality in an unco-operative jurisdiction would likely render the chances of Ireland successfully confiscating such assets insurmountable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022062100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Gubbins"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I thank Detective Chief Superintendent Michael Gubbins.

As members are aware, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Helen McEntee, has recognised the very important principles behind this Bill and has made absolutely clear that Ireland must not be a safe haven for illicit gains.  The Department recognises the vital importance, particularly in light of the situation in Ukraine, of ensuring public officials can be held accountable to the greatest possible extent for human rights abuses they commit.  A detailed submission has been provided to the committee and my colleagues and I are happy to address specific areas in more detail where that would be useful.  I will refer to some central points at this stage.<\/p> <p>  The first is the distinction between the political and judicial approaches to targeting assets.  The critical feature of the US Magnitsky Act, and indeed that of the more recent EU global human rights sanctions regime, is that a determination may be made at political level to freeze the assets of a person linked to human rights abuses.  Freezing does not require proof of a legal standard that the person has committed a specific abuse or that the assets in question result from such abuses.  On the contrary, the measures act against the person concerned, and any assets held by or for the benefit of that person.  Measures can be taken quickly and can target both those committing abuses along with those directing them.<\/p> <p>  This political approach is distinct from the judicial one taken in this Bill which hopes to use proceeds of crime legislation.  Seizures would be based on a court finding on a legal standard that an asset results from conduct which is both criminal in Ireland and a gross human rights abuse within the definition provided.  There is no difficulty in treating gross human rights abuses committed by public officials as criminal conduct and this, of course, applies even where an official might be somehow protected under their domestic law.  However, in most cases, gross violations of human rights will already be serious crimes under the law of the state concerned.<\/p> <p>  The question that arises is whether a person has done the conduct rather than whether the conduct constitutes a crime.  The major practical challenge is providing sufficient evidence to meet that legal standard.  However, the more fundamental difficulty is that human rights abuses do not usually create profits in and of themselves.  They may be committed by a person who is also committing other crimes that generate profits, such as corruption or fraud, or they may be committed to cover up such crimes.  However, the asset will still flow from the profit-generating crimes rather than from the human rights abuses.  Ultimately, it will be the link to the profit-generating crime that will need to be proven to support a proceeds of crime action.<\/p> <p>  In our initial assessment of the Bill, the Department identified four conditions that would need to apply in any given scenario for the Bill to yield a practical benefit: first, when conduct is an offence under Irish law but not in the other state; second, when the relevant asset is the proceeds of a human rights abuse rather than another form of crime; third, that sufficient evidence would be available to support a court finding; and fourth, that no other means of recovery is available.  The challenge we have faced is identifying situations where these conditions all apply.<\/p> <p>  We look forward to hearing from other witnesses and from members on this issue in particular.  If there is something that can genuinely be done to help target assets and counter abuses, then the Minister has been very clear that she will progress that.  In passing, I note that amending legislation to the Proceeds of Crime Act is under development and there is certainly further work to be done in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022062100002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Woods.

It is great to see him again.  I thank members of the committee for this opportunity to discuss this hugely important legislation.  I am the head of the Global Magnitsky Justice Campaign.  My work for the last 12 and a half years has stemmed from the murder of my lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, after he uncovered a massive Russian Government corruption scheme.  He exposed it and in retaliation he was arrested, tortured for 358 days and killed on 16 November 2009.  I have made it my mission since then to get justice for him and one of the main tools for justice is the legislation called the Magnitsky Act.  The Magnitsky Act was designed to freeze the assets and ban the visas of the people who killed Sergei Magnitsky, the people who profited from his crime and the people who commit similar types of crime in Russia and around the world.<\/p> <p>  The United States passed the Magnitsky Act in December 2012.  At that time, it was specifically for Russia.  The Magnitsky Act was then broadened in 2016 - it is called the Global Magnitsky Act - to apply to human rights abusers all over the world.<\/p><p>After that, the Canadian Parliament unanimously passed its own Magnitsky Act, as did the UK, European Union and Australia.  Norway has a Magnitsky Act, as do Kosovo and Montenegro.  I am hoping that this legislation being considered today will become the Irish Magnitsky Act to be passed in due course.<\/p><p> I wish to say a couple of things regarding what is happening in Ireland.  Some may ask why Ireland needs a Magnitsky Act or some version of it when the European Union has one.  I have seen the dysfunction of the European Union when it comes to sanctions.  Every country has a veto right over the sanctions list.  In the Magnitsky case the Hungarian Government vetoed any Magnitsky killers being sanctioned in the EU, so only the United States, Canada, the UK and Australia, along with Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, have sanctioned Magnitsky's killers.  Those same individuals could travel to Ireland right now and open bank accounts in Ireland.  They could transact business and buy property in Ireland.  Ireland has an opportunity to have a Magnitsky Act whereby it can operate its own sovereignty, so Ireland is not a soft touch for people such as Magnitsky's killers and they cannot come to this country.<\/p><p> I also wish to respond quickly, if I have the time, to the statement by previous speakers.  The way the Magnitsky Act is structured in other countries is that a person is identified and any assets that belong to that person are subject to freezing.  It is next to impossible to prove that assets coming from a human rights abuse are in a jurisdiction.  It relies on the offending jurisdiction to provide evidence, which is often impossible.  However, it is not so impossible to provide evidence of human rights abuse, so it is very much in Ireland's interest to have a legislative measure similar to that of all the other countries which states that if a person is guilty of human rights abuse based on whatever legal standard Ireland decides to apply, that person's assets in Ireland's jurisdiction will be frozen.  Anything more complicated than that will make it an inoperable legislative measure.  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022062100002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Browder","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Browder.

I warmly welcome the written and detailed submissions from the Department of Justice, CAB and Mr. Browder, with whom I have had conversations.<\/p> <p>  I will make a few general points.  First, Magnitsky is a general heading.  When I looked at this some years ago, and this predates any current human rights abuses ongoing in Ukraine, I wanted to see how we could have something effective in our jurisdiction.  I was a member of the Government when the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 was enacted.  I remember many of the arguments made at the time, with all due respect to some of the arguments I have heard just now, about how impractical that unique new legislation would be to confiscate assets from people without a criminal conviction.  It was groundbreaking at the time, and impractical.  In fact, I had a discussion last night with Mr. Greg Sparks to refresh my memory - he was programme manager for Mr. Dick Spring at the time - and he gave me chapter and verse on how difficult it was to convince people, including senior officials in the Department of Justice, that this was actually a very practical thing.  It is now regarded as the most practical legislative measure we have to combat crime.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly go through the purpose of the Bill.  The purpose is to do a couple of simple things.  One is to enact that the conduct that takes place outside the State would be criminally unlawful if it occurred within the State and can be declared as criminal conduct if it would constitute an offence under the law of the State if it is connected with a gross human rights abuse and some property obtained or received as a result of or in connection with that conduct, that is, the gross human rights abuse, is situated within the State.  The rule would relieve CAB of the dual criminality issue.  CAB addressed that fairly in its submission.  I do not think it has a difficulty with the issue of removing the dual criminality test.  If it has, it should let me know.  In terms of gross human rights abuses, it would be a vacuous thing to try to do in some jurisdictions where obviously human rights abuses will never be made illegal and, in fact, are part of the normal operation of government.<\/p> <p>  In the CAB submission, it has adopted the argument that was put forward in the written submission from the Department of Justice which, at its core and is the core argument against it, is that while abuses may be committed by a person who is engaged in other profit-generating criminal activities such as corruption, fraud or embezzlement, the assets will flow from other crimes rather than from the human rights abuses themselves, and that the primary provisions of the existing 1996 legislation, in common with other confiscation frameworks, can only be used against the assets that are obtained from such criminal conduct.  That is the core of its case.  Even in situations where the human rights abuse is committed to cover up such profit-generating crimes, it is still essential, in CAB's contention as I read it, that the assets to be seized are the product of those crimes.<\/p> <p>  I challenge the Department's contention that the confiscation powers can only be used against assets that are the result of criminal conduct.  The definition of \"proceeds of crime\" is set out in section 1 of the 1996 Act as meaning \"any property obtained or received at any time ... by or as a result of or in connection with\" criminal conduct.  The passage quoted in the submission concentrates on two of those six tests, any one of which must be satisfied before property can be the proceeds of crime under the Act - if it was obtained by criminal conduct, if it was obtained as a result of criminal conduct, if it was obtained in connection with criminal conduct, if it was received by criminal conduct, if it was received as a result of criminal conduct and if it was received in connection with criminal conduct.  They are the definitions set out.  I contend, contrary to the point that was made, that it is not necessary that it flows from crime.  It is sufficient, and I was at the Cabinet table when these matters were discussed and agreed, that they were obtained or received in connection with crime, which obviously is a less onerous test.<\/p> <p>  If an individual or an official of a foreign state routinely abuses his or her position to commit gross human rights abuses, whether he or she is acting licitly or illicitly in connection with the office, it is our contention that if there are goods got in connection with the commission of those human rights abuses, he or she would be liable to have those goods confiscated under the Proceeds of Crime Act.  If the definition in the Bill I have drafted is not sufficiently clear, it is possible to amend it to make it sufficiently clear.<\/p> <p>  More troublingly, and I will end on this point, the submission goes on to assert that the seizure of assets arising from criminal conduct outside the State generally requires the co-operation of the authorities of that state.  Where gross human rights are alleged against persons in positions in authority, it is self-evident that this would present significant challenges.  The submission is willing to contemplate scenarios where a foreign state is co-operating with Irish authorities and in seeking Irish assistance to recover those assets that were corruptly obtained that are now located in Ireland, generally a legal issue with dual criminality does not arise in these cases, which are dealt with by way of mutual legal agreements.<\/p><p>My concern is this argument is unwilling to consider a scenario where the official in question serves under an uncooperative foreign state.  However, that is precisely the whole concept of what the Magnitsky laws are designed to deal with, namely, an uncooperative abusive foreign state where there are officials trying to act properly and whistleblow on that activity.  It seems the two contentious points that have been raised can be addressed.  First, by making it clear this direct connection of proceeds to a human rights abuse is not the definition intended in the original 1996 Act and, second, the co-operation of a foreign state will obviously not happen in this instance.<\/p><p> I am conscious the legislation I am proposing has universal application.  It is not simply confined to Russia, about which there has been some commentary today.  Mr. Browder is generally concerned with that but this Bill pre-dates the current activities of the Russian Federation in Ukraine.  It deals with any human rights abuser who wants to stash goods in Ireland.  Bluntly, the points made about the difficulties in getting evidence, or the challenges in following through on the legislation, have never been an impediment to us as legislators.  If were dealing with, for example, domestic abuse, it would never be a matter for us to say we could not deal with it because it is too difficult to get into the home to find out about the abuse or get a witness statement.  If something needs to be legislated for because it is the morally right thing to do, we should enact legislation no matter how challenging or difficult it is. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022062100002#D00300","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":491,"content":"<p>As we have a few items on the agenda in addition to this Bill, I will take that as the Deputy's opening remarks and will start the three minutes now for questions and answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022062100002#E00200","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I have set my questions out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022062100002#E00300","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":493,"content":"<p>Yes.

The question of at what point assets can be considered the proceeds of crime is very much at the root of this.  In the situations we have looked at, the human rights abuse does not generate the asset.  Even in the Sergei Magnitsky case, I do not think the argument is that the abuse itself generated the asset; the key question in that situation is what generated the asset.  In those cases where it is clearly corrupt behaviour, or the argument is that it is corrupt behaviour, embezzlement or fraud, there is no current impediment to being able to chase or freeze those assets.

We have been successful in those cases without the co-operation of the state in which the corruption occurred.  That was not because the state was unco-operative, but because we were able to get the evidence from elsewhere, from other international law enforcement partners.  I think the US authorities assisted in providing evidence in both those cases.  We were able to present that to the High Court to seize assets situated in this country that were the proceeds of corruption in the two jurisdictions I referred to.<\/p><p> This is part of the point we are trying to make.  Regarding the legislation as currently enacted, we had corruption in the example I gave.  Corruption is recognised as a criminal offence in Nigeria and Thailand.  Corruption is recognised as an offence, I would suspect, in virtually every jurisdiction we are seeking to target.  The question as to whether a particular act is recognised as corruption in a country is of little consequence in the High Court.  In the Magnitsky case, the case which brought about this whole affair, my understanding is that there was corruption which led to the generation of approximately $230 million worth of assets and that it was not recognised as an act of corruption in the jurisdiction in which it occurred.  In that case, under our current legislation, if there were assets in this jurisdiction which were identifiable and if we had evidence of corruption, we would still be able to seize and confiscate those assets, provided we had enough evidence to convince, on the balance of probabilities, the High Court that they were, in fact, the proceeds of that corruption.  Whether a gross human rights abuse occurred in connection with that corruption, or otherwise, would be immaterial because both would be recognised as a criminal offence in this jurisdiction and in the jurisdiction in which the offence occurred, although I recognise that the specific offence may not be recognised as having been an offence of corruption in the jurisdiction in which it occurred.<\/p><p> Co-operation is important, but it is not necessarily that important in the jurisdiction in which an offence occurred, provided the offence is an offence in the jurisdiction in which it occurred.  This Bill does not actually help us in that scenario.  The difference between the provisions of the 2012 Magnitsky Act in the US and the one we are dealing with here is as highlighted in the submission.  One is concerned with political sanctions and the other is legislation in the realm of the civil law, but it straddles the criminal law as well.  We must show an Irish court before a judge, and convince that judge, that the proceeds in a case are the proceeds of criminal conduct, whatever the definition of that criminal conduct might be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022062100002#E02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin McMeel","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":511,"content":"<p>Mr. Browder has his hand up.

I have seen this because I have worked now with many different governments and parliaments on these sanctions.  The Magnitsky case is all about, as was said, the uncovering by Sergei Magnitsky of a $230 million scam.  He exposed it and he was then arrested by the people he exposed and tortured to death.  A number of people were then involved in the cover-up of his murder and the financial crime he had exposed.  When we went to get sanctions imposed, certain countries, such as the UK, originally passed a Magnitsky Act that just went after human rights abuses.  They did not go after kleptocracy or corruption, and that meant they could only go after about 25 of the 50 people who had been sanctioned in America.  That was obviously not very helpful.  The people committing the human rights abuse tended to be some of the low-level officials, whereas the high-level officials were the ones who were involved in ordering the crime and in benefiting financially from it.  Eventually, the UK added a series of new provisions so that its legislation could capture corruption.  We ended up getting all the perpetrators, including those involved in the cover-up after the murder.<\/p> <p>  As far as this law goes, it is important that the definitions are not so tight that one cannot capture the people involved in a crime.  If one can prove that people are benefiting financially from a human rights abuse, that is great, but that is a very small subset of people.  To prove that somebody is involved in kleptocracy is much easier.  To prove that somebody has been involved in human rights abuse is not that hard, but to connect kleptocracy to human rights abuse is almost impossible.  Therefore, it is extremely important that the definition, however it ends up being defined, captures as many of these participants in the crime as possible.  When it comes to proving it, there are probably 500 people or entities now on the global Magnitsky list of the US.  I cannot say this with certainty, but I believe all those people were sanctioned not because there was any co-operation from any foreign government, but because of information provided by the victims, NGOs or by the US Government itself, which found ways of acquiring such information, through intelligence sources, etc.  If the burden of proof is on the balance of probabilities, that proof can come from wherever it needs to come from and it does not need to rely on the co-operation of a foreign government.  It would be naive and unrealistic to expect to expect one would get such co-operation from those people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022062100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Browder"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Browder.

If people were engaged in human trafficking and then using those trafficked people in the commission of further crimes, be that drug distribution or other activities, is the relevant fact that they are incidental to the crime?  Is it incidental to the offence in this regard that the perpetrators are treating people in a way that violates their human rights?  Is the actual crime committed the drug trafficking or whatever other illegal activity it might be?  Is there a link if people&rsquo;s rights are being violated, in cases where that violation of rights does not generate a profit in itself?  I invite Mr. Browder to elaborate on that distinction a little further in respect of the statement that I think came from the Department.  That is why I am looking at Ms Woods.

I very much welcome that it is taking place.  I thank the organisations and individuals taking part.  I very much welcome any constructive suggestion as to how the Bill can be improved.  I am very open to amendments that members of the committee or other Members of the Oireachtas may have to strengthen it on Committee Stage.  It has two specific intentions, the first being to introduce a specific criminal offence for anyone who demands sex in lieu of rent or for reduced rent and the second being to introduce a specific offence for advertising sex in lieu of rent, for individuals placing an advertisement, a platform or publication or anyone involved in facilitating it.<\/p><p>To give the background to why I introduced the Bill, there have been many reports, particularly in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>by Ann Murphy, who has done very good work on this, and also RT&Eacute;'s &quot;Prime Time&quot; on the practice of putting renters under pressure to offer sex for a reduced rent or making available of accommodation in this regard.  There have been reports over a number of  years.  More recently, and very disturbingly, we have heard about some people trying to exploit people fleeing war in Ukraine.  We can all agree this is an abhorrent practice.  We must ask whether legislation is necessary.  In the D&aacute;il the Minister of State for Justice confirmed that no specific criminal offence exists for the practice, and the Garda confirmed for the housing committee that the PULSE system does not specifically record sex-for-rent complaints as a specific category.  That is not surprising given that it is not a specific criminal offence.  The point was made on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il by nearly all contributors that while this Bill would be welcome, no one is suggesting it would sort out all the problems and that there are not wider problems related to housing, renting and power imbalances.  It would be helpful all the same.  The potential value of the Bill is that it would act as a deterrent.  It would also assist renters and organisations that support renters in bringing forward complaints.  At present, any complaints would have to be made to fit the criteria of other legislation.  The Bill, if passed and strengthened, would be successful if it led to a reduction in the practice of putting pressure on renters.<\/p><p>We do not have full data on the extent of the problem.  We lack research in Ireland.  There is some evidence that migrants, in particular those with less access to support networks, have been targeted.  This has been seen from certain advertisements placed on platforms mostly used by migrants.  More extensive research has been done in the UK by the housing charity Shelter.  It suggests that 59,000 women in the UK were propositioned for sex in lieu of rent in a period of a year and a half between March 2020 and September 2021.  There is no equivalent quantitative research in Ireland at this point.<\/p><p>On Second Stage of the Bill in the D&aacute;il, the Minister of State raised a number of issues constructively that the Government felt needed to be addressed to tighten the wording, make the wording more precise and ensure the terms in the Bill are properly defined.  Concerns were also raised over the proportionality of the fines suggested in the Bill.  I welcome that input and am very much committed to working with members of the committee to address these concerns and improve and strengthen the Bill.  I very much look forward to hearing people's comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022062100002#J00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cian O'Callaghan.

I am the legal director of Rape Crisis Network Ireland.  So-called sex for rent is a serious form of sexual exploitation and abuse of some of the most vulnerable people.  The opportunities for this form of abuse are multiplying as the shortage of affordable housing for rent becomes ever more acute.  This issue also needs to be addressed if the problem is to resolved effectively.<\/p> <p>  Rape Crisis Network Ireland is glad to see from the Second Stage debate that there is a consensus that this Bill needs to be enacted to deter future abusive sex-for-rent offers and also mark the gravity of this behaviour by criminalising it.  This legislation, if enacted, will also send a strong message that it is unacceptable to exploit a person's acute need for a roof over their head by making offers to supply accommodation and-or a reduced rent in return for sexual services.  If such an offer is not accepted, as the law stands now the offerer cannot be criminalised unless the other person is a prostitute.  This gap needs to be closed.<\/p> <p>  Rape Crisis Network Ireland urges all Members of the Oireachtas to work together to ensure first that it is legally robust and workable and second that it is passed and commenced as soon as possible.  It is needed urgently.<\/p> <p>  I have a few remarks on drafting, which I am going to truncate.  The full picture is set out in our detailed submission.  With regard to section 2, on the offence of requiring or accepting sex as a condition of accommodation, the words \"require\" and \"accept\" may not cover the situation where there is no explicit demand for sexual services but instead a suggestion that providing sexual services might unlock access to the accommodation or provide that accommodation at a reduced rent, or even no rent, or prevent eviction.  It should also criminalise advertising, offering, seeking to provide or providing any accommodation-related benefit in return for sexual services.  The term \"sex\" is too vague.  It must be possible to identify which sexual acts are criminalised.  The wording \"as a condition of access to or retention of\" does not necessarily cover where there is an offer to forgive all or part of the rent, including rent arrears, in return for sexual services.<\/p><p>The wording \"as a condition of access to or retention of\" does not necessarily cover the situation where there is an offer to forgive all or part of the rent, including rent arrears, in return for sexual services.  Either the wording should list all of the situations in which the landlord might seek the sexual services of a tenant in return for a housing benefit or it should use a blanket term such as \"housing advantage\", \"housing benefit\" or \"accommodation-related benefit\" to the tenant.  A wording broader than one involving a condition of acquiring some form of housing advantage is desirable.  For example, \"in return for\" is easier to prove and is clearer.  The term \"accommodation or related services or transactions\" should be defined so that it is clear what is and is not accommodation or related services or transactions.<\/p><p> In subsection (2), \"provider of accommodation\" is not defined.  With respect, we suggest that it ought to be.  It is not clear as to whether this offence can be committed by a company or other any other legal entity that is not a person.  It must also be clear as to whether it includes landlords who enter tenancy agreements, licensors renting rooms, people offering accommodation free of charge in return for certain non-sexual services, for example, caretaking, and so on.<\/p><p> With regard to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022062100002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Counihan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I apologise for cutting Ms Counihan short.

In September 2019, the then Solidarity Deputy, Ms Ruth Coppinger, highlighted a case in which a constituent had been offered a sex-for-rent arrangement when she could not afford a rent increase.  In January 2020, this reporter discovered a sex-for-rent arrangement being advertised in the Lough, Cork city, on a website called Locanto, which carries a wide variety of classified advertisements from Ireland and across the world.  One of the properties advertised in Limerick late last year on the same website was for a single lady &quot;with a twist&quot;.  The ad read: &quot;Can do reduced rent for occasional fun&quot;.  When contacted by this reporter posing as a prospective tenant, the landlord made it clear that sexual activity was required on a weekly basis in return for rent of &euro;200 for the first month and &euro;250 per month thereafter.  To establish the veracity of the landlord and the existence of the property, this reporter went to the house in the guise of the prospective tenant and met the landlord at the door.<br\/><br\/>In particular, foreign women have been offered reduced or no rent in return for sex or bed-sharing with landlords in different parts of the country.  In recent weeks, a number of advertisements have appeared online targeting Ukrainian women with offers of accommodation in Ireland in return for sex.  One relating to a property in Cavan was titled, &quot;Seeking a Ukraine woman&quot;, and was explicit in nature, offering a &quot;free bed in exchange for sexual pleasure for me&quot;.  The advertiser added: &quot;I can pick you up in Cavan if you can't drive need this asap please???&quot;  Such advertisements are still to be found online even as we discuss this legislation today.  Some are explicit in their content, as above, with recent ads offering &quot;friends with benefits&quot; arrangements or a room for rent for a sweet girl in Dublin, for example.<br\/><br\/>Testimony has been provided to the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>by women offered sex-for-rent arrangements after they responded to rental accommodation advertisements on Facebook groups, classified advertisement websites and some more streamlined accommodation websites, including <i>daft.ie<\/i>.  In these instances, the offer was not mentioned in the advertisement.  Testimony from women previously targeted by such arrangements shows a reluctance to go to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make complaints for reasons including a fear that they will not be believed or taken seriously.  On some occasions, those offering sex-for-rent arrangements are people who are subletting rooms unknown to their own landlords.<br\/><br\/>Information on the precise nature and extent of sex-for-rent arrangements in Ireland is sporadic and anecdotal, unlike in the UK where research has been conducted by the homeless organisation, Shelter.  The findings of that study suggested that 30,000 women in Britain were propositioned with sex-for-rent arrangements between March 2020 and January 2021.  No such research has yet been carried out in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022062100002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":562,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Murphy.

We welcome the introduction of this legislation, which seeks to prevent the exploitation of people who are seeking a secure and safe home to rent.  I agree with and echo the comments that have already been made.  We are taking this opportunity to make comment on the Bill and recommend several changes, which we suggest would make it more victim friendly and ensure that protection and support were available to victims.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Cian O'Callaghan has stated, the full extent of the issue is unknown.  A small number of private renters have spoken publicly, and none of us can be anything but horrified by what we have read in the press.  Few of Threshold's clients have reported such propositions by their landlords or prospective landlords to us.  This may not be particularly surprising, though, as it may not be the sort of issue that a renter would contact Threshold or, indeed, the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, about.  No reporting mechanism is in place and, as we have heard from Deputy O'Callaghan, it is not an offence at the moment to engage in such behaviour.<\/p> <p>  While reliable evidence on the prevalence of the issue in Ireland is not available, international comparators can provide us with some troubling indications that the recent press reports on this issue may only be the tip of the iceberg.  Of particular concern is research from England, a jurisdiction that shares a similar rental culture to Ireland.  It would be a mistake not to regard the evidence that has been gathered in England about this practice as significant and an indication that the practice might not only be occurring in Ireland, but might be worse.  England is not experiencing an across-the-board housing crisis to the extent Ireland is.  Evidence of the prevalence of the issue in England must be viewed in light of a similar rental culture and a much more constrained rental market in Ireland.  We have heard about the research conducted by Shelter in England.  If those proportions were replicated in Ireland, it would equate to almost 4,000 renter households.  Obviously, there is a major caveat with this figure, but it is significant nonetheless.<\/p> <p>  The legislation in England has not been successful in tackling the issue despite attempts to do so, partly due to an attempt to prosecute offenders under more general legislation dealing with prostitution offences.  Since the issuing of prosecution guidelines in the UK in 2019, there has been just one successful prosecution.  The lesson from the UK is that shoehorning sex-for-rent offences into existing offences risks mislabelling the offences and obscuring the nature of both crimes.  Threshold suggests that the reporting of such offences be incorporated into existing victim-friendly processes, such as those created by the report, Supporting a Victim's Journey.  NGOs working with people who may be victims of these offences should be empowered to provide mechanisms through which people may make such disclosures.<\/p> <p>  We are particularly concerned for sitting tenants who report such practices.  As it stands, many private renters do not report wrongdoing by their landlords for fear of eviction.  In such precarious situations, a tenant may fear retaliation or penalisation by his or her landlord if he or she reports the landlord for requesting sex or sexual favours in exchange for accommodation.  A tenant may have no other housing options available and may be forced to remain under these circumstances, the only other option being homelessness.  We suggest that the Bill be made coherent with section 14 of the Residential Tenancies Act, which prohibits penalisation for making a report to certain bodies.  Incorporating in this Bill the making of a report might be sensible.<\/p> <p>  As currently drafted, the Bill will offer relatively little support to people who may be, or previously have been, in situations where there has been a sex-for-rent exchange.  Satellite supports for victims need to be considered and put in place to aid the effectiveness of the Bill.  This could include an expansion of domestic and-or sexual violence services to provide support for victims of these offences.  For example, people who are reporting such offences could, where necessary, be supported by an extension of the recent rent supplement protocol between the Department of Social Protection and Tusla, counselling and housing supports.  It is Threshold's experience that people, even in extreme housing difficulty, are sometimes forced to make a choice between unacceptable housing conditions and homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022062100002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavin Elliott"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":564,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Elliott.

As the committee will be aware, during the debate on Second Stage, the Government did not oppose the Bill.  In his remarks the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, noted the Government's support for the objectives of the Bill, which aims to create an offence of requiring or accepting sex as a condition of accommodation or of facilitating same.  Both the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, are engaging on how best to address this unacceptable behaviour and are in agreement with the principle of Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill.  The Attorney General has advised there are some concerns of a legal and drafting nature to be addressed to ensure it is legally sound and achieves its objectives.  The Minister of State outlined those concerns on Second Stage and they are detailed in the Department's submission, so I will not go over them again.  I will just reiterate that any agreement to pay for accommodation with sexual acts is invalid and not enforceable under contract law.  Additionally, sexual offences legislation makes it abundantly clear that consent must be freely and voluntarily given.  Submission when a person is forced or has no other choice is not the same as consent, and sex without consent is rape and punishable on conviction by up to life imprisonment.<\/p> <p>  The Department agrees with Deputy O'Callaghan and other stakeholders here, including Rape Crisis Network Ireland, that the behaviour this Bill aims to target is unacceptable and exploitative and should be subject to criminal sanction.  The Minister recognises there is a gap in the law here that has to be addressed, so any concerns we express are just about the manner in which that gap should be addressed.  The Department has some concern that the level of the penalty proposed risks blurring the lines between a sexual act which takes place in an exploitative situation and a non-consensual sexual act.  The proposed seven-year penalty in the Bill approaches that for sexual assault.  It may be that the offence we are considering is more closely aligned to the offence of purchasing sexual services, which is one of exploitation targeted at people, predominantly women, in vulnerable and sometimes desperate circumstances.  The penalty for that offence, however, is considerably lower.<\/p> <p>  The Department has highlighted the need to ensure any new offence created in this area takes account of the existing legislative framework.  The Department believes further consideration is required in that regard.  In that respect, the committee may wish to note that a review is under way of Part 4 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, which deals with the purchase of sexual services.  Recommendations on strengthening the safety and well-being of persons who engage in sexual activity for payment are awaited and will inform further legislative efforts in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022062100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Woods.

I congratulate Deputy O'Callaghan on this piece of work.  It is important the committee has been able to provide further scrutiny of it.<\/p> <p>  Sex without consent is clearly rape.  Consent cannot be coerced.  Consent cannot be purchased lawfully.  Consent cannot be transacted.  Consent is consent; it is freely given.  The nature of this, however, is whether a person will be believed.  I am very glad Ms Murphy referred to that.  The nature of sexual exploitation is very rarely what we perceive as being directly violent and very rarely involves a stranger.  The vast bulk of sexual exploitation or abuse, as we know, is committed by somebody known to the victim.  It goes beyond agreed boundaries.  It is nuanced.  It is delicate.  It is practically always a surprise, practically always in the moment and practically always something that - and this is very important - creates doubt in the mind of the victim and a sense of surprise along the lines of \"Did that really just happen?\", or more specifically \"Did I really just get asked that question?\", or \"Did that physically just happen?\", or \"Am I actually in this situation?\".  There is always that moment of creating doubt.  The question of whether they will be believed is one all victims of sexual abuse and exploitation ask themselves.  That is particularly important when it comes to this issue.  It is already incredibly difficult to get a successful prosecution for any sexual offence.  It is already very difficult to reach the evidential standard relative to the number of offences we know are committed and the range of experiences of women in particular.<\/p> <p>  What is the Department's thinking on the evidential standard for this offence?  How does that compare with the other forms of sexual exploitation and efforts to purchase sex, which we know we are having difficulties with?  One thing I will draw to the attention of the committee is the group established by the National Women's Council called Beyond Exploitation.  Beyond Exploitation is run principally by the National Women's Council and Ruhama but is also linked in carefully with Dr. Ruth Breslin, who works in the sexual exploitation research programme in the Geary Institute of UCD.  These are serious programmes to highlight the nature of the difficulty of people forced by coercion or circumstance to sell sex.  This is especially the case with trafficked and vulnerable women.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate I have very little time, but that is my question to the Department as to how it thinks this offence will be proved if we get it into legislation, which I firmly believe we will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022062100002#L00400","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655766000,"counter":568,"content":"<p>That is a very good question.  All sexual offences are difficult to prove in certain circumstances.  It is quite clear that, no matter how an offence is constructed, there will be an element of \"he said, she said\" or two stories and two sides.  The position is difficult to prove.  However, the evidential standards will be those that apply in every other sexual offence.  In this case, where advertising is available, there can be actual physical evidence.  Often there are email, text or phone contacts.  Those would be the kinds of evidential supports available, but that will be a difficulty no matter how the offence is constructed.

As Deputy Carroll MacNeill stated, exploitation, including sexual exploitation, takes very many forms and is a spectrum.  It was interesting that in Ms Murphy's testimony she said testimony from women previously targeted shows a reluctance of victims to go to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for various reasons, including a fear they will not be believed.  It is important we send a message out from this committee that women - not just women, but mostly women - will be believed.  We should encourage them to go to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is a pity no research on that has been carried out in Ireland.  It has come up time and again in this committee that the lack of proper statistics compared with what they have in England causes the way we deal with things to fall down in a lot of ways.  I reiterate a call for more effort and more funding to be put into that.<\/p> <p>  I agree with what Threshold said about victim-friendly processes and supporting the victim's journey.  That should be done.  Unfortunately, many private renters do not report landlords' wrongdoing.<\/p> <p>  As for RCNI's testimony, the point that stood out, because it tallies with the OPLA's opinion on this, is that we should all work together to ensure first that this legislation gets through, whether or not it has to be amended slightly.  It probably does.  RCNI's view is that it must be legally robust and workable and that it is important that it be passed as soon as possible.<\/p><p>Having said that, there are concerns in the OPLA advice about drafting, making sure that it is precise and maybe some amendments on the lack of definitions and clarity.  There is no point in sending it forward if we know there are likely to be constitutional difficulties with it.  Having spoken to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, I think he is open to amendments on that point.  There are also some concerns around the penalty clauses where more flexibility could be shown on that.  <\/p><p> I thank Deputy Cian O'Callaghan for his efforts and Ms Murphy for all the work she has done on this.  I have spoken to her in the past on it.  <\/p><p> The only question I have is for Ms Woods.

It is an important hole that needs to be plugged.  I endorse what my colleagues have said about consent and its non-transactional nature.<\/p> <p>  Given time, I will raise a couple of issues.  I do not accept what Threshold has said about the extrapolation from the British report.  However, given that we know anecdotally that this is happening, will the Department conduct research to establish what the extent of the problem is?  Second, Threshold mentioned that in the UK there has been a failure to achieve convictions in relation to its legislation.  Can we identify what the issues were?  Is it the old chestnut around sexual offences that there are difficulties believing people?  How do we address that?  I also agree with sending out the message that people will be taken seriously when they bring these offences to Garda attention and potentially in a way that they never have been before.  People need to understand there is a listening ear for this kind of thing.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious of what was said about the extent of the penalty that is available.  The point made was reasonable but I understand from Deputy Cian O'Callaghan that there was a certain openness to amendments around that.  However, the offence under section 2 does not cover asking where someone simply asks someone to enter into that arrangement.  The offence as currently structured refers to a requirement.  I think that it is important that we send out the message that any kind of discussion on this subject is not acceptable.  If we solely rely on the requirement we are saying that it is okay if someone has the strength and presence and the circumstances to be able to push back and reject the requirement.  However, the danger is that a vulnerable person, faced with this option would feel obliged to take it at any level.  Is there room in the Bill for simply asking that equally would be an offence under section 2?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022062100002#M00400","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":578,"content":"<p>Does Threshold want to respond about the figures?

My question to the Department of Justice is whether there is similar legislation in other jurisdictions that captures this issue and has proven effective that we can look at as a model?

Very few other jurisdictions have an offence in this area.  Those that do, such as Britain, prosecute it as part of payment for sexual services or prostitution because they have defined prostitution as any payment or consideration including accommodation.  I was interested to hear the comments from other witnesses before the committee that they are not happy with that and that they believe it is not working.  It should be examined to determine why it is not working.<\/p> <p>  Northern Ireland also uses the same legislation for payment for sexual services, and it does not define that in terms of prostitution at all.  It refers to any consideration exchanged for sex and it does not define it in terms of prostitution.  Again, it would be worth considering how that is working there given that jurisdiction has not based the issue on prostitution.  Our legislation is not suitable in this area because the provision is very much defined as for the purposes of prostitution, but we could look at amending that area of law and widening what is in that legislation.  Waiting for the review to see whether what is there is working would be sensible before amending the legislation because amendments may be required following the review.<\/p> <p>  The alternative is to proceed with Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's Bill.  The Department does not have a firm position on what the best way to do this is because we do not have the review of the 2017 Act.

If it is, after all, decided it is best to proceed with Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's Bill and to amend it, it will be important that it be drafted in such a way that it will capture the wide variety of cases Ms Murphy laid out for us.  What we see all the time is that sexual exploitation and abuse is a horrible amoeba.  It adapts to fit a shape that suits whatever the situation is.  Somebody who is determined to abuse another person sexually will find some way to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022062100002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Counihan"},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I compliment Deputy Cian O'Callaghan on bringing forward this legislation and pay tribute to the Department of Justice for having an open mind as to whether it would go with it or do something else.  I might put a few points before the committee for consideration.  What we are dealing with is, clearly, a first cousin of prostitution and pimping, whereby somebody is induced to provide sexual services by being offered some consideration in exchange.  Other types of offences that could also be closely related to this, such as the seeking of sexual favours in exchange for offering employment or a Harvey Weinstein situation whereby sexual favours are sought in exchange for recruitment, the offering of a contract or other things like that.  Whichever choice the Department makes, there is something to be said for widening the concept of prostitution to cover what I call the first cousin of prostitution and pimping, namely, what we are dealing with here.<\/p> <p>  I fully agree with Deputy Carroll MacNeill in that proving this is going to be very difficult.  Unless there are, say, text messages or a printed advertisement, it will be practically impossible to prove it because the offer will have been during an oral conversation, by innuendo or something like that.  Nevertheless, the fact it is difficult to prove does not mean it should be legal or that there should be no consequence to doing it.  As an example, if a male were to suggest to a female that she move in with him into his gaff and share his rent, while it may be clear from the circumstance that there is to be a sexual dimension to her moving in and that she will have to pay a portion of the rent in shared accommodation or whatever, it may not be so easy to prove.  It is essential, therefore, that the language of the legislation be very clear as to what it will or will not catch.  For instance, in Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's brave effort to work out who such an offender could be, the Bill refers to providers of accommodation or employees, agents or contractors of a provider, but in a lot of cases involving house-sharing, it will be very difficult to work out who is or is not a sharer and what his or her status is.  That is something we will have to bear in mind.  In England, there was recently a successful prosecution for incitement to prostitution, based on the English definition.  It was the case of a 53-year-old man who had made very explicit demands of a prospective tenant.<\/p> <p>  I am in two minds, like the Department of Justice, as to which is the correct way to go but I am equally convinced, as has been noted by others, that something should be done reasonably urgently about this, one way or the other.  I appreciate the Department is looking at the measures that were taken recently to make prostitutes immune from prosecution but the customer liable to be prosecuted.  I would love to see the Department take a simple step and  carry out a survey on the extent of prostitution in Ireland.  Unless I have a very prurient imagination, it seems a high number of odd-looking massage establishments are cropping up everywhere.  Unless there is very high demand for massage, I think prostitution is much more widespread now and that it is going under the flag of massage much more often than it used to.<\/p> <p>  I return to my main point.  Whatever language is put into the legislation has to be sufficient to capture me-too situations where people are asked to provide sex for a job or other things.  It should be in the context of revising the concept of prostitution and bringing in this cognate, first cousin of prostitution, whereby the concept of consideration can cover situations like this.  We cannot just long-finger it.  We cannot just say that because it is complicated, we should do nothing.  Clearly, the most vulnerable people are being exposed to this demand now.  Moreover, the Bill should extend to lodgers, given many people are now sharing homes on the tax-free lodger system and that must be wide open to the issue.<\/p> <p> I reiterate my congratulations to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan on taking the initiative in bringing the Bill before us.<\/p><p>It requires careful but nonetheless urgent work in order to make it effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022062100002#N00400","speaker":"1669","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655766000,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for those points.
