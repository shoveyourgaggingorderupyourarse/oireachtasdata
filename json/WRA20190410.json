Galway's designation as European Capital of Culture 2020, is a great honour for Ireland and a wonderful opportunity to strengthen and promote our culture nationally and internationally. It is particularly important in ever changing circumstances that Ireland uses this opportunity well to celebrate the creativity of Galway, on the periphery of Europe and mark Ireland's place in this important EU led celebrations of culture.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's support of &euro;15m represents the largest single contribution to the overall cost of Galway 2020 as the European Capital of Culture.\u00a0 The Government's contribution is provided under the terms of a Performance Delivery Agreement setting out the respective roles and responsibilities of the Department and Galway 2020 in the provision and expenditure of the grant, the key deliverables and performance indicators attached to the drawdown of the grant.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition\u00a0to the funding\u00a0being granted by my Department the other key partners are Galway City Council and Galway County Council who have guaranteed a minimum of &euro;6m and &euro;2m respectively.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A full breakdown of Galway 2020&rsquo;s income and expenditure is publicly available on the website and reported to my\u00a0Department on a quarterly basis as part of our performance delivery agreement.<\/p>  <p>  A large scale fundraising drive is underway.\u00a0 Galway 2020&rsquo;s fundraising team is engaging with local, national and international businesses very positively and effectively.\u00a0 It is understood that the process to negotiate and agree packages with fundraising partners takes time to finalise for each individual business and Galway 2020 are of course anxious to\u00a0ensure that both sides get the same level of satisfaction from the partnership.<\/p>  <p>  As is normal for projects of this scale, it is envisaged that the fundraising drive will continue throughout 2019, into and during 2020, with funding realised throughout the entire duration of the project.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the terms of the Performance Delivery Agreement, regular monitoring meetings are held between my Department, Galway 2020 and Galway City Council and Galway County Council, as the other main stakeholders,<\/p>  <p>  Galway 2020&rsquo;s ambition is to deliver an artistic and cultural programme that will exceed expectations and leave a lasting legacy for Galway city and county.\u00a0 In January 2019, Artichoke, under the leadership of Helen Marriage was appointed to deliver the Creative Leadership\u00a0role for the project.\u00a0 Having masterminded many large and unique cultural events, spectacles and arts performances, this expertise and creativity will be brought to bear in an imaginative programme for Galway 2020.<\/p>  <p>  As Galway 2020 is moving into the delivery phase of the Capital of Culture, it is signing contracts with organisations, artists and performers for the performances and events that they will hold under the overall delivery programme.\u00a0 The programme continues to evolve as Galway 2020 has this week announced an exciting open call for communities to develop projects for inclusion in<\/p>  <p>  the cultural programme for Galway 2020, European Capital of Culture.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;200,000 will be awarded by Galway 2020 across the successful<\/p>  <p>  community groups to create and deliver thrilling projects that could transform<\/p>  <p>  their communities.\u00a0 These projects will form will form an integral part of<\/p>  <p>  the cultural programme for 2020<\/p>  <p>  At an organisational level, a number of changes have taken place over the past year. The company is now led by Patricia Philbin, formerly of Galway City Council, who had a direct role in the bid book phase and recent appointments to the\u00a0Board include Arthur Lappin as Chair. In addition, the\u00a0securing of the cultural production company Artichoke. Artichoke who has a proven track record in programming, funding and audience development, has given the project important cultural leadership. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While aspects of these\u00a0changes gave rise to some local concerns during the initial bedding down stage, I believe that it is now timely for all to work within the timeframe to assist in delivering what is being designed an exciting and innovative programme for 2020 in Galway.<\/p>  <p>  The first of the\u00a0monitoring meetings was held with the company in February when\u00a0officials from my\u00a0Department met with the Chief Executives of Galway City Council and Galway County Council, and separately with the senior management team in Galway 2020 to discuss progress on all key aspects of the project. All parties are working together to achieve the best possible programme in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  To date funding has been paid to Galway 2020 toward certified expenditure incurred on the research and development phase for 27 projects that will comprise the key deliverables under the culture programme for Galway 2020. This expenditure is in line with the terms of the performance delivery agreement, which aligns Department funding to the successful delivery of the cultural projects concerned.<\/p>  <p>  It is proposed that the Government funding will be rolled out on the basis of\u00a0&euro;6 million in 2019 \u00a0 and the remainder of the Government committed funding will flow over 2020 and 2021. I believe this level of support\u00a0with additional funding by other public and private partners\u00a0will deliver an ambitious and exciting first-class programme for Galway 2020 as European Capital of Culture.<\/p>  <p>  Preparations for Galway as European Capital of Culture 2020 are progressing apace. I understand that the Galway 2020 team is working hard to deliver an artistic and cultural programme that will exceed expectations and leave a lasting legacy for the city and county of Galway and Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is not unique in having personnel changes during the planning and delivery phase of a European Capital of Culture. What is important now that structures and personnel are in place, is that the public funding commitment to Galway 2020 is used to maximum impact to show globally that Galway and Ireland are a place of creativity, innovation and an exciting programme is on offer for all to experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041000069#WRA01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wildlife Control","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041000069#WRA01300"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[16710\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041000069#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if licences have been granted for the capture of hares on lands owned by Coillte.","asker":"1259","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>My Department issued one permit in 2012 under the Wildlife Acts to Coillte to remove a maximum of tens hares from their lands in Co Carlow as they were causing damage to red oak trees.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The hares were captured by means of nets and released back into the wild onto lands in agreement with officials of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0This permit was granted under section 42\u00a0of\u00a0the Wildlife Acts which offers a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case by case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual species on specific lands.

Ireland sits on the Steering Group of the Man and Biosphere Programme, and is represented by Dublin Bay Biosphere.<\/p>  <p>  To support sustainable development, UNESCO&rsquo;s concept of a Biosphere has since evolved to include not just areas of ecological value but also the areas around them and the communities that live and work within these areas.

They were originally designated in the early 1980s. The Department (represented by the National Parks and Wildlife Service) is the national focal point for Biospheres under UNESCO and is a partner to both Biospheres.<\/p>  <p>  Development within Biospheres is subject to an existing comprehensive legislative and policy planning framework implemented by all levels of government. \u00a0Biospheres are an internationally recognised designation which does not alter these existing frameworks. \u00a0Biosphere Partnerships are not a planning reference body involved in land use planning deliberations or discussions.\u00a0 While they remain neutral on individual developments,\u00a0a Biosphere Partnership may make information available to inform evidence-based discussion, where appropriate. There\u00a0are no additional planning burdens as a consequence of biosphere designations but in some cases areas are already designated as SAC\/SPA and in the case of Kerry, contain National Park land so are already afforded protection.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The original biosphere designation in Kerry centred on Killarney National Park.

As the market developed over the years this treatment resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils, and these rulings were published in Revenue&rsquo;s VAT rates database. The evolution of the scope of the concessionary treatment of certain types of food supplements was well understood by the industry and by agents representing clients in the food supplements sector, and this is reflected in Revenue&rsquo;s correspondence with taxpayers involved in this business and their agents, in its discussions with the Irish Health Trade Association (IHTA) and in the content of its VAT rates database.<\/p>  <p>  In the operation of this concessionary treatment, it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplements that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated, resulting in a situation in which elements in the industry and certain agents aggressively pursued zero rating of all kinds of products, including products claiming to enhance male fertility, promote hair growth, boost tanning, avoid a hangover, build muscle and reduce stress. These businesses consistently challenged Revenue guidance and Revenue decisions on the VAT rating of products giving rise to serious concerns about compliance within the industry and unfair competition between compliant and non-compliant businesses.<\/p>  <p>  The IHTA raised concerns with Revenue about the difficulties in distinguishing between food supplement products which could be zero rated and those which should be standard rated. In response, Revenue undertook a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplements and engaged an expert to advise on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act, 2010. Based on the expert advice and its own legal analysis, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable and engaged with my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018. <\/p>  <p>  I decided not to introduce any legislative changes at that time but as the Deputy may be aware I have committed to putting in place a consultation process to help me identify the policy options in relation to VAT on food supplements and will publish the conclusions in the Tax Strategy Papers later this year.

There are currently 8 universities in the State, the most recent being the establishment of Technological University Dublin under the Technological Universities Act 2018 on 1 January 2019. \u00a0The National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 states that there is no case for the establishment of any new universities in Ireland on the basis set out in Section 9 of the Universities Act 1997. \u00a0The National Strategy states that smaller, stand-alone institutions such as individual Institutes of Technology (IoTs) lack the scale required to deliver necessary advances in quality and efficiency. Universities and IoTs are encouraged to work together collaboratively in regional clusters. <\/p><p>The strategy also recommended consolidation within the IoT sector and a pathway of evolution for consolidated IoTs to allow them to demonstrate significant progress against stated performance criteria and to become multi-campus technological universities (TUs). Government policy as set out in the Programme for Government\u00a0is to support the creation of TUs as higher education institutes (HEIs) of sufficient size, capacity and critical mass to have a significant impact at regional, national and international level. These regional HEIs will have greater links to industry and will have an enormous impact on the capacity to create and retain jobs in regions. As such, Government will prioritise those institutions which have clear ambitions and plans for the furthering of industry-relevant technological research and education. <\/p><p>The Government has provided the enabling legislation in the Technological Universities Act 2018 for two or more IoTs to come together to seek TU status. The Technological Universities Act 2018 which was signed into law on 19 March 2018 provides the legal framework underpinning the process for establishment by two or more IoTs as a TU subject to a decision-making process contingent on the meeting of specified eligibility criteria and including assessment by an international advisory panel. The 2018 Act also sets out the functions and governance requirements for these new HEIs. Section 29 of the 2018 Act provides for the application jointly by two or more institutes to the Minister of Education and Skills for an order seeking designation as a TU. Section 38 of the Act provides that an institution and an established TU may also apply to the Minister for such an order.<\/p><p>Government also continues to support those consortia of IoTs seeking to achieve TU status under the legislation in terms of significant Exchequer co-funding, with the latest funding call for a total of &euro;14 million in respect of TU development and other higher education landscape restructuring projects having issued from the Higher Education Authority on 29 March 2019. <\/p><p>The potential benefits of becoming a successful TU are significant in terms of increased reach, international recognition, research capacity building, FDI attraction, skills retention and creation, regional development, enhanced staff and student experience and opportunities and socio-economic progression. The merging of institutes of technology will create institutions of sufficient size, capacity and critical mass to maximise those benefits and attract greater investment. <\/p><p>TUs will be distinguished by a mission and ethos that is aligned and consistent with the current mission and focus of IoTs with an emphasis on programmes at Levels 6 to 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), industry focused research and the development and use of new knowledge through industry-focused research. However, TUs will also offer post-graduate programmes at Levels 9 and 10 on the NFQ. <\/p><p>TUs will help retain talent in the regions by strengthening the offer available to students who will be able to continue to masters and postgraduate level, including PhDs. Larger management and academic teams permitted by the merger of institutions will increase institutional capacity and will facilitate enhanced performance in areas such as winning research funding. <\/p><p>TUs will also be expected to play a pivotal role in facilitating access and progression particularly through relationships with the further education and training sector. The presence of a technological university in a region, with a specific mandate for promoting regional development, will have a transformative effect on local and regional communities.\u00a0By creating institutions of increased scale and capacity, multi-campus TUs will bring greater social and economic benefits to their regions through a strengthened role in research and innovation and the delivery of a broad range of high quality education and training in each of their campuses. <\/p><p>It is clear from the progress made with existing consortia and from international exemplars that there is very considerable coherence in sectoral and educational offerings that make a single HEI hub both a catalyst and a magnet for regional economic development and employment. The strong regional mission of TUs to support development and innovation is aligned with the objectives of Project Ireland 2040: National Planning Framework.\u00a0Enhanced HEIs will deliver the skilled and talented people that sustain enterprise and new investments.<b><\/b>The National Development Plan 2018 - 2027 cites as a priority the establishment of a clearly prioritised Exchequer-supported higher education building programme including the objective of bolstering the capacity of multi-campus TUs. The current TU development consortia are referenced under Project Ireland 2040 as having a role in deepening the talent pool for distinctive regional clusters and driving research and innovation. TUs will also be well placed to attract increased research funding and to bid for a share of the &euro;4 billion in funding available as part of Project Ireland 2040 over the period 2019 &ndash; 2027 under the four broad themes of rural development, urban development, climate action and disruptive technology. <\/p><p>On 1 January 2019 the first TU in the State, Technological University Dublin, which formerly comprised Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Blanchardstown and Institute of Technology Tallaght, was established under the Technological Universities Act 2018. With some 28,000 students, Technological University Dublin became the largest HEI in the State. <\/p><p>On 12 February 2019 the Munster Technological University consortium, comprising Cork IT and IT Tralee, submitted an application to the Minister for Education and Skills seeking TU status under the 2018 Act. The relevant legislative procedures under the Act are in train in relation to the assessment and decision- making process in relation to this application. <\/p><p>There are two other consortia of IoTs working to develop TU proposals. These are the Technological University for South East Ireland consortium, comprising Waterford IT and IT Carlow, and the Connacht Ulster Alliance, comprising IT Sligo, Galway Mayo IT and Letterkenny IT. These consortia are understood to be working toward the submission of applications for TU designation under the 2018 Act in 2019 and 2020, respectively.<\/p><p>Currently four IoTs - Athlone, Dundalk and Limerick - and the Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art Design and Technology - have not joined or formed a consortium seeking to develop TU proposals. Athlone IoT had previously considered joining a TU development consortium but to date has not chosen to do so.<\/p><p>It remains at the discretion of each individual IoT whether or not it chooses to join an existing consortium, or to form a new consortium, of institutes to progress together towards making an application for TU status under the 2018 Act. \u00a0It is also a matter for the relevant IoTs in a consortium to lead on the progression of their plans to seek designation as a TU under the Technological Universities Act 2018 subject to their individual circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041000071#WRD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Patronage","counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041000071#WRD01100"},{"type":"question","counter":116,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[16794\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041000071#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans in respect of access to a new school (details supplied); and if he will meet a representative group of parents from the Dublin 8 and 12 areas.","asker":"1367","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":117,"content":"<p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I met with the Group in question on the 13th of February and\u00a0we had a very constructive and informative meeting and I would like to\u00a0thank the Group for\u00a0the information they presented to me at the meeting.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy\u00a0will be aware, in November 2016, I announced the patronage of a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school to be established in 2018 to serve the Dublin South City Centre area.\u00a0This new school, which\u00a0will be a co-educational, multi-denominational school under the patronage of Educate Together, will\u00a0serve the Dublin _8 school planning area, along with the Dublin 2_Dublin 4 and Dublin 6_Clonskeagh\u00a0school planning areas as a regional solution.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  More recently, in April 2018, I announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022), including new post-primary schools for areas adjacent to Dublin 8 and Dublin 12 as follows:\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - new 1,000 pupil post-primary school to be established in 2020 as a regional solution to serve the Dublin 6_Clonskeagh and Dublin_6W school planning areas.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - new 600 pupil post-primary school\u00a0to be established in 2021 to serve the Dublin 2_Dublin 4 school planning area.<\/p>  <p>  These new schools will further reduce pressure on schools in the adjacent school planning areas, including the Dublin 8 and 12 areas.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A patronage process, which will be open\u00a0to all patron bodies,\u00a0will be run by my Department to decide who will\u00a0operate these schools.\u00a0 All new schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required to prioritise pupil applications from within the designated school planning area(s) which the school was established to serve.\u00a0 This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area where they have sufficient places. <\/p>  <p>  The requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>  <p>  The existing schools in the Dublin 8 and Dublin 12 areas have significant current capacity to accommodate demand in the area at present.

I will address these, prior to outlining the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process. <\/p><p>My Department understands that a representative of the Archdiocese of Dublin wrote to schools in the Portmarnock, Malahide, Kinsealy and Yellow Walls areas on 5 April last in relation to the consultation that had been undertaken by the Archdiocese with a number of schools under its patronage in these areas.  I understand that this correspondence indicates that any vote which may have been planned by the schools involved should be postponed, pending the publication of the Identification Phase report for this area as part of the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process. My Department intends to publish the Identification Phase reports in the first half of this year.<\/p><p>For clarity, I wish to confirm that in relation to the phase 1 pilot areas, including Malahide\/Portmarnock, the Implementation Phase of the process has not yet commenced.  <\/p><p>Prior to the letter issuing on the 5<sup>th<\/sup>of April, I understand that representatives of the Dublin Archdiocese had been holding meetings with a number of primary schools under their patronage in the Malahide and Portmarnock area to provide information to them on the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process.  Letters\/leaflets received by parents were not based on information provided by my Department.  These letters and leaflets contained incorrect information which led to unnecessary confusion. At no stage did the Department seek to impose any artificial deadline on this process  and there has never been a requirement for any transfer of patronage to take place in September 2019.<\/p><p>Transfer of patronage and consultation with school communities on Reconfiguration is a matter for the current patron (i.e. the Dublin Archdiocesan representatives in the case of the schools under Catholic patronage in Malahide and Portmarnock) in the first instance.  Any concerns or views that parents have in relation to such events should be discussed with the school patron. My Department, as part of this process, is not involved in the selection of any school for reconfiguration. <\/p><p>In relation to the Schools Reconfiguration process, as Deputies are aware, the Programme for Government includes a commitment of reaching 400 multi-\/non-denominational schools in Ireland by the year 2030. The Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity Process is aimed at assisting in achieving this target by transferring existing schools from denominational to multi-\/non-denominational patronage in line with the wishes of the school community. <\/p><p>The process is composed of two separate and distinct phases - the Identification Phase and the subsequent Implementation Phase. The first Identification Phase of the phase 1 pilot process is nearing completion for 16 initial areas nationwide.<\/p><p><b>Identification Phase<\/b><\/p><p>In the Identification Phase, each of the country&rsquo;s 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) have selected an initial pilot area within their district where they consider, based on census data and local knowledge, there is likely to be an oncoming demand for more diversity of patronage within the local educational provision. Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB, while initially having selected Skerries, subsequently revised its selection to Malahide and Portmarnock. <\/p><p>Surveys of parents of pre-school children have been carried out in these areas by the relevant City\/County Childcare Committee on behalf of the ETBs. Template documents were supplied in relation to the surveys. ETBs, having analysed the survey results, then draw up comprehensive reports detailing the outcomes of the surveys in relation to each of the 16 pilot areas. This forms the basis of discussions with the most prevalent patron\/landowner in the area, which is the Catholic Bishop or Archbishop in most cases, concerning the transfer of patronage of an existing school(s) to meet that demand. <\/p><p>The response of the Bishop to any identified oncoming demand for greater diversity of school patronage in the area is included in the report prepared by the ETB, for submission to my Department, which will publish the reports on its website, www.education.ie. Not all of the Identification Phase reports from these 16 initial areas have been finalised. It is envisaged that the reports will be published in the first half of this year. <\/p><p><b>Implementation Phase<\/b><\/p><p>Following the publication of the first round of reports, it is intended that the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process will move into the Implementation Phase.<\/p><p>It is intended that the Implementation Phase would involve the existing patron of the majority of schools in each area, i.e., the relevant Catholic Archbishop or Bishop, consulting with their local school communities on accommodating the oncoming demand for a greater diversity of patronage among the schools in their area. <\/p><p>In the Implementation Phase, the existing patron (the Catholic Archbishop\/Bishop), would identify a school to transfer to a multi-denominational or non-denominational patron (where the Identification Phase report has shown a viable level of demand for greater diversity of patronage). <\/p><p>The process envisages that the identification of a new multi-denominational or non-denominational patron should reflect the wishes of parents and the school community.  It will be up to the relevant school patron (i.e. the Catholic Archbishop\/Bishop) to discuss with their school communities the choices that could be made.  <\/p><p>It is also envisaged that the existing patron would provide information to parents on the multi-denominational\/non-denominational options available and engage in a consultative process with the school community.For example, the existing patron may wish to arrange a meeting where prospective patrons could provide information to the school community. <\/p><p>Draft protocols for the Implementation Phase are at an advanced stage of development and consultation with Catholic Church representatives is ongoing. <\/p><p>I recently had a very constructive meeting with Irish Episcopal Conference representatives in relation to a number of matters including Reconfiguration. The Bishops reiterated their commitment to the Reconfiguration process. Further engagement is planned in this regard and I look forward to working positively with the Bishops on this matter in a spirit of continued partnership.<\/p><p>There are also a number of instances where school communities directly engaged their patron and sought a transfer of patronage to a multi-denominational patron.

The report covers the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:<\/p>  <p>  1. the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and<\/p>  <p>  2. an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.<\/p>  <p>  This report has been completed and was published on the Department of Health website on 21 November 2018.  Preparation of the report involved consultation and engagement with national and international bodies, including the Health Products Regulatory Agency (HPRA); the relevant professional training bodies, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecology (IOG) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI); the Continence Foundation of Ireland (CFI) and the Health Service Executive (HSE), as well as colleagues in other jurisdictions.\u00a0 The report was informed by review of international reports and safety reviews of mesh surgery which have been published in recent years.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The report was informed by the personal experiences and concerns of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery, including through written representations to me and my Department, those concerns raised in Parliamentary Questions on this subject, and the issues raised by the Mesh Survivors Ireland group at its meeting with me on 14 June 2018. I acknowledge the bravery, commitment and dignity shown by the women I met and by those women who have written to me concerning this issue, in sharing what were often harrowing, deeply personal experiences.<\/p>  <p>  The priority issues relating to patient care which were raised by women suffering complications and by others on their behalf are addressed in the report recommendations and are being addressed by the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the views of the many women who have undergone mesh procedures and have had satisfactory outcomes, with minor or no complications, were not formally sought and so are not reflected in this report. Also, following the implementation of a pause in mesh procedures by the HSE in July 2018, a number of women whose procedures were postponed wrote to me and my Department expressing concern at the impact that this is having on them personally as they await treatment for the distressing symptoms of SUI, reflecting another important group of women affected directly by this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The CMO&rsquo;s Report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional SUI and POP procedures. However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women. These are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The Report makes 19 recommendations including:<\/p>  <p>  - the development of patient information and informed consent materials;<\/p>  <p>  - surgical professional training and multidisciplinary expertise in units carrying out mesh procedures;<\/p>  <p>  - the development of clinical guidance;<\/p>  <p>  - the development of information systems to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices;<\/p>  <p>  - ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications; and<\/p>  <p>  - ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of the report&rsquo;s completion, the HSE was requested in May 2018 to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the\u00a0clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications. The HSE was also asked by the Chief Medical Officer on 24 July to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so, until a number of key recommendations are implemented.<\/p>  <p>  A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the HSE, to advise on and progress all of the recommendations.\u00a0 The Group includes three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups to advise on and action all of the recommendations above. The HSE has advised that it is unable to facilitate membership on the Advisory Group to every patient or patient group who has a mesh experience. The NWIHP has sought to have a range of mesh experiences from the patient&rsquo;s perspective represented by a patient advocate on the Group &ndash; including patients who have had mesh with post-operative problems, patients who have had successful mesh surgery and patients who are on the waiting list for a mesh procedure.\u00a0 The HSE advises that women who wish to submit views or submissions to the overall work of the Group should contact the National Women and Infants Health Programme at smi.nwihp@hse.ie.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that\u00a0an ongoing work programme for the development of appropriate patient information resources and consent materials,\u00a0and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications\u00a0is being progressed through this Group.\u00a0The work being progressed by the HSE will include identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services.\u00a0Pending the completion of this, the HSE will also examine the need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any immediate shortfalls identified, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that many women have already engaged with this pathway system and have attended centres for second opinion and follow up appointments.\u00a0 The HSE has published a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information for women suffering complications, which I hope is a useful resource.\u00a0This can be found on the HSE website.<\/p>  <p>  The Secretary General of my Department wrote to the HSE on November 27 2018 to request that it prepare a detailed Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, to be approved by the Leadership Team in the HSE and published on the HSE website within three months of receipt of the report, or sooner if completed. It was also requested that a copy of the Implementation Plan, together with an interim report on the implementation of those recommendations on which work has already commenced, should be submitted to the Department at the time of publication of the Implementation Plan.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that the HSE has advised that the final version of the Implementation Plan will be published on its website and submitted to my Department in coming weeks.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  At my recent meeting with the Mesh Survivors Ireland Group on 7 March 2019 I agreed to continue engagement with them on a pathway forward, to ensure that\u00a0the ongoing clinical management of this patient group is in line with international best practice and emerging evidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041000073#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Charges","counter":207,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041000073#WRG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":208,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[16869\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041000073#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason charges have been implemented in the case of a person (details supplied) when the service user has a free travel pass; if he will instruct the HSE to reverse its decision to implement both charges; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":209,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone.I am disappointed that a number of coal firms have indicated that they would challenge the decision of two former Ministers to expand the smoky coal ban nationwide. Banning the use of smoky coal would have a positive impact on air quality and public health, particularly in built up areas. <\/p><p>I am working with the Attorney General to finalise a legally robust plan which will improve air quality by reducing particulate matter in the air. High levels of particulate matter arise from a number of sources, including the burning of smoky coal. <\/p><p>I have also asked the EPA for a report on air quality in areas not currently covered by the smoky coal ban.  This will provide important evidence which can assist in the development of this legally robust plan.<\/p><p>Pending the completion of this work I am aware of the need to provide clarity now to the public and to the trade to enable them adequately plan for purchases of stock for the 2019\/20 heating season.

This Inclusion Strategy is a cross-Departmental initiative to improve the lives of the Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland.  The development of the Strategy involved a comprehensive public consultation process, including two rounds of public meetings and engagement with Traveller organisations at national level.  Integral to the finalisation of the Inclusion Strategy was the work of the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy Steering Group which has members from relevant Government Departments as well as Traveller and Roma representatives and advocates.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from the consultation process, ten key themes were identified as central to the success of the Inclusion strategy, and two of these relate most directly to employment.<\/p>  <p>  First, the Strategy recognises that &ldquo;there is a very large disparity between Travellers and non-Travellers in the level of education completed&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the labour market disadvantage of Travellers is largely linked to that educational disadvantage.&rdquo;  Accordingly, the Strategy identifies 14 different actions aimed at improving access, participation and outcomes for Travellers and Roma in education in order to achieve outcomes that are equal to those for the majority population.<\/p>  <p>  Employment and the Traveller Economy is also identified as a specific key theme in the strategy and it includes a range of relevant actions.  Within this range of actions, my Department and the Department of  and Skills is committed to delivering and supporting a range of assistive and targeted measures to increase employment, training and apprenticeship opportunities for Travellers and Roma over the long term by:<\/p>  <p>  - Promoting the availability of existing employment and training services to the Roma and Traveller communities and continuing to ensure promotional and information materials on its schemes are available and accessible via the Department&rsquo;s website. Work is underway to support transition of DEASP web content to the new Gov.ie website, with transition to begin in 2019.  All DEASP content on gov.ie will be in an easy-to-read, plain English format.    <\/p>  <p>  - Providing accessible literature on DEASP services. Three plain English booklets  &ndash; Families and Children, Retired and Older People,  Illness and Disability &ndash; are now finalised or nearing completion. Hard copies will be distributed to Traveller representatives for distribution to service users.     <\/p>  <p>  - Providing tailored supports for the long-term unemployed and for young people to build their confidence and prepare them for the workplace;<\/p>  <p>  - Developing targeted initiatives to increase Traveller and Roma engagement with employment and training services;<\/p>  <p>  - Providing Anti-racism and cultural awareness training for staff under the new shared Civil Service learning and development curriculum. <\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring that Travellers and Roma, under the age of 25, who register as unemployed claimants of Jobseekers&rsquo; payments engage with activation case officers on a monthly basis and receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, apprenticeship or traineeship within a period of four months of registering, in line with commitments under the Youth Guarantee.<\/p>  <p>  The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy is a living document, with monitoring of its implementation a key and integral feature of its success.

It was subsequently extended to the acquisition and construction of properties by AHBs and facilitates delivery under the Capital Advance Loan Facility (CALF), the Mortgage to Rent Scheme (MTR), the Housing Agency Acquisitions Fund (HAA) and the Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS). All P&amp;amp;A funding is underpinned by a P&amp;amp;A agreement, which is a template contractual arrangement between an AHB and a local authority setting out the terms under which AHBs make properties available to local authorities for the purpose of providing social housing support. <\/p><p>Under the Department&rsquo;s leasing programme and the RLS, AHBs lease dwellings from private owners, with local authorities providing funding under a P&amp;amp;A agreement to pay the lease payment due to the private owner. The payment to the owner may be up to 80% of market rent, or 85% in respect of apartments with management company service charges. The discount of up to 20% on market rent paid reflects the fact that the owner has no tenancy management or day to day maintenance responsibilities and is paid for vacant periods. Under the P&amp;amp;A agreement, the AHB is responsible for tenancy management and day to day maintenance of the property. Responsibility for structural maintenance and insurance remains with the owner. The AHB collects differential rent from the tenant, in its position as landlord under the Residential Tenancies Acts.
