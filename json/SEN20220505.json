I also want to thank the Cathaoirleach for choosing this important matter.<\/p> <p>Regional aid is an enhanced form of aid that can be provided to enterprises in more economically disadvantaged areas.  It incentivises SMEs and large enterprises to invest in growth and expansion.  Most important, it increases the attractiveness of these areas for investment.  It is an important aid measure for enterprise agencies and to support Irish enterprises to grow and to expand as they attract foreign direct investment into this country.  Grants and other state aid under the regional aid map are funded by the Exchequer.  There is no EU or external funding.<\/p> <p>I have asked the Minister of State to come before the House today because the Athy municipal district was previously in the regional aid map from 2014 to 2022.  Unfortunately, in the map that has been most recently presented to us, the Athy municipal district, along with some municipal districts have been removed.  The explanation as to why that may have happened is beyond many people in the region.  There has been no great enterprise.  There has been no great investment into job creation by the Government in that area since the 2014 announcement.  Indeed, the regional aid, as I have said, is enterprise to encourage investment and job creation in an economically disadvantaged area.<\/p> <p>The Athy municipal district has seen investment in a long-awaited road.  We have been waiting over 40 years for it, but thankfully it has started.  It will revitalise the area of south Kildare.  There is also the issue right across the bottom of south Kildare that we are lacking investment in job creation and we are lacking the criteria to attract investment into that area.  This is the case both for existing businesses and for attracting new businesses into the area.  Over the last period of time, I have been contacted by a number of people who would like to invest in Athy.  I have also used this regional aid map previously to show that there will be something there for there them when they come there.  The fact that Athy has been removed from the regional aid map is worrying to say the least.<\/p> <p>There can be no doubt that American Fruits &amp;amp; Flavor's recent announcement that it will invest in Athy is a positive move.  We also have a number of attractive heritage trails, including the Shackleton Museum and the Athy Blueway, which will see potential for tourists coming to the town.  Unfortunately, though, Athy still has much social deprivation.  It still has many social indexes that we are concerned about.  They should have shown up on the assessments that were done on this regional aid map.<\/p> <p>I worry, too, that the announcement stated that any part of the county that had been previously on the map would still be included on the new map.  However, that has not been the case for the Athy municipal district.  It is also not the case because they have not actually been scored in the new map.  This is because the Government policy is that they are seeking regionally balanced investment.<\/p> <p>I would like to the hear the Minister of State talk today about what the Government is doing regarding investment in that particular area of south Kildare.  What incentives are the Government planning for the area of south Kildare?  We are surrounded by Portlaoise and Carlow.  Both of those electoral areas are included in the regional aid map.  That will cause serious problems for us in attracting investment into the area in which I live.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply, which I am sure will encourage people to invest into south Kildare.  I thank the Minister of State again for taking this Commencement matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050500002#A00700","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1651743000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Wall for tabling this Commencement matter for discussion.  I am happy to address it and to explain to him the reasons and the rationale behind this, as well as to discuss what we are doing with working with the local enterprise offices, LEOs, in Kildare.<\/p> <p>As the Senator will know, the mid-east regional enterprise plan brings together the three counties of Wicklow, Kildare and Meath, to work together with all the business development agencies, LEOs, local authorities, education systems and chambers of commerce.  All of these are involved in promoting counties such as Kildare, Meath and Wicklow in the area of job creation.  It is working with existing companies and with new companies coming in.  I know that the Senator probably read the committee&rsquo;s regional enterprise plan.  I would encourage him to go through it again so that he can see all of the various actions that are set out within it to help to develop jobs in the sector.  He should also look at the plans by Enterprise Ireland and the IDA to bring investment and jobs right throughout the country, hitting all of our counties.  <\/p> <p>At the outset, it should be pointed out that the regional aid map is decided by the European Commission and not by the Government.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In negotiations with the Commission, the Government sought the inclusion of much more of the country.  We will do so again at the mid-term review in 2023 when the data from the census are available.<br\/><br\/>As Senator Wall indicated, it is true that regional aid does not involve any European money or grants and should not be confused with Structural Funds, which Ireland qualified for in the past.  Rather, it limits the amount of regional State aid that the Irish Exchequer can provide to certain geographic areas based on specified criteria.  That is where the issue arises in regard to Athy in County Kildare in terms of the criteria that are set down by the European Commission.<br\/><br\/>The regional aid map for every member state must be developed within coverage levels set by the Commission and criteria laid down in the European Commission's regional aid guidelines, issued in April 2021.  Ireland's economy has shown strength and improvement since 2014, including Senator Wall's county of Kildare.  As a consequence, the European Commission initially proposed to reduce the overall coverage of Ireland's map, as a proportion of total population, to 25.6%.  Following intensive negotiations with the Commission, this was increased to 35.9%.  Of course, we would like it to be higher, but it was a significant improvement on the proposed 25.6%.  This is, however, still a significant reduction of almost one third from the 51.3% which applied previously.  This adjustment was part of a European-wide review and Ireland was not unique in facing a reduction in coverage.<br\/><br\/>With a more limited population coverage, and the strict criteria set by the Commission, it was important that the optimal allocation was achieved.  To achieve this, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, working with stakeholders, including Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, developed a multidimensional model that provided a depth of analysis within the Commission's set criteria.  This was an objective and impartial approach, although final approval of the map, for Ireland and for all member states, rested with the European Commission.  The Commission announced its decision on 22 March 2022.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that areas can only be included on a regional aid map if they meet the Commission's strict criteria.  Conformity to the criteria must be supported by socioeconomic data.  The criteria must be met for contiguous areas at NUTS 2 or NUTS 3 level.  To meet the Commission's criteria for inclusion on the regional aid map, an area needs to have a GDP <i>per capita<\/i>below or equal to the EU-27 average, an unemployment rate above or equal to 115% of the national average, be undergoing major structural change or in serious relative decline.  The socioeconomic data available for Kildare indicates that the county does not meet these criteria.<br\/><br\/>It is important also to recognise that regional aid is only one form of assistance available to enterprises.  Only approximately 7.4% of Ireland's state aid is in the form of regional aid.  There is still plenty of opportunity to work with other companies that want to bring investment and jobs to the Athy area.  Athy can benefit from all other types of state aid that remain available to enterprises, irrespective of their location.  We want to be very clear on that.<br\/><br\/>Senator Wall says he spoke to other companies and interested bodies.  I am very happy to engage with them with him.  If he wishes, he may bring them to the Department or the development agencies, which are very proactive when it comes to any opportunity to create jobs or investment for any part of the country, and they target various areas as well.  From talking to the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, as well about Kildare in general and Athy, I know that there is every opportunity to create jobs there.  Recently, there were some very significant announcements in Athy, and the food hub is very important too.  We must build on the success of those announcements and continue to provide jobs in the area as well.  I thank Senator Wall for his time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050500002#A00800","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651743000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy English, for his reply.  I worry when I see that the indicators for Kildare show an unemployment level that does not conform with the criteria set down.  I am asking about the Athy municipal district, where unfortunately the unemployment rate is higher.  Once again, we have a departmental reply which encompasses the entire county rather than the part of the county to which I refer today.  I am worried about the south of the county.  Parts of County Kildare have terrific employment.  Unfortunately, in the main, we have become a commuter county.  The part of Kildare I am worried about is the Athy municipal district.  We need to attract employment to it.  There is a high unemployment rate there at the moment.<\/p> <p>I have gone through most of the nine criteria set down by the Commission.  I ask that it would look at them again.  The Minister of State referred to the census.  Perhaps in his reply he would indicate that he will look again at the issue when the information is available.  I know that it only equates to 7.5% funding, but every cent of funding for the Athy municipal district would be welcome.

There is no denying that.  However, when we are dealing with European state aid rules, we must fit the criteria and in this case Kildare scores too high, which is a positive in one way, but a negative when we want to secure the funding Senator Wall talks about.  Thankfully, it is only one part of the funding, and it is less than 8% of possible supports to businesses that want to invest and create jobs in Athy.  I have been through this with the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, because he was also concerned.<\/p> <p>As I have said to Senator Wall, we can work with him on a number of other supports to develop and create jobs in the area, right throughout Kildare and in Athy.

If the evidence has changed and is different - not according to Senator Wall's opinion, my opinion or anyone else's opinion - that will give us an argument to make a different case.

I hope I have the right answer to this question because we might have misinterpreted the question here.  If I have the wrong understanding of the question, I would be happy to come back with another answer.  We took it from the question that the Senator was asking about the appeals board and the appeals adjudicator.  If that is not the case, I can certainly come back to her with an updated position.  We worked with both the Department of Health and the Department of Finance to prepare a detailed answer on the matter.<\/p> <p>The Senator mentioned a specific case, although I know she is raising the issue in general for all the people in her area of Limerick.<\/p> <p>The disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme provides relief from VAT and vehicle registration tax up to certain limits, an exemption from motor tax and a grant in respect of fuel on the purchase of an adapted car for transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities.  The relief from value added tax and vehicle registration tax can in some cases be quite generous and rightly so because disabled people need additional assistance, amounting to up to &euro;10,000, &euro;16,000 or &euro;22,000, depending on the level of adaptation required for the vehicle.<\/p> <p>Members of the scheme may claim payment of a fuel grant based on a per litre rate in respect of the mineral oil taxes applying to these products.  An annual maximum of 2,730 l applies in respect of a driver or passenger, and 4,100 l in respect of an organisation.  The fuel grant covers the excise tax elements of petrol, diesel and liquefied petroleum gas, LPG.<\/p> <p>In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a primary medical certificate issued by the relevant senior area medical officer in the HSE or a board medical certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal, DDMBA.  To qualify for a primary medical certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled and satisfy one of the conditions as set out in the Finance Act 1989.  I will not go through them all as I am sure the Senator is aware of them anyway.<\/p> <p>A new Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal is being established following the resignation of all five members of the previous board.  An expression of interest seeking suitable candidates for the board closed on 29 April.  Applications have been received and an assessment process is under way.  Suitable candidates will be recommended to the Minister of Health for nomination and the Minister for Finance will consider any nominees for appointment to the new board.<\/p> <p>Requests for appeal hearings can be sent to the DDMBA secretary based in the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  New appeal hearing dates will be issued once the new board is in place, which will be very soon.<\/p> <p>Claimants already accessing the scheme can continue to do so and assessments for the primary medical certificate by the HSE are continuing to take place.  The Minister for Finance has no role in the granting or refusal of primary medical certificates.  The HSE and the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal must be independent in their clinical determinations.<\/p> <p>In addition, the Minister for Finance gave a commitment that a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, would be undertaken.  The Minister is working on this matter with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman.  They have agreed that review should be brought within a wider review under the auspices of the national disability inclusion strategy, NDIS, to examine transport supports encompassing all Government-funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities.  The Ministers believe that this is the most appropriate forum to meet mutual objectives in respect of transport solutions and mobility supports for those with a disability.<\/p> <p>In this regard, it should be noted that the NDIS transport working group, chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, had its first meeting on 26 January 2022.  A stocktaking exercise of existing transport and mobility schemes currently supporting people with disabilities is ongoing ahead of the next meeting of the group.  The issue was also discussed at the most recent meeting of the NDIS steering group on 13 April, which included input from stakeholders.  The outcome of this review and any recommendations will be brought to the Government for its consideration.  I hope that will happen soon and we can get some movement in the area.<\/p> <p>With all that, I hope I have covered the answer the Senator was looking for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050500002#C00200","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1651743000,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed response.

The Construction Instruction Federation has highlighted the considerable impact hyperinflation is having across the building industry.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland has shown that the annual rate of construction inflation was 13.4% during 2021.  Increasing materials and energy prices have been the driving forces behind the increasing costs since early 2021.  When there appeared to be a brief decrease in inflation at the end of last year, the war in Ukraine swiftly caused prices to soar again and it is believed the prices will continue to rise throughout this year.<\/p> <p>A multitude of issues, including the pandemic, high demand, supply shortages, delivery delays, the long-lasting impacts of Brexit and the war, have led to an increase in materials costs, a shortage of materials and a labour shortage for the construction industry.  Ultimately, such inflation increases the possibility of contractors being unable to tender for projects and even in some cases becoming insolvent.<\/p> <p>There is a case to be made for an effective price variation clause to be included in all new public works contracts and a mechanism to be applied retrospectively for projects that are under way.  No one who signed a contract two or three years ago could have foreseen the level of cost inflation that has taken place in the interim.  There are implications for projects already under construction.  It may become uneconomical for some contractors involved to complete their work without becoming insolvent.  There is a possibility that contractors will be unwilling to tender for public contracts because of this issue.<\/p> <p>I will give a few examples of price inflation in construction.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The cost of a tonne of rolled steel has risen to &euro;1,500, which is up by &euro;600 since mid-February, an increase of 65%.  There has been a 50% rise in the price of rebar, which has jumped from &euro;900 to &euro;1,350 per tonne in just the last four weeks.  The cost of copper cable has increased by 31% while certain types of steel are simply no longer available.  The cost of some deliveries, particularly of electronic controls and lighting equipment, has increased by up to 100%.  These extra costs may have serious implications for future and current public works projects including the national development plan and Housing for All.  With regard to the national retrofit scheme, it is estimated that the cost of insulation products has increased by 35% in recent times.  That puts a question mark over that entire project.<\/p><p>Apart from the Government-backed schemes under Housing for All, the retrofit scheme and the national development plan, inflation in the cost of building materials has the potential to stall many one-off housing projects, as I mentioned in the House last week.  Builders seem to have reached a point at which their budgets simply cannot go any further.  Housing associations also need help.  They need a bit of flexibility to ensure that contracts are fulfilled and much-needed housing delivered.<\/p><p>I understand the importance of protecting taxpayers' money.  It is public money and the Minister of State and the Government have a duty to ensure it is not wasted.  However, perhaps some flexibility could be shown as a result of the &euro;2 billion capital underspend in 2020 and 2021 that arose because of the pandemic.  That might allow for some space to manoeuvre on price variation clauses.  It is clear that something needs to be done in this regard.  It is not a question of whether we can afford to do this, but of whether we can afford not to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050500002#C00600","speaker":"1658","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651743000,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Gallagher for raising this issue.  It is very important.  We can all see the effects of inflation in costs in every part of construction throughout the country.  We also want to protect the public capital investment plans we have made and rolled out under Housing for All, Project Ireland 2040 and others.  There is to be a great amount of capital expenditure, over &euro;10 billion a year, for the next ten or 11 years.  It is important that we get the most out of that funding, stretch it and get the infrastructure delivered.<\/p> <p>I am taking this debate on behalf of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.  I will outline some issues in response to the Senator's raising of the issue of construction inflation.  There have been significant and sustained increases in the prices of a broad range of commonly used materials in the construction sector throughout 2021 in the aftermath of the pandemic.  The Senator has outlined some of these.  Energy prices also showed marked increases in 2021 and have further escalated in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Both represent significant input costs for construction projects and inflation is a risk that contractors have been expected to bear under capital works management framework public works contracts for a defined period.  <\/p> <p>These inflationary provisions have operated effectively over the years since their introduction, albeit in times of relative price stability.  However, the price movements experienced on construction materials over the past 12 months have arisen suddenly and with no warning.  In response to this challenge, the Minister and the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, introduced a series of measures in January of this year to address the risk posed.  The OGP issued procurement guidance in November 2021 to assist public bodies in managing the challenges they face in concluding live tenders.  With reference to future tenders, the OGP published interim amendments to the provisions in the public works contracts on 7 January 2022.  Within certain parameters, these amendments will reduce the level of risk of exceptional materials price inflation that contractors will have to bear, while also enabling the Exchequer to obtain cost reductions should exceptional price reductions occur during the course of the works.  The measures are designed to encourage confidence in the tender process and to mitigate overprovision for price inflation in tender prices.  However, as the Senator has said, these changes do not fully cater for the fuel and energy price increases and supply chain disruptions which have arisen since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  The pre-existing provisions for inflation contained in the public works contracts published prior to 7 January 2022 continue to apply as these were the terms entered into by the parties. <\/p> <p>The OGP has been monitoring the inflation pressures faced by contractors, particularly with respect to the recent sharp increase in energy prices, and is engaging with stakeholders, including industry and public sector contracting authorities.  The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, recently had a meeting with representatives from the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, at which the issue of contracts that were awarded prior to January 2022 was raised.  The CIF advised that contractors who tendered with no knowledge of the inflationary pressures which have arisen since February 2021 are particularly exposed and are not in a position to absorb the increased cost of materials which have, in some cases, more than doubled in price since they submitted their tenders.  In addition to its impact on energy prices, the war in Ukraine will further increase the cost of building materials.  At the conclusion of the meeting, I understand that the Minister asked his officials in the OGP to prepare options to mitigate the risk posed to projects where contractors can no longer bear the increased cost of materials.  In reviewing the options, the Minister will consider the available evidence and the potential impacts they will have on costs and the ability to deliver the wider national development plan while maximising value for money for the taxpayer.  <\/p> <p>It is vital that public works contracts remain a viable proposition for contractors with whom we partner in the delivery of the plan, whether in respect of housing, roads or any other infrastructure.  The Minister is also engaging with key capital spending Departments and bodies to gain their perspective on the issues that are being raised with him.  I see that we have a school group with us so I will note that this includes investment in our educational facilities across primary, secondary and third level because, while a large sum has been set aside to be invested, it is very important that all projects can be fulfilled and delivered.  We must protect our investment in the infrastructure we want, including schools, hospitals and roads, but we must also help to protect the jobs and companies involved.  That is the work the Minister, Deputy McGrath, in involved in.  I will be able to update the Senator at an appropriate time in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050500002#D00200","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1651743000,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I welcome our visitors to the Gallery today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050500002#D00300","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1651743000,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I also extend a c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte to our visitors.

I have been advised Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's operational fleet is currently fully deployed on scheduled services, in line with the prevailing passenger demand.  The current capacity on the rail network is primarily based on demand levels pre-Covid, when rapid growth in demand resulted in the use of 100% of larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's operational fleet at peak times.

An initial order of 95 electric and battery-electric carriages for the DART+ fleet was placed in December 2021, with up to 75 carriages to be ordered over the coming decade.  It is expected the first 95 carriages will arrive from mid-2024, entering service on the rail network from 2025.  These 95 carriages will comprise 30 electric carriages, which will be deployed on existing DART services, and 65 battery-electric carriages, which will be deployed on the northern commuter services.  This additional rolling stock will free up existing commuter and intercity carriages for use on other routes on the rail network.<\/p> <p>As the Senators will be aware, the strategic rail review, undertaken in co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland, will inform the development of interurban, interregional rail on the island of Ireland over the coming decades.

I understand the average daily rate for Covid-19 has dropped to under 1,000 over the past 14 days.  Concerns remain about future variants and the direction of the trend but we are almost three months into the Government decision to lift almost all restrictions across society and the economy.  Yet, across most of the 19 maternity units, the policy restricting partners from attending some appointments remains in place.  I ask the Minister of State to provide us with an urgent update on that policy.  As recently as yesterday, the National Maternity Hospital announced that partners are now welcome to attend all appointments.  That is very welcome.<\/p> <p>Women have been telling us stories, particularly in recent weeks, and there is a degree of shock when people learn the restrictions are still in place.  In recent weeks, we have heard of the experiences of people attending the Rotunda and Coombe hospitals, where partners were prevented from attending certain scans and appointments.  One woman was told her partner could not even wait outside.  In another case, a partner was prevented from attending a foetal anomaly clinic.  Receptionists and sonographers are conveying different messages about whether a partner can attend at different appointments.  One woman received bad news alone.  Over the past two years, and up to last week, one hospital has been issuing a note to every woman coming into antenatal classes telling them they cannot communicate directly with the medical professionals or that they may not be guaranteed individual access to a medical professional.  That has created all sorts of needless distress and confusion.<\/p> <p>It is almost 12 months to the day since the Minister for Health announced that all Covid maternity restrictions would be lifted, on 11 May last year.  That did not happen.  Over the past two years, the Better Maternity Care campaign has very powerfully highlighted the stress and trauma associated with some of the restrictions that were put in place.  It has shone a light on the restrictions that remain in place to this day.  This group has been seeking a meeting with the HSE since the new year and that has not happened.  There was engagement between the HSE and the campaign last year but that has fallen away since the new year.<\/p> <p>It is important to acknowledge that many maternity units are often operating under difficult conditions, and flexibility has been afforded to some in high-risk pregnancies, but the reality is there is no clear message and there is inconsistency between one hospital and the next.  While we accept that hospitals have a right to have individual visitor and infection control policies, partners are not visitors.  Partners are a vital support to women when they are going through pregnancy and childbirth.  I want a firm commitment from the Minister of State that, over the next fortnight, the HSE will update its partner restriction policy across the 19 maternity units and restrictions will be lifted, unless there is strong and very clear clinical evidence to the contrary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050500002#F00300","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1651743000,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Sherlock for raising an issue that has been of significant concern for women and their partners.  I fully appreciate that limitations on partners accessing maternity services have been very difficult for women and their families during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The current version of the HSE guidance on access to acute hospitals for nominated support partners in maternity services was implemented on 21 February 2022.  The guidance recognises the central role the nominated support partner plays in supporting and advocating for a woman engaging with our maternity services.  It recognises that such a support person also has a right to be present and participate in the care process to the greatest practical degree.<\/p> <p>Maternity services are focused on maximising access for nominated support partners in the context of the current guidance.  The objective of the guidance is to keep maternity services safe, support the woman and facilitate access for the nominated support partner.  The clinical advice has always been focused on the potential for Covid-19 to spread in maternity services, and the highest priority is protecting the health and safety of the women and babies in our care.  While guidance remains in place, it is important to recognise that it is a very different situation now from the position in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The HSE's guidance has significantly reduced limitations on access for nominated support partners.<\/p> <p>The latest guidance again sets out that controls on access for support partners should be the minimum required to manage infection prevention and control risks, and any limitations on access must be clearly explained and should be applied with consideration for individual circumstances and needs.  The guidance specifics that once a woman reaches her bed space or room, the nominated partner should have open access between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m.  The guidance is quite broad in its scope, facilitating access for partners where women are attending antenatal scans, during labour and childbirth, during postnatal care and on arrival for labour or induction of labour during the initial assessment process.  I am happy to inform the Senator that the HSE is currently reviewing the clinical guidance on the remaining access limitations as the recent surge in cases shows signs of reducing.<\/p> <p>The HSE has advised that every possible effort continues to be made to provide maximum access for nominated support partners in maternity settings.  Women are encouraged to raise any concerns pertaining to partner access and every effort is being made to address those concerns.  Information on websites is reviewed and updated regularly to reflect any adjustments in access, and risk assessments are undertaken in circumstances where it is not possible to comply with the current guidance.<\/p> <p>I assure the Senator that the decisions to restrict attendance in maternity hospitals were not taken lightly.  The HSE has assured the Department that every effort continues to be made to maximise access for partners in maternity services and the guidance on remaining access limitations is currently under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050500002#F00400","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1651743000,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I had a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>when listening to the Minister of State's response.

Based on the stories women have told me or communicated to others and the Better Maternity Care campaign, we know the reality is different from what the Minister of State has set out.  I ask that the clinical lead within the HSE for women's healthcare and Dr. Colm Henry now engage both with the Department of Health and those advocating on women's behalf on the ground to ensure, first, that what the Minister of State has set out is being implemented and, second, that there is further progress in lifting those restrictions.

He is great for coming in here and taking the heat but he is the Minister of State with responsibility for public health and well-being so my Commencement matter is relevant to his role as well as that of the Minister for Health.<\/p> <p>I want to raise an issue that concerns cervical smear tests.  There have been improvements thanks to great pioneers like Vicky Phelan and others but we have some way to go.  Several women have contacted me to tell me that they have experienced a huge amount of stress caused by delays in getting results after they had an initial cervical smear test, and they experienced further delay, in cases where there were irregularities, in getting an appointment for a colposcopy procedure or have irregular cells removed and discover the final diagnosis.<\/p> <p>A few women have told me that they had to wait over five months.  As a woman who has had a cervical smear test and irregular cells were discovered, I know that as soon as one is told irregular cells have been found one automatically thinks cancer, and one continues to think like that until one is told that it is not cancer.  So that is a stressful situation.<\/p> <p>Every year in Ireland over 12,000 women are diagnosed as having irregular cells following a cervical smear test so that is 1,000 women a month or between 30 and 40 women every day.  Therefore, every month 1,000 women must endure this stress until they get a final result.  Targets have been set out but I could not find out whether we have reached them.  It seems to me that most women still must wait between four and five months before getting the all-clear or find out that they need a further procedure or procedures.<\/p> <p>In Ireland, the State provides a test, which is very good.  Women should get tested every three years if aged between 25 and 29 years and every five years if aged between 30 and 65 years.  There is a national screening programme where 295,000 women annually are screened, which is a much better target than in previous years.  Unfortunately, I was unable to find up-to-date figures and cited the figures for 2020.  <\/p> <p>People still must wait.  In some cases, the consultants have the results but if they go on holidays or take a break for a few weeks, which they are entitled to do, the test results sit on their desks and there is nobody in place to convey the test results.  A few women have contacted me to tell me that they had waited for weeks and I made representations on their behalf so their results were taken off the desk of the consultant, who had gone on holidays, and brought to light so the women got their results.  That is not my job.  I should not have to help people to gain access to their medial results.  It is the job of the HSE, clinicians and consultants to deliver results to women.<\/p> <p>I do not know who is to blame for delays and it probably is not the fault of consultants.  A woman told me that the reason for the delay in her case was that her consultant had the results but went on holidays.  That poor woman was in bits because she thought she might have cancer and every single day she waited for her results.  Partly due to me making inquiries she got her results quicker than she would have if she had not contacted me.  Speeding up medical results is not our job as politicians.  We make inquiries because we want to take care of constituents although the woman I mentioned was not even from County Clare.  There is something radically wrong if people are left in a situation where they lose sleep because their results are on a desk because somebody has gone on holidays.  That is not right.<\/p> <p>I want to touch on targets and ask a couple of questions that the Minister of State might answer today or follow up.  How can long waiting times for such a worrying diagnosis be justified?  Let us think of the day-to-day worry that these women have experienced every step of the way.  What is the procedure for continuing the CervicalCheck workload for consultants when they go on leave so that test results do not end up sitting on a desk?  How many people await screening results?  How many people await colposcopy results?  Who conducts the tests for the State?  Is it private companies?  Who does the tests?  Is the testing conducted inside or outside the State?  If the State is paying can faster turnaround times be demanded?<\/p> <p>The HSE and the Government have set target times as follows: the results of smear tests should be four weeks; an appointment for a colposcopy should be eight weeks, which is still a long time; and results for colposcopy should be four weeks.  So the waiting time should not be five or six months.  Have these targets been met?  I ask because I could not find out that information.  I look forward to the response of the Minister of State to this worrying issue that affects half of the population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050500002#G00400","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speech","time":1651743000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to update the House on this important matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  Both the Minister and I are fully committed to supporting our population screening programmes which are a valuable part of our health service.  I am pleased to say that the CervicalCheck programme is back screening at pre-COVID-19 levels.   Furthermore, by the end of 2021, CervicalCheck had screened the same amount of people as in any other two-year period.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the effort made by the staff in CervicalCheck, primary care services and GPs along with the laboratory services in achieving this level of activity despite the difficulties they faced.  This positive situation is also testament to the women across the country who took up their screening invitations and attended for this important test.  Importantly, the focus of the resumption of cancer screening services includes the management of capacity across the whole of the screening pathway, which includes follow-up assessments and treatments.<\/p> <p>In terms of colposcopy, it is important to acknowledge the effects that Covid-19, the May 2021 cyberattack on the HSE and the December 2021 cyberattack on the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital had on these clinics.  I am pleased that the latest data on colposcopy attendance, from March 2022, show that the majority of people are being seen within the programme's target timeframes.  In terms of colposcopy attendance at University Hospital Limerick, the latest figures in March 2022 show that this applies here also, with 100% of urgent and high-grade referrals seen well within the set targets.  There is ongoing work to continue to build capacity in the services to ensure that this remains the case, and further improve timeframes for low-grade referrals that are currently slightly outside national targets.<\/p> <p>While it is understandable that waiting for any test results is a worrying time for anyone, it is important to emphasise the fact that colposcopy identifies abnormal cells and is not a cancer diagnosis in the first instance.  In most cases, it takes between ten and 15 years for a human papillomavirus, or HPV, infection to cause abnormal cells to develop into cervical cancer.  In addition, cervical cancer is a rare outcome of a HPV infection.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Health and I want to ensure that we have world-class cancer screening programmes in which the people of Ireland can have confidence.  This commitment was shown with the allocation of an additional &euro;10 million in 2021 for cancer screening services in the HSE national service plan, and continues this year to progress with service developments.  This investment represented a real dedication to improving cancer outcomes in Ireland through the early detection of disease.<\/p> <p>The Government is committed to ensuring that Ireland has a robust cervical screening service, which will enable our progress towards the ultimate goal of eliminating cervical cancer.  Importantly, CervicalCheck made the technical transition to HPV cervical screening in 2020.  This means that Ireland has joined a small group of nations that employs best-in-class testing to screen their populations for cervical cancer.  Ireland can look forward to a significant reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer cases over the next ten to 20 years.<\/p> <p>The Senator mentioned that issues arise when consultants or whoever go on holidays.

Despite what the Minister of State is being told, we are not meeting the targets.<\/p> <p>There is no problem with getting the initial cervical smear done, thanks to brilliant CervicalCheck services and GPs around the country doing a great job.  The first part is no problem but, unfortunately, while there is good uptake, all of those women must then wait on results.  As I said, 12,000 women have a diagnosis of irregular cells every year.  While most of those cases do not involve cancer, women cannot help but worry.  When a woman is told she has irregular cells she cannot remove that knowledge or the worry about the possibility that these cells are cancerous.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State said, early intervention is key.  It is very important that we give women the confidence to go ahead and start the experience.  They are afraid to start in case they find out something negative and must wait in worry for six months.

All was going well and the children are settling in as best they can under the circumstances and the school and teachers are dealing with the situation as best they can as well.  They are travelling from a hotel about 14 km away and one of the parents was accompanying them on the bus from the hotel to the school in order to ensure there would be somebody there with the language skills to deal with the bus driver if anything were to happen.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, the school was contacted this morning by Bus &Eacute;ireann to tell it the parent can no longer travel on the bus with the students, even though she is the mother of one of them, and that that is now company policy.  Since then, I have raised this through the T&aacute;naiste's Department to bring it up the line because it does not make sense to me.  I am not sure whether it is an issue of insurance or one of child protection, even though the parent is Garda-vetted, as one would expect given she also works in the local school in a voluntary capacity to deal with her own child and the students from Ukraine.

I am aware the Minister is looking at a whole independent review, as I understand it, of the board.  There needs to be more than just looking at the board.  There are management issues within IFI.  There are issues that are happening that are being brought to the board belatedly, including, for example, 16 uninsured company vehicles on the road, one of which has been involved in a crash.  The cost of that has not been established.<\/p> <p>There has been locally-arranged leasing of Ashleigh Lodge, which was an IFI property, to a staff member as a guest house with no transparency process or financial accounts.  There was inappropriate disbursal of Dormant Accounts Fund moneys, allocation to an angling club that did not exist and other matters as well.  Again, IFI is a central body.  Centralising it was not the right move.  There is now a dissociation between central management and the work needed on the ground.

As the Kremlin spokesperson put it, it would turn both Ireland and Britain into a nuclear desert.  While I think the idea is farcical and outside the realms of what is scientifically possible given the Russians do not possess such weapons, it gives us an insight into their intent and what their next steps might be.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Tom Clonan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=TomClonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->My fear is that deprived of a conventional victory in Donbas and certainly having been pushed back from Kyiv, Putin along with his administration and those who empower him may consider the use of tactical nuclear missiles.  Unlike the weapon that the Russians purported to possess, they do possess 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons and have deployed 1,500 of them.  All the talk thus far has been about supplying weapons to Ukraine, with which I agree, to support the Ukrainians in their resistance against the Russians.  However, we now need to begin to talk about de-escalation and bringing this conflict to a halt.  We need to have a ceasefire.<\/p><p>This is a standard conventional conflict and, in the past, the United Nations has been able to suggest very robust Chapter 7 interventions to create a buffer zone with the agreement of all parties.  We need to look for that.  The UN Security Council needs to push this line.  The UN Secretary General, Mr. Guterres, is in Nigeria today, but with the risk of nuclear escalation and a war that none of us wants to find ourselves in, this is what we should be pushing for.  That would allow for a full and proper investigation of war crimes in Kharkiv, Irpin, Kherson, Mariupol and so on.  The House should debate the alternatives to just sending weapons, and work on ways of constructing a ceasefire and getting a good robust UN intervention to bring a halt to the killing and prevent escalation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050500002#K00600","speaker":"1699","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651743000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I welcome the Cathaoirleach's remembering the tragic victims in Cork 100 years ago.  I remind colleagues that today also represents the 41st anniversary of the death of Bobby Sands, a great man.  It is important to remember him today, particularly as our brothers and sisters in the North go to vote in a crucial election.<\/p> <p>The Limerick Shannon metropolitan area strategy plan was published last week.  It is hard to put into words the amount of frustration that people have expressed to me on this issue.  The northern distributor road, a key part of Limerick's infrastructure, has been effectively dropped by the Green Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  This is particularly tragic because after a major battle locally, involving people in Moyross aided by my colleague, Deputy Quinlivan, we managed to get the Coonagh to Knockalisheen road almost built; it will be completed in the coming months.  That road effectively will now go to nowhere because the northern distributor road will not be built.  The northern distributor road is absolutely key to opening up Moyross and encouraging industry into an area that has been neglected for too many years.  Once again it has been let down by Government.  I am disappointed with Government politicians effectively blaming the Green Party.  While a Green Party Minister made the decision, of course, there is collective Cabinet responsibility.  This is a Government decision which effectively puts road infrastructure in Limerick on hold.<\/p> <p>The rest of the plan contains many good things, including promises relating to rail and bus, but they are very vague and aspirational.  For example, there is a call for another feasibility study for a spur to Shannon Airport.  The first time that was raised was in 1997.  Some 25 years later, we are still looking at feasibility plans.  The language in the area plan is the language of let us examine this, let us look at the feasibility of that.  It begs the question as to what the Government has been doing for the last two years.  We are nearly at the halfway point of this Government.  Limerick is effectively on hold.  There is talk of transport possibilities but nothing concrete.<\/p> <p>A key part of our infrastructure has effectively been denied by the Government.  It is not good enough for the people in Limerick and there is considerable frustration related to that.  This has added to the ongoing issues with Limerick hospital, which was raised again yesterday.  Things are getting worse rather than better and we have had to deal with this for years.  As things stand it is very unlikely that we will have a motorway between Limerick and Cork; it is more likely to be a regional dual carriageway.  This is another failure in terms of developing the western corridor to ensure we have a proper counterbalance to Dublin.  I feel that Limerick has effectively been put on hold by this Government when it comes to key infrastructure projects.  It is not good enough and I am calling for an urgent debate on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050500002#L00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1651743000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business that No. 19, the Right to Flexible Work Bill 2022, be taken before No. 1.  Those of us who talk to people in our communities know of the enormous demand for flexible work arrangements among those who work and those who want to work but cannot work because of various structural barriers in their lives such as the cost of childcare and inflexibility of hours.  This particularly applies to those who are lone parents or have a disability.  This is borne out by a number of CSO surveys, particularly the pulse survey last November which showed that 88% of all workers are looking for flexible work arrangements.<\/p> <p>The question for us, as legislators, is how we should respond to that demand and ensure there is a strong legal framework to promote and protect flexible work.  We know from the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Government's right to request remote work Bill 2021 that it is not fit for purpose.  The extensive and sweeping nature of the 13 grounds for refusing a request, the 26-week waiting period and the failure to allow any appeal have all been roundly criticised by many of those appearing before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, particularly Grow Remote, Glofox, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions along with Deputies and Senators from across the political spectrum who want a better and stronger legal framework for flexible work arrangements in this country.<\/p> <p>We are introducing this Bill today on a right to flexible work on the basis of having talked to a number of groups.  We recognise that this is important for those who want to stay in their jobs, those who do not want to reduce working hours because of caring responsibilities or because of other issues going on with their lives, and also to tap into all those who want to work but cannot work.  The Disability Federation of Ireland, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, SPARK and the unions have all given input into our legislation which would effectively give a right to flexible work from the first day of employment and make flexible work a default and not the exception or a perk for good behaviour after 26 weeks.  It should be a right for all workers and not just those with caring responsibilities, as has been set out in the work-life balance Bill that the Government plans to introduce.  We know that thousands of people commute long distances and no longer want to commute five days a week.  We know that thousands of people have been forced to move house because of the housing crisis in the city and throughout the country.<\/p> <p>We are introducing the First Stage today and hope to be able to take Second Stage in the coming months.  We hope that the Government, as it has claimed over the past two months, will introduce improvements to its right to request remote work Bill.  As of now, we have not seen anything in that regard.

This is especially the case as it relates to the transition of language, communication and the spoken language of English.  It is so important they have the ability and the educational support that is necessary to continue their native tongue while they are here, but also that they have the great opportunity to learn another language.  What an opportunity.  Children absorb like a sponge.  They will be able to speak fluent English in 12 months.  That is the reality of it.  I would have loved to have had that opportunity.  This is a crisis, but there is a different opportunity coming out of the crisis.  It is really important we put supports in place.  The education and training boards, ETBs, are potentially a place where this can happen within local communities.

I have been contacted by families across Galway city and county who want to and need to avail of this programme but are not sure they will be able to.  This is because only 28% of the schools operated the programme last summer, and that figure is not expected to change significantly this summer.  A number of parents have advised me of this.<\/p> <p>To provide some data and facts, of the 8,018 children who have been enrolled in special schools in 2021, just 1,641, or approximately 20%, had any access to the July provision, which is now named the summer programme.  Just 5% of those children - 410 pupils - received the full allocation of four weeks.  Just 410 pupils received the full four-week allocation of last year&rsquo;s summer programme.  Departmental data shows that just eight special schools in Ireland did the full allocation of four weeks, including two hospital schools.  A further 31 special schools did between one and three weeks.<\/p> <p>The Department states parents can avail of the home-based option if their school is not participating.  While this is factually correct, the Department itself acknowledges that home-based programmes are considered the least effective way to deliver the scheme.  Families advise that in addition to home tutors not being as effective, it is almost impossible to find a home tutor.  Many families do not try because it merely creates further stress in their lives.  These families are in extraordinarily difficult situations that those who do not have experience in cannot begin to understand.  They should be the top priority for supports.<\/p> <p>It is a relatively small cohort that is being spoken about here.  Of the total school population of 1 million, only 8,108 are in special schools, with a further 8,500 in special classes.  Whatever needs to done should be done to ensure these families have effective supports, whatever the cost.  A country is judged on how those most vulnerable are treated.

They have recently set up the Drive Virtual Driving Academy.  I had a good opportunity to try it out.  It is incredible and is exactly what I said: a virtual driving academy.  It gives people the option to learn how to drive a car virtually a couple of times before having to go out on the road for the first time, whether they are 16, 17, 18 or 19 and learning how to drive, an older person in life or, as in some situations I have seen, a person coming back from a very severe medical situation such as a brain haemorrhage where it is difficult to learn how to drive again and it can be daunting to get back into a car on the road for the first time.  The concept of virtual driving is that it is bespoke, realistic, impressive and gives a really good feel for it.  It allows people to build up their confidence virtually and in a safe manner before going out onto the road themselves.  It is a good idea and is something for the future.

It would make our roads a lot safer and would make people more confident and at ease.  Niamh and Paul Brady are pioneering this technology.

There are two Bills on the Order Paper that aim to lower the voting age to 16 and 17 for local and European elections.

With the additional problems of Brexit and logistical problems caused by Covid, many customers are receiving calls from their pharmacies telling them that there is a delay with their usual brand of medication.  Pharmacies are also ringing customers' GPs to discuss alternative options.  Many patients are worried about such changes and, for a number of reasons, some simply cannot take a different brand.  We have all listened to reports of the ongoing and unacceptable problems with the availability of hormone replacement therapy medications that are currently affecting the daily lives of many women in this country.  I ask the Leader to convene a debate in this Chamber on this significant and growing problem for many patients and their pharmacies.  I ask her to invite the Minister for Health to the House to discuss this very important matter further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050500002#N01200","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1651743000,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I had reason to write to the Cathaoirleach and the Ceann Comhairle last week with regard to the treatment of my colleague, Senator Keogan, at a recent committee meeting.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

It is extremely worrying.  Yesterday, I saw the Chair of a committee say at the end of a piece by somebody who was at the committee that the contribution would be struck from the record.  Nobody can strike the utterances that are made in a parliamentary democracy from any record at any time.  It is becoming rather serious.  In some cases, I would go as far as to say that it is bullying in the workplace, and that is something that would be of concern to me.

We do not know what the outcome will be, but we are clear on one thing, that is, that there are significant structural problems within the political system in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>I want to draw the House's attention to an article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>by a unionist commentator, Newton Emerson.  He makes a fair point which we should look at: that the votes of those people who vote for non-aligned groups in Northern Ireland - non-nationalist or non-unionist parties - effectively are devalued because the people whom they elect labour under the disadvantage that they are second-class citizens when it comes to determining who becomes First Minister and deputy First Minister or whether an administration is formed in Northern Ireland at all.  That is something we must address.<\/p><p>I would like to have the opportunity to discuss that.  Whether the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, or Sinn F&eacute;in is the largest party - who knows how it will all end up - nobody in Northern Ireland should have a veto.  Nobody should be in a position, in the case of the DUP, to withhold consent to the creation of an administration.  Nobody in Sinn F&eacute;in should be in a position to procure the suspension of the arrangements on issues such as the Irish language.  We need a more robust democracy in Northern Ireland.  I would very much appreciate if the Leader could arrange a reflective discussion on the outcome of the Assembly elections when the dust has settled, and the votes have all been counted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050500002#O01000","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"speech","time":1651743000,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.  I am calling for a debate on the World Health Organization pandemic treaty and its implications for Ireland's future freedoms and autonomy in responding to a health crisis, as well as the European Parliament's attitude towards a joint armed force and its implications for our time-honoured neutrality.  We need to be talking about the big-picture stuff in this Chamber.  We do help local councillors in liaising with the Government and aid them in their service of the people of Ireland.  We are happy to do that, but in addition to legislating, we should also be looking into the future and beyond our borders, examining our role in the grand scheme of things so as not to get caught out and off guard.  It is important that we speak about these important issues in advance.  It is not good enough to hastily edit a weekly schedule to take account of a landmark international shift happening in the next week or so.<\/p> <p>It seems increasingly the case that whenever someone tries to shine a light on what is coming down the line, there is a heightened risk of having the truth of his or her claims disputed in this Chamber.  Accusations of false information and untruths abound, despite section 425 of the salient rulings of the chair detailing that it has been ruled as disorderly to state that a Member was telling untruths.  This is typical of post-2016 western discourse where disinformation and fake news have become labels slapped on just about anything people disagree with, do not want to talk about or simply are not aware of themselves.  It cheapens and dilutes the effects of the words and the idea behind them and has rendered them practically useless in combating real propaganda.<\/p> <p>If I were to say, for example, that the European Parliament is planning mandatory school training in fake news, or that it is also planning to allow a European joint armed force, which could be deployed overseas, some could hear these sentences and think that sounds like a conspiracy theorist, but they are actually proposals adopted last month by the European conference plenary, which parliaments voted to support on Friday.  It is important that we can address these issues in the comprehensive and critical manner befitting the House.  I once again ask for a debate on these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050500002#O01100","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1651743000,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I am conscious that we have a guest, who is of this House, but is present for our launch of Seanad 100.

There are some 450 delegates and some good speakers, and it will be an opportunity for us to re-engage with the farming community this weekend.<\/p> <p>Senator Keogan asked for a debate on the WHO treaty.  That is no problem.  I will organise it in the next couple of weeks.  To reassure her, certain things get brought up at European Council meetings and by the Commission, but we always have our veto, so we are sovereign in what we decide to do.  Notwithstanding anything Senator McDowell has said, that there should not be a veto in certain fora, we have a veto at the European Council and the European Commission and we will not be afraid to use it.<\/p> <p>Senator McDowell asked for a reflective debate in the coming weeks on the outcome of the Assembly election in Northern Ireland.  I will arrange that, notwithstanding the sensitivities and the fact that we all want to make sure we get an Assembly up and running.  We do not want to do anything to interfere with that but, by all accounts, it would be a very interesting debate.  I wish everybody well who is going up for election today.<\/p> <p>Senator Craughwell talked about acknowledging the diversity of views.  We would all do this.  The diversity of views is vital.  It is why we are here.  If every single one of us came into this Chamber every day and said exactly the same thing and we all agreed with each other, we would be bored off our rockers.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I would be.  I say that as someone who has at times fought with her own fingernails.  I am definitely able to have a fight with people I do not agree with.  The most important thing we can do is find dignity in people's opposing views and treat them with respect.  It makes the final decisions we make in our Parliament, in this House and in the D&aacute;il, more worthwhile and worthy when we accept and listen to the diversity of views and take on board other people's ideas.  We need to be tolerant of each other and treat each other with respect.  That goes every way, not just one way. <\/p><p>Senator Wall seconded the amendment to the Order of Business, which I am very happy to accept.  He also asked for a debate on prescription drugs and HRT in particular.  I have been investigating this for the last couple of weeks because of requests people have made of me.  There are the usual explanations about supply chains, Brexit and Ukraine but the light-bulb moment came the other day was when the supply company said it is not getting as much for its product here as it is somewhere else.  It is economically more viable for it to go elsewhere.  That is the free market economy.  However, it calls into question the people who have negotiated our contracts for delivery and that is where we need to focus our ire as customers and our lens as legislators.  I will try to organise that debate as soon as I possibly can.<\/p><p>Senator Buttimer asked for a debate on the new higher education plan launched by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science this week.  It is welcome.  Everybody will have their own views but after many years of talking about it and the Cassells report and so on, we are finally getting a bit of movement.  It is most rewarding to see the hundreds of millions of euro going into it.  That is to be debated. <\/p><p>I also acknowledge what Senator Buttimer said about unemployment.  As a former Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, but more importantly, after seeing what the pandemic did to nearly everybody who was working, I feared we were going to have tens of thousands of casualties arising from the pandemic.  Thankfully, there are fewer people unemployed today than before the pandemic, which is wonderful news.  There are also more job vacancies in Ireland today than there are people on the unemployment register so we are still not doing something right and a debate would be very worthwhile.  Flexibility or anything else we can do to encourage anybody who wants to work is worth debating so I will organise that.  We will debate that with the Minister but I also look forward to debating Senator Sherlock's legislation. <\/p><p>I thank Senator Murphy for raising the issue of Robert Pether, his wife Desree, their son Flynn and their young daughter.  I am not as frustrated about this as the Senator because he is far closer to the case than I am but I do speak to Desree on a nearly weekly basis, if not more than that.  I am utterly dismayed at the lack of a response from the Australian ambassadors, and I say that respectfully.  They say they are not willing to engage with us because of the nature of the case, which I understand.  If that attitude were reflected in their representing Robert it might give us some solace that somebody is fighting for him but it appears nobody is.  Desree and the new solicitor they have acting on their behalf have been very complimentary of our Minister but compliments are not moving the case any further and they are not getting Desree's husband home to her and her children.  I will try to arrange a debate and get the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, in here to talk to us about what we can collectively do to raise the awareness of this woman, who is phenomenal because of the stress she is living under and the campaign she is running to bring awareness to her husband's case.  I thank the Senator for raising that today. <\/p><p>Senator Warfield brought up the ten-year anniversary of the referendum on children's rights and his wish for the Electoral Commission to look at holding a referendum to extend voting rights to children and young adults aged 16 or over.<\/p><p>Senator McGahon spoke about a virtual driving academy.  I had never heard of that before but I think it s a wonderful idea so I will write to the RSA on his behalf.<\/p><p>Senator Crowe asked for a debate on the summer programme in special schools.  It is sad that we talk about increasing it every year but we have to do that by encouraging schools to participate in the programme as opposed to telling them they have to.  The needs of young children with special needs do not stop needing to be met during the months of July and August.  The numbers are stark as only 1,641 children out of 8,018 are getting continuity in that service.  It shows how far we have to go.  I will ask the Minister for Education for a debate on the matter.  She has done a huge amount of work in the last few years to improve the programme but we still have a bit to go so I will organise that debate.<\/p><p>Senator Boyhan talked about the historic visit by our Cathaoirleach to the Ukrainian Parliament next week and wished him well.  We will arrange time for him to tell us about what he has learned and the experiences he has had when he comes back.  We look forward to that. <\/p><p>Senator Lombard acknowledged us putting on the record of the House and remembering the murders of those 13 gentlemen and one child in Dunmanway 100 years ago.<\/p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne asked for a debate on human rights and foreign policy.  It is not just about what we are seeing on our screens all day, every day, in Ukraine and Belarus but what is happening in countries further away, which may not be talked about so much.  We have the luxury in Ireland of thinking we have everything right.  There are lots of things that are still wrong but with regard to human rights and dignity we are a hell of a lot more advanced than some of our international neighbours.  We will certainly organise that debate.<\/p><p>I accept Senator Sherlock's amendment and look forward to the debate on her Bill.<\/p><p>Senator Gavan talked about the metropolitan plan that was announced in the last number of days.  He is not the first person to have raised that this week.  We have a large contingent here from his neck of the woods and nobody is happy with it.  I was asked for a debate and I have put the request in.  There is probably more to it but the Senator is right that the appearance that has been given is not a good one.  That must either be addressed or counteracted and an explanation given as to why it is not true.  I will bring that to the House as soon as I can.  I thank the Senator for raising it. <\/p><p>Senator Clonan talked about an investigation into war crimes, which the resolution we are going to pass in the next few minutes also relates to.  He is right.  For the last few months we have been talking about humanitarian aid and everything we can do for the effects of the war but we need to start talking about how to help end the war.  I do not know whether \"sinister\" is the right word for the simulation we were exposed to on Monday night.  If it was not so serious one would nearly say it was childish and churlish.  There is a genuine fear - maybe I am wrong and maybe I am indoctrinated - that these people do not think about things in a normal way, the way everyone else thinks about things, and that it actually could happen.  We need to move the narrative on to try to find a space where everybody can stop the egoism of winning the war and start saying we need to stop the war and stop people being murdered while they defend their own home ground.  There has to be a way to do that.  I will organise that debate on the Ukrainian war outcome as soon as I can.<\/p><p>Senator Kyne opened the debate by raising the case of 17 Ukrainian children.  Only in Ireland would we stop a mother who is looking after and communicating on behalf of 17 young children, who are as distressed as they could be when going to school, from getting on a bus.  I will contact both Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Minister for Transport today and try to relieve that issue.  The Senator also asked for a debate on the Inland Fisheries Ireland board, which I will organise as soon as I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050500002#O01400","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651743000,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Senator Sherlock has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business: \"That No. 19 be taken before No. 1.\"  It has been seconded by Senator Wall and the Leader has indicated that she is prepared to accept the amendment.

It is very helpful and it allows us to get our debate under way quickly.  I want to acknowledge and thank him for that.  I want to also welcome the Minister.  I do not want to rehash too much here today.  To be fair, we have had a good debate.  I want to acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s staff who are here as well.  This is a very specialised area.  I have looked at the reports on the marine casualties Bill as well as issues around marine casualties and the importance of being an island nation and our interface with the sea.  There has been an awful lot of public commentary about this.  I also want to acknowledge the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications which dealt very extensively with this particular issue.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The amendment provides that within nine months of the passing of this Bill, the Minister will bring a report on &quot;the feasibility to provide for the establishment of a regulator for the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.  The regulator will, if deemed agreeable by the Minister...&quot; and so on.  Ultimately, this is a decision for the Minister.  He is responsible and is driving this issue.  I also want to acknowledge the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, in this area.  I thank her for her meaningful engagement during the Committee Stage debate.  <br\/><br\/>We have had the Lacey report and the Clinch report, with which the Minister will be very familiar.  The former was prepared by Ms R&oacute;is&iacute;n Lacey, senior counsel, and delivered to the Department on 25 August 2010 but remains unpublished.  The report was commissioned by the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, a long time ago.  The Lacey report made some very substantial recommendations, one of which was that there would be an investigation office, independent of the Department in every way.  It would encompass aviation, rail and the marine.  The report identified the fact that this must be done in order to comply with EU directives and was compatible with both international and Irish law.  We have moved on from all of that.  The Department explored the case for having a response for aviation, rail and marine but I detect, having read the debates, that there was a desire within the Department to focus on the marine aspect.<br\/><br\/>What is interesting, having looked back at the press clippings on this as well as at research provided by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, is that there were many calls for the Garda Commissioner to act on the Lacey report.  While that is very interesting, I do not intend to get into who said what because it is not appropriate to do so today.  Accusations were made that there was huge resistance within the Department of Transport to publishing the Lacey report and its recommendations.  Again, that accusation is out there; I am not making it but there is a suggestion that there was huge departmental resistance, for some reason.  While I am privy to aspects of the reports, I cannot be absolutely sure they are correct so I will not quote extensively.  <br\/><br\/>I will now turn to the Clinch report, with which the Minister would be very familiar.  I read a number of transcripts into the record at the last meeting, on which the Minister commented, relating to the Clinch report.  That report was prepared by Captain Steve Clinch of UK-based Clinchmaritime Limited and was also commissioned by the Department of Transport.  Captain Clinch was asked to carry out an independent review of the organisational structures of the Maritime Casualty Investigation Board, MCIB.  The report was delivered to the Department in 2021 and has still not been published.  I do not know if the Minister has considered all of its recommendations or if he intends to implement any of them.  I simply do not know.<br\/><br\/>It is important to state that the Clinch report was a Government-funded report and its author was tasked with carrying out an independent review of the MCIB structures.  That is the kernel of the debate on these issues.  We need to determine how to address the current deficits and problems in the organisational structures of the MCIB.  That is where the suggested shortcomings lie and where the concerns arise.  Clinch set out numerous recommendations and suggested that these could be embodied into law, thus ensuring that Ireland is fully compliant with its EU and international obligations.  The Minister is aware of the Clinch report and of the finer, granular detail of the recommendations therein.  Clinch also advocates for a robust and properly resourced MCIB in the context of any new organisational structure.  Again, we are talking about the organisational structure, professionalism and accountability <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>issues relating to marine casualty investigations.  <br\/><br\/>What does the Minister intend to put in place and when does he intend to publish the Clinch report in full?  How many recommendations are contained in the report?  Has the Minister considered them in detail?  Is he still working on that?  Is it his intention to implement all of the recommendations and what is the timeline for that?  I understand that one of the key recommendations of the Clinch report is the establishment of a full-time, professional uniformed MCIB.  That sounds reasonable and obvious.  I am told that the current structure in Ireland is a part-time investigation board.  I cannot be sure of that but that is what I have been told.  It is my understanding that we have a part-time investigation board that is staffed by part-time investigators.  Is that the case?  I ask the Minister to confirm whether the current MCIB is a part-time or a full-time operation.  Are the investigators part time?  Perhaps there is not the demand for full-time investigators.  The Minister will know this from the data in the possession of his Department.  Is there a real demand for a full-time panel of investigators?  I am simply posing those questions.<br\/><br\/>At a meeting of the Oireachtas Select Committee on Transport and Communications on Wednesday, 16 February 2022, the Minister said:<\/p><blockquote>\tAs the Clinch report was commissioned on the back of the Department's initiative, it is very much in our interest that it would be published and acted on.  I am happy to commit here to doing exactly that. <\/blockquote><p>During previous debates on the record of the Houses, Deputies Joe Carey, Darren O'Rourke and Cathal Crowe expressed similar concerns to the ones I am articulating here today.  They also said that there was clearly a need for new structures and new systems to deal with maritime casualty investigations and related matters, including a full-time, independent investigation unit.  Again, to go back to the meeting of 16 February last, the Minister said the following: &quot;What I said in private session is that we expect the publication of the Clinch report at the end of quarter 1 and that is still the timeline, subject to the Office of the Attorney General and others signing off on it&quot;. <br\/><br\/>I understand the role of the Office of the Attorney General and respect it.  I also know that the Minister clearly intends to publish the report, or at least I hope so.  I do not know where we are in relation to the Attorney General's office considering these matters.  I do know that the office has a big work schedule and this might not be at the top of the priority list.  Can the Minister give us an indication of where we are with regard to the Attorney General considering these matters.  Are we any nearer a deadline or a date for the publication of the Clinch report?  <br\/><br\/>I have no skin in this game.  I have never been involved in a maritime accident, nor have any members of my family.  I have no knowledge of same except through people who have contacted my office.  People from Donegal, Galway, Kinsale and Arklow have contacted me and shared horrific stories of their experiences.  They are concerned and believe there are shortcomings here that must be addressed.  What I have read and my understanding of the Minister's commentary on these matters, particularly at meetings of the select committee, leads me to believe that he also has concerns although I do not know the extent of those concerns.  A lot of work may be going on in the background.<br\/><br\/>I ask the Minister to ensure that there is an assessment of the current organisational structures of the MCIB and to set out a report, at some stage in the future, with recommendations and timelines to achieve the most appropriate and most effective marine casualty investigation structures for Ireland.  That is not an unreasonable request.  Such recommendations must take into account national and European legislation in this regard.  <br\/><br\/>My amendment provides that the Minister shall, within nine months, consider the issue of a regulator.  It is important that any new regulator would take into consideration the recommendations of the Lacey report.  The amendment provides that the regulator &quot;will take into consideration&quot;, which is very reasonable, the recommendations of the Lacey and Clinch reports, as well as the &quot;ruling of the European Court of Human Rights&quot;.  This is a reference to a particular case which was very significant.  I do not want to go into that in much detail but we know that it came at a cost, financially, to the individual who took the case to Europe.  <br\/><br\/>The Minister is on top of his brief.  He knows the issues here and the granular detail of the concerns.  As I said, I have no skin in this game or personal axe to grind with anyone.  All I want to see is a robust and professional operation that ensures we have an MCIB that is well resourced and appropriately structured to address the issues in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050500002#U00500","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651743000,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for the opportunity to respond to this amendment and to the debate.  The main purpose of the Bill is to amend the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000, to facilitate a revised board composition for the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, MCIB, and thereby remove risks associated with the current reduced board membership and ensure the quorum requirements of the Act continue to be met.  The Bill is a transitional legislative measure to support the continued functioning of the MCIB as the marine investigation body in the State and in accordance with our EU international obligations to have an independent marine casualty investigation body in place.<\/p> <p>As explained during the Committee Stage debate, the Bill is a first step of a reform process.  I have recently obtained Cabinet approval for the preparation of draft heads for another merchant shipping Bill, which will provide for the further reorganisation of marine casualty investigation structures in Ireland based on the establishment of a full-time marine accident investigation unit.  To answer one of Senator Boyhan's questions, I agree that it is that full-time characteristic that we need to establish.  Therefore, this Bill is not the end of the legislative reform in this area.<\/p> <p>I am concerned, unfortunately, at the contents of this proposed amendment for a number of reasons.  First, it seeks to introduce a policy proposal in regard to the establishment of a regulator for the MCIB and, therefore, appears to pre-empt a legislative policy decision of Government.  The effect of the amendment would be to require the Minister for Transport to examine and prepare a feasibility report on a proposal for a regulator of the MCIB, which policy proposal that has not yet been the subject of consideration by Cabinet.  In that regard, the proposed amendment seeks to pre-empt a legislative policy decision of Government.<\/p> <p>Second, a proposal for the establishment of a regulator of the MCIB goes beyond the scope of this Bill.  It is completely different from recent policy decisions taken by the Government in regard to wider structural reform in this area.  In my view, acceptance of such an amendment would expand the entire focus and intent of the current Bill and it is based on a policy approach that, as I said, has not been approved by Cabinet.  I would not be in a position to accept such an amendment without further recourse to Cabinet on a detailed revised policy proposal in regard to what is envisaged as a regulator or the functions of the body or of the individual concerned.<\/p> <p>Third, in view of the focus of current policy as approved by Cabinet, I do not consider it appropriate to pursue a report on the feasibility of a regulator in the manner and timeline proposed, particularly when the implementation of current Government policy decisions will see, as I said earlier, a transition from the existing MCIB structure to a full-time marine accident investigation unit in the medium-term.  The current Bill supports the continued operation of the MCIB in accordance with international and EU requirements pending the development and progression of the next proposed reform legislation in this area.  It has been explained that the continued operation of the MCIB during this transitional period is crucial.<\/p> <p>As also explained on Committee Stage, a post-enactment report on the functioning of this Bill when enacted will be laid before the Oireachtas Library for the information of Oireachtas Members 12 months following the enactment of the Bill.  This will outline developments in regard to the implementation of the current Bill.  The draft heads for the proposed next merchant shipping Bill to implement the next steps for the organisational reforms process in regard to marine casualty investigation will also be subject to engagement with the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, including for pre-legislative scrutiny as part of the normal legislative process.  <\/p> <p>I reiterate the intention to publish the Clinch report.  As I said in an earlier D&aacute;il debate, it is subject to Attorney General sign-off.  I am still awaiting that, but I expect to receive it shortly.  I cannot outline the contents or nature of the report in advance.  As I said, the report is subject to Attorney General approval, which I hope I will receive very shortly.  As has been said throughout this legislative process, that should not impinge on, shorten or delay the enactment of this legislation because it is required to meet a very specific purpose, namely, to provide a viable transitional arrangement as we develop the new legislation.  Unfortunately, I am unable to accept the amendment, although I very much understand the spirit in which it is presented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050500002#W00100","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1651743000,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for outlining the position he has taken.  There has been a great deal of debate in committee and in both Chambers in regard to this particular issue.  It is not surprising that many have sought to try to broaden this legislation because the notion of reviews and reform of the overall architecture of the Marine Accident Investigation Board and its operation has been around and promised for a long time.  Quite frankly, it has not happened.  That is why there has been such a push at this stage.  I recognise that the Minister's hands are tied to some extent because this Bill is technical in nature and needs to be passed relatively quickly to give credibility to the investigations that are already under way.<\/p> <p>The decision taken elsewhere has created a lacuna that had to be brought to a head.  The engagement by all Members of both Houses was a genuine effort to bring about the ultimate change that is required here.  The Minister clearly sees the benefit in it.  As identified by him, he has already secured approval from Cabinet.  That is to be welcomed, but there has been approval from Cabinet to proceed previously and nothing has happened.  We are putting trust and faith in the Minister to bring that to fruition.<\/p> <p>In committee, we have had various hearings.  The person by whom I was taken on every occasion he presented, whether in terms of the material he provided or his oral presentations, was Mr. Michael Kingston, a noted expert in this area, who is legally trained.  He has been involved in this area and has a personal interest in it having lost his father in an accident many years ago.  The RT&Eacute; radio \"Documentary on One\" or \"Doc on one\" is well worth listening to from a podcast point of view to get a sense of the feeling that is there.  I suggest that the Minister's officials, in preparation the next Bill, reach out to Michael Kingston in light of his expertise in this area.  It might give a grounding or context in which the next phase of the legislative response is brought to fruition.<\/p> <p>I look forward to working with the Minister on that legislation, including in the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  We will be happy to engage.  I am aware that the Minister has a busy schedule, as does the Government in terms of getting legislation through, but this is important for all those families out there who have been impacted and affected and, sadly, for those who will be affected into the future as well.  There is need to put in place an appropriate architecture from a legislative perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050500002#W00200","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1651743000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I will be brief.  Like Senator Dooley, I am a member of the transport committee, which has engaged in an inordinate amount of informed debate and consideration of this issue.  Senator Dooley referred to the issue of architecture and to Michael Kingston whose testimony and evidence are to be commended.  <\/p> <p>This is a technical Bill.  It is about protecting and saving lives and ensuring that our Marine Accident and Investigation Board has confidence.  I am heartened by the Minister's comments in regard to the transitional nature of this measure.  I thank him and his Department for their work on it.  It is important that we move forward.  The amendment tabled by Senator Boyhan is in the spirit of trying to improve the Bill in creating confidence and certainty.  I hope we can take on board some of the points which, as Senator Dooley indicated, arose out of the committee's hearings.  I have listened to the very informative \"Doc on one\".  It should be compulsory listening for those of us in the Houses of the Oireachtas dealing with this particular Bill and future legislation.<\/p> <p>The Minister's comments today are positive.

Let us use this House in a constructive way.<\/p> <p>The key words in the Minister's statement were that the proposed amendment \"pre-empts further legislation\".  He also said that in regard to the regulator it might not be appropriate, but that he had not teased out that matter in any great detail.  I respect that.  The Minister spoke about this legislation being transitional and part of a series of changes that he would like to see and said it was but a first step in the reform process.  I have to be clear on one issue; we need to speed up.  We should not doubt the Minister's commitment.  Things move slowly, but this is a critical issue.  The coverage this Bill has received in various marine publications is enormous.  It is interesting to look at the provincial newspapers that are covering this particular issue.  There is huge concern.  Coastal communities around the country are stakeholders and they are concerned.  <\/p> <p>I echo what Senators Dooley and Buttimer said in regard to Michael Kingston.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->He is a very brave man who put his money where his mouth is.  He has expertise, took a case and was successful, and we must learn from that.  The Minister and his party, more than anyone, know about bravery and courage because they challenged the establishment and <i>status quo<\/i>about environmental issues.  It is a lonely and expensive road and it leaves people very much on their own.  I acknowledge that and the role of some key Green Party activists who have pursued other similar types of advocacy issues because they believed in them.  Let us not forget the guys outside who are trying to do their best.  Let us not always overanalyse their motives.  Not all of them are necessarily against the establishment.  They want a better system.<br\/><br\/>I take on board what the Minister has said but the problem is that progress is too slow.  I know we will be able to look back at this legislation in 12 months.  The important message that I want to go out today is that we have a structure that is professional and appropriate in terms of a marine casualty investigation.  I have reflected on what the Minister has said and will read his comments in the Official Report later.  He has indicated that legislation is part of a process that will be rolled out.<br\/><br\/>I am glad to have had the opportunity to bring this matter to the House again.  I acknowledge that the Minister, who is a busy man, came to the House to tease out the details.  I will withdraw my amendment but I will keep a keen eye on this legislation.  To be honest, I will stir things up if I do not see progress made in the next 12 months.  We should not have to wait that long.  This is an important issue.  I want to send the very clear message to the coastal communities that I have raised this issue.  I am never shy when it comes to public relations, advocating and telling the world what I do in here.  It is what we all should do as it is what makes a politician stand out.  I will engage with the various maritime publications and the maritime community within the next few hours.  I will tell them where we are and send them a link to the proceedings of this debate.  All we can do is bring this matter to the central table and ask the Minister to keep an eye on it.<br\/><br\/>The Minister's party is only one member of a three-party coalition but the Minister knows what it is like to be a member of a small party in a parliamentary Chamber.  We have quite a small set-up on this side of the House but the vast majority in both Houses.  I would like to think that one day in the life of this Government a Minister will come to the House and tell a member of the Opposition that he or she brought some really constructive ideas and suggestions to legislation and that he or she will support that Member 100%.  Unfortunately, such unconditional support has not been forthcoming.  It is a mark of this Government that it does not have the political maturity to come into the Houses and acknowledge the work of members of the Opposition who have a critical role to play in parliamentary democracy and enhancing legislation, particularly in the Upper House.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Minister and his officials for their time and the few Senators in the Chamber who engaged in this debate.  More important, I thank all of the Senators on the committee because that is where a much of the debate took place and much of the work was done.  Let us leave with a renewed commitment to keep this issue on the political agenda.  I am happy to withdraw my amendment on the basis I have outlined. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050500002#W00400","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651743000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651743000,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Bill received for final consideration.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651743000,"counter":147,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Fifth Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050500002#X00400","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1651743000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050500002#X00500","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1651743000,"counter":149,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?
