I am looking for an update on the work and actions of the transport working group under the national disability inclusion strategy.  How is the group working?  How is the Minister of State bringing together all the relevant Departments and stakeholders in order to make real changes, including making disability proofing of transport policy the default rather than the afterthought?<\/p> <p>I congratulate the Minister of State on her absolute and complete bias towards equitable policies and the way in which she has fought for people with disabilities.  I am determined, as is the Minister of State, to do everything possible to address those challenges and to break down all barriers to independent living and equal participation in society.  The Minister of State is aware of the inequitable access to transport for thousands of people with disabilities across the country and she knows the detrimental effect that has on those individuals.  It means a lack of independence, isolation and an inability to take part in community activities.  The lack of transport has an affect on those people's educational and employment opportunities, and their ability to go out and socialise with their friends and families.  It makes me furious to think that because I am able-bodied, I automatically have a easier path through life.  That makes me upset.  The Minister of State and I have spoken about how hard it is and how upset it makes us that people are barred from doing the normal things we take for granted.  Fianna F&aacute;il has always worked to create a fairer and more equal society.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's update.  The working group has the tired and exhausted hopes of thousands of individuals, families and communities resting in its work.<\/p> <p>I was happy that on 26 January, the Minister of State attended the working group session to examine the accessibility of transport for people with disabilities, including the priority review of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme.  As she has highlighted, there are significant and immediate issues with the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme.  There needs to be a focus on those issues and they need to be remedied with haste.  The lack of a proper scheme, as the Minister of State knows, is causing unnecessary hurt, physical, mental and financial pain to many families.  The Minister of State has also highlighted the problems with the primary medical certificate, as have many Members of this House and the Lower House.  An applicant must be permanently or severely disabled to satisfy at least one of the six medical criteria in order to obtain a primary medical certificate.  The mobility allowance and motorised transport grant also need to be reformed.<\/p> <p>Allowing people full participation in society is an important aspect of our transport policy.  I would like to know what steps are proposed towards the disability proofing of all transport projects.  That can include buses, trains, footpaths and bus stops.  How will the working group take a role in the review of how we apply joined-up thinking?  We must make all Departments look at what is best and how we can allow our friends and families who happen to have a disability to become equitable members of our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#A00500","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  I know it is an issue she is continuously working on and trying to progress so it is great to have the opportunity to provide the House with an update.  The transport working group was established in 2020 to support work action No. 104 of the national disability inclusion strategy, NDIS, the whole-of-government strategy which is tasked with tackling a wide variety of issues across society.  Action No. 104 of the NDIS commits us to lead a review of transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities and to enhance the options for transport to work or employment supports for people with disabilities.  We will develop proposals for development of a co-ordinated plan for such provisions.  This plan will have regard to making the most efficient use of available transport resources.<\/p> <p>The transport working group's work was paused to prioritise initial responses to the pandemic, while the work of the main NDIS steering group continued.  I made a commitment to reconvene the working group and it met on 26 January.  I chaired that meeting.<\/p> <p>Following engagement last summer between the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, it was decided to use the existing transport working group to progress a review of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That scheme is designed by the Department of Finance and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has already committed to reviewing that scheme.  The group's membership is made up of relevant Departments and State agencies which have a role in the provision of transport for people with disabilities with a particular focus on transport to enable access to employment.  Members include officials from both of my Departments, namely, the Department of Health and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, along with the National Disability Authority, the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Transport with the National Transport Authority.  The County and City Management Association is also represented.  To put it in context, I have left nobody out.  I brought everybody back into the fold because it has to be a whole-of-government, cross-departmental working group to ensure we get delivery for persons with a disability.  It is not just a rural or an urban issue.  It is about accessibility, inclusion and participation.  While I reference work there, I also reference education.  In her contribution Senator McGreehan talked about the social outlet.  That is equally as important as access to work or education.  Everybody has a right to participate.<\/p><p>I am pleased to say that there is involvement from all stakeholders on the group, and representatives from the disability stakeholder group, the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland were also in attendance.  As the House knows, consultation with stakeholders is a key element of the implementation of the UNCRPD and I look forward to hearing its views and input as the work of the group develops and continues.  This group will meet every three months.  It is not that it meets and is a talking shop.  It is based on actions.  Everybody knows his or her own actions within it.<\/p><p>At January's meeting, Department representatives presented on the transport support schemes they are responsible for and we heard views and concerns from the stakeholders.  Members have agreed an initial work programme to include a stock take of the current and, indeed, previous transport support schemes in operation.  I have also asked it to consider what worked well in the past, what currently works well, ruling nothing in and putting everything on the table.  It is clear that a variety of measures and supports exists across government but we must make sure action is co-ordinated across the system and addresses the real needs of people with disabilities.  The ongoing work of the group will be co-ordinated by my officials who will also draft terms of reference for discussion at the next meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#A00600","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>It is refreshing to see and hear about the work that is going on and the positive actions being taken.

I refer to a review of the free travel scheme.  There is a barrier in terms of how different disabilities are classed.  It is means- and disability-tested.  For example, a person who has epilepsy should have a pathway to access to free travel.  We need a more flexible pathway to free travel to assist people to live independently and to have free access to education and work which are really important things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#BBBB00200","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The wonderful thing about this working group is it will be an opportunity, as I said, to consider what worked well in the past and what resources were removed from people with disabilities which gave them independent access to participation.

I must compliment and thank the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, for his willingness to participate and to send his officials to the conversation.  This means we are prepared to have that conversation.  Technology has moved on in regard to adaptations within the car but if you are blind, you still cannot drive.  People who are blind are completely excluded from the assessment criteria.  It is about understanding what inclusion is and what people's rights are, and enshrining that within the whole-of-government, cross-departmental approach.

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, particularly as I am raising a west of Ireland issue, the Saolta Hospital Group, although it may be something that is relevant to other hospital groups as well.  I am not sure about that.<\/p> <p>We all appreciate and accept the sacrifices that front-line healthcare workers made over the past two years during the Covid-19 period and, indeed, before that in a very challenging health service environment.  We know front-line healthcare workers have put their safety and health on the line, stayed apart from vulnerable loved-ones and held the hands of patients who passed away from all kinds of illnesses, including Covid-19.<\/p> <p>These healthcare professionals worked long shifts in double PPE, not knowing what the future held for themselves, their families or their patients.  Many of them suffered burn-out because having spent months and years in high-stress environments, they could take no more.  Some have reached retirement age while some have opted to take early retirement because they can give no more.  They were rightly hailed as heroes and nobody disagreed with their receiving a &euro;1,000 bonus as a gesture of thanks and recognition by Government.  However, when these heroes inquire about their pension entitlements after years of service, they are not treated like heroes, or at least not in the west.  They face months, if not up to a year's, delay in getting a response as to what level of pension they are entitled to, and many retire without knowing exactly what their pension will be and when they will receive it.<\/p> <p>I think the Minister of State will accept it is not unreasonable to expect that on retirement, you will receive your hard-earned pension but many healthcare workers in the west have to wait months for payment.  I know of one case where a nurse, aged over 60, seeking early retirement because of burn-out and serious back problems, inquired of Saolta in March 2021 as to what her pension entitlement would be if she retired in early 2022.  She followed up by phone in the summer of 2021 to be told that it could be early 2022 when she would be informed of her pension entitlement.  Here we are in 2022 and she still has received no answer.  She must now make the decision without knowing what she is entitled to.  She has also been told by colleagues who have retired that she should set aside money because she will not be paid for months, when she retires.  One colleague retired from Saolta in October 2020 but was not paid until the following March.<\/p> <p>This is no way to treat healthcare staff who have given their working lives in service of their community.  There can be no excuses.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure the Department follows up and insists the Saolta Hospital Group puts in place the resources to make sure that retiring healthcare staff are treated properly and can retire with dignity and peace of mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#BBBB00400","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Kyne for raising that question.  As a former financier, the basic thing anybody wants to know about his or her pension is what his or her entitlement is and how to make provisions into the future.  That is the essence of pensions.  I have a script that I will read.  It has been forwarded by the HSE in the west, from Saolta, but I do not accept the answer.  It is not good enough, but I will give it to the Senator because people have come to him as they have to me.  The answer is not acceptable.  Using the pandemic and the cyberattack as a reason for not being able to tell a person his or her basic entitlements is not acceptable in this day and age.  We all know that what you put it in, you get out, and it is accrued on an annual basis.  Whether you have done 15 years or 30 years, you should know what your accruals are.  I will read this script because the Senator will get a flavour of why I feel strongly about this.<\/p> <p>I want to take the opportunity to thank the Senator for raising the issue.  As I am sure he is aware, the HSE administers a pension service for its employees as well as for other health employers, such as certain hospitals.  The HSE pensions administration function, like other support and administration functions, faced significant challenges over the past two years during Covid-19.  Due to the pandemic, the HSE had to move its pension function to remote working at short notice.  This involved significant challenges which included providing remote access to a variety of computer systems.<\/p> <p>As the Senator is no doubt aware, pension processing is a complex operation that involves calculation of pension benefits which includes estimates, retirement benefits, temporary rehabilitation remuneration and injury grants to name but a few.  In addition to the technical challenges at the outset of the pandemic, a significant number of pension staff was redeployed to support the emergency efforts, Covid-19 recruitment and contact tracing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This necessary temporary redeployment also has an impact on the delivery of pension services.  <\/p><p>This situation was then compounded in May 2021 by the devastating impact of the cyberattack on the HSE.  While it may now be a distant memory, the pension service is still dealing with the impact of the attack.  The fact that access to all computerised systems ceased overnight had a massive impact on the HSE pension administration function.  While access to most systems has now been restored, there are significant backlogs which the pension services must now work through.<\/p><p>The HSE recognises the challenges in the administration of the pensions and, as such, has implement a service improvement programme across the country.  In order to address any current delays, the HSE suggests that any individuals who are experiencing difficulties in relation to their retirement benefit should make direct contact with their local pension office.  The HSE remains committed to providing an inefficient and effective pension administration service to its employees.<\/p><p>The Senator will understand why, at the start of my response, I stood away from the answer provided.  The lady in question has been trying to access this service for 12 months.  At the end of the day, she has done X number of years service, and regardless of whether we had a cyberattack in 2021, at a certain point in time she will have known what her accruals were by that date and time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#BBBB00500","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her official reply and also her frankness on this issue.

We also still do not have a review of the previous strategy's implementation, as promised to us last year, to determine whether it actually did anything.  We do not have the review of the implementation and we do not have a new energy poverty strategy.<\/p> <p>I am calling on the Government, yet again, to expedite the strategy as a matter of urgency.  I ask the Minister of State for an update on it.  I welcome the renewed call by the older persons' charity, Age Action, for a Government energy poverty strategy.  A new strategy should have preceded the retrofit plan announced yesterday, or they at least should have gone hand in hand to ensure the retrofit plan was informed by the energy poverty strategy.  Likewise, we were promised Central Statistics Office, CSO, indicators to ensure retrofitting was actually reducing energy poverty as well as increasing energy efficiency.  However, we have yet to see the CSO indicators for that either.  This was on the back of a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform report in 2020 which found insufficient data has been collected on demographics to conduct a social impact assessment on its energy poverty schemes, which include retrofitting.  While we know that energy efficiency upgrades are a key part of the strategy to tackle energy poverty, the retrofit plan announced yesterday still seems to fall short of making the upgrades attainable for those on low incomes.  It is absolutely critical that we get those CSO indicators so that the retrofit plan and the energy poverty strategy are targeted at those who most need it.<\/p> <p>Retrofits are important for bringing down our emissions but they also have to reduce energy poverty.  As announced yesterday, the deeper retrofit will still cost &euro;25,000 on top the grant.  That is not attainable for many families.  Those who are already at the pin of their collar will not consider getting a loan.  The cruelty is that they may never be eligible for a retrofit scheme but they will always be liable for the carbon tax.  Under the measures announced yesterday, those who are wealthy will be able to benefit from taxpayers' money by getting massive grants.  Effectively, we are transferring a huge amount of wealth to those we do not need it.<\/p> <p>I am sure that onlookers had high hopes because we were promised a socially progressive retrofit programme, but what we heard yesterday did not meet that bar.  If it not based on evidence through CSO indicators and a review of the implementation of the energy poverty strategy, the programme will not achieve its aims.<\/p> <p>As regards short-term solutions, I would like to hear the Minister of State address energy poverty.  My colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Claire Kerrane, put forward a proposal for a discretionary fund a year ago.  At the time, the T&aacute;naiste said the would take this proposal on board and look at it, yet it has not happened.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has been calling for this for a long time.<\/p> <p>I also raise the issue of reforming the public service obligation, PSO, a regressive tax that subsidises renewable energies.  The PSO does not take ability to pay into account.  The way it is currently designed means that households are subsidising large energy users, such as data centres and pharmaceutical companies, because it based on a peak demand rather than a steady demand.  We know that data centres have a steady demand and, as such, once again, it is households that are subsidising the big energy users.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to provide an update on the energy poverty strategy, the CSO indicators and the report of the review of the implementation of the energy poverty strategy that lapsed in 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#C00600","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boylan for raising this important issue and for the timely opportunity to give an update on Government action to alleviate energy poverty.<\/p> <p>The national retrofit plan, which was published as part of Climate Action Plan 2021, sets out how the Government will deliver on our retrofit targets and includes a range of matters aimed at supporting those least able to afford to retrofit.  A key measure in that regard is a commitment to complete a review of the implementation of the strategy to combat energy poverty in the first quarter of 2022, which is March of this year.  Good progress has been made in that regard and the review findings will inform the next steps in the development of a new strategy.<\/p> <p>Energy poverty is influenced by a person's income, the energy efficiency of the home and the cost of the energy they use.  Government policy, therefore, focuses on supplementing lower income households through the fuel allowance and other payments, as well as providing free energy efficiency upgrades through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, schemes and also through the social housing retrofit programme, for which the budget provided &euro;85 million this year.<\/p> <p>The effects of recent energy price increases have undoubtedly been felt across society, especially by those at risk of energy poverty.  That is why the Government has acted to support householders through the introduction of an energy measure, which will provide a &euro;100 credit to all domestic electricity accounts, as well new, specially enhanced grants for home insulation, which I will mention later.<\/p> <p>Since the publication of the strategy to combat energy poverty, measures to support those at risk of energy poverty have continued to be improved and expanded.  Funding for the SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased dramatically over the period, from &euro;15 million in 2015 to &euro;118 million for 2022.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will invest a further &euro;85 million as part of the social housing retrofit programme this year.

These measures and improvements have had an impact, with the share of households at risk of experiencing energy poverty falling from 28% in 2016 to 17.5% in 2020 and the proportion of people who report that they are unable to afford to keep the home adequately warm falling from 9% in 2015 to 3.4% in 2020.  These are positive indications but we still need to improve how we measure and monitor the number of households that could be at risk.  A research network on fuel poverty chaired by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has been established to examine the data and metrics needed to improve existing measures for fuel poverty in Ireland.  The group consists of representatives from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Social Protection, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the Central Statistics Office, CSO.<\/p><p>Yesterday, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications also announced further improvements to the supports available to homeowners to retrofit their homes, in line with the commitments in the national retrofit plan.  A budget allocation of &euro;109 million has been provided for the warmer homes scheme this year.  This will support an increase in the number of free home upgrades, from an average of 177 per month last year to 400 per month this year, helping to reduce waiting times.  Separately, grants for cavity wall and attic insulation will more than triple as part of the Government's response to the current exceptionally high energy prices.  For instance, in the case of a semi-detached home, the attic insulation grant will increase from &euro;400 to &euro;1,300 and the cavity wall insulation grant will increase from &euro;400 to &euro;1,200.  These are highly cost-effective upgrade measures that can be deployed rapidly and at scale this year.  It is expected that these works will pay back in less than two years in most houses.<\/p><p>The new grant rates will cover approximately 80% of the typical cost of these measures and will be available to all homeowners.  The details I have outlined demonstrate the Government's significant commitments to supporting those at risk of energy poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#C00700","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

I would like the Minister for Education to make a statement on plans to build a second post-primary school in Kinsale, which is a wonderful part of the world.  History and geography have been very good to Kinsale over millions of years.  It is a growing, thriving town.  Its population has grown enormously over the last few years.  In the 2016 census, the population of Kinsale had risen to 5,281.  The county development plan states that by 2028 it is expected that the population of Kinsale will be 7,342.  That is a significant growth.  That growth is clear in all the current developments in Kinsale.<\/p> <p>Not only is Kinsale thriving and building but the rural villages around it are also developing.  Kinsale is our shopping, entertainment and also educational destination.  When it comes to post-primary choice in our part of the world, we all feed into Kinsale.  Pupils from schools in Dunderrow, Ballinadee, Ballinspittle, Belgooly, Minane Bridge, Nohoval, Kilbrittain and Ballyheedy go to Kinsale for post-primary school and there are another four primary schools in the town.  It is amazing that there are 12 primary schools feeding into this post-primary destination of Kinsale.  The town currently has only one post-primary school, which is a unique complex.  There has been savage growth in the school over the last few years.  While it is a high-class school, it is also the only one.  Other towns have a similar population but more schools.  Bandon is slightly bigger but has four post-primary schools.  Carrigaline is significantly bigger and also has four post-primary schools.  There is very much a need for choice.  We need to plan ahead and take into consideration the projected growth in the county development plan and the growth in the villages around Kinsale.  We need to strategically plan for educational infrastructure for Kinsale.<\/p> <p>As I said, there have been major increases in Kinsale's post-primary capacity in the past few years.  We now need to plan ahead for a second post-primary school for Kinsale.  That is the key.  We need plans so there is another destination that will complement the one we have.  That is realistically what the town of Kinsale needs.  It is very unusual to have such a population increase and not have a strategic plan in place for educational needs.  It shows a lack of joined-up thinking in so many ways.  The Department of Education must come up with a long-term vision for the town that incorporates the entire hinterland as well.  That is the key issue here.<\/p> <p>I hope we can start a debate this morning on a second post-primary school for Kinsale.  We are going through a county development plan process and we can look at proposals to get land zoned.  Even without the county development plan process, it would be appropriate to look at that school complex in a strategic and holistic way.  We can start this debate and hopefully move forward and get plans in place for Kinsale so it can move forward in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#D00500","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  I can hear in his voice his passion for education in Kinsale.  In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, using data from a range of sources, including child benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise and where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.<\/p> <p>Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area.  In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, the Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain up-to-date information on significant new residential developments in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that school infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes.  Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets also inform the Department's projections of school place requirements.  Where demographic data indicate that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided by utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools, or the provision of a new school or schools.<\/p> <p>There is one post-primary school, Kinsale Community School, in the Kinsale school planning area.  This is a co-educational school catering for boys and girls and serves the post-primary demand in the Kinsale school planning area.  The school has a current enrolment of 1,326 pupils for the 2021-22 school year.  Current demographic data indicate that the peak enrolment year in the Kinsale school planning area is projected to be in 2024, when it will have 1,393 pupils.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Ossian Smyth:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Subsequently, enrolments are projected to decrease to 1,225 by 2028.<\/p><p>With regard to meeting the current and future accommodation needs of Kinsale Community School, the Department has approved a significant level of additional accommodation for the school.  In March 2021, approval was given for the provision of 12 mainstream classrooms in modular accommodation, procured through the Department's framework, to meet the school's immediate enrolment need.  More recently, further accommodation was approved consisting of ten mainstream classrooms, two science laboratories, five specialist rooms, a library, a meeting room, a general purpose room, a five-classroom special educational needs base and various ancillary accommodation, including storage and preparation areas.<\/p><p>Both projects have been devolved to the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools for delivery.  It is intended that the school will have capacity to cater for a minimum of 1,350 pupils when the totality of the additional accommodation is provided on the school site.  This will then meet the projected post-primary school demand in the Kinsale school planning area for the foreseeable future.  The Department, therefore, has no plans to provide a further post-primary school in Kinsale.  The requirement, however, for additional school places is kept under ongoing review.  Additionally, the Department will continue to liaise with the local authority in respect of its review of the county development plan, with a view to ensuring that any potential long-term school accommodation requirements are anticipated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#D00600","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

This road has been promised to Galway for decades.  In that time, every other major Irish city and even smaller cities have developed their road network, while Galway has not.  These judicial reviews will now further delay what has already been a ridiculously long process to get to this stage.  It is essential that these reviews are carried out with urgency.  It is extremely disappointing to see Green Party representatives support these reviews and advocate against the ring road.<\/p> <p>The ring road, as we all know, is part of the programme for Government.  The document was negotiated by three parties, none of which got everything it wanted.  It is not appropriate for members of a party in government to advocate against projects which form part of the programme for Government.

The lack of a bypass has damaged the local economy to a significant degree, already.

I have supported this project and its precursor, the Galway city bypass, for all of my political career.  It is regrettable that two judicial reviews have been lodged as of now, with perhaps more to come.  The one from Galway city race committee makes clear that the committee supports the road but has issues with the planning conditions, although it is still regrettable that an application for a judicial review was lodged.<\/p> <p>The Galway transport strategy is supported by both local authorities in Galway, the city and county councils.  Indeed, it was supported by Galway County Council unanimously.  The strategy involves a range of measures being put in place to support public transport, including a new quality bus corridor through the grounds of the hospital, up University Road and through the Salmon Weir, use of which by private vehicles will be restricted.  A range of measures under BusConnects have been committed to, including on the Dublin Road and elsewhere.  A number of greenway projects are also included in the strategy but are in limbo in terms of final consent.  Hopefully, yesterday's Supreme Court decision on the south Kerry greenway will act as a driver and incentive to develop and allow planning applications to be lodged for greenways across the country, including from Galway city to Moycullen and Oughterard.  <\/p> <p>It is a source of regret that judicial reviews have been lodged, although it is not surprising.  Unfortunately, in this country at the moment, we have a high level of judicial reviews for everything.  It has become a bit of an industry which is regrettable.  I certainly welcome the decision of the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Peter Burke, to consider and reform the planning laws in a range of areas, including housing and critical infrastructure.<\/p> <p>As we talk about alternatives to roads, we have to also look at the fare structures on buses.  The adult daily return fare from Carna or Carraroe to Galway city is &euro;20, for example.  One can get to Dublin for less than that.  That is not an incentive to use public transport.  I welcome the initiative that has been put in place by my Green Party colleagues to provide reduced fares for students but we have to look at expanding that if we are serious about encouraging people to use buses as an alternative.  That accepted, the Galway city ring road is vitally important to the people of Galway, the development of the city and quality of life.  I hope that quick decisions can be made.<\/p> <p>Finally, in this day and age, the use of cash and coins is greatly reduced but on toll roads in many different parts of the country there are coin-only toll booths and one cannot swipe a card.

The debate has sprung up again about the divestment of schools in this country, that is, schools removing themselves from the patronage of the Catholic Church.  This debate has been springing up every now and again for the past few years, often when there is a slow news day.<\/p> <p>As of 2021, of the national total of 3,126 standard schools, 88% had Catholic patrons, 5.7% were controlled by the Church of Ireland, 1% were controlled by other religious organisations while 5.4% were not affiliated with any particular religion.  In 2018, the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, set up the oddly named \"school reconfiguration for diversity\" process to facilitate transfers of existing schools from religious patronage to that of secular bodies.  Since then only 12 primary schools have taken up this offer, although more multi-denominational schools have been established or sanctioned than divested.<\/p> <p>The programme for Government commits to achieving at least 400 multi-denominational schools by 2030 to improve parental choice.  How does the Minister plan to achieve this?  This House would be a good place for a debate on this issue.  The transfer of patronage happens on a school-by-school basis, based on dialogue between the local bishop and the local State-run education and training board, ETB.  This means that divestment only occurs where there is an actual grassroots call for it from parents in an area.  Effecting change only where change is asked for will never allow the State to hit its target.  The obvious way forward is a centralised consultation between the Minister and her Department and representatives of the ETBs and the Catholic bishops and archbishops, in tandem with localised surveys carried out by each school of families in its catchment area.  These surveys would determine what groups want and what solution fits best.<\/p> <p>I would love to see more diversity in schooling in Ireland.  I am sure the Islamic Foundation of Ireland would love to be patron of more schools for Muslim children.  There must be also be a desire among Hindu, Jewish or Orthodox residents in Ireland to see their beliefs reflected in schooling too.  Maybe then we could have truly Catholic schools under a less thinly spread patronage and these too would be in high demand.  A national survey carried out as recently as 2019 showed that 78% of parents supported the continued role of the Catholic Church in shaping the ethos of their children's school, with 9% saying that the church should have a much more active role.  These parents want schools to reflect their beliefs as well.<\/p> <p>I ask that the Minister for Education be invited to the House for a serious conversation on divestment and how the Department is planning to take religion out of our schools, while allowing those who want to have religion in schools to participate in that way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#H00200","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I welcome the Acting Leader.

I have long said that I am against the Galway ring road, not because I am against all roads but because we are in the middle of a climate crisis.  This is an old solution and new roads on this kind of scale have not been shown to reduce congestion.  In fact, they lead to more congestion as we get more sprawl.  That said, the attacks on the justice system in relation to judicial reviews by Senator Kyne's party colleague, the Minister of State Deputy Peter Burke, who said that judicial reviews are a moneymaking racket or words to that effect are unwarranted.  The parties that take these reviews are often charities.  They do it because they are entitled to do so and we should not prevent them from doing so.  In fact, we will get to a better planning system if we take these reviews seriously and go through the process.  The reason for the increase in judicial reviews is poor planning law, such as the strategic housing development provisions which are now ended.  That is what the increase in the last few years was about.<\/p> <p>Galway is not like other cities in this country.  It does not have large cities on either side of it.  A road that would probably cost around &euro;1 billion is oversized for the problem.  It is the lack of investment by my colleague's parties - there are Galway Senators sitting on either side of me - over the last couple of decades in anything else that is the problem.  They have promised the people of Galway something they have failed to deliver but they have also failed to deliver in areas like public transport.  That is where we need to be looking.  Only 8% of people in Galway are using bus corridors at the moment.  We need to roll those out and we also need to roll out BusConnects and Connecting Ireland.<\/p> <p>Where I would agree with Senator Kyne is in relation to the cost of public transport.  I would love to see the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, looking at reducing the cost of public transport overall as one of the measures to address the cost of living.  We have a couple of crises at the moment.  One is the cost of living crisis and another is the climate crisis.  We  have to deal with both.  We have to be serious and not just have business as usual.  That is what I am hearing all around me.  People are not prepared to take the necessary measures.  We have Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael councillors in Galway who are against a temporary cycle lane in Salthill bringing forward a motion next Monday.

The most recent SIPTU survey was quite shocking.  It was an extensive survey of 10% of workers in the sector.  Some 66% of childcare workers earn less than the living wage.  Perhaps more shocking is the fact that managers are paid less than &euro;15 an hour in many cases.  Some 42% of managers earn less than &euro;15 an hour.  Imagine how hard it is to be a manager in a childcare or early education centre.  That is all we are paying them.  That tells me the model is fundamentally flawed.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been arguing for several years that we need a new, State-led model of childcare and early learning.  One in five workers in the childcare sector works a second job.

How can that be acceptable in 2022?<\/p> <p>The more fundamental point I want to make is the following.  The big theme this week is the cost of living.  Sinn F&eacute;in put forward a proposal costed by the Department of Finance last October to reduce the cost of childcare by one third this year and by one third next year by moving to a State-run early years childcare model.  That is a radical proposal and would not please everybody but it is the right thing to do.  We talked about setting up a sustainability and capacity fund.  It was costed by the Department of Finance at &euro;86.1 million.  A full year would cost &euro;167.85 million.  That could significantly reduce the cost of childcare for hard-pressed families.  Anyone who listened to \"Morning Ireland\" earlier heard mothers talking about how expensive childcare is and how they are struggling with the cost of living.  Rather than piecemeal efforts to address the cost of living, why not adopt a radical proposal to develop a State-led childcare sector?  That is what the workers in the sector are crying out for.  This time next year, will those workers have pensions, sick pay and a living wage?  If not, why?  Surely our priorities must start with those workers who do incredibly important work.<\/p> <p>I am asking the Deputy Leader to organise a debate on this issue as a matter of urgency.  Let us have a debate so we can move this conversation forward and ensure justice for childcare workers so we do not have to endure another depressing SIPTU survey this time next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#J00100","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I rise to argue for the need of students to be prioritised in Government discussions on the cost of living.  Students have been at the coalface of the rental crisis for years with some now paying into the thousands or, even more tragically, living in homelessness while trying to get their qualifications.  I was glad to hear that the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, will bring proposals to the Cabinet on the cost of fees but we must be honest and say that the road ran out a long time ago on the funding crisis in higher education.  The Cassells report, published in 2016, which I have mentioned before in this Chamber, has provided us with a pathway for an education system that is fully publicly funded and free at the point of entry.  It is beyond time we implemented those recommendations.<\/p> <p>Furthermore, while the Government considers how to mitigate the cost of living, it is worth remembering that students are some of the most poorly paid workers in Ireland and usually occupy seasonal and precarious jobs.  I will not even go into what that sector has looked like over the past two years.  My colleague, Deputy Nash, rightly spoke yesterday about the need for a living wage in Ireland.  Our students are desperately in need of same.  I ask the Deputy Leader of the House to invite the Minister, Deputy Harris, to this Chamber to discuss the future funding for higher education and how we are going to take care of our students struggling with the cost of living.  Now that we have a full, dedicated seat at Cabinet for further and higher education, I see no reason why they should not be given due priority and consideration.<\/p> <p>I will also take a moment to reflect on something that came up yesterday at the Sub-Committee on Mental Health.  We were having a discussion with GPs and the topic of the prescribing of medication for mental health came up.  A GP told an anecdote on the issue.  When a friend of hers was in Australia, she was prescribing medication in approximately 30% of the cases of people who came to her with mental health issues.  In Ireland, the same doctor is prescribing in nearly 100% of cases.  That is because the requisite resources for talk therapies or social prescribing are not available to GPs at primary care level.  That was shocking.  I asked if GPs are overly relying on prescribing because there are no other resources available to them at primary care level.  There was a conversation in that committee meeting on the topic, and I encourage Senators to listen back to it.  It is a bad indictment of our healthcare system and our mental health system, in particular, that GPs are left with no option but to rely solely on medication to treat people when we all know of, and all evidence points to, the need for a combination of talk therapies, medicines, treatments and a whole suite of things we know will have a benefit for people who are suffering with mental health issues.  I ask the Acting Leader to invite the relevant Minister to the House for a debate on our mental health services, particularly in a primary care setting.  The whole thing is scandalous.  I was shocked to hear a GP say that GPs have no choice and prescribing medication is the only way they can take care of their patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#J00200","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I have come to the Chamber disheartened.  I am not yet defeated but I am feeling quite defeated in a sense because of the lack of a date for the citizens' assembly on drug use in Ireland.  Of course, the issues that will next be considered by citizens' assemblies are important but the issue of a directly elected mayor does not come with the same urgency as the issue on drugs.<\/p> <p>To give some context, someone will die of an overdose every day this year.  It will happen every day.  The citizens' assemblies that are to be set up may have a quick turnaround and finish their work in nine months but every single day those assemblies are running, someone will die of an overdose.  That is without mentioning the other impacts and harm caused by drugs and the lack of services for dual diagnoses.  There is a lack of detoxification beds and aftercare beds.  There is no access to a locked zone.  The only treatment we have for assisted therapy in this country is methadone when Suboxone is available.  We can talk about heroin-assisting treatments and trauma-informed care.  The Keltoi facility closed to allow for Covid-19 beds and has not reopened.  That provided the only trauma-informed care for addiction in the country.  Where are there consumption sites and safe injecting facilities?<\/p> <p>I have been engaging on this issue for 25 years.  I used drugs when I was a child and then became a person who ran and developed addiction services.  I now work on drugs policy.  The lack of urgency on this issue is baffling.  It comes down to the fact that the 319 deaths that will happen between today and Christmas Day do not impact the people in this Chamber or the Lower House in the same way they impact our communities.  Some communities will feel every inch of those 319 deaths because addiction, chronic use and dependency are responses to deprivation and inequality.  My fear is that we are not treating the matter with the urgency it needs because the focus will then be taken off the drug user and will be placed firmly back on the policymakers when we realise it is the inequality of one's conditions that leads to chronic use.  We would then have to make real decisions about how we treat society, introduce legislation and make policies that negatively impact the lives of some of the most vulnerable people in this country.  The moment we have a citizens' assembly in respect of this issue, we will see that there is zero evidence for how we implement drug policy or services in this country.  Big decisions will then have to be made by the Government.  I am asking the Government to take those decisions on.  We cannot wait for nine months for the proposed citizens' assemblies to finish and for a citizens' assembly on drugs to be established because another 319 people will die while we are waiting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#J00300","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#J00400","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I stand to congratulate the Government on the national retrofit plan.

The Restaurants Association of Ireland has sought the extension of F&aacute;ilte Ireland's brief to the restaurant and gastro pub sector.  That is appropriate.  The Cathaoirleach's home town of Kenmare is famous for food.  Food is a major part of the offering of towns and villages across this country.  It is a major part of the tourism product.

I followed some of today's debate from my office.  It was interesting to hear the take of three Government Senators, all from Galway, in regard to the Galway ring road.  It shows there is always a tension and a dynamic at play in government, which we are beginning to see played out on the floor of the Seanad.  I respect the Senators are from three different parties.  Senator Crowe made the most valid point when he spoke about what had been signed up to, published and agreed.  As time moves on in the evolution of this particular Government, that seems to be a bit frayed.  It is an interesting space to watch.<\/p> <p>I, too, raise the issue of Galway, in particular Galway County Council and the refusal of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to consent to a wind farm in the Slieve Aughty Mountains in County Galway, which is a beautiful place.  I visited it very recently with Independent councillor, Geraldine Donohue, who lives close by and represents that area and I heard first-hand the concerns of the people there.  I understand their concerns.  Galway County Council told the ESB to seek substitute consent, effectively retrospective compliance with the EU directives and environmental impact assessments.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has refused to grant a substitute consent for the 70 turbines at Derrybrien wind farm development at the Slieve Aughty Mountains in Galway, which was built and operated by a subsidiary company of the ESB.  The State has now amassed fines of &euro;17 million related to the wind farm, the European Court of Justice having found the development to be in breach of environmental safeguards and regulations in regard to the construction of wind farms.  <\/p> <p>I will park all of that and move a little further down into County Clare where, again, Government party members are opposing a wind farm.

We now have only 13 litter wardens.  Dog litter is a huge scourge in our urban areas and our landscape generally.  In 2017, I brought forward the Litter Pollution (Amendment) Bill which seeks to increase fines in line with inflation and makes it an offence to not pick up after one's dog.

Are there other management things that we should be putting in place?  People who swim in the sea, rivers or lakes are entitled to expect high quality bathing water.  On an island like Ireland, where we claim to be a green country that looks after its environment, we need to secure this and people are entitled to expect nothing less.  I would welcome a debate with the relevant Minister to discuss what needs to be done to let people swim with security in our waters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#L01200","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Consultation on the Ballinasloe flood relief project with the OPW starts today.  Ballinasloe was devastated by floods in 2009 and again in 2015.  Millions of euro worth of damage was done.  I am sure many here from the west will remember that.  St. Michael's Square, businesses and Derrymullen were underwater.  It was huge.  As a result of that, Ballinasloe was prioritised under CFRAM, the catchment-based flood risk assessment and management programme.  That was wonderful.  In 2011 there were scoping exercises.  In 2016 there was a preliminary report.  There were consultation days last year and today the next consultation starts.  This has gone on for years and nearly decades but we are getting just two weeks for a public consultation period.  I have spoken to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, about this.  During lockdown, the OPW could only do virtual assessments.  We hope to see that on the website but as of now there is still nothing on the website.  We need to see an in-person engagement with Arup, the liaison consultants on engineering, about what this means.  I mention emerging options for the routes around Ballinasloe.<\/p> <p>It is fantastic to see this project being progressed.  However, the information is available only in physical copies and the maps are only available in the library and the municipal district which are only open for limited times during the day, including the weekend.  It is very important that an exercise similar to the last consultation where the liaison consultants were available during the day and in the evening to engage with the community happens again, perhaps in the local hotel.  It is also important that we liaise with the person on the ground who will meet those with concerns in the community.  Galway County Council has someone involved in this, who is based in the city.  The consultants are based outside the county.  It is crucial that we see this happen in the local area and see this development happen.  It will take a number of years but we need positive engagement with the community at this early stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#M00200","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I pay tribute to the incredible hard work done by the board of management of Hartstown community centre.  For the last three years, it has worked long hours and made great sacrifices to look after the centre.  Over the years the centre has provided vital services from childcare to Sue's reiki and mental health support.  There are clubs, dance classes and a stage that is not being used now because it requires renovation.  This place is the heart of Hartstown.  We know community centres like it all over the country.  An audit in 2019 showed it needed urgent repairs and renovation to keep it open.  The board of management did what it has always done and fundraised to complete the work needed keep the doors open.  It knows the scale of the work required.  It has phased reports.  It applied for a sports capital grant, for which we all have our fingers crossed this week.  It has worked through Covid.<\/p> <p>The centre is on church grounds.  It was actually built by prisoners in 1985.  It is an incredible building.  It is run by the community for the community.  However, in law the church owns it.  That has been a barrier to getting the funds needed to get it up to the spec that is required.  I am really glad to say that after a long time, the archdiocese and Fingal County Council are now in direct negotiations about ownership.  That is fantastic but it needs to be done urgently.  The board of management has been working around the clock for three years.  It needs this to be resolved and after that it needs the funding.  There is a pot of &euro;5 million from the Departments of Social Protection and Rural and Community Development for community centres like this but there are community centres all over the island which need investment.  We need to prioritise that funding for groups like this.  We need Fingal and the archdiocese to sort it out.  We need to retain the community focus and the people who have driven this community centre need to stay at the heart of this.  I call for urgency on this.  Again, I thank the centre and its volunteers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#M00300","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Over recent weeks people across the country have been shocked and upset by the sad passing of Ashling Murphy and the subsequent alleged assaults against women in Kilkenny and across the country.  People have been rightly upset and moved.  However, on the alleged assault in Fermoy, there is somewhat of a positive story in that the two young 16-year-old boys intervened.  They made a decision there and then to intervene to support and protect the young woman.  We, as a State, need to be strong on law.  If found guilty, people need to be punished and when people perform acts of bravery, that needs to be acknowledged.  This House, the Cathaoirleach and the Ceann Comhairle have an opportunity to award national bravery awards to people who put their own lives at risk to protect others.  At the moment, considering how people feel about domestic abuse and violence against women, I cannot think of a better example to show the country than two young boys of 16 years and they need to be acknowledged by the State.  I have a two-year-old boy and if you were the parents of these boys, you would obviously be worried about the decision they made but would you not have a great sense of pride that you had raised children who made a split decision to protect a vulnerable young girl?  We, as a State, and even the President, but certainly the Cathaoirleach and the Ceann Comhairle, have an opportunity to ensure that if people do good deeds and make quick decisions to protect people, the State recognises it.  It shows the importance of educating people on how you speak to people and to women, in particular, and how you treat them.  It is getting through.  These boys knew that what was happening was wrong and they intervened straight away.  The more we can do to acknowledge that, the more that these things can be prevented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#M00400","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising that.

I know the Acting Leader, Senator O'Loughlin, will have an interest in that today.  One of the things that can happen straight away is that they can follow through on the recommendation that the Permanent Defence Forces Representative Association, PDFORRA, and the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, if it wishes, can now affiliate to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The quicker that happens the better.  I have held my counsel on it for the past six years because it was important that it came from the official side.  That has happened now, and both of those organisations should be allowed to affiliate should they wish to do so.  It is vitally important for the negotiations and pay rounds that will start in the coming months.<\/p> <p>This week, the Minister announced an independent investigation into an event that took place at McKee Barracks.  It is in the public media, and I will not get into the ins and outs of it, but what it has done is undermined the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.  He had initiated an investigation and officers were charged and admonished.  There is a potential for a court martial coming forward.  By bringing in a third party to carry out an investigation now we have a serious problem of double jeopardy.  This could finish up in the courts.  I have no idea what the Minister was thinking or who advised him at the time to initiate a separate investigation.  The Military Police are statutorily in place to carry out investigations and there is a military judge and a military courts system.  There are penalties that can be awarded by the military.  There is an appeals mechanism.  There is no place for somebody coming in from the outside.  Should it be an issue for the Garda to be involved in, it falls to the Chief of Staff to decide that, not a Minister.  We need to have a discussion on that at some stage in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#N00600","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator, and granddad.

A number of interesting issues were raised.  We started with Senator Crowe speaking about the judicial review on the Galway ring road.  He said that Galway has been left behind in terms of infrastructure and the ring road is necessary both from the point of view of business, commuters and tourism.  As somebody who has attempted to traverse the traffic in Galway, I agree with him 100%.  As Senators Crowe and Kyne outlined, this was agreed in the programme for Government.  I fully appreciate how disappointing it is to see another judicial review.  We do need the Minister to come to the House and we will certainly request that he comes.<\/p> <p>Senator Kyne also supported the ring road project and the need for it.  He also mentioned that the cost of public transport must be sufficiently competitive that people will avail of it when they can.  I fully agree with that.  He also made a point about the need for access to paying by smartphone at toll booths.  We should not need to have coins for all toll booths.  That is certainly something we will pass on.<\/p> <p>Senator Keogan spoke about the divestment of schools in terms of school patronage.  She remarked that only 12 primary schools had taken part in spite of a programme for Government commitment regarding more divestment.  Her key question was how the Minister plans to achieve this.  We can ask the Minister to come and talk about it.  I know about the issue from schools I liaise with.  I agree that parents should have an element of choice in terms of schools and the ethos of schools their children attend, but in several church-led schools it is very difficult to get volunteers to go on boards of management.  That is part of the problem.  Where there is a very good administrative network set up, such as with education and training boards, it can be easier to manage the many different aspects of a school.  We will seek such a debate.<\/p> <p>Senators Pauline O'Reilly and Boyhan gave the other side of the story regarding the Galway ring road.  Senator O'Reilly said she is concerned about more congestion.  I do not agree with that personally, but that is her view and she is entitled to it.  She is also concerned about an attack on the judicial process.  We note that and we look forward to a lengthy and interesting debate between all of those involved.<\/p> <p>Senator Gavan spoke about the Big Start campaign for the early years sector, which was launched this morning.  I listened to a little of it before I came in here.  He is correct that the statistics he mentioned are shocking, with 66% of workers earning less than the living wage.  Some managers earn &euro;15 an hour and one in five people must have a second job.  That is not even looking at the fact that many do not have a pension or sick pay and they do not work during holiday time.<\/p> <p>This is one of the most fundamental conversations we need to have in society, in government, in this House and in the other House.  It is important to note that on 7 December the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, announced major reforms and spoke about core funding and establishing a Government regulation order to improve pay and conditions in the sector.  It is vital for the functioning of society and business.  We will send the message to the Minister on that issue.<\/p> <p>Senator Hoey spoke about students and the funding crisis they have both in terms of the cost of living impacting on them and the fact that there is a possibility of fees being reduced.  We all support that, but we must ensure that colleges and universities are not left without core funding.  This brings us right back to the Cassells report.  Six years later there is no report on it.  I understand that at the time the Minister did seek economic funding from the European Commission.  I also understand that is back with the Department.  It is vitally important that we have a debate on that issue.<\/p> <p>Senator Hoey also mentioned the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health and the difference in the prescribing of medication between Australia and Ireland.  I have no doubt the doctor said that but I find it very hard to believe that almost 100% of people in Ireland get prescriptions.  From a conversation yesterday, I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is doing an audit of CAMHS because of the situation in south Kerry.  One of the three areas being examined relates to prescription, to make sure that there is not over-prescribing.  We cannot have a system that is relying on that.  We must have a situation that looks at all other areas and techniques.  There is a programme for Government commitment on SUSI eligibility.  That is important and it is ongoing at the moment.<\/p> <p>Senator Ruane spoke about being nearly defeated but never defeated.  I would never see her being defeated by anything because of her passion, involvement and interest in the subjects she champions.  I urge her to keep us all on our toes.  I know she will continue to do so.<\/p> <p>Citizens' assemblies are very important for the conversations we have in society.

The one on education is hugely important and I hope we see that advance in 2022.<br\/><br\/>Senator Ruane said, &quot;someone will die of an overdose every day this year&quot;.  That just shows us the huge urgency regarding this matter, and that is without all of the other impacts on people's lives.  We all know lives that are absolutely being destroyed by addiction and by drugs.  We need to put a huge focus on this matter.  I disagree that there is a lack of urgency because there is work happening behind the scenes and we need to show that.  We will seek a debate on this matter.<br\/><br\/>The Senator mentioned that she thinks addiction and chronic drug use are a response to inequality.  That may well be but I do not think we can take it just like that because every sector and community knows about addiction, drug use and the havoc all of that causes.<br\/><br\/>Senators McGreehan, Murphy, Paddy Burke, Fitzpatrick and Carrigy spoke about the national retrofitting plan.  They mentioned that it is important to be proactive, and increase and support people to avail of the plan through the one-stop shop and other ways.  All of them spoke about the need to provide low interest loans.  They also emphasised the need to encourage people to take up trades in order that we can deliver this very ambitious programme.<br\/><br\/>Senator Conway supported Senator Ruane in her call for a citizens' assembly.  He spoke about the disparity whereby restaurants and gastropubs have not been included in the F&aacute;ilte Ireland brief.  He called on them to be included and I can approach the Minister about the matter.  It makes sense because when we support tourism we are encouraging people to eat in the towns that they go to and support local cuisine.<br\/><br\/>Senator Boyhan responded to the tension between the Galway Senators, who come from all different parties.  He spoke about wind farms and about Government party members being opposed to wind farms in counties Galway and Clare.  I opposed the establishment of wind farms in County Kildare because I felt that the narrow roads infrastructure was unsuitable.  There is a place for wind farms and in my view they are more suitable to being located offshore.  We need to consider energy guidelines and we will ask for a debate on this matter.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Ardagh supported the call made by Senator Ruane.  She said it is an important issue and I agree.  Apart from the health issue, for anybody in a wheelchair or anybody who must push a buggy getting dog dirt caught up in the spokes of a wheel is awful and soul destroying.  We need to do far more to tackle the problem of dog fouling.  The Senator mentioned that Leitrim County Council has piloted a DNA profiling system.  I do not know how that will work but I am interested in learning about the technology.<br\/><br\/>Senator Boylan spoke about <i>daft.ie<\/i>and rent increases.  Yes, there are rent increases.  We need to reduce accommodation costs and the Government is doing a lot to resolve the issue, which was outlined by Senator Fitzpatrick.  Yesterday, when I was in Kildare, I was happy to talk about the cost rental scheme and the fact that there will be 180 houses in Newbridge and Kildare where people can avail of a minimum of 25% below the market price in rent.  I understand that the scheme hopes to deliver almost 5,000 houses around Ireland.  We have to consider many ways to tackle housing issues.  It is a fact that 20,000 houses were delivered last year and 30,000 units were commenced.  When we take that into account, even Part V in terms of social and affordable housing, then that is a very good start but the Senator said it was not and sought a debate.  Last Thursday night there was an interesting debate on this matter on &quot;Prime Time&rdquo; to which we could refer.<br\/><br\/>Senator Fitzpatrick spoke about the investment in housing and the retrofitting plan.  Senator Carrigy spoke about the warmer homes scheme and the fact that there is a 22-month wait, which is appalling.  He mentioned that the RTB needs to be overhauled to support balance, and support landlords and tenants, with which I agree.  When we are in a situation where we depend on landlords to provide houses to rent then we need to ensure that there is a balance of rights.<br\/><br\/>Senator Murphy spoke about the outrageous attacks on older citizens, which is an issue that Senator Crowe has raised previously in this House.  The thefts and harm are absolutely shocking.  Senator Murphy is correct to say that we need to consider sentencing and legal aid.  We also need to consider the bail laws.  We should also call for a debate on this matter and invite the Minister for Justice to come to this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#N00800","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":82,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#O00200","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Senator Ward spoke about water quality, especially the quality of water in which to swim.  He is correct that many people took to the waters during the pandemic, which was wonderful to see and I declare that I was not one of them.  The Senator spoke about the gap between sampling and giving results so people may find themselves swimming in water that is contaminated and that will have an impact on health.  The Senator is 100% right that we need to narrow the gap.  People need to know that it is safe to swim so we must properly treat sewage.  We need a debate on the quality of water for swimming and we shall look for that debate.<\/p> <p>Senator Dolan spoke about Ballinasloe being prioritised and that there is a narrow two weeks for consultation.  She is right that we need proper and appropriate engagement between engineers and officials, and the citizens of the area.  That does need to happen in a locality where people can engage and discuss.  I suggest that it would be worthwhile if she tabled a Commencement matter on the topic.<\/p> <p>Senator Currie spoke about Hartstown community centre and the vital services it provides.  We are so lucky to have places like that centre around the country because they are the vibrant heart of communities.  I know that because I am involved in the community centre in Rathangan.  It is a fantastic place that has facilities that can be availed of by everyone in the community and provides a range of classes etc.<\/p> <p>I wish to refer to the fact that an audit was done in 2019, which again raised the need for urgent repairs, but there was an issue because the community centre is located on church ground.  Again, we had that situation.  That is an ongoing situation around the country because a lot of communities centres are former churches or the property of churches.  The leases have been generous but people need things to go further so that they can draw down funding.  This is a issue and we need to prioritise funding to retain a community focus in community centres.<\/p> <p>Senator Ahearn spoke about the two 16-year-old boys in Fermoy who went to the aid of a young girl who was being attacked.  Certainly, we need to enforce positive behaviour and call it out.  I say that because far too often, and rightly so, we call out negative behaviour.  Therefore, when we see positive behaviour we need to call that out and reinforce same.  I agree with his good suggestion to put forward the names of these two boys to receive an award for their act of bravery.<\/p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke about the Minister for Justice in terms of refuges.  We are way behind in terms of the Istanbul Convention.  As we all know, nine counties have no refuges so the commitment to providing 400 beds is very welcome.  We also need a commitment to provide ancillary services.  Teach Tearmainn in County Kildare, with which I am familiar, has been fortunate to get extra funding to provide counselling to children etc.  Refuges can do a lot more than just provide a safe refuge, which is hugely important in itself.<\/p> <p>I congratulate Senator Craughwell on being a grandad to his granddaughter Alice.  He spoke about the commission on defence report.  I have not seen it yet but I am greatly interested in it as I come from County Kildare.  I fully support PDFORRA and RACO members being able to affiliate to ICTU as that is hugely important.<\/p> <p>In terms of the Minister seeking an independent review on what happened in McKee Barracks, to be perfectly honest if that did not happen then people would call for an independent review so I do not believe the Minister has undermined the Chief of Staff whatsoever.  We cannot have it both ways.  There are calls for independent reviews and investigations all the time.  That is what the Minister has done and I support him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#O00300","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1644402600,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Committee on Autism: Motion","time":1644402600,"counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#O00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders &mdash;

I will not go over old ground, but will take the opportunity once again to thank Eve McDowell and Una Ring for their work in campaigning on this issue.  They were undeterred.  When they started this campaign it was not easy for them, but despite dealing with and recovering from their ordeals they very bravely took on the task of trying to bring about change to our laws, which is never easy to achieve.  It was an honour and a privilege to work with them to bring the Bill to where it is today.<\/p> <p>I believe that it is the first Private Members' Bill to pass all Stages this term, which is a significant achievement for all of us and for everyone who worked on the Bill.  I thank all my colleagues, across parties, for their contributions to and support of this Bill.  It has been a very good process for all of us.  It also sends a powerful message from the Seanad that this side of the House, which is led by three women from the three Government parties, with some very strong contributions from male colleagues, recognises the need to improve and modernise our laws to make our streets safer for victims.  It acknowledges the fact that these types of crimes predominantly affect women, in addition to the importance of sending out a strong message that we have acknowledged there are gaps in the law and that changes need to be made.  This is just one of those small changes we think will make a very big difference to many victims.<\/p> <p>As I said previously, we have looked to other jurisdictions, in particular Scotland, England and Wales, where stalking was made a stand-alone criminal offence more than a decade ago.  That had a very real impact on the reporting of crimes.  In Wales, for example, reporting increased by threefold when this law came into place and it also resulted in increased prosecutions.  It has a direct impact on victims coming forward, the need to tell victims there is a process and, hopefully, encouraging more people to come forward to report what is a very serious crime that can escalate very quickly.<\/p> <p>I will finish by thanking the Cathaoirleach for his latitude and all my colleagues for their support in getting this Bill to where it is.  It is now over to the Minister for Justice, Deputy Helen McEntee, to take this legislation through the D&aacute;il.  I hope to see the Bill being progressed at the earliest opportunity without any delay.  We could, theoretically, have this Bill on the Statute Book in a number of weeks, if the political will is there to do so.  We have done our work on this side and in this House, in addition to working with Eve McDowell and Una Ring, to produce this legislation.  I will now hand it over to the Minister for Justice to bring this legislation through the D&aacute;il as quickly as possible and to get this law on the Statute Book.  That way we can say to Una and Eve that the work they have done has paid off and they have initiated and brought about real and meaningful change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#Q00600","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I know the Minister will want to respond, but there are a number of other speakers.

There is a body of elected representatives in this House in particular who want to progress legislative proposals.  I also acknowledge the fact that the Minister has been a particularly good and open receptor for those ideas.  I congratulate her on the fact that she has always been willing to sit down with Members to discuss legislative proposals.

It is entirely appropriate that this Bill should be brought forward in this House by an individual Senator or Senators.

I will begin by congratulating Senator Chambers.  I agree with everything she said about this being a very good day for this House.  It is a very significant Bill.<\/p> <p>Before I speak to the Bill specifically, I will commend the makers of Monday night's \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme.  It was a powerful, disturbing and very frightening revelation of what life is like for women who are brutalised by their husbands or partners and how they are let down by the State when it comes to protecting them or effectively prosecuting their abusers.  I suggest that the leadership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Judiciary watch this programme and, in particular, address those issues where much more can be done to help those women caught in a violent and, in many cases, threatening relationship.  I suggest this not to take away from the great help and assistance women receive from the Garda and Judiciary, but the programme highlighted specific areas where more needs to be done.<\/p> <p>I will quickly recap some of the main points made with regard to the stalking Bill as it made its way through its various Stages.  Many stalkers are charged by the Garda with intimidation or harassment, but no specific stalking legislation exists.  Some victims of stalking do not believe that harassment properly defines the insidious effect stalking can have on their lives.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Victims have to change their daily routine.  They suffer from mental health issues and their relationships with their families and friends are turned upside-down.  I have personal experience of someone very close to me whose life was torn apart by a stalker.  It is a good few years ago now but the lady in question never recovered from the horrendous effects of it.  More support is needed for victims' services and the support organisations, which are run on a shoestring budget.  Sentencing must match the gravity of the charges that are brought against the stalker.  Stalking is a very serious matter and those who practise it need to know that they will face serious time in prison.  I agree with colleagues who asked for swift passage of this Bill.

A great deal of effort has gone into developing it.  I commend the Senator and also the co-sponsors of the Bill, Senators Fitzpatrick and McGreehan, on their work on it.  I, too, want to acknowledge the outstanding work and extraordinary contributions of Eve McDowell and Una Ring, not only in their campaign to change the laws in place but also for recounting their lived experience and providing encouragement and support to many others.  The way in which they have come forward leaves us indebted to many victims who have been very brave in telling their own stories.  Members of this House have also told their story, which is certainly not easy to do.<\/p> <p>Throughout these debates, we have returned time and again to the fact that this crime has such a devastating psychological impact on victims, survivors and other people who are impacted.  We cannot even begin to realise the harm stalking causes.  As a crime, it is profoundly intrusive.  It undermines dignity and shatters lives, as many Senators have outlined.  I have seen the impact it has had on a very close friend.  I know what it can do to a person and how devastating it is.<\/p> <p>Legislative change is only part of the answer but I am particularly conscious of the evidence that has been shown.  Senator Chambers outlined that again today.  When a specific offence of stalking has been created in other jurisdictions and other countries it has led to an increase in victims coming forward, which means an increase in prosecutions.  More than anything else, we want to see victims coming forward.  We want them to feel confident in doing so and to know the law will be on their side and there to support them.  We need to create a system for victims to ensure they feel comfortable in coming forward.  That is what supporting a victim&rsquo;s journey is about.  It is my plan in the Department to improve the criminal justice system, which includes training for garda&iacute; and legal professionals.  More recently, we saw moot courts held for judges who deal with cases of sexual harassment, rape and sexual assault.  We need more of that to continue.  It is extremely important when people come forward that they know the law is on their side and that the people they are dealing with understand and appreciate the difficulties and challenges they face.<\/p> <p>We share a similar desire to see the law in this area strengthened.  The Government has not opposed this Bill and I look forward to seeing it passed in the Seanad today.  Senators will be aware from my recent statements and from the debate on Committee Stage that I have been working closely with the Attorney General on changes to the law in this area.  I met Senator Chambers, Una Ring and Eve McDowell and it is my intention to enact the changes in this Bill in the criminal law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, which will be published before Easter.  While this work is continuing, I hope we can go even further in some aspects and areas being proposed in the Bill.  These include clarifying and widening the scope of conduct that may constitute stalking and what should be taken into account by the courts; providing for court orders to tackle stalking and these types of behaviours at an earlier stage before its consequences impact victims; ensuring we recognise stalking offences may take place where a victim does not even realise it is happening to him or her; enabling the Garda to take action where the victim does not know this is happening; and revising and updating the existing section 10 harassment offence.  <\/p> <p>I very much look forward to working with Senator Chambers, Eve McDowell and Una Ring and colleagues as we develop these changes and find a way to ensure the existing law and new offence of stalking are as clear and strong as they possibly can be.  Victims need to know that they can come forward, that the law is clear and those working with them are clear in what they are doing in taking prosecutions and, more important, that it is clear there will be consequences for those who perpetrate these crimes.

As I have said on previous Stages, there is no excuse for anyone in either House of the Oireachtas to delay the adoption of this legislation.  Therefore, I am glad we are where we are today.<\/p> <p>It is important to distinguish again between an act of harassment and a campaign of stalking.  There is a distinct difference between the two.  As matters stand, stalkers are likely to be charged on the basis of having harassed their victims, if they are charged at all.  We have seen a rise in violence and intimidation in this country, mainly perpetrated by men against women.  We must be seen to act swiftly to stamp this out, be it gender-based violence, public disorder or stalking.  The citizens we represent want assurances that these Houses will protect them and that we will provide the Garda and courts with the flexibility and powers to ensure real justice is served.  I again commend my colleagues on their tireless advocacy and give my full support to the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#S00300","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate.

By way of background, I advise Senators that EU Council Regulation No. 1224\/2009, known as the control regulation, requires, <i>inter alia<\/i>, that member states implement a points system for serious infringements of the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, committed by the master or skipper of a fishing vessel.  The points system is intended to promote compliance with the rules of the CFP and seeks to deliver on the policy objective of ensuring proportionate, effective and dissuasive penalties for serious infringements and must contribute to a level playing field in fisheries control across all of EU member states.  The points system was due to be in place on 1 January 2012, which is ten years ago, and the delay in implementing it is the subject of EU infringement proceedings against Ireland at present.  A negative judgment from the European Court of Justice in any such proceedings could cost the State significantly in lump-sum and ongoing fines.  Furthermore, serious financial implications arise from the non-implementation of the points system because as a condition of the EU contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s European maritime and fisheries fund programme certain conditions must be fulfilled, including implementation of a points system for masters.<\/p><p>Turning to the main provisions of the Bill, in the context of the proposed masters points system the Bill replicates, insofar as is possible, the key provisions of the separate required EU points system for sea-fishing boat licence holders, the arrangements for which are set down in the governing EU regulations.  The licence holders system has been implemented by means of an administrative system under secondary legislation, namely, the European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations 2020, as amended.  The scheme for masters proposed in the Bill insofar as far as possible follows the provisions of the existing licence-holder system, as I said, with regard to the list of serious infringements, the number of points assigned and the suspension thresholds provided for under the EU regulations.  The period of suspension is determined by the number of points accumulated.  The higher the number of points accumulated the longer the suspension.  The accumulation of 18, 36, 54 and 72 points will trigger suspensions of two, four, eight and 12 months respectively.  A master who has accumulated 90 points or more or received five suspensions shall effectively be permanently disqualified from taking control of an Irish sea-fishing boat or a foreign sea-fishing boat wherever it may be.<\/p><p>The masters points system proposed in the Bill also mirrors the provisions of SI 318 of 2020 as regards the licence-holders points system in other respects, including that the same independent determination panel and independent of appeals officer will determine on the balance of probabilities whether a serious infringement has occurred.  Second, the procedures and timelines laid out in the Bill for the determination panel and the appeals officer to make their determinations are very similar to those provided for under that statutory instrument.  Third, the master can request a oral hearing, both before the determination panel and also before the appeals officer.  A decision of the appeals officer to assign points can also be appealed to the High Court on a point of law and last of all, points assigned to a foreign master will be notified to the relevant authorities of the relevant member state.<\/p><p>The Bill provides that the Minister of the day shall establish maintain a register of masters who are Irish citizens.  A person cannot take charge of sea-fishing vessels unless he or she is registered and to do otherwise is an offence.<\/p><p>The Bill contains a section to facilitate the sharing of certain data between the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, and the Revenue Commissioners.  There are also various technical and miscellaneous amendments, most of which are primarily technical in nature and which correct typographic and reference areas in the errors in the Act.  These amendments will improve the overall operation of the Act.<\/p><p>Senators should also be aware the general scheme the Bill was subject to thorough pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in April and May of last year.  The committee heard from key industry representatives.  I appeared before it on two occasions as part of that process.  I acknowledge and thank the members of the committee for their time and for a constructive discussion on the contents of the general scheme.<\/p><p>The Bill was initiated in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and completed its passage through the Lower House last week.  The following are certain key amendments made by the D&aacute;il to the Bill.  First, there was the inclusion of an option of using an electronic interface for serving of notifications or documents to masters.  Second, provisions were inserted to ensure that points should be assigned to a master who commits serious infringements of the landing obligation or discards ban as required under EU law.  In addition, the power of the Minister to set a fee for masters to pay when appealing to the independent appeals officer on a determination of the independent determination panel that a serious infringement had been committed has been removed.<\/p><p>I take this opportunity to again thank Deputies for a robust and constructive discussion on the contents of the Bill on all Stages.  While we have had our differences in certain regards to aspects of the Bill and I have no doubt that those on all sides in the D&aacute;il and in this House are committed to the timely introduction and implementation of an effective, proportionate and dissuasive masters points system.<\/p><p>I will now provide an overview of the detailed provisions in the Bill.  Section 1 clarifies that the Act of 2006 means the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act of that year.  Section 2 amends section 2 of the Act of 2006 insofar as certain definitions provided for thereunder are concerned.  Section 3 then amends section 12 of the Act of 2006 to provide clarity around the publication of a notification in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il <\/i>as provided for thereunder.  Sections 4 and 5 amend sections 13 and 15, respectively, of the Act of 2006 to provide for certain miscellaneous and technical amendments.<\/p><p>Section 6 inserts into Part 2 of the 2006 Act a new chapter 2A titled &ldquo;Regulation of Irish Fishing masters&rdquo; and provides for the establishment of a points system for masters of fishing vessels as required by EU law.  The Minister shall establish and maintain a register of Irish citizens who are masters of sea-fishing boats, to be called the Irish fishing master register, and the points assigned to each such master.  The control authorities, they being the SFPA and the Naval Service shall have access to and may examine the register for control purposes only.  It shall be an offence for an Irish citizen to take charge or attempt to take charge of an Irish sea-fishing boat or a foreign sea-fishing boat unless he for she is registered.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charlie McConalogue:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2319\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2319&amp;amp;pid=CharlieMcConalogue&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Also under section 6, the accumulation of points will result in the suspension of a master from the register, that is, he or she will be prohibited from taking control of an Irish sea-fishing boat or a foreign sea-fishing boat, wherever it may be.  When points are assigned to a master on the register, the Minister shall notify him or her of certain matters.  A master who has been suspended or removed from the register is required to immediately inform the sea-fishing boat licenceholder who engages or proposes to engage him or her as master of such suspension or removal.<br\/><br\/>Sections 7 and 8 amend sections 16 and 17 of the Act of 2006, respectively, to provide for certain miscellaneous and technical amendments.  Section 9 provides for the transfer of certain data between the SFPA and the Revenue Commissioners, as I outlined earlier.  Such data sharing already occurs in respect of other public bodies, for example, between Revenue and the Department of Social Protection.  Section 10 amends section 28 of the Act of 2006 to provide clarity on certain drafting matters identified therein.  Sections 11 and 12 amend sections 37 and 54 of the Act of 2006, respectively, to provide for certain miscellaneous and technical amendments.<br\/><br\/>Section 13 amends the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003 to, <i>inter alia<\/i>, rectify a lacuna to the effect that there is at present no legal impediment to a minor applying for a sea fishing boat licence.  That will address that issue.  Section 14 provides for certain amendments to Regulation 7 of the European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations 2020.  Section 15 provides standard provisions for the Title, citation and commencement of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>My firm view is that an efficient and effective masters points system is necessary to protect law-abiding masters, who make up the vast majority of those in the industry, and to preserve this precious and valuable resource for all Irish fishermen and for future generations.  I am confident that the masters points system proposed in the Bill will play a vital role in delivering on the Common Fisheries Policy objective of ensuring proportionate, effective and dissuasive penalties for serious infringements and, importantly, in contributing to a level playing field in fisheries control across member states.  The points system is necessary as an effective measure against the small number of masters, either foreign or Irish, who break the rules.  It is necessary to protect law-abiding operators and preserve fish stocks.<br\/><br\/>I commend the Bill to the Seanad and look forward to a constructive discussion on Second Stage this afternoon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#W00300","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  No fishing representative would like to see any sort of penalty points or other system that might in any way adversely affect their work.  However, I note the European Commission has issued a reasoned - I like the word &quot;reasoned&quot; - opinion against Ireland for failure to implement the system by 1 January.  It states &quot;2012&quot; but that might be an error.<\/p><p>It crossed my mind that what the Minister is dealing with is probably a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.  We are in Europe, even though sometimes many fishing trawler owners have some difficulties with that.  A question put to me by some of the fishermen is: how sure can we be that these regulations and this penalty points system will be enforced by other major countries in Europe, such as France and Spain?<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned the master of the vessel a few times.  Is that equivalent to the skipper or to the owner, or is it a different situation?  If it is the case that the master - I usually look on masters as being of big ships such as merchant ships - or the skipper ends up with a maximum of 18, 36, 54 or 72 penalty points for whatever reasons, and nobody wants to end up in that situation, can that vessel still fish under another master or skipper?  If it cannot, that is a serious problem.  I note the Minister is nodding and that is a reasonably good indication of where he stands on it.<\/p><p>We are looking at the control of our seas.  Recently we had that unusual so-called &quot;historic&quot; event where the Russians were to launch missiles in Irish fishing waters.  It was not the Minister for Foreign Affairs but apparently the fishers who prevented that event happening.  That is what is being claimed.  On a serious point, have our Naval Service vessels the capacity to control our international waters?  It is my view, as somebody who lives in Cork South-West and from my experience of the fishing industry which would be reasonably well established, that our Naval Service's capacity to police our international waters is not adequate.  If it is not, what proposals are there to augment the Naval Service vessels to make sure that not only are we policing our own but others are being policed?  Maybe that is for the Minister for Defence.<\/p><p>In the past year during a particular storm, there were approximately 40 nearly-ocean going trawlers, some of them 40 m long, sheltering in Bantry Bay, which is known as the best bay in the whole of Europe.  It boasted of containing the entire British fleet in the past.  My worry is that this accusation has been made, and I am in these Houses since 1989, that traditionally Irish fishermen have been neglected at the expense of Europe.  I do not want to go back over history but we got a poor quota.  We are now in a situation again, as the Minister will be aware, where there is a proposal to decommission other vessels.  Our fishing industry has contracted severely.  I remember when there were five or six fishing boats in Schull.  Kinsale, Union Hall and Castletownbere - all those ports - had many more fishing vessels and more people working in the industry 40 years ago than there are now.  I am not sure whether it is a good or a bad indication.  I note also that this is EU driven.  I have no problem with it being implemented by the State, in compliance with EU laws and regulations, but I would like to see a level playing field.<\/p><p>Another point, which may not be directly related but which is interesting, is that we talk about the carbon footprint, taking stuff across the world from A to B and bringing in beef from Brazil or wherever.  Recently I was in a reputable shop - I will not say whether it was in Cork or Kerry - and I was thinking of buying a 0.5 k of prawns, which I usually would not be getting.  I noticed to my dismay that they were imported from Ecuador.  If we are getting fish from Ecuador, I would be very concerned about the future of our fishing industry.<\/p><p>I honestly believe we cannot reverse what has been done in Europe.  There has been a case made against us.  I do not want to see any fishing vessel or the fishing industry being further penalised in any way.  That would be detrimental to our industry.  The Minister's heart is in the right place and he visited Castletownbere.  The Minster is from Donegal and has first-hand experience from places like Killybegs of what goes on in the fishing industry.  My only appeal is that we get fair play and that the fishing industry, which has, in many ways, been suppressed and is getting smaller and tighter, is protected and does not suffer as a result of any EU regulation or system that might adversely affect the industry in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#X00200","speaker":"1691"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber and acknowledge he is bringing forward important legislation to, in many ways, bring clarity to this industry regarding how the penalty points will work.  We have been talking about this for a significant period of time and there is a feeling out there that we need to put a fair and appropriate scheme in place.  That is what fishermen and women are talking to me about continuously.  We realise that there has to be legislation and regulation but it has to be fair.

That is a real issue.  In the briefing notes I received regarding this point, one of the issues was how the foreign investors are going to be dealt with in the proposed penalty point regime.  The Minister might clarify how that is going to tie in with the legislation and how foreign vessels will be policed in Irish waters.  Will they have the same issues when the points are being sent to their jurisdictions?  I do not think there is a European register of all masters and what points pertain to their licences at present, although I may be wrong on that.  The Minister might confirm the position.  We have no idea what penalty points have been applied to foreign vessels or what disciplinary action has been taken against them when they are fishing in European waters.  If we had clarity and knew which vessels penalty points had been applied to, it might give some reassurance on the issue of what foreign vessels are getting away with.  That is an issue on which we need some clarity.<\/p><p>The Minister might also clarify how this system will work with regard to UK vessels.  There have been issues around Brexit, quotas and the transfer of fishing entitlements.  It seems to me the UK is now somewhat outside the net.  Where do UK trawlers come into the equation?  How can the European Union have a system that will give confidence to the Irish fishing industry that the UK masters are not outside the proposed regulations at European level?  That is a significant point.  People in the industry want fair play and want to know everyone is playing by the same rules.  If we had that assurance, it would go a long way towards ensuring that these issues are taken on board.<\/p><p>Let us be honest, there will be concerns, to say the least, about these proposals.  We all realise there is regulation of everything one does in life but as long as that regulation is applicable to everyone, we can get by.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#X00300","speaker":"1666","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to discuss this matter.  There are four key issues I want to raise with him.  I am relying heavily on the report from the Library and Research Service.  It is a resource available to us and I do not think the members of the service ever get thanked enough for the informative work they do.  Their digest of this Bill is particularly helpful because it encapsulates many of the concerns that have been brought to the attention of many people.<\/p> <p>The first issue relates to the questionable fairness of the allocating points system.  The standard of proof required threshold is based upon balance of probabilities rather than culpability beyond a reasonable doubt.  In its pre-legislative scrutiny, the joint committee identified the potentially problematic nature of a determination panel concluding on the balance of probabilities as evidenced by the report of the authority, rather than a threshold for proof required.  All alleged serious infringements are made by means of a written report by the authority.  Section 6 of the Bill provides that a determination panel will be established \"for the purpose of determining ... whether a serious infringement has occurred and whether a person was, at the time, the master of the sea-fishing boat\".  In addressing an appeals process, an appeals officer will be assigned at the authority.  A period of 30 days is available in which to submit an appeal to the appeals officer.  The appeal must be in writing from the master and is subject to a fee which is yet to be determined.  The issue raised during pre-legislative scrutiny was that the Bill does not address concerns regarding the balance of probabilities providing the required threshold of proof, nor how existing reports and-or points may or may not be considered in the authority&rsquo;s assessment of further alleged infringements.  That is the first issue that came up in comparing what came up in pre-legislative scrutiny with what is now in the Bill.<\/p> <p>The second issue is the weighing of fishery products in-factory.  The committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report, according to the digest of the Bill, states the Bill as published does not cover or address this issue.<\/p> <p>The third issue relates to the application of penalty points to EU and non-EU vessels.  There was particular concern that UK vessels in Irish waters were going to be advantaged.  Senator Lombard already raised this matter.  The Bill does not provide for assigning penalty points to or having a register of points assigned to foreign nationals.  Instead, a provision in the new section 15 being inserted into the 2006 Act via section 6 states that points assigned to a foreign master will be notified in writing to the authorities in the relevant member state.  The UK is not specified.  Thus the Bill does not provide for the authority dealing with serious infringements by UK fishing masters in Irish territorial waters in the same way as provided for other EU member states.  I am happy to be corrected on that if I have misinterpreted the legislation.<\/p> <p>The fourth issue is fair administration and SFPA capacity and resourcing with regard to the register of penalty points.  At the pre-legislative scrutiny stage, the committee stated the Bill did not have provisions for organisational capacity or resourcing for the SFPA.<\/p> <p>Those are just four issues.  I know other issues have been raised.  The Bill digest encapsulates some of the key issues exercising certain communities throughout the country.  I hope the Minister is in possession of information to articulate how some of these issues are to be dealt with.  There is no doubt but that we must protect our fishing reserves and there needs to be sustainability in the sector.  There is, alas, no doubt that jobs in the sector are threatened.  There are no two ways about that.  It is important that we ensure support for the jobs and a just transition and we want to make sure the Bill does that.  There has been talk of this being a fair and appropriate scheme, that there has been weighting of it in the Bill and that it is not too onerous on fishermen, particularly those who are sticking to the rules and not taking the Mick, if you will.  Those are the points I wanted to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#Y00200","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their contributions.  One of the key things that came through in two or three of the contributions was the issue of beyond reasonable doubt.  I will touch on that matter first.  The standard of proof used in the determination of an appeals officer is the balance of probability.  It is a matter that has been raised throughout the progress of this Bill.  It has not only been raised here today; it was also raised in the D&aacute;il and in committee.  I reiterate that the legal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt is almost entirely confined to criminal trials and is not applicable to proceedings of a civil nature, where the standard used is the balance of probabilities.  The legal position is that the balance of probabilities is the appropriate legal standard for the masters points system.  The standard of proof is ordinarily and overwhelmingly on the balance of probabilities in civil cases.  A higher standard of proof is required in criminal cases, that of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.<\/p> <p>In considering previous statutory instruments, the Supreme Court did not in either the Crayden or O'Sullivan cases make a single reference to beyond a reasonable doubt throughout the two judgments.  The Supreme Court did not take issue with the balance of probabilities standard of proof in any of the statutory instruments it considered.  Thus there is no support in the Supreme Court judgments for the proposition that the standard of proof on the basis of the balance of probabilities should be raised to the criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator O'Donovan for his contribution.  There is an obligation on all member states.  The Senator made the point that it is important these rules are applied consistently across all member states of the EU and asked what assurances can there be that other member states are enforcing them.  The first challenge is that we are the very last member state to put a system in place.  We are ten years later doing so than the legal obligation required.  There has been much engagement and many chapters to this over that period of time.  There is an obligation on all member states to have a penalty points system in place and then to enforce it.  The overall competent authority for overseeing that is the European Commission, as well as the European Fisheries Control Agency.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charlie McConalogue:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2319\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2319&amp;amp;pid=CharlieMcConalogue&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I nodded when I was being asked whether a boat could be fished with a different master in the event that one master has received a penalty.  That will not impact on the capacity of the boat to be fished as long as the second master has a valid licence and authorisation.<\/p><p>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan went on to make a point in respect of ports where fishing happens less now.  Boats tend to be larger now than they were ten, 20 or 30 years ago.  Since the Common Fisheries Policy and the principle of relative stability were established in the early 1980s, quota share among various member states has remained stable, Brexit notwithstanding.  Obviously, Brexit has had a sideways impact on the overall relative stability among other member states, but since the early 1980s, despite many Common Fisheries Policy reviews, the percentage allocated to each member state has remained stable.<\/p><p>Following Brexit, member states' national quotas were impacted to varying extents.  Our national quota will decrease by 15% between now and the end of 2026.  The same is true of Germany, while the figure is somewhat lower for France, at 8% of its national quota.  This is something we have been forthright about and I have fought the battle at European level in that context, but it is very much a result of the Brexit negotiation, in which fisheries was one of the key battle points for the British Government.  One third of the fish we were catching was in British waters and, in the event of a no-deal scenario, we would not have had access to those waters to catch one third of the total fishing catch on which our fleet depends.<\/p><p>Another issue that has restricted fisheries somewhat over the years relates to the move to fishing according to maximum sustainable yield so as to ensure we do not overfish in a way that leads to the stock becoming depleted and endangered, which would have the side effect that the stock would not be available to be fished in the years ahead.  A number of stocks that were under pressure, having been overfished in years past, have been closed in order that they will be given time to recover.  In the case of the stocks we fish, we do so in a careful way, in accordance with science, to ensure we do not take any more fish than the stock can provide for.  Overall, what this means for fishing activity at ports is that the capacity of boats now tends to be larger and we have to manage the fish stock sustainably, within an individual percentage allocation for each member state.   Obviously, we have always fought, and will continue to fight, the battle to increase our allocation and percentage but that is always difficult to achieve.<\/p><p>Senator Lombard asked whether the system will apply to all vessels and, in particular, to UK trawlers or masters.  It is a European Common Fisheries Policy, so it applies to EU member states.  Ideally, it would apply outside of that as well, but that will be subject to negotiation with third countries.  When the UK was a member of the Common Fisheries Policy, it had its own point system, which worked in sync with the other EU point systems, but it is outside of that now.  Every year post Brexit, there have been challenges in respect of negotiating quotas with the UK and, likewise, issues such as this are subject to negotiation.  As we all can see, that engagement can be a difficult process.  As a starting point, in any event, it will apply to all EU member states and I fully accept we should engage with other countries outside of that in order that everyone takes a responsible approach, with systems that talk to one another, to try to ensure that uniform rules will apply, with commonality in respect of how they are monitored and implemented.<\/p><p>Senator Hoey asked about the threshold of proof, which I have dealt with, and about the capacity of the SFPA and the Naval Service to oversee and enforce the regulations.  I have increased significantly the resources to the SFPA over recent times and it is important that we have an enforcement authority that can carry out that role well.  Likewise, in respect of the Naval Service, the recent review of the Defence Forces will be important in informing of us about that.  It is important that all boats be held to the same threshold and that standards be enforced for all boats that fish in our waters, regardless of their positioning within our 200 mile zone.<\/p><p>I think that covers most of the questions.

I had it printed and circulated to every Member of the Oireachtas, both in the D&aacute;il and here.  One of the reasons I did that was that I was conscious of the letter that some of us had received from the Ceann Comhairle regarding Irish-Chinese relations describing the Chinese Government as our friends and advising Members of this House to have little or nothing to do with the Taiwan Government and its representatives in Ireland.  I wanted to impress upon everybody precisely why it is that the people of Taiwan are so justified in refusing to be incorporated into a cruel, despotic and totalitarian regime.<\/p> <p>I should start, perhaps, by saying that Xinjiang province is one of the most north-westerly provinces of the People's Republic of China, as it is now constituted.  It was, until approximately 20 years ago, in the majority inhabited by Turkic people who were Muslims.  They are ethnically and visually distinct from the Han Chinese.  They have different customs, different language, different religion and a different culture in its entirety.<\/p> <p>That province, what used to be called East Turkestan in some people's vocabulary, was designated an autonomous region of the Chinese republic in deference, when the Chinese people's republic was established, to the proposition that it was different from the rest of the People's Republic of China for the reasons that I have mentioned, and for other reasons.<\/p> <p>Mr. Xi, now President of the People's Republic of China, from approximately 2012 onwards, initiated a campaign of repression and dissolution of the Uyghur culture in that region in Xinjiang province.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I do not want to be too lurid in my detail of the kind of evidence that has been given to the tribunal, but it is about time it was put on the public record of these Houses, precisely how disgusting and obnoxious what has been done to the Uyghur people actually is.  Huge camps have been established in which between 1 million and 2 million people have been incarcerated for re-education.  They are taken away from their homes.  They are frequently shackled.  They are forced to live together in dormitories.  They are abused by their guards.  They are subject to indoctrination.  They have to sing pro-Beijing songs and they are beaten when they fail to show enthusiasm.  They are required to learn and to become expert in Han Chinese, the majority language of the People's Republic of China.  They spend hours and hours being indoctrinated as to the merits of the People's Republic of China, Mao Tse-tung's regime and the present regime in Beijing.  At the same time, they are asked to confess the error of their ways in adhering to their previous cultural norms and values.  A network of cameras has been established in the streets of most cities, which engage in visual recognition of people and make them all subject to constant surveillance.  Some 800,000 children have been taken away from their parents and sent to Chinese state-run boarding schools.<\/p><p>Uyghur men are not permitted to wear moustaches or beards of any kind.  Uyghur women are not permitted to adopt traditional Muslim or Turkic dress.  Their language is effectively being run out of existence.  Their religion has been crushed by the systematic demolition of mosques right across Xinjiang province.  Their entire culture is being swept away as part of a process of assimilation into what the Beijing regime hopes will be a complete assimilation of the Uyghur population - what is left of it - as a homogenous population in the People's Republic of China.<\/p><p>Far more scandalous and revolting than all of that is the detail of what happens to those people who are incarcerated.  According to testimony received by the tribunal, women are frequently stripped and gang raped.  If they are pregnant they are compulsorily subjected to abortion.  One person I was reading about was subject to an abortion six and a half months into her pregnancy.  First of all, they have their hair shaved and the like and, routinely, the women are effectively chemically sterilised by having injections of anti-fertility drugs administered to them in these places.  The situation for men is also pretty horrific.  They are shackled, put into prison dress, brought to classes and made to chant and if they show any degree of resistance, they are severely punished and beaten.  Some of them have been gang raped as well.<\/p><p>Worse than that, photographic evidence has emerged not merely of the scale of these camps, which is huge.  They are purpose built.  These are not just temporary structures or internment camps with barbed wire.  These are massive structures that are visible from space.  Worse still, hundreds and thousands of Uyghur men have been deprived of their liberty and sent in shackles, blindfolds and jumpsuits to factory locations right across China.  This is happening in our time.<\/p><p>The other point that has to be made is that many people have simply disappeared.  People do not know what happened to their relatives.  They go into these camps and they never see them again.  They do not have gas chambers but, short of that, this is on a par with the Holocaust as to the scale, deliberation and planning that lies behind it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#JJ00500","speaker":"1669","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#KK00200","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I want to draw the House's attention to pages 33 and 34 of the report which I circulated.  It shows that between 2015 and 2019, the fertility rate and reproduction of Uyghur people has plummeted.  On page 34 of the report in particular, there is a graph showing the decline in fertility rates of the Uyghurs.  Their reproduction is mainly clustered between an increase of 0% and a -60% increase whereas the Han population is continuing to grow in their area.<\/p> <p>All of these things are completely unforgivable - the abortions, forced chemical sterilisation, the brutality, rape, beatings, stripping, shaving and the exportation to forced labour across China of the menfolk.  They have been documented at great length and with remarkable objectivity by the tribunal that established itself in London to hear the testimony of Uyghur people from around the world.  I will give an example.  One Uyghur woman was persuaded to go back to China by her Uyghur employer to settle up her pension entitlements and as soon as she arrived in Xinjiang province she was thrown into this system.<\/p> <p>The tentacles of the Chinese repression go right across the world.  Uyghur men and women in the United Arab Emirates are now disappearing into black detention centres where they are interrogated by Chinese diplomats and security officers and some of them have never been heard of again.  Right across the world there is a campaign of destruction of the Uyghur people.  Anybody who speaks out against it is ruthlessly followed and repressed insofar as the brutal regime in Beijing can do it, through its network of diplomatic staff and by whatever other means.<\/p> <p>The Chinese ambassador to Ireland should not be welcome in these Houses any more because he has decried this report as untrue, false, unreliable and effectively propaganda and lies.  He is a part of the diplomatic regime in Beijing which has systematically denied the obvious truth.  When one is a Marxist-Leninist communist party with totalitarian habits it is perfectly reasonable to lie, falsify and deny the truth of anything in the cause of what one considers to be the greater good.<\/p> <p>The Chinese Government, through its diplomatic services, has sought to discredit all Uyghurs in their resistance to what is being done to them and to deny the truth of what has been found against it.

It does not want this House to do that.  It has decided to put in simply that the House further notes \"continued deep concern in relation to evidence-based reports on the treatment of the Uyghur people in Xinjiang\".  It seeks to note \"continued deep concern\".  That is not what this is about.  People are actually being compulsorily aborted.  Women are having IUDs put into them, which cannot be removed manually and require to be surgically removed.  This is what is happening.

No, I am not because it is part of a piece of constant capitulation to the wolf diplomacy of the Beijing regime.

Is &aacute;bhar an-t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; sin.<\/p> <p>The countermotion my colleague Senator Horkan has put forward on behalf of the Government takes account of our deep concern about the situation in Xinjiang and the evidence-based reports referred to on the treatment of the Uyghur people.  It also seeks concrete actions, including calling on China to allow immediate, meaningful and unfettered access for independent observers to Xinjiang.  We urge the implementation of the eight recommendations related to Xinjiang made by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, CERD.  I will return to that issue.<\/p> <p>Previously in the Seanad, the Minister of State, Deputy Colm Brophy, set out our proud history of supporting the protection of human rights around the world, including in the People's Republic of China.  Ireland is committed to the universality, indivisibility and interrelatedness of all human rights and accountability for human rights violations and abuses.  This approach is anchored in our firm commitment to international law and to agreed multilateral frameworks and bodies.  Our credibility as an independent voice on the international stage is based, in no small measure, on our promotion and defence of the rule of law as framed by the multilateral system.  That is why we engage wholeheartedly in the European Union and United Nations.<\/p> <p>The situation in Xinjiang resonates with the Irish public and, clearly, the Seanad and the D&aacute;il, and also the Government.  We emphasise to the Chinese authorities their obligation to act in a manner that ensures the full respect for the rule of law and complies with China's human rights obligations under national and international law.<\/p> <p>It has been three and a half years since the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination first published details of concerns relating to Xinjiang.  The CERD expressed alarm at the numerous reports of large-scale detentions of ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, to whom Senator McDowell referred, under what was described as the \"pretext of countering terrorism and religious extremism\".  We cannot lose sight of the obligation on the Chinese Government to respond appropriately and proportionality to whatever threats it sees.  However, it must do so in a manner that respects the human rights of the Uyghur people.  In fairness to Senator McDowell, the tribunal and the CERD, a UN body, found evidence of mass surveillance, as the Senator described it, restrictions on travel, forced returns from abroad to China and the banning of Uyghur language in certain prefectures.<\/p> <p>There are also eight recommendations, which have become the basis for Ireland's engagement with China on Xinjiang.  These include releasing individuals detailed without due process, conducting an investigation into racial profiling and analysing and reporting the ethnicity of individuals stopped by law enforcement.  The report recommended the safeguarding of individual data, the elimination of travel restrictions and the disclosure of the location and status of Uyghurs who have been returned to China against their will.  Finally, there as a call for the Chinese authorities to provide precise figures and detail on the number of people involuntarily held in extra large detention facilities.  More recent reports suggest there has been no discernible improvement in the situation since the CERD report.<\/p> <p>I understand that the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, OHCHR, is finalising an assessment of the situation in Xinjiang to be shared with the authorities in China.  For Ireland, this is a very important step, particularly in lieu of a national visit.  Ireland and other like-minded countries continue to call for the High Commissioner to have meaningful access to Xinjiang.  It is standard practice that the High Commissioner would only undertake a national visit with certain guarantees from the host government, including unfettered access to key sites and the right to speak to activists.  China should facilitate the terms for such a visit without delay.<\/p> <p>Ireland has spoken out bilaterally and in the multilateral system on Xinjiang.  It is my firm belief that the best way to push for change in Chinese policy in Xinjiang is to engage with the Chinese authorities.  Like the vast majority of countries, Ireland engages with China on various issues, including tourism, educational exchanges, cultural exchange, etc.  We can do this.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, raised concerns with his Chinese counterpart, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, during his visit to China in May 2021.  It is equally important that we work in co-operation with like-minded states through the multilateral system to demand focus on this issue.  At the 48th UN Human Rights Council in September 2021, Ireland joined an EU group statement of 26 member states calling on China to comply with its obligations under national and international law to respect and protect human rights, including in Xinjiang.<\/p> <p>In October 2021, Ireland joined a cross-regional statement on the situation in Xinjiang delivered at the third committee of the 76th UN General Assembly.  Recalling what Senator McDowell said, the statement to which we signed up calls attention to the arbitrary detention of over 1 million people in Xinjiang and the systematic human rights violations, including reports documenting torture or cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment or punishment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Thomas Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2203\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2203&amp;amp;pid=ThomasByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As the world becomes increasingly aware of the plight of the Uyghurs, and this awareness will expand as a result of this Seanad debate and that is very welcome, more and more countries have joined this multilateral effort.  In 2019, 23 countries signed a similar statement.  In 2020, this increased to 39 countries.  In 2021, 43 countries signed.<\/p><p>In March 2021, the EU agreed on a global human rights sanctions regime, which allows the EU to target serious human rights violations and abuses by state and non-state actors worldwide.  Given the EU's continued concern about the situation in Xinjiang, the EU has targeted four Chinese persons and one entity with an assets freeze and travel ban.  The use of these sanctions is designed to act as a deterrent and encourage changes in these actors' behaviour.  Sanctions are based on solid legal evidence and are deployed alongside other measures, including dialogue, to which I referred earlier.  In response, China has put sanctions on EU academics, parliamentarians and diplomats.  This constitutes an attack on academic freedom and freedom of expression.<\/p><p>Today the Seanad is considering a report by the Uyghur people's tribunal.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has studied this report in detail, as we do with all information available pertaining to the situation in Xinjiang.  I recognise the dedication of those who want to draw attention to the issue.  I am familiar with the work of the World Uyghur Congress and consider the report a further contribution to our broader understanding of the situation in Xinjiang.  I recognise the strength of feeling in the House on the situation.  I will say this however.  Notwithstanding the conclusions outlined by Senator McDowell, which correspond with similar conclusions of UN bodies, the Uyghur people's tribunal lacks due judicial authority to make any legal determination.  It is not established by a sovereign state, an international agreement or an international organisation.  It does not have any jurisdiction under international law.  The Government is concerned about accepting the findings.  This gets to the point made by Senator McDowell.  Senator McDowell was quite flippant in what he said at the very end of what was a very good speech outlining the serious human rights difficulties.  I have set out very similar concerns to those he set out in equally strong terms.  I am also setting out that the Irish Government works within a multilateral system.  If we go outside this it risks undermining the rule of law framework on which we base our international engagement.<\/p><p>Last week in the D&aacute;il, we were asked what we were doing about various issues in the UN Security Council.  People felt we were not doing enough.  Today I have outlined a huge range of measures that have been taken by various parts of the United Nations.  While our countermotion does what Senator McDowell said it does, in that it eliminates the final four words, it also adds on practical steps the Government proposes be allowed to be taken.  Senator McDowell is looking for a statement making a declaration from the Seanad on this issue.  This is a reasonable position to take.  The Government is setting out many of the concerns he raised.  We are not really apart on this.  We also set out practical steps.  The flippancy with which the Senator delivered the last few sentences of his speech is not appropriate in this context and does not reflect the work the Government has done and continues to do.  The Government continues to speak out on this issue.  Ireland's credibility as a global actor is anchored in our commitment to the rules-based multilateral order.<\/p><p>\"Genocide\" is a legal term that has a particular meaning as Senator McDowell knows.  Ireland follows the practice of recognising genocide where it has been established by a final decision of a court in Ireland, by a judgment of an international court or where there is international consensus on the matter.  The people's tribunal referred to by Senator McDowell has done significant work collating reports from different sources.  I am not here to castigate the Senator or what he said.  It is important to underline that while the tribunal is useful and significant, it does not have the standing and authority to make determinations of criminal responsibility.  Neither does our approach to the people's tribunal undermine the seriousness with which we consider China's activities in Xinjiang.<\/p><p>Ireland has a wide-ranging relationship with China.  We have strong engagement across the spectrum.  We are anxious to build partnerships with China on a range of global challenges.  While these strong links exist, there are serious differences in our relationship.  The situation in Xinjiang is one.  I want to be absolutely clear about this.  I reassure the Seanad that in our bilateral relations with China and through our participation in multilateral organisations, Ireland will continue to pursue this matter and seek better protection of human rights for the Uyghur people.  There is no doubt this debate in the Seanad will contribute to the awareness that is very important to move on the issue and bring more countries on board.  Senator McDowell will note this would also be significant for the outcome all of us in the House want.  The steps proposed in the Government's countermotion are practical measures relating to activities and actions taking place under the framework of the United Nations.  We are very much part of the United Nations and a member of the Security Council.

I thought it was useful that we would have the response of the Minister of State and the Department to Senator McDowell's very clear and damning acknowledgement of what is happening in this part of western China.  I certainly do not doubt the findings of what is going on.  There are far too many people involved from different organisations, including the United Nations and the Uyghur Tribunal.<\/p> <p>I take the point from the diplomatic service, the Minister of State and the Department on where we draw the line on accepting a report from a body that is not officially internationally recognised as such.  However, I do not doubt for a minute anything Senator McDowell has said.  What he has brought to the Chamber has done a service and not only to us in understanding what is going on.  I have to say I would be fairly sure an awful lot of people in Ireland do not know the level of activity and oppression going on in this part of the world.  Unfortunately, I know more about it now than I did before.  It is absolutely horrific to imagine that this type of behaviour is going on unfettered.  It is not the only thing the Chinese authorities seem to be doing.  We know of its relationship with Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet, the Falun Dafa and even Christians.  It has a particular style and approach that we would not tolerate or expect and we should not allow this House or any other House to say any of that activity is okay.<\/p> <p>I would much prefer if the Department had felt it could have accepted what Senator McDowell had said.  This is my opinion.  I understand there are protocols in place and Government formats that need to be adhered to from its perspective.  We have a relationship with China and we need to understand that relationship.  The Chinese also need to realise we are not okay with what is happening in this part of China.  We are not okay with the relationship with Taiwan.  We are not okay with what is happening in Hong Kong and the guarantees it gave and has continually eroded since.<\/p> <p>I was asked to speak on the motion on behalf of our spokesperson on foreign affairs who is not available.  I do not pretend to be an expert on the Uyghur people or the region in China they are from.  I take on board what Senator McDowell is saying and I am sure Senator Mullen will say something similar.  I ask them not to take it personally.  I am here as a person representing the Government group.  It would have been much easier for me if the amendment had not had to be tabled but that was what the Government felt was necessary and sometimes this happens.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerry Horkan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2476\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As a former Attorney General, T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Senator McDowell knows that protocols must sometimes be followed and that things less than palatable must be taken as compromises.  This amendment is trying to bring as much of Senator Mullen's motion on board as possible.  It is acknowledges &quot;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann notes the publication of the judgement of the Uyghur Tribunal on 9th December, 2021&quot; and:<\/p><blockquote>\t  \tfurther notes:  <blockquote>\t- continued deep concern in relation to evidence-based reports on the treatment of the Uyghur people in Xinjiang;  <\/blockquote>calls on: <blockquote>\t- China to allow immediate, meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang for independent observers, including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and her Office, and relevant special procedure mandate holders; <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote><p>We should not just be calling for that, we should be insisting on it, particularly in light of our seat on the UN Security Council.  The amendment then urges &quot;the immediate implementation of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination&rsquo;s eight recommendations related to Xinjiang&quot;.<br\/><br\/>We are not dismissing the motion and we are certainly not saying that it does not have merit.  The Senator has done an enormous service by bringing it forward in this Chamber in order to allow us to have this debate.  He can probably tell from the sizeable number of people here that not many are going to try to defend the indefensible.  I cannot speak for all the Government Senators, but I know that nobody is going to defend the Chinese Communist Party regime's behaviour in this regard, nor in any other.<br\/><br\/>Many Government Senators, including Senators Malcolm Byrne, Ward, Joe O&rsquo;Reilly, myself and others, have criticised these things in the past.  It is unfortunate that the Government amendment to the motion had to be tabled, but I understand why that had to happen.  There are other relationships at play here.  We all understand the difficulties recently experienced in the context of the case of Richard O&rsquo;Halloran.  Indeed, the case might not have turned out as it did.  It was a horrific incident, but, thankfully, the conclusion arrived at was better than the alternative, which could still exist for others.<br\/><br\/>I appeal from this side of the House to the Chinese regime, not that it is necessarily going to listen to the Seanad r the Irish people, but it should acknowledge that there is worldwide concern and deep concern-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#MM00300","speaker":"1696","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Any advance on that deep concern?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#NN00200","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":153,"content":"<p>Senator Horkan, without interruption please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#NN00300","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Mullen.

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also thank the Independent group of Senators for tabling this motion.  It is an important discussion.  There has clearly been a breakdown of human rights in Xinjiang province.  A systematic effort is under way to destroy a culture, a heritage and a way of life.  While there is not full extermination under way, through the sterilisation process, abortion, etc., there is, effectively, an effort being made to exterminate a people.  We are talking about something extremely serious here.<\/p><p>Before I comment on the tribunal, I will cite a few other sources.  There is universal awareness of this issue now, but I will cite a few more sources, if only to read the material into the Official Report.  On 12 July 2021, <i>The Economist<\/i>stated that 1 million Uyghurs &ldquo;are in prison camps&rdquo; and that people are put into those camps for the following reasons: &ldquo;having contact with [...] relatives oversea [...] growing a beard&rdquo;, showing too much of their own culture or religious behaviour, or anything that shows that Uyghurs are engaging in their traditions.  The same article went on to cite practices within the camps, including &ldquo;forced labour, torture and forced female sterilisations&rdquo;.  Frighteningly, one in ten Uyghurs has at some point been interned in these detention centres.  This includes one sixth of young men and one third of middle-aged men.  That is a shocking statistic.  People are sent to the camps because of information obtained through monitoring using surveillance cameras, mobile phones and medical records.  All of those sources are used as a basis to detain people.  Pressure is being applied in so many ways.  The article to which I refer also indicates that &ldquo;16,000 mosques in Xinjiang have been destroyed or damaged since 2017, around 65% of the total&rdquo;, with 8,000 having been demolished.<\/p><p>Another source, <i>USA Today<\/i>, in April 2021 referred to forced labour camps, torture and it being a crime for Uyghurs to demonstrate anything to do with their culture.  This piece stated that up to 50 people were being held in cells measuring 22 sq. m.  There is a litany of crimes against humanity.  Those in the cells are observed all the time by CCTV, and they suffer fingernail extractions, beatings, the use of tiger clamps, etc.  I watched a &quot;Dispatches&quot; programme on Channel 4 recently, which referred to people being submerged in cold water, confined in cages, the use of metal weights, people being raped and subjected to other sexual violence, the provision of bad food and the withdrawal of food being used as a punishment.<\/p><p>Researchers with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, using satellite evidence, have found that 380 detention camps have been &quot;newly built or significantly expanded since 2017&quot;, and that there are more than 14,000 such camps overall.  A report from Amnesty International has cited married women of childbearing age being targeted for sterilisation.  Equally, the BBC had a special report on this issue on &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot;.  Meanwhile, <i>The Washington Post<\/i>recently urged that the pending UN report on abuses in Xinjiang be published, which is necessary, and referred to China only wanting UN human rights' officials in the country as visitors rather than as observers.<\/p><p>Turning to the report of the tribunal, which has been very helpfully circulated by Senator McDowell, it refers to detainees being &quot;forced to take medicines by mouth&quot; and &quot;forced to provide blood samples and being subjected to other medical testing&quot;.  This is all so reminiscent of what happened during the Second World War and the horrors perpetrated by the Nazi regime.  The tribunal report continues by outlining how &quot;Pregnant women, in detention centres [...] were forced to have abortions even at the very last stages of pregnancy&quot;.  It also details how Uyghurs are subjected to intense monitoring and surveillance, and constantly so inside cells, and how &quot;facial recognition and advanced technologies&quot; are used to target people.  The &quot;Dispatches&quot; programme I watched a few weeks ago described Xinjiang province as effectively being an open prison.  The tribunal report also states, &quot;Children as young as a few months were separated from their families and placed in orphanages or state-run boarding schools&quot;.  The report goes on and on in the same vein.  Senator McDowell very eloquently described the litany of crimes in his contribution.  All the details can be read in the tribunal report.<\/p><p>One would like to have the time to read a lot of it into the record, but I do not.  Regarding the amendment to the motion, the Government accepts everything being put forward in the motion.  It is purely intended to state that this issue should be addressed through the UN and international bodies; it does not question the evidence of this tribunal report.  In fact, this information correlates with all the evidence from the international media and Amnesty International.  The amendment does not question the tribunal report; it only suggests the appropriate mechanism to address this issue.  We will try to discuss this matter with as much consensus as is possible as the debate progresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#NN00600","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  The last time a motion was before the Seanad regarding the treatment of the Uyghur people by the Chinese Government, my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, spoke clearly and directly on this matter.  Unfortunately, he is unable to be with us this week and he has asked me to step in.  I will reiterate what he said on that last occasion.  Sinn F&eacute;in is deeply concerned about reports of the treatment of the Uyghur minority in China.  Those reports are very concerning and warrant urgent attention.  It is believed that 1 million Uyghur people are in prison.  This is totally unacceptable.  Amnesty International has expressed its alarm at the situation, as has the UN.  Like all minorities and all people, the Uyghurs should be treated with dignity and respect.  They should be able to live their lives free from intimidation or repression.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For our part, Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to highlight the plight of those who face persecution and are denied basic human rights.

This is never acceptable and must never be tolerated, no matter where it is.  <\/p><p>This State's seat on the UN Security Council will only mean something if it is used in support of repressed people around the world, including those such as the Uyghurs in China, the Palestinian people and anywhere else where injustice and abuse of human rights prevails.

We need to acknowledge that often official relationships, and working within officialdom, in a sense, can be compromised when it comes to holding states to account.  People's tribunals have provided a voice to the voiceless to advocate for legal and institutional reform.  They have the potential to contribute to substantial rule of law and they should not be seen as something separate from or outside of, but as another body that can hold to account the bodies spoken about in the reasoning as to why we have introduce this in terms of unilateralism, the Security Council and the tribunal not being official.<\/p> <p>On 9 December, the UK's Uyghur Tribunal found the Chinese Government guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of committing genocide, crimes against humanity and torturing Uyghurs and other minorities in north-west China.  Nine short weeks after this verdict, China welcomed the world for the Winter Olympics and the Winter Paralympic Games.  Countries around the world, including the UK, US and Canada, have protested and engaged in a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics, citing the gross human rights abuses against Muslim ethnic minorities, which were confirmed by the 9 December verdict.  <\/p> <p>A date which could not be more significant in global history, 9 December marks the International Day of Commemoration and Dignity of the Victims of the Crime of Genocide and Prevention of this Crime.  A date on which we, as part of an international community, think of the 1948 Genocide Convention, which was signed on the same day 73 years previously, and when we said, \"Never again.\"  The fact that the Uyghur Tribunal announced its decision on this day is, therefore, very fitting.  It situates it firmly within the darkest chapters of human history.  The Uyghur Tribunal implores us all, especially Ireland, considering our role on the UN Security Council, to take a leading role in publicly recognising the genocide of Uyghur people and, subsequently, taking the appropriate actions to show, rather than simply saying, \"Never again.\"  Unless we take real and tangible actions condemning the abhorrent behaviour of China's Government, we are tacitly encouraging this genocide and future genocides.  We know there will be future genocides should this be allowed to slip.<\/p> <p>The verdict delivered in the UK's tribunal is clear that the Chinese Government was responsible for deliberately lowering the birth rates of Uyghurs, indicative of the Chinese state's genocidal intentions.  In announcing its judgment, the tribunal stated that it is satisfied that the People's Republic of China has effected a deliberate, systematic and concerted policy with the object of so-called optimising the population of Xinjiang.  What the Chinese Government calls \"optimising the population\" is, by any other definition, genocide.  This is a fact made clear in Article II(d) of the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which defines the act of genocide as, \"Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group\". <\/p> <p>Official statistics from the Chinese Government revealed during the course of the tribunal indicate that there was a 48.7% decline in birth rate in ethnic minority areas of Xinjiang.  Yet, we have an amendment here stating we are deeply concerned.  I am sure they are looking at us and are saying, \"You can keep your concern.\"<\/p> <p>As shocking as these figures are, they should not come as a surprise.  We have heard them all before.  It was only in December, on that evening, when many of us were in here flagging the same atrocities taking place in Xinjiang.  These crimes were subsequently laid bare in the UN Special Rapporteur's report, which highlighted evidence suggesting that the Chinese Government has continued to use Uyghur and other ethnic minorities for organ harvesting.    <\/p> <p>What is most concerning is how these crimes are being powered.  The report outlines the use of repressive AI-based technology used in targeting ethnic minorities in China.  We know camera surveillance has become a feature of daily life for Uyghur Muslims and members of other ethnic minorities in China, both inside and outside the gates of the camps.  <\/p> <p>Testimonies from survivors and experts at the tribunal detailed that as the presence of cameras grew, so did the technological capabilities.  Expert testimony at the UK tribunal detailed how companies, such as Huawei, the multinational hardware firm, and Hikvision, the largest global camera manufacturer, developed and tested technology that would detect a Uyghur from the Han Chinese majority.  This facial recognition technology plays a role in tracking and eventual detention of the Uyghurs.  <\/p> <p>Earlier we spoke about this not being official but people are experiencing this.  They are official, regardless of where they give their testimony.  It is their experience and we should accept that, no matter what avenue it comes through.  We should not dismiss it just because it is not official in the Government's eyes in terms of being the tribunal.  <\/p> <p>First, in co-ordination with other western states and allies, Ireland should stigmatise those responsible for designing and implementing repression in Xinjiang through strategic messaging and diplomatic interventions and boycotts.  The US, for example, has issued increasingly powerful sanctions against China.  So far, it has publicly sanctioned one government entity, about 50 Chinese firms and four officials in connection with the persecution of Uyghurs.  Canada, under its Sergei Magnitsky Law, and the UK, which recently implemented its own version of the Global Magnitsky Act, called Global Human Rights, imposed financial and other restrictions on foreign nationals responsible for or complicit in violating internationally recognised human rights. <\/p> <p>I ask the Government to think about its amendment, which removes the words \"accepts its findings\" and changes them to \"deep concern\".  It removes the urgency, actions and seriousness of it.  We should be calling for sanctions.  Unfortunately, it took until Senator Joe O'Reilly raised this before anyone made an impassioned contribution about what was going on for people.  The two other Government Members protested as to why it is putting forward this amendment.  I did not feel any sense of the people that we are talking about in their contributions and it is deeply upsetting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#OO00200","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it freisin.  At the outset, let me say that I have read this report.  It took a little bit of time because there is an enormous amount of detail, testimony and evidence in it.  It is disturbing, in no uncertain terms, but it is not surprising, because this is not the first we have heard of what is happening in Xinjiang and to the Uyghur Autonomous Region.<\/p> <p>There are Uyghurs living in Ireland and throughout the world, most of whom can never go home.  They do not know what has happened to their families, parents, brothers, sisters or friends, as they can have no contact with them.  What is happening there is unconscionable, indefensible and clear.  However, nothing the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, said disagrees with that analysis.  I never heard him say that this is not correct or not accurate.  I know Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, one of the QCs involved in drawing up this report.  I have worked with him and have enormous respect for him.  I do not quibble with anything that is in this report.

The application of the rule of law being one of them, however unsatisfying that is.  I would disagree with Senator Ruane in saying that the amendment that the Government tabled in any way diminishes the recognition of what is in this report.  It recognises, unfortunately, that this not a report that the Government can accept, which I understand, however unpleasant and unhappy that is.  I understand why we, as a Government and member of the international community that is bound by all of those conventions and rules, cannot wholesale accept it.  <\/p> <p>That said, we also know there are other more official and officially-based reports that are saying the same thing.  I am not aware of any Government in the western world that is disavowing the contents of this or saying that what is being described in this report is not happening.  We know it is.

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I thank my colleague and friend Senator McDowell, in particular, for leading off this Private Members' business on behalf of the Seanad Independent Group.  At many times in this House, I have used the analogy that we need to shine a light in a dark place.  If ever there was a time to do this, it is today.  As politicians elected, it is great to say, in a democracy, we have to be defenders of human rights, dignity and respect for people.  We are wasting our time if we cannot use this Chamber, Parliament and Republic to advocate for people like the Uyghur people.  That is an important point to which I and many of us in the House are committed.<\/p> <p>I also thank my colleague for going to the trouble and taking the time to print the Uyghur Tribunal judgment before Christmas and to send us an accompanying letter, which I understand he sent to every Member of the Oireachtas.  I sincerely thank him for that.  It made for harrowing reading and set out a litany of issues, including forced sterilisation and abortions, massive internment camps, suppression of religion and culture, forced internal migration, slave labour and genocide.  How can anyone stand here and say we are concerned?  We are more than concerned.  The people outside the House looking in will make their call.  It will not be what we are saying or are trying to convince them.  They will make their call.  Are we true defenders of human rights or are we not?<\/p> <p>The Uyghur people have been subjected to unconscionable crimes against humanity that amount to an act of genocide.  The independent tribunal chair, Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, has confirmed that to the world.  The UK-based Uyghur Tribunal team hope that by processing, publishing and laying this evidence in the public domain, it will, with the international press, the international community and international human rights defenders, compel international attention and tackle the alleged abuses against these people, a largely Muslim ethnic group.<\/p> <p>The tribunal report states that there is evidence that detainees have been confined in containers up to their neck in cold water, shackled in heavy metal chains and immobilised for months and possibly years.  It states that some of the detained have been subjected to extreme sexual violence, including gang rapes, penetration with electric shock rods and iron bars.  Women were raped by men paying to be allowed in to detention centres for that purpose.  This is all clearly set out in the report.  The tribunal found evidence of enforced abortions, the removal of women's wombs against their will, the killing of babies immediately after their birth, and the mass enforcement of sterilisation through the insertion of IUD devices that are only removable by surgical means.  How harrowing and shocking.  Hundreds of thousands of Uyghur children have been taken from their families and placed in Han-run boarding schools.  Burial grounds have been bulldozed or built over, mosques have been destroyed and religious practice has been banned.  That is what this tribunal has uncovered - human suffering and breaches of international human rights law.<\/p> <p>As elected politicians, people place their trust in us to be fearless defenders of human rights.  Fearless journalists have highlighted this on the international stage and I commend them.  I particularly want to commend those in our national press and the international press who have highlighted this.  We need them; they need us.  Words such as \"uncertainly\", \"solidarity\" and \"hope\" are used by many.  They come to mind now.  We must stand in solidarity with these people.  We must use our Chamber, Seanad &Eacute;ireann, to shine a light in a very dark place.  We must be a beacon of hope and light for these people.  Let us stand in solidarity and park our political difference.  Let us forget about the scripts that come from Iveagh House.  Let us forget about the different agendas.  Let us send a clear message today to the international world that this is a priority and that we, Irish politicians, are defenders of human rights.  We deserve that place.  We have earned it in the past.  We will continue to advocate for it.<\/p> <p>I must say I cannot support these amendments.  If I were a Senator listening to this debate, I would get into my car and get into this Chamber because, today, we will have votes and we will send a signal.  Do we really stand in solidarity with these people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#PP00900","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I took the Order of Business the day Senator McDowell raised this issue before Christmas.

We can look back on some of the documentaries, including &quot;The Death of Yugoslavia&quot; from the BBC, which is upsetting, very graphic but very insightful in what it says.<\/p><p>I accept this report, which speaks about crimes against humanity, deportation and forceful transfer of population, proved beyond reasonable doubt.  The report states the evidence, &quot;leaves the Tribunal satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the crime against humanity of imprisonment or severe deprivation of civil liberty is proved&quot;.  It states, &quot;The Tribunal is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the crime against humanity of torture is proved&quot;.  It states, &quot;The Tribunal is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the crime against humanity of rape and enforced sterilisation and which may include other forms of sexual violence is proved&quot;.

It states, &quot;The Tribunal is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the crime against humanity of enforced disappearance of persons is proved&quot;.<\/p><p>There are references to matters that are not proved and this suggests it is a balanced report that was not a <i>carte blanche<\/i>instrument for everything brought before the tribunal.  The participants have considered the matters and, for example, there is no evidence of mass killing so the crime against humanity of extermination is not proved.  There is an absence of proof of the intended crime against humanity of murder and it is not proved.  This report is balanced and based on lived experiences and testimony, as reflected by contributions of Members to this House over preceding months.<\/p><p>The role of the Seanad should be to give a voice to concerns and we would be found wanting if we did not do so.  It is no fault of the Minister of State that the Cabinet decided not to accept the recommendations and pursue this at United Nations level but I regret that.  We celebrated the winning of the seat on the UN Security Council - some more than others - but what are such achievements for if at times we are not able to make a statement of our views and what we think happens in the world?  China is not a country that will establish a tribunal to see how the Uyghur population lives.  It is not like a tribunal that we might set up on past decisions.  We are a democratic country, faults and all, and we set up tribunals from time to time to look at things.  Those tribunals report back and nobody doubts the due process and its validity, the independence of the Judiciary or retired members of the Judiciary that make presentations, or the barristers or senior counsel that are appointed.  Such a process is not possible in such cases in China.  Therefore, the Uyghur population took it upon themselves to carry out a tribunal into happenings - that is probably not a strong enough word - and the barbarity that has been visited on their population.<\/p><p>As I stated, our role should be to support motions.

I am not one of the people who generally condemns &Eacute;amon de Valera or de Valera's Ireland.  De Valera was a very gifted man and did many things that were good.  It is generally accepted that perhaps a low point was when he called on the German Embassy at the end of the Second World War, when Hitler died.  To give de Valera his due, he waited until Hitler was dead.  The Chinese regime bestrides the world, and it is when the regime is at its full power, perpetrating its many horrors, that the Irish Government, among other governments, kowtows dramatically to its will.<\/p> <p>Ireland's approach to China is craven and sycophantic.  It is not the fault of the Minister of State that he is required, by virtue of being in office, to stand up here and give a speech that is remarkable for all the words it does not use.  His speech did not enumerate a single instance of horrors being perpetrated on the Uyghur people.  The Minister of State encouraged the Seanad to amend Senator McDowell's word-perfect motion so as to avoid even commending the tribunal.  I can see the Minister of State's point, or at least there is a case that can be stated, about how the Government might feel constrained and not be able to accept the findings.  That does not justify the whip being used on Members of the Seanad or seeking to prevent the Seanad from accepting the findings of this tribunal.  There was absolutely no reason for the Government side of the Seanad to propose an amendment to the motion that would avoid even commending the tribunal.<\/p> <p>As much as I accept the sincerity of speakers on the Government side, therefore, I must say that by supporting the Government-inspired and required amendment, they are today being an enabler in the silencing of the horrors going on.  I would go further to say the Government Members ought to vote with the motion as it stands.  They are not the Government but Members in the Seanad and they are entitled to take a view on the authenticity and veracity of the tribunal's work and findings.  The words missing from the Minister of State's speech include \"horror\", \"torture\", \"abuse\", \"outrage\", \"condemn\", \"evil\", \"shame\" and, perhaps most of all, \"consequences\".  The Government is determined to use only language that is satisfactory in the eyes of the Chinese Communist Party and its regime.  These are the Government's weasel words, or if one likes, the Government's Uyghur words that we have had to listen to here today.<\/p> <p>There are many references that are meant to be complimentary to Senator McDowell.  It is indicated at the outset that the engagement on Xinjiang is not anti-China and as we challenge Chinese policy in Xinjiang, we do not seek to undermine Chinese sovereignty.  It is like saying that as we kowtow to China's human rights abuses, we do not seek to remove Senator McDowell's right to speak, at least not until China might require us to do so.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister of State ever say that China's sovereignty does not extend so far as to remove it from scrutiny and criticism of the human rights abuses in which it is engaging?  Will he acknowledge that China is engaging in them?  Will he go further than expressing mere \"deep concern\", hiding behind international institutions and saying we should let them in so they can tell us what is going on?  Does he accept that China is perpetrating these horrors?  If he does accept it, something more is needed beyond what the Minister of State delivered to us today.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I have often used in jest that distortion of the biblical line to the effect that meek shall inherit the earth by adding \"If that's all right with you fellas\".  The latter characterises the Government's communications in respect of China.  It does not utter a word without first checking that it will not offend the Chinese regime.  As a result, it presents us with a highly and unacceptably sanitised version of reality.<\/p><p>I am glad to hear that there will be engagement with the head of the World Uyghur Congress.  However, I expect the Government to use its access to the media to bring that gentleman and his entourage to the forefront during the days on which he might be in Ireland in order that his case will be fully heard.  The Government could at least be an enabler in the context the message of pain and suffering and the plea for help that are coming from the Uyghur people.  The Chinese Government, make no mistake, will be absolutely delighted that there is no free vote for Government Senators here today.  That suits its playbook very well indeed.<\/p><p>I will make one final point.  The Government is not completely dishonest about its true motivations because the Minister of State referred to the international trading framework.

I was in Taipei - Senator Horkan was with me - I went to the European Union representative office there.  I found out what they thought about Iveagh House in Dublin.  We were by far the outlier in the European Union.  We were the most nervous and timid people.  We would not use their office for any purpose.  On the last occasion when this was mentioned in this House, the Minister of State's colleague stated that Ireland has commercial relations with Taiwan.  Iveagh House removed its office from Taiwan to Singapore because it was so afraid of the Chinese.  Let us get to the truth and stop blathering in order to cover up the weakness of Irish policy in respect of China.  Let us tell the truth.

No penalties exist for giving false or misleading information to PIAB.<\/p> <p>As we know, PIAB was established almost two decades ago to ease pressure on the courts by allowing personal injuries claims to be dealt with and settled without recourse to litigation, thereby avoiding unnecessary legal costs and delays.  A claimant can apply to PIAB for an assessment of his or her claim for damages.  The respondent, which is usually, but not always, an insurance company, can consent to that assessment.  PIAB then decides whether to make an award, and the parties can choose whether to accept it.  Once it is accepted, it becomes legally enforceable.<\/p> <p>If at any stage both parties do not consent to the assessment process or agree to the suggested award, PIAB grants authorisation for the claimant to issue court proceedings in the normal way.  PIAB has certainly diverted tens of thousands of personal injuries claims from the courts in its time, but it is by no means a perfect system.  The number of applications received by PIAB that are not resolved deserves some scrutiny.<\/p> <p>On average, PIAB receives 31,000 applications each year, which number was down to about 26,000 in 2020.  Many thousands of cases do not result in an award.  Does that mean some of the applications are unmeritorious or possibly false?  It almost certainly does but the problem is that we simply do not know the numbers because, at present, it is not an offence to give false information to PIAB.  As a result, PIAB is not required to report to the Minister on any such cases of false information that it may encounter.  However, we would be naive to think every single application was based on the truth and the whole truth.  This is particularly the case given that there is no legal sanction of any kind in the 2003 Act for submitting false or misleading information to PIAB.  Claimants can take a punt on submitting a false claim, and unscrupulous respondents can take a punt on submitting false information to repel a genuine claim, without any risk of sanction.  It is like getting to put a chip on the roulette wheel without even having to buy it.<\/p> <p>Is there a lacuna in the law?  There most certainly is.  When this issue was first brought to my attention last year, I must confess I was sceptical, believing there must surely be some kind of penalty for those who tell lies to PIAB.  There is not.  Ultimately, it is not against the law to tell lies, but we have many examples of where untruths are prohibited by law.  The laws against perjury have existed in common law since time immemorial and have recently been codified in statute law.  Other examples, more relevant to the non-judicial set-up that PIAB involves, are applications for social welfare payments under the Social Welfare Acts and statements made in returns and applications to the Revenue Commissioners under the Finance Acts, in respect of which applicants are clearly and repeatedly told they may be prosecuted if their applications are not truthful in all material respects.  Applicants for the fair deal scheme under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 also face prosecution for any material untruths in their applications.  If the use of false information in each of these circumstances attracts a serious criminal sanction, why should providing false information to PIAB not be treated in the same way?<\/p> <p>In addition to enacting the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003, the Oireachtas enacted the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, which applies serious penalties for making false claims for personal injuries before the courts.  When one thinks about it, one finds it remarkable that these cases do happen.  In 2017, Zurich and the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, exposed an organised fraud by a group that took out insurance policies just prior to staging accidents.  The point, though, is that if false statements in the course of personal injuries litigation in the courts attract such serious penalties &mdash; they attract up to ten years in prison and a fine of up to &euro;100,000 &mdash; surely the use of false information in a claim to PIAB, or in defence of a genuine claim, should attract at least some kind of penalty?  It does not, however.<\/p> <p>If, as we see in cases that arise and are reported every so often, people are willing to make false statements in court, putting themselves at risk of perjury charges, can we seriously believe no false information is being given to PIAB if it can be given without sanction?<\/p> <p>The text of my Bill is quite straightforward.  It is short and almost self-explanatory.  Under the 2003 Act, there are three main circumstances in which a person might find himself or herself submitting information to PIAB: making an application; providing further information or documentation in response to PIAB; and submitting information as a third party, such as an expert, to enable PIAB to assess a claim.  As the legislation stands, there is no penalty for submitting false information.  My Bill amends each of the relevant sections to include an additional subsection whereby a claimant or any other person who \"knowingly gives the Board information which is false or misleading in a material particular is guilty of an offence.\"<\/p> <p>Taking from the existing provisions in the Act regarding such events as it provides for, mainly acts of PIAB personnel that might be criminal, we are talking about the imposition on summary conviction of a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both.  These penalties will apply to each of the three new offences created by my Bill.<\/p> <p>It is important to note that the amendments in the Bill would prohibit a person from \"knowingly\" giving the board information that is false or misleading.  The other enactments I have referred to, including the fair deal legislation, make it an offence for an applicant to \"knowingly or recklessly\" submit false information.  Therefore, what am I doing in my Bill?  Without getting too far into the reeds of the matter, I believe colleagues will be aware that there is an important distinction in criminal law between an act that is committed \"knowingly\" and one that is committed \"recklessly\".  An act committed \"knowingly\" means just that &mdash; an act committed deliberately, with full knowledge and foresight.  An act committed \"recklessly\" has a different legal meaning.  In layman's terms, it can include actions that are just rash or careless.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Therefore, a test of recklessness creates a lower threshold to be met in order to get a conviction.<br\/><br\/>What this Bill aims to prevent is the deliberate use of false information, <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">not information which might be submitted carelessly, rashly, naively or incorrectly.  PIAB is intended to be a process which is engaged with by ordinary people without legal representation, even if in the great majority of cases solicitors are involved.  Given the involvement of people who are sometimes not legally represented, I believe it would be wrong to include the lower threshold of recklessness because it might result in people being unfairly caught out for careless or inadvertent errors in their claims.  To be caught by my legislation, one has to knowingly submit false information.  What is needed is for people who deliberately submit false information to be held to account, and that is the reason the Bill has been drafted in this way.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> It may well be the case that providing false information to PIAB could in certain circumstances, at least in theory, contravene section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, which makes it an offence to &quot;dishonestly, with the intention of making a gain for himself or herself or another, or of causing loss to another, by any deception induces another to do or refrain from doing an act...&quot;.  If one intends to make a gain and one induces a person to do something or not do something by any deception, that is fraud.  However, if this provision was in fact an effective tool against false information being submitted to PIAB, we would surely be aware of cases where prosecutions were brought.  My office has not been able to find a single such case, and practitioners in this area to whom I have spoken are also not aware of any such cases.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> Second, the provision I have just referred to would be of no use in the situation where knowingly false information is given but does not lead to a payment following a PIAB assessment.  Third, false information by the respondents in PIAB claims may well not come under that section, since it might be a stretch to say that they are seeking to make a gain or cause a loss by submitting false information to defend a claim.  They are just trying to prevent a loss to themselves in that situation.  In other words, the legislation would not catch them for fraud.<\/font>There may be situations where false statements are made at PIAB stage in an attempt to get a win there but later, when the case proceeds to court, the party mends its hand and does not repeat the false information there because of the perjury and other sanctions.  In that situation, a person could get away scot-free as well.<br\/><br\/>Clearly, there is a lacuna in several situations and, quite possibly, even in situations where one might think the fraud legislation would apply, it is not workable.  The 2001 Act, or the fraud legislation as I call it, therefore is a non-runner for dealing with a range of possible scenarios involving fraud, attempted or accomplished.  The amendments proposed in my Bill bring about a clear and straightforward means of dealing with this problem, in that they prohibit knowingly false statements to PIAB under any of the scenarios I have outlined.  The ultimate outcome of PIAB assessment, and therefore the issue of whether a gain or loss is caused by an award being made, becomes irrelevant.<br\/><br\/>I raised this in a Commencement matter in June 2021.  The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy James Browne, told me there was no lacuna.  He said that if we were to introduce what I was proposing, it would effectively turn PIAB into a quasi-judicial body.  With the greatest of respect to him, expecting people to tell the truth in their dealings with PIAB does not turn PIAB into a quasi-judicial body, no more than expecting people to tell the truth in their dealings with the Department of Social Protection or the HSE would turn any of those bodies into quasi-judicial bodies.  After all, neither PIAB nor any of those other bodies can impose sanctions on anyone for telling falsehoods.  That responsibility rests with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate and ultimately the courts to decide.<br\/><br\/>There is a lacuna and this Bill proposes to close it.  I do not pretend that PIAB is a perfect system.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, is making an announcement today that he is getting permission from the Cabinet to develop and bring forward legislation, as I understand it, to give PIAB a role in mediation and in other matters that would strengthen and enhance its remit.  That is very welcome.  I believe he is also proposing that PIAB would have a role in co-operating with the Garda where information about fraud is made available to it.  That is also welcome.  What my Bill achieves, and what is not mentioned as I understand it from what I have read about his press release, is that it clearly creates an offence of knowingly providing false information.  The fact that it does not exist at present is anomalous, having regard to the other examples I have given where it is an offence to supply false information knowingly, for example, in the social welfare context or to the Revenue Commissioners or in the nursing homes support scheme.<br\/><br\/>There are also questions about whether PIAB is aligned too much with respondents and the insurance industry.  One will get a different account on that depending on who one talks to.  PIAB's remit should surely be to assist genuine claimants to receive compensation they are entitled to outside of the court system.  It is certainly not to assist insurers to resist claims.  Any reduction in insurance premiums is welcome, and we should work hard for that, but that should only come through the elimination of fraud and the reduction of legal costs.  Those are the issues we must examine closely.  PIAB is not a quasi-judicial body; it assesses awards with the consent of both parties.  It has no role in adjudicating on personal injuries claims.  There have been calls for it to be given that power, but I am quite sceptical about that.  Those calls sometimes come from business representative groups and we should scrutinise very carefully whose interests such a move would serve.  We must keep the interests of ordinary people and genuine claimants at the forefront of this.<br\/><br\/>As I said earlier, truth has become something of a devalued currency in recent years.  In spite of that, the vast majority of Irish people are honest.  They would never dream of lying in any kind of application to a statutory body or in any other circumstance.  When we can, we should always try to take people at their word.  However, even that must have its limits, and that is why we have law.  Applying to a statutory body seeking damages out of the pockets of fellow citizens, or seeking to avoid paying damages which are justly owed, simply has to be one of those situations.  As they say in Russia, &ldquo;<i>Doveryay, no proveryay<\/i>&quot; - &quot;Trust, but verify&quot;.  Members might recall Ronald Reagan reminding Mikhail Gorbachev of that.  In other words, we should take people at their word to the extent that we can, but we should have no fear about asking them to stand over their word, and no citizen should have any fear or complaint about being asked to do so.  Telling the full truth to a body such as PIAB, on the basis of the facts as one has them, should never be portrayed or seen as, or felt to be, an intolerable burden.<br\/><br\/>I acknowledge that there are other lacunae in our law.  It was also pointed out to me recently that the Judicial Council Act 2020 contains a similar lacuna to the one I am seeking to close today.  With regard to the process for complaints against members of the Judiciary, there appears to be no penalty for including false information in such a complaint.  I wonder why that is the case.  Surely we should insist on truthfulness there too, especially when a person&rsquo;s good name and professional reputation are at stake.  I would have thought it would apply <i>a fortiori <\/i>that we should do so.  I should also add, on a completely unrelated matter, that as the law stands only one third of all voters are asked to prove their identity with a photographic identity document at polling stations on election day.  In this day and age, when photographic ID is required for the most mundane of reasons, especially in the last couple of years, is that acceptable?  However, those are matters for another day and for other Bills.<br\/><br\/>The Oireachtas should have no reluctance about requiring people to tell the truth in their dealings with statutory bodies, and about having a system of enforcement in place that supports that fundamental concept.  That applies all the more to any case where inaction could result in citizens having money taken out of their pockets through wrongful awards &ndash; with the resulting hikes in insurance premiums for all of us &ndash; or citizens having genuine awards denied them through deception and false statements being made.<br\/><br\/>For all those reasons, I ask the Minister of State to consider either incorporating this Bill in his legislation or, even better, joining me in asking the Government for the small amount of Government time it will take to get this small but significant and necessary Bill through the Seanad.  I fear that the Minister of State's legislation might take some time given its greater scope and complexity.  I commend this Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#UU00400","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Mullen for his work on the Bill.

I am aware that Senator Mullen has also met the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, to discuss the issue, and that the Minister of State has advised him that the Government is open to reform along the lines of this Bill.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State has been developing legislative proposals to enhance and reform PIAB.

The vast majority of people across the country have no connection with this.  As Senator Mullen and all other Members will be aware, the Minister of State has noted that insurance fraud is a criminal matter and that allegations should be referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is already provided for in the legislation.  Creating a new offence in the PIAB Act may potentially be unnecessary.  Further examination of the matter is required.  If there is merit in introducing these provisions, the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, will revert with proposals to the Government.<\/p><p>Overall, we need to reform insurance broadly, and the programme for Government has committed to doing so.  It is essential that work is carried out in that regard.  Again, from my experience, I can speak to the hugely damaging impact insurance claims can have on businesses.  As all Members of the House will be aware, payouts in Ireland for a long time were some of the highest in the world, likewise our premiums.  This is having an extremely damaging impact on businesses and motorists.  In recent months we have seen car insurance premiums in particular come down.  We all welcome that, and that is the way we need to continue.  We need to increase the availability and affordability of insurance for businesses, consumers and community and voluntary groups across the country.  Reform of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board is an essential part of that reform agenda.<\/p><p>The action plan for insurance reform sets out 66 actions to be delivered across the Government.  It is one of the most important programmes this Government will undertake.  Progress has been made in delivering the action plan but there is still much work to do, and it is important the Government seeks to move forward with urgency.  My understanding is that the T&aacute;naiste will convene a meeting of the sub-group on insurance reform very shortly to consider progress made to date and that the sub-group will continue to meet in the coming months to ensure that momentum on reform is maintained.  The action plan contains a number of actions relating to fraud.  The Garda insurance fraud co-ordination office was opened in July 2021.  I think we all welcome that.  The establishment of that office will improve co-operation and co-ordination with the insurance industry and bring consistency to the handling and investigation of insurance fraud.  Referrals should facilitate the referral of more cases to the DPP for prosecution.<\/p><p>The Department of Justice has examined deterrents to insurance fraud, including penalties for insurance fraud, in consultation with the relevant agencies.  An important milestone was achieved in 2021 with the enactment and commencement of the Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021, increasing the range of options for investigation, prosecution and penalties on conviction that can be considered for those making fraudulent or misleading claims.  As I pointed out earlier, and as Senator Mullen has pointed out, this is a minute percentage of our population.  The commencement of the personal injuries guidelines is a significant reform and is making a huge impact.  Under the guidelines, award levels have decreased across nearly all ranges, with the reduction ranging from 31% to 70%, depending on the severity of the injury.  PIAB data have shown a significant downward shift in award values, which will reduce the cost of claims.  Data from the Central Bank show that the average cost of motor insurance policies has decreased by 20%.  The Government will publish a 12-month report on the action plan later this month.<\/p><p>Once more, my view is that the Government has taken some positive steps which have made an impact but that more can be and needs to be done before this matter can be considered fully addressed.  I hope and expect that action similar to what Senator Mullen proposes in this Bill will be implemented in the short term, following the previously mentioned examination of this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#VV00200","speaker":"1646","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber and thank him for the work he has done in his Department over almost the past two years.  The Fine Gael Party will not oppose this legislation.  I commend Senator Mullen on the work he has done on this Bill.  It seems strange that these provisions are not already in place.  It seems to make perfect sense that if information is to be given it must be factual and that there is something in place to deter the very small number of people who would give misleading information.  The Bill, as Senator Mullen said, concerns people who knowingly give misleading information, and that is the key point.  People might argue how one can distinguish between people who knowingly do so, people who recklessly do so and people who mistakenly do so, but that is there to be adjudicated and decided on afterwards.  What is important is that there needs to be a deterrent in place for people who may do this.  This is essentially about protecting people who make legitimate claims or cases.  This impacts absolutely everyone.  There is not a household in this country that does not understand the rise in insurance costs, and there is not a business in this country that does not understand the challenges of rising insurance costs.  This Bill might not play a major part but will play some part in this.  This area of law needs to be tackled and changed.<\/p> <p>I welcome the fact that Senator Mullen said he is open to working with both sides of the House on this to make sure an agreement can be found on this to bring the Bill through.  Insurance in general has been a real challenge over recent years.  We all remember about two years ago, I think, when a large number of outdoor sporting facilities had to close down because they could not get insurance.  Anyone who works in bars and restaurants will say there is, I think, only one insurance company to which they can go to get insurance.  A great many people have small bars and pubs in rural Ireland, including in places in Tipperary, where I live, and choose not to have insurance on those premises.  One prays to God that nothing happens in those pubs because, if it does, they will not reopen if the matter goes to court and they do not have insurance.  Essentially, however, they cannot afford it.  A great many pub owners are in that situation.  We need to bring in measures to rectify these things.  As a Government, we need to bring in measures to make sure that the simple thing of being able to get affordable insurance for businesses is possible.<\/p> <p>I spoke recently to someone who runs a childcare facility.  There are massive demands on childcare from a range of areas, including rates and other costs, and insurance plays a huge part in that.  The demand from people who need childcare has not increased dramatically, but childcare providers are in a very difficult situation in that they cannot increase the price paid by individuals because there is a cap on that price.  That is right because individuals find it very expensive to pay for childcare in the first place.  As for the new measures that will be brought forward for September, they do not even know what they are at the moment.  There are huge costs to this, the industry is in serious trouble and people are leaving the industry on the back of it.<\/p> <p>This discussion is welcome, however, and I am interested to hear other Members' comments.  We should be able to find common ground on simple things such as this.  They have an impact.  As I said at the start of my contribution, I was surprised to find that these provisions are not already in place.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Garret Ahearn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In fairness to the Government, this is one of 66 actions that it will bring forward over its lifetime and, in fairness to the Minister of State, he has taken serious action on this already.

It seeks to criminalise the giving of false information to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board under section 11, which relates to the making of assessments, and section 23, which gives the board the power to require additional information from third parties, of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003, the establishing Act for the body.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in supports strengthening the role of PIAB as it allows for cheaper and quicker settlement of claims than resorting to the courts.  This should allow savings to be passed on to the consumer as high insurance premiums are one of the major contributory factors in the cost-of-living crisis workers and their families are currently experiencing.  However, what we have seen from the industry thus far is that savings are not passed on to the consumer but retained as increased profits.  In 2021, the Central Bank published a 2019 report on private motor insurance which clearly showed that the insurance industry had decided to pocket the vast amount of savings it had made during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Despite traffic falling by 37% in 2020, the number of claims falling by 26% and the cost of claims per policy falling by 20%, premiums only fell by 7%.  Meanwhile, the industry made profits of &euro;163 million, a margin of 12%.  There is the evidence and the facts with regard to the insurance industry continuing to rake in profits at the expense of their customers through what is, in effect, a monopoly of a small few companies.<\/p> <p>Insurance fraud is a serious role that plays a role in increasing premiums but we cannot trust the industry to do the right thing and demonising ordinary workers making claims, the policy of the industry for many decades, will not help.  The Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on finance, Deputy Doherty, introduced legislation in April 2021 that would require insurers to show if savings are being passed on to consumers in the form of lower premiums and, if so, how much.  The Bill was blocked by the Government, which has refused to stand up to the industry.  The 2019 report also made clear the need for the role of PIAB to be strengthened.  <\/p> <p>In summary, we support the aims of this Bill as it seeks to reduce insurance costs but there are areas where it could be improved and we will work to submit amendments on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#XX00400","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I too welcome the Minister of State to the House this evening and thank Senator Mullen for bringing this important Bill, which we support, before us tonight.  As colleagues have said throughout their contributions tonight, it is very hard to believe that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act, as amended, does not provide for any penalties for giving false or misleading information to the board in the course of an application for an assessment of a claim for personal injuries but we are told that is currently the case.  That is what Senator Mullen addressed in his contribution and what he is trying to address through his Bill.  As has been said, the Bill proposes to amend three sections of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 to provide for penalties for those who provide information that is false or misleading.<\/p> <p>There have been a number of contributions on the reports on the insurance industry in Ireland published by the insurance companies in recent years that have suggested that the cost of fraud to the Irish insurance industry could be as high as &euro;200 million.  Insurance companies have stated in the past that they suspect 20% of cases may involve exaggerated or fraudulent claims.  However, it is a little harder to get information on the exact number and the number of reported cases under investigation is much lower.  Previous debates in the Oireachtas have concentrated on discussions around these numbers and the number of ongoing investigations.  It is interesting that a recent survey I came across that had been carried out on behalf of one of the insurance companies in Ireland found that 86% of survey respondents believed that people who commit insurance fraud are motivated to do so because they believe they can get away with it.  The survey, conducted by KPMG, found that 70% of people in Ireland believe that it is unethical to overstate an insurance claim.  What the other 23% might think should worry everyone.  It is very important to state that it has been announced that the Government has established an insurance fraud co-ordination office under the control of the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau.  As others have said, that is welcome.  With regard to the reports I have mentioned tonight, we also need to address what is happening and, more importantly, discourage any dishonesty.<\/p> <p>We must fight insurance fraud in order to protect genuine policyholders and other groups, many of which are community groups that continue to struggle to raise money for their ever-increasing insurance bills, as has been mentioned.  As I have said in the House before, I deal with many community groups that are seeing their insurance bills rise and rise again.  I hope the Bill the Minister of State and his Government are proposing will address this once and for all because, at the end of the day, those community groups are doing a lot of good work in all of our communities but are put to the pin of their collar in trying to come up with money to cover those ever-increasing insurance bills, which are not justified.  A community organisation I am involved with has seen an increase of &euro;500 in its insurance bill over the last five years, which is simply not sustainable for a small community group representing 400 households.  As I said before, it is the genuine persons and businesses that have been mentioned and these community groups that ultimately end up footing the bill for these fraudsters.<\/p> <p>We simply cannot continue to suffer premium hikes and, in certain cases, the wasting of Garda resources and strain on our health services as accidents are staged and false claims made and facilitated.  The effects of insurance fraud are far-reaching and have the potential to damage many individuals and areas of our State.  We need to challenge it.  I thank Senator Mullen for bringing forward his Bill.  I look forward to discussing it further as it passes through the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#XX00500","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I second the Bill.

As previous speakers said, it is timely and important legislation, and I very much share Senator Mullen's ambition for positive change in this area.<\/p> <p>Senators will be aware that I have today published the general scheme of a Bill to enhance and reform the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  The general scheme relates to commitments in the programme of Government and the action plan for insurance reform and reflects my ambition to increase the numbers availing of the PIAB model and to reduce the need for costly litigation.<\/p> <p>Many speakers have pointed to the importance of businesses, consumers and community and voluntary groups being able to get insurance at a reasonable price.  I wholeheartedly agree with them.  For too long, the cost and availability of insurance has had a negative impact on our economy and society, particularly for SMEs in rural Ireland.  While I would wish for it to be simple and quick to fix, that is just not the case.  It requires action, and sustained action at that.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Robert Troy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2305\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2305&amp;amp;pid=RobertTroy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Government's action plan for insurance reform does this.  With 66 actions to be delivered across Government, it is one of the most important programmes this Government will undertake.<br\/><br\/>We have made progress in delivering principal actions, including an office to promote competition in the insurance market, chaired by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Fleming.  The scope of the national claims information database has been widened to cover employer and public liability.  Actions to mitigate fraud have been delivered, which I will touch on later.  Most important, the personal injury guidelines have been commenced.  I also wish to acknowledge the perjury legislation initiated in this House under the last shadowed by former Senator<b>, <\/b>P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, and we acknowledge his contribution.  That legislation has now been enacted.<br\/><br\/>The Government has been clear that the reason we are undertaking reform and changes is to ensure that insurance would become more available and affordable for motorists, homeowners and businesses.  As these reforms have been realised, we expect the insurance industry to do what it is supposed to do, and said it would do, which is to reduce premiums for motor and home insurance and employer and public liability.<br\/><br\/>Reform of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board is another important instrument for change in the personal injury sphere.  Since its establishment, the PIAB model has delivered major benefits by providing a low cost, quick and fair option for injury compensation.  The Central Bank's reporting under the national claims information database, NCID, and, most recently, the bank's third private motor insurance report published in November 2021 shows the benefits of using PIAB.  It shows the compensation awarded to claimants is broadly comparable regardless of whether the case was finalised through PIAB litigation.<br\/><br\/>However, legal costs associated with settling these claims through litigation was, on average, &euro;16,064 compared to the legal costs under PIAB of only &euro;841.  The time taken to resolve the claim with the litigation model is, on average, 4.2 years, with claims settled through the PIAB taking, on average, 2.3 years.  The NCID report makes it clear that in overall terms the board offers the most cost-effective settlement channel in terms of injury claimant settlements, but also shows that only 15% of motor claims in 2019 to 2020 and 12% of employer and public liability claim in 2019 were settled through the board.<br\/><br\/>As Senators have noted, we know the number of cases being finalised through PIAB has fallen.  It has informed me that public health restrictions have led to a significant reduction in the number of road collisions during 2020 and 2021.  These trends are similar for accidents in public places and places of work, with many public places closed or limited in number and many employees working from home.  This has resulted in a significant decline in personal injury claims to PIAB.  Claim application volumes in 2020 were 60% lower than in 2019 of 31,000.  Applications in 2021 are estimated to have been reduced by approximately 20%, compared to 2020 volumes, and are down to 21,000 claims.<br\/><br\/>While it is not fair to measure the success or failure of PIAB based on the number of claims it receives, it is an important indicator of the personal injury landscape.  It gives us an insight into what can impact on the number of accidents occurring resulting in claims.  This includes not only the effects of Covid I have mentioned, but also increasing awareness regarding accident prevention and risk assessment.  The impact of the guidelines, together with reform of PIAB, should lead to greater use of the service provided by the board and lower claim costs, and should facilitate a reduction in insurance premiums.  This should contribute to reductions in insurance premiums for businesses, consumers and community and voluntary groups.  <br\/><br\/>Given our shared ambition to improve availability and reduce the cost of insurance, I want to take this opportunity to inform the Seanad of work in this regard, specifically to enhance and reform PIAB.  Since taking office, I have worked to develop proposals to ensure that more personal injury cases are resolved by PIAB within a faster timeframe and with lower costs compared to litigation.  I have engaged with businesses, community group and representative bodies, such as the alliance for insurance reform.  The resounding message from all has been for the urgent need for change in the personal injuries sphere.  <br\/><br\/>Last year, I launched a public consultation on measures to enhance the role of PIAB.  I am pleased to say there was an excellent response to the consultation, with more than 240 responses received.  These submissions reflected the consensus that the time is right to strengthen and enhance PIAB.  At the same time, I was struck by the positive feedback received which indicated that the service provided by PIAB is valuable and makes a real difference.  This is reflected in the Central Bank's report which showed that legal costs are 50 times greater when claims are settled by a litigation rather than through PIAB and take almost twice as long to settle.  It is clear to me that PIAB has a valuable role to play and the general scheme I published today is the starts of a process of legislative reform to enhance and strengthen the agency.<br\/><br\/>The general scheme proposes to amend the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019 to increase the number of personal injury claims settled through PIAB and avoid the expense and time associated with litigation.  It provides that PIAB will offer mediation as a means of resolving a claim.  It will retain claims of a wholly psychological nature.  PIAB will have additional time to assess claims where an injury is yet to settle, rather than released into litigation.  PIAB will deepen its analysis and public information roles.  It will seek approval of identity on application and disclose information to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order to reduce fraud.  A court's discretion regarding costs in litigation will be tightened.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the cross-party support today mentioned by various Senators and their commitment to support and enhance PIAB.  I do not have a monopoly on good ideas.  As with pre-legislative scrutiny, and as we go through the process of the Bill, I will gladly consider amendments and suggestions emanating from the committee.<br\/><br\/>Given the provision to extend the remit of the board and give it new statutory functions to resolve personal injury claims, I also propose to change the name of PIAB to the personal injuries resolution board.  A key reason for this is my proposal to introduce mediation into PIAB.  This is a new function.  The advantage of mediation is that parties can avoid potentially prolonged and costly litigation and may arrive at a mutually satisfactory outcome for the party in a much shorter space of time.  Mediation offered by PIAB will follow the recognised principles of mediation, including being a fully voluntary process, ensuring confidentiality and impartiality and providing the opportunity for the parties to determine the issues that require resolution.  <br\/><br\/>Where parties do not consent to mediation, the existing process in respect of an assessment of claim remains.  An advantage of mediation is the ability for parties to get speedy access to a process that may produce a satisfactory outcome for the parties within a short space of time.  Mediation will not affect the timeline for assessment of a claim.  The board will remain obliged, under section 49 of the principal Act, to assess claims within nine months of the confirmation of the respondents' consent to the assessment process, notwithstanding some exceptional circumstances provided for in the litigation.  <br\/><br\/>Mediation is already successfully used by body such as the Residential Tenancies Board, the Workplace Relations Commission and the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman as a means of facilitating the resolution of issues between parties.  My proposals are modelled on existing legislation in respect of these bodies. <br\/><br\/>With the introduction of the personal injury guidelines, a claim that has been assessed by the board but then proceeds to litigation will be considered by the courts using the same criteria and award levels used by the board.  The obligation on the part of the trial judge to have regard to the guidelines is mandatory.  Under the general scheme proposed, I intend to strengthen and clarify existing provisions regarding the costs in a court setting.  <br\/><br\/>The discretion available to the court will be tightened regarding the award of costs against the claimant who has rejected a PIAB assessment and where the respondent accepts it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Robert Troy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2305\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2305&amp;amp;pid=RobertTroy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Instead the default will be for the courts to award costs against the claimant unless this would give rise to an injustice.  This should encourage a certain class of personal injury claims to be settled without the need for far more costly litigation.  <\/p><p>While developing the legislation to reform and enhance PIAB has taken a bit longer than I would have liked, I believe it is important that when we legislate to reform PIAB, we will have gone as far as we can in terms of strengthening the agency to ensure more cases are settled through it without recourse to expensive litigation.  On foot of stakeholder engagement, I considered at some length and in detail the potential to reform PIAB as a quasi-judicial body.  The potential to legislate so that a claimant or respondent could only appeal a decision of the board on a point of law was fully explored.  However, informed by the advice of the Attorney General, I have not been able to take this approach forward.  This is because such an approach would not be compatible with the Constitution as it would impinge on the constitutional right of access to justice delivered by the court as well as the primacy of the courts regarding the administration of justice, particularly with regard to a body of common law.  The general scheme is the starting point for reform and I will continue to explore all avenues and suggestions to enhance the agency.  <\/p><p>Turning to the specific provisions of the Bill referred to by Senator Mullen, the Bill provides for penalties for giving false or misleading information to PIAB during an application for or the assessment of a claim for an award for personal injury.  As Senators will know, certain classes of personal injury claims where liability is uncontested can be settled on a consent basis without the need for litigation.  By proceeding with the PIAB process, the respondent - generally an insurer - will have considered the claimant's case and satisfied itself of the bona fides or otherwise of it.  Where liability is an issue or the circumstances of a claim are disputed, the respondent will refuse an assessment by PIAB so that it can investigate the matter.  In those circumstances, PIAB will release the case and provide authorisation to a claimant to proceed to litigation if he or she so wishes.  The PIAB Act does not provide for any penalty or sanction regarding the provision of misleading or false information to it.  This is because PIAB does not investigate the circumstances of claims or address the issue of liability.  However, where there are suspected fraudulent claims, there is an onus on the respondent to report such suspected fraudulent claims to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enable the successful prosecution of fraud offences.  Where PIAB is made aware of suspected fraudulent activity, it reports the matter to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The determination of whether fraud has taken place is by nature a matter of judgment for which a court is the appropriate body and which can consider the relevant matters presented to it by all parties.  <\/p><p>As the Senator is aware, there is already a significant body of legislation dealing with fraudulent personal injury claims both where an alleged fraud has taken place regarding information supplied and proceedings before the court and suspected fraud outside the litigation system.  This legislation includes the Criminal Justice Act 2011, the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 and the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.  The Department of Justice has examined deterrence to insurance fraud, including penalties for insurance fraud, in consultation with relevant agencies.  An important milestone was achieved in 2021 with the enactment and commencement of the Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021 increasing the range of options for investigation, prosecution and penalties on conviction that can be considered regarding those making false or misleading claims.  <\/p><p>The Government fully appreciates the intentions of the Senator's Bill.  Fraudulent claims should be dismissed by courts and, where appropriate, fraudsters should be prosecuted.  I believe there may be merit in introducing a further offence concerning the provision of false information to PIAB along the lines of the Bill.  If there is a gap in the PIAB legislation, I will move to fix it.  I will, however, need to consider how the proposed provisions might interact with the provisions of existing legislation.  This will need to be examined to determine if the effect of the proposed provisions of the Bill provide additional benefits or merely duplicate existing provisions under which PIAB can refer suspected cases of fraud for investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Consideration will need to be given to how fraud would be detected, investigated and the legislation enforced.  When I have examined the matter and if there is merit in introducing these provisions, I will revert with proposals to Government.  <\/p><p>To conclude, I thank Senators for their valuable contribution tonight.  I believe greater utilisation of the PIAB process alongside consistent implementation of the personal injuries guidelines will increase the number of personal injury claims settled through PIAB and ensure that insurance products are available and affordable for all businesses and consumers.  I am determined that legislation to strengthen and reform is progressed as soon as possible and I look forward to constructive engagement on this.  The proposals to enhance the agency represent a new direction to address issues in the claims environment.  As I said previously, Government does not have a monopoly on good ideas and we are willing to work with Members of both Houses to progress reform.  I acknowledge Senator Mullen's positive and constructive engagement with me to date and I want to ensure that this positivity and constructive debate and engagement continue as I progress to enhance and reform PIAB.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#XX00700","speaker":"1596","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his very comprehensive reply to my Bill and my proposal on this matter along with all my Seanad colleagues for their contributions.  The Minister of State deserves great credit for the work he has been doing to date.  I certainly look forward to his wider set of PIAB-related proposals in the legislation he promised to bring forward this evening.  I also welcome his statement that there may be merit in introducing a further offence concerning the provision of false information to PIAB along the lines of that in the Bill.  He can certainly rely on it.  There is merit in this proposal and this legislation is about no mere duplication of existing provisions.  The Minister of State will have the opportunity to look at what I have put before the House this evening in proposing this legislation.  We have examined this in great detail.  There are several circumstances where the existing legislation would not be adequate to deal with the various kinds of mischief on offer.<\/p> <p>This particularly applies to a situation where a false statement might be made to PIAB but where no award is made.  There is no legislation dealing with the fraud involved there.  It might also apply to a situation where the matter goes on to court in the absence of an agreement as to PIAB's assessment or indeed the eventual award it proposes to make and where the false claim set out at the PIAB stage is dropped from the subsequent court proceedings.  I put it to the Minister of State and his officials that there are gaps here that the law cannot reach.  The Minister of State cited the fact that the reason the PIAB Acts do not provide for any penalty or sanction is because PIAB does not investigate the circumstances of claims or address the issue of liability but those are two different issues.  There are lots of bodies that are not responsible for investigating issues of liability.  Nonetheless it is an offence to give them false information.  It might come to PIAB's notice that false information has been placed before it and as the Minister noted, it brings that to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but the question is whether the law to prosecute it on that basis exists.  In certain cases, it does not, particularly where no award has been made but possibly where an award has been made in the context of court proceedings subsequently.  <\/p> <p>Many of the examples given by the Minister of State relate to offences that are undoubtedly there regarding what happens in the context of court proceedings.  The work of former Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and others has been very valuable there.  However, there is a gap regarding what may falsely be put before PIAB and there are circumstances where there is no law that can reach that.  It is not necessarily only PIAB that might come to the knowledge of that fraudulent intent.  It might be due to circumstances that somehow come to light.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For example, imagine collusion between two parties where, in an employer's liability case, somebody makes a claim and is colluded with by an employee on the other side so that false information is put before PIAB.  If, for whatever reason, that ends up before a court, then a fraudulent presentation has been made to PIAB.  It might not come to PIAB's notice at that point, but it might come to light in some other way at another stage.  That is what the criminal law is for.  The mere existence of a criminal provision does not mean that it will always be possible to get the information needed to investigate and prosecute it.  The hope is that it acts as a deterrent in the first place and that when information comes to light, it might sustain a prosecution such that a prosecution can happen.  My legislation creates a deterrent in circumstances where there is no current deterrent.  It also offers the hope that where information comes to light that would satisfy the needs of a prosecution with regard to false provision of information, a prosecution might then be possible.<\/p><p>I wish the Minister of State well with his Bill.  He may well decide, having examined this more closely with his officials, to incorporate my proposals into his Bill.  From what I have heard so far, they are not currently envisaged.  However, the chances are that I might get to the floor sooner rather than later in an attempt to bring this further.  I ask the Minister of State and his officials to look at this in the near term.  I ask the Government to consider giving me time to progress this small but significant and necessary Bill through the House, once the Minister of State has satisfied himself that there is no duplication and that there are no unforeseen consequences.  From what I have heard today, there is nothing in the legislation proposed by the Minister of State that would in any way be contradicted by what is contained in my Bill.  On that basis, I thank the Minister of State for his positive response and I look forward to it becoming even more positive as he gets a chance to examine this legislation further as it hopefully continues to Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1644402600,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":216,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#AAA00250","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":217,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020900002#AAA00275","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1644402600,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?
