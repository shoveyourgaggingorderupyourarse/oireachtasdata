Unfortunately, Eamonn Crowley, the chief financial officer, is unable to attend due to personal circumstances.<\/p> <p>  At our various engagements with the committee over the course of 2018, there have been a number of recurring topics, so perhaps I may begin by providing a quick update on where we are in respect of these matters.  I will start with the ongoing tracker mortgage examination.  There has been no material change in respect of this issue at Permanent TSB over the past 15 months.  In December 2017, we confirmed to the Central Bank of Ireland that we had identified a total of 1,979 accounts which were eligible for redress and compensation.  That figure rose by four accounts to 1,983 in the following months as we completed the programme of work.<\/p><p>To date, we have completed redress and compensation for a total of 1,951 accounts, or 99% of the total.  A total of 14 customers have chosen not to accept payments at this point.  The remaining 19 accounts relate to individuals who we believe have left the jurisdiction.  Despite the use of international search agents, we have been unable to locate or contact these customers.  In these cases we have lodged the relevant amounts to the mortgage accounts pending contact.  Should there be contact in due course, the funds will be transferred to the customers.<\/p><p> The work in this area has been very thorough and objective.  We built a strong governance framework around this project that, in turn, shaped both the response of the Central Bank and the industry.  The work established a rigorous approach to how we analysed the customer population, identified affected customer accounts, redressed and compensated the holders of those accounts and offered the right of appeal to these individuals through the relevant channels, including appeals panels and the Office of the Ombudsman.  All key decisions along the way were subject to check, challenge, review and independent oversight.  We are not aware of any cohort of customer accounts, outside those identified by us, which the Central Bank of Ireland believes should be included in our impacted population.<\/p><p> We have been asked frequently at this committee whether we have identified any individuals who bear responsibility for this issue.  Let us remind ourselves that the key issue which has been identified was that the bank failed to disclose fully to customers that their request to break early from fixed-rate products would result in the loss of a right to return to the tracker-rate mortgages which they enjoyed so long as they completed the fixed-rate term.  During the bank&rsquo;s work and in responding to the Central Bank's tracker mortgage examination, we found no evidence that the failure to provide this disclosure was planned or deliberate.  Of course, the bank&rsquo;s work on the tracker mortgage examination is, as with all of the main players across the industry, subject to an enforcement investigation by the Central Bank.  We continue to co-operate fully with this exercise and this will restrict our ability to answer questions on this issue today.<\/p><p> A second issue which has taken up a significant amount of time here is the subject of non-performing loans, NPLs.  As the committee is aware, Permanent TSB has undertaken a series of actions to reduce the percentage of NPLs on its balance sheet with the aim of both reducing the underlying exposure to an economic shock and enabling management to focus on providing ongoing competition in the Irish retail and SME banking market.  Last year we discussed two significant transactions in great detail with the committee, namely, Project Glas and Project Glenbeigh.  In respect of Project Glas, the migration of the loan accounts to their new owners has now completed.  In the context of Project Glenbeigh, we are well advanced in completing the migration of the accounts to their new servicer, Pepper Finance Corporation (Ireland).  In completing this project the bank sought accounting advice from KPMG and transaction advice from Citibank.  In addition, we had significant ongoing interaction with PwC, as the bank&rsquo;s auditors and with the Central Bank of Ireland and the European Central Bank as regulators, as the transaction was complex and involved the reconciliation of a myriad of interconnected factors to achieve NPL derecognition.  Based on stakeholder interactions, we came to the conclusion that ceasing the servicing of the loans within a reasonable timeframe after their sale to Glenbeigh Securities would be necessary to give us the certainty we required that both the loans would be derecognised and the NPL ratio reduced which was, of course, the purpose of the exercise.  In doing so, we provided clarity to our customers about their ongoing mortgage servicing arrangements.<\/p><p> The execution of NPL sales or securitisations - which involve thousands of properties - is very complicated as a result of: contractual commitments in respect of cut-off dates, including agreeing a final decision date on which accounts are included or excluded from a transaction; contractual commitments in respect of the management of relevant accounts after contracts are signed but prior to migration; and technical challenges around how and when accounts are onboarded to the new owner&rsquo;s IT platform.  At all times, we undertake these activities in good faith, doing our very best to deliver fair and certain customer outcomes as we fully appreciate the sensitive nature of NPL sales.  As a result of the two transactions, the proportion of NPLs on the bank&rsquo;s balance sheet has been reduced from 26% to 10%.  This is good news for the taxpayer as minimising NPL ratios reduces, in the words of the Governor of the Central Bank, national risk.  However, the bank&rsquo;s residual NPL ratio of 10% remains about three times the European average and we will continue to work to reduce the proportion of NPLs on our balance sheet over the coming months.<\/p><p> In this regard, I am conscious of the proposed No Consent, No Sale Bill 2019.  Thus far we have avoided public comment on this legislation however, given the forum we are in today, I will say that I share the concern recently expressed to this Committee by the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland about the legislation.  Our concern is that this legislation will make it more difficult for banks to repair and strengthen their balance sheets, to deepen funding sources such as securitisation, to attract sufficient capital, to increase competition, or to reduce interest rates in the market.<\/p><p> The issue of mortgage interest rates has come up at various committee meetings.  Over the past year, we have completed a comprehensive overhaul of our fixed rates for new business customers.  This has allowed us to reduce fixed rates for three-year and five-year terms and to introduce a very competitive seven-year fixed rate.  This the longest fixed-term product we have been able to introduce in eight years, which is testament to the fundamental restructuring and repairing of the balance sheet since 2012.  The bank&rsquo;s next priority is to review the pricing and product strategy for existing customers and we hope to be able to make announcements on this front during the course of this year and beyond.<\/p><p> Another issue which has attracted some attention in recent months relates to the changes we have made to the pricing model for legacy current accounts.  I will make a couple of points in this regard.  The bank&rsquo;s objective is to maximise the sustainable value it generates for its shareholders, including the Irish taxpayer, while delivering value to its customer base.  That requires us to review constantly the pricing models in different product areas to ensure we are not leaking taxpayer value.  In current accounts, we have a very competitive, award-winning product which we launched three years ago.  This product rewards customers in various ways and makes payments based on card usage.  It is now the default current account offering for the bank&rsquo;s customers.  However, we do have legacy products which are not economically viable and which are out of kilter with the wider market.  The changes we made to the aforementioned current accounts address this issue.<\/p><p> In this context, the evolving and ongoing changes to the bank&rsquo;s customer offering is reflective of the fact that the banking world is changing.  In particular, both customers&rsquo; and regulators&rsquo; needs are changing, and we have to change with them.  That is going to require constant and dynamic changes to all dimensions of the bank&rsquo;s proposition, for example, to both our product and digital offering.  In respect of digital, we are already investing in improving service for customers, having made some significant progress over the last 12 months, and there is much more to come now that we are largely free of the anchors of the past.<\/p><p> In its invitation to us to attend this meeting, the committee indicated its interest in our views on Brexit and the emerging banker accountability framework.<\/p><p>In respect of Brexit, Permanent TSB is focused exclusively on the Irish retail and SME banking market.  Some years ago, we disposed of loan books in the UK.  We have no ongoing business interests in that jurisdiction.  Therefore, our concern about Brexit is the general economic impact, in particular on our SME customers who may have exposure to the UK market.  We have no evidence to date that would justify any significant concern in this regard.  As the committee would expect, we are monitoring the situation carefully and engaging with the SBCI in respect of its future growth loan scheme.  We support the banker accountability framework.<\/p><p> The bank recently announced its results for 2018.  As the results demonstrate, we made substantial progress in the bank's transformation last year.  We reduced our NPL ratio and generated operating and bottom line profit.  Our position in lending, particularly new mortgage lending, grew significantly.  Most important, we successfully exited the EU restructuring plan into which we were placed after the crisis.  With the support of the Irish taxpayer and stakeholders across the system, including this committee, the regulator, the Department of Finance and our customers, we have worked long and hard to rebuild Permanent TSB after the financial crash.  The progress we have made has come at some really significant cost to the taxpayer, our staff and, most important, our customers.  However, the taxpayer has been saved billions of additional funding and capital costs that would have been incurred if the bank had been allowed to fail.  PTSB, which has a customer base of over 1.1 million, has been saved as an important competitive force in a market that is not exactly overburdened with competitors.  Now we will be part of the debate about how the market is shaped in the future.  We have an even better opportunity to return more of the investment which the taxpayer made in us.  This always remains the key objective for me and the board.  I thank the committee for its attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Masding","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554814800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Masding and his colleagues.

When Glenbeigh is fully executed, the bank's headline NPL rate will reduce from 26% to 10%.

We have completed the vast majority of our reduction.  By definition, any further activity in 2019 will not be of the same scale as the 2018 activity.  We now have the second or third lowest NPL ratio of the five retail banks in Ireland.  Therefore, to answer the Deputy's question, we are continuing to look at all options for further NPL reduction.  Nothing, including loan sales, is ruled out.  We expect other measures, such as increased mortgage-to-rent activity, to have an effect.  A significant number of natural cures will also account for a substantial proportion.  We still have a long way to go.  I would not rule anything in or out this afternoon.

Regarding the MVR, the bank is only allowing customers to submit a valuation and avail of a reduced MVR once.

Other banks allow customers to continue updating their LTV ratios and benefit from reduced interest rates.  That is unfair.

Permanent TSB was not unique in terms of identifying new customers.  To add to that, it has been stated that the margin issue is one that Permanent TSB has still not dealt with.  Mr. Padraic Kissane, who has been a shining light in relation to this issue, has made it clear that the big remaining issue within Permanent TSB is that margin, and he believes he is 100% right on this.  Is Mr. Masding satisfied that he has dealt with this in a customer-centric way, as opposed to the more legalistic approach, or the approach of trying to save a few bob for the bank?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040900002#N00500","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554814800,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I have a few observations in response to Deputy Doherty's comment.

Let us not forget that over 60% of our book is already in trackers, so I think that is important.  In good faith, I do my best to assure the committee that the way we approached the work was in an objective, customer-centric manner.

I do not have a short memory.<\/p><p>I recall a case which occurred only a couple of years ago, when Mr. Masding was in charge.  I recall it because I know the person concerned very well as she is a relative of mine.  The bank sent her a letter, because she was &euro;320 in arrears for the first time, and told her the only option for her was voluntary surrender.  When I sat at her kitchen table and looked at her contract, it told her clearly that she should have been on a tracker rate.  She contacted the bank of which Mr. Masding was in charge again and again to tell it that it was in black and white in the conditions, but she was told she was not entitled to it.  I have read her impact statement and about the impact it had on her, her family, her children and the missed opportunities.  We have had the victims in here.  Mr. Masding was in charge of all that, so it is not a case that this management team just owned up to everything, that now everything is fine and that we should forget it because the bank has restored the money.  The bank has stolen opportunities from these families.  It is not just a financial amount that was taken from their accounts.  The banks stole opportunities from the children, the families, the parents and from the wider family circles because of all the other things they missed out on when they could not afford them.  In some cases, the bank took the roof over their heads.  It was not done by some other management team, but under Mr. Masding's watch.<\/p><p> I refer to this kind of rosy picture that the banks were not dragged kicking and screaming to a situation in which they had to acknowledge that each of them wrongly took money from the accounts of 40,000 of their customers.  That money would still be in the banks' accounts but for the fact that the woman to whom I spoke went to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, FSPO, and she, along with 83 others, took a case against the banks to the court, which opened the gates to where we are today.  Mr. Masding was in charge.  It was not some other management team.  The bank fought this through the court when the FSPO came down on the side of its customers.  Forgive me if I do not buy this customer-centric stuff because we have track record to go on.  We know these people.  Some of them are very close to us and we know the hurt and the pain that this bank and other banks inflicted on them, their lives and their families.  Mr. Masding will forgive me if I am suspicious of his bank and its approach to its customers.<\/p><p> In relation to some of the variable rate issues, there are five customers who are on a 9.1% rate.

Ultimately, the investors provide the capital for us to allow our businesses to grow.

The level of capital that we put up against mortgage lending would increase and that has an impact on front book pricing, and I am not sure that is healthy for anybody.

I speak to investors all the time, whether they be the Department of Finance or the external shareholders.  At its simplest, the conversation splits into those matters we can control and those we cannot control.  Unfortunately, the matters we cannot control currently place a heavy burden on the share price.<\/p> <p>  On what we cannot control, investor sentiment about the European banking market is probably as low as I have ever known it.  Low-for-longer interest rates hurt European banks more than American banks.  Within the European banking market, to my knowledge, Permanent TSB has one of the highest, if not the highest, exposures to tracker mortgages.  Low-for-longer interest rates, therefore, are a profitability issue for us.  There is dampened eurozone growth, with Brexit looming large.  The return on equity, ROE, is a market measure at a point in time which assesses the return a bank makes against the minimal capital it is required to hold or that it believes it should be required to hold.  European bank ROEs are as low as they have ever been, probably due primarily to interest rates, along with a lack of confidence about where eurozone economies are going.<\/p> <p>  The conversation moves from Europe to Ireland and we can apply similar factors to Ireland.  The sentiment about the Irish banking landscape is relatively downbeat.  Unfortunately, capital intensity is based on a rearview mirror and we still keep a disproportionate amount of capital because of the financial crisis.

I am sure that the Senator will have read the Department of Finance and Goodbody reports on mortgage pricing.  It is penal and, therefore, the ROEs in Irish banking are depressed, which contributes to there being more sellers than buyers.<\/p> <p>  The third reason that ROEs are low is the lack of liquidity in the Permanent TSB stock.  There is only 25% free flow and the spread between buyers and sellers has become wide, causing the sale of some shares to have a disproportionate effect.  The Senator might say I would be expected to say this, and he will probably smile, but we made enormous progress at the end of 2018.  On the day of the results, there was not a lot of trading but the share price fell by 5% due to one factor only, namely, the lack of liquidity.  <\/p> <p>  As for what I can control, I can control the business performance of Permanent TSB.

We are under pressure in retaining labour.  That is a risk to the value of the bank.  However, what happened in the past cannot be replicated.  There is a balance between the two.  For me, it has to do with three elements, the first of which is control.  The boards of the banks and the frameworks in which they work within the EBA have probably put in place much more effective controls against reward getting away from itself and moving to greed, which none of us wants.<\/p><p>Second, in order to attract and retain talent one has to have reward tools in one's toolkit.  As long as they are controlled properly, I hope we can move towards that over time.  Third, those controls and schemes have to be transparent so that no games are played.  I would like things to move on because I believe we are running an operational risk.  However, I think the controls and transparency that go with them are a critical part of the picture.<\/p><p> In terms of the accountability regime, there was a single sentence because I think we are still waiting to see exactly what it means.  If it is similar to the senior managers' regime in the UK, which I know about, it is something that seems to be good practice.  Having a role profile which identifies what one is accountable for, having organisational charts which have real clarity and having measures to demonstrate whether one is delivering value to the customer and getting value from the customer in the right measure all seem to me to be good banking practice.  I can see no reason Permanent TSB and its board would not endorse that regime.<\/p><p> We have had to have different approaches to culture through different phases of the organisation's development over the past few years.  The culture in the early days was trying to make sure we survived and focused on those things.  Survival meant, for example, whether we could find solutions for customers who were about to lose their homes.  The culture of survival was one I advocated at that time as the right mindset because there were fires everywhere.  We then had to have the cultural fix and that goes back to Senator Conway-Walsh's comment about the control environment of banks.  We all understand that we are the agents of depositors' funds and shareholder funds.  I sometimes find that the conversations go to the lending side of the balance sheet.  A bank cannot lend unless it has good funding and capital.<\/p><p> The second element was trying to put in place the better controls.  We still have some way to go on that but I hope the bank is better managed than it was, albeit I do not want to sound over-confident as we still have areas to deal with.  The third one is running the bank as a normalised banking institution.  In my experience, a normalised banking institution needs to deliver what I call the customer value equation.  We need to make sure we give value to the customers and that means understanding their needs and fulfilling them, not necessarily their wants because what they want and what we can give might be two different things.  It means understanding their needs and delivering them in the sectors we choose.  At the same time, within the boundaries of competition we have to make sure we get the right price for that because, as per the Senator's previous question, the value of the bank does not represent what it should for a minimum return.<\/p><p> The culture is around what we call delivering the bank of choice for our shareholders, customers and colleagues in the community we work in and, underpinning that, ensuring that we maintain our banking licence.  It moves from survival to fixing to normalisation and growth.  That is the corporate journey we are going on.<\/p><p> The last question was about exceptions.  We try to manage those exceptions through the whole 12-month period.  We have done a pretty good job in previous years.  We have not run out too early, if that makes sense, and we will continue to try achieve that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040900002#Y00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Masding","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554814800,"counter":231,"content":"<p>How many exceptions can the bank give or what percentage of exceptions is allowed?

Rightly, Deputy Doherty challenged me last time by saying that if AIB can achieve a certain goal then why could Permanent TSB not do the same.  Deputy Doherty said that it was a function of us not thinking enough about where we were at.  Forgive me for reminding the committee - I am conscious that committee time is precious - we had to offer more splits than any other bank in Ireland because of the nature of the weakness of the balance sheet.  For example, in the 2017 split mortgages accounts made up 6% of loans in AIB.  They made up 24% of loans for us.  For that 24% we warehoused up to 80% of the debt in some cases.  We set out to try to keep as many people as possible in their homes.  This meant many of the warehouses were rather deep.  Then, the depth of the warehouses related to the constructs of the split, because the non-performing loan guidance from the Single Supervisory Mechanism states that 20% is a level above which the warehoused portion and the main mortgage are deemed to be connected.  As soon as we pass the connection test, they stay as non-performing loans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019040900002#FF01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Masding"},{"type":"speech","time":1554814800,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I want to clarify the point because I have followed everything Mr. Masding has said up to now.
