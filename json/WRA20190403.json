Under the Act, any relevant public servant who had not already reached their compulsory retirement age of 65\u00a0before that date\u00a0has a\u00a0new compulsory retirement age of 70.\u00a0 Enactment of the legislation had no effect on those public servants who retired at 65 prior to the 26 December 2018 and who availed of a one year contract under the interim arrangements.\u00a0 The terms of their contracts continue to apply and they will cease working when they reach the age of 66.<\/p>  <p>  Section 3A(6) of the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 was inserted by Section 3 of the Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Act 2018.\u00a0 It provides that I, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, within three months of the passing of the Act, would prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the public servants who were forced to retire between 6 December 2017 and the commencement of the Act, due to reaching the age of 65 years, and on potential remedies to assist this cohort of worker.\u00a0 This Report was laid before the Oireachtas on the 26 March 2019 and is publicly available on the Oireachtas and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform websites.<\/p>  <p>  Whenever legislation is enacted to implement a change in policy, there has to be a dividing line between those who are affected by the change and those who are not.\u00a0 There are always people who will not benefit because they miss the deadline by a matter of days or weeks.\u00a0 Having considered all of the issues in the Report, I am satisfied that the interim arrangements were an appropriate temporary policy response at the time of the Government Decision pending enactment of the legislation.\u00a0 The terms of those arrangements were clear, unambiguous and made known to those who availed of them.\u00a0 Accordingly, as set out in the report, I do not propose to make any changes to those terms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040300067#WRC02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Areas of Conservation Designation","counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040300067#WRC02900"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[15602\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040300067#WRC03000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the required approvals will be applied for a special area of conservation in order to remove the build-up of silt on the mud flats outside the sluices gates and open a channel to deep water at a location (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":146,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) is responsible for the maintenance of Arterial Drainage Schemes and catchment drainage schemes designated under the Arterial Drainage Acts of 1945 and 1995. \u00a0<\/p><p>The sluice gates referred to by the Deputy forms part of the River Maine Catchment Drainage Scheme for which the OPW has maintenance responsibility. <\/p><p>Staff from the OPW inspected the sluices in October 2018 and found them to be in proper repair and operating effectively.

Section 46 of the Act further\u00a0provides that a commercial practice is misleading if the trader omits or conceals material information that the average consumer would need in order to make an informed purchasing decision and the practice would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a purchasing decision that he or she would not otherwise make.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is the statutory independent body responsible for the enforcement of domestic and EU\u00a0consumer law in the State, including the enforcement of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 in relation to commercial practices in the car rental sector.\u00a0 Section 9 (5) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 provides that the\u00a0CCPC is independent in the performance of its functions.\u00a0 As investigations and enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the Commission, I, as\u00a0Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, have no direct function in the matter.<\/p><p>If the Deputy has specific information that a car rental company is engaging, or has engaged, in the practice referred to in his question, he should submit that information to the CCPC.<\/p><p>As much of the car rental\u00a0by consumers occurs outside their country of residence and as the main companies engaged in car rental\u00a0operate on a trans-national basis, action to tackle anti-consumer practices in the car rental\u00a0sector needs also to be\u00a0undertaken on an EU-wide basis. In response to an increase in complaints from consumers about car rental, in 2015 the European Commission and national consumer protection authorities in EU Member States, including the CCPC, engaged, through a common position, with the five leading car rental companies with a view to securing better compliance with EU consumer protection legislation. The five companies - Avis, Europcar, Enterprise, Hertz and Sixt - account for around two-thirds of all private car rentals in the EU. As a result of this engagement, the companies gave commitments on\u00a0their\u00a0commercial practices in a number of areas,\u00a0including the procedures for inspection of vehicle damage and for handling of damage claims. The European Commission and the national consumer authorities agreed that they would continue to monitor the car rental sector closely. In March 2019, following further engagement with the\u00a0national consumer protection authorities\u00a0and the European Commission, the five main car rental companies agreed to change the way they present car rental prices in order to make them more transparent for consumers. These changes include a commitment to make clear in price offers the price and details of optional extras, in particular the insurance waivers that reduce the amount due in case of damage. This information should set out what is covered in the basic rental price regarding damage to vehicles, while any additional payments the consumer may have to make should also be clearly indicated. If additional insurance or damage waiver is purchased, what this does and does not cover should be clearly indicated before the consumer signs up for it. <\/p><p>The Car Rental Council of Ireland which represents the main companies involved in car rental in Ireland has established a Code of Best\u00a0Practice for the sector.\u00a0This includes\u00a0provisions on pre-rental and post-rental inspection\u00a0which require companies to provide customers with a written pre-rental inspection report and to give them an opportunity to check and agree the condition of the vehicle before signing this\u00a0report. On the return of the vehicle, the Code provides that the company will inspect it in the presence of the customer and establish a written post-rental inspection report that must be noted and signed by both parties. Both parties are required to record on this inspection form any new damage found that was not recorded on the pre-inspection report.\u00a0Membership of the Car Rental Council is subject to acceptance of, and compliance with, the Code of Best Practice.\u00a0Section 45 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 provides that a commercial practice is misleading if it involves a representation that the trader is bound by a code of practice and the trader fails to comply with a firm commitment in that code where the representation would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a purchasing decision that he or she would not otherwise make. <\/p><p>Information\u00a0on the number of complaints about car\u00a0rental made to the CCPC since 2014 is set out in the following table. <table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>2018<\/th><th>2019 to date<\/th><th>Grand Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Volume<\/td><td>188<\/td><td>117<\/td><td>152<\/td><td>181<\/td><td>227<\/td><td>46<\/td><td>911<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The Commission has advised me that in order to provide information on the number of complaints relating specifically to charges for pre-existing damage, it would have to review each complaint individually.\u00a0 As such a\u00a0review\u00a0could not be undertaken\u00a0in the time available to\u00a0answer\u00a0the Deputy's question, I regret that I am not in a position to\u00a0provide this information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040300068#WRD03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":214,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040300068#WRD03800"},{"type":"question","counter":215,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[15667\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040300068#WRD03900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the cost of making a video (details supplied) on regional enterprise plans;

The Lisbon Treaty extended this competence to cover foreign direct investment, as well as making the European Parliament a co-legislator alongside the Council on trade matters. The European Commission acts as lead negotiator on behalf of all EU countries regarding trade agreements with non-EU countries. Member States (in Council) approve negotiating directives (or mandates) before negotiations begin, are consulted as the negotiations proceed and have final approval at Council as has the European Parliament.<\/p><p>The EU&rsquo;s suite of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) has evolved over time, from the &lsquo;First Generation&rsquo; FTAs dating back to the 1970s which focused on tariffs for goods, to the current &lsquo;New Generation&rsquo; of FTAs which go beyond the reduction or elimination of conventional tariff barriers to include; non-tariff and regulatory barriers, services, investment, recognition of professional qualifications, intellectual property rights, access to public procurement, regulatory cooperation, sustainable development, labour and environment.<\/p><p>The EU&rsquo;s trade agreements differ depending on their content, with:<\/p><p>-  Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) supporting the development of trade partners from African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.<\/p><p>-  Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) enabling market opening with developed countries and emerging economies by granting preferential access to markets.<\/p><p>-  Association Agreements (AAs) bolstering broader political agreements.<\/p><p>The EU also enters into non-preferential trade agreements, as part of broader deals such as Partnership and Cooperation Agreements (PCAs). <\/p><p>Negotiations of all these trade agreements are conducted in accordance with the rules set out in Article 218 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union.<\/p><p>Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) are agreements which set the terms and conditions for investments between two states. Most BITs between EU member states (intra-EU BITs) date back to the 1990s when one or both countries were not yet a member of the EU. Their aim was to encourage investments by offering reciprocal guarantees against political risks which might negatively affect those investments.<\/p><p>Ireland\u00a0is the only EU Member State with\u00a0no BITs. A list of each EU Member State&rsquo;s BITs can be found on the United Nations Conference for Trade and Development (UNCTAD) website, and can be accessed at: <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>EU Member States no longer conclude bilateral BITs, and MS BITs with third countries are superseded when new EU agreements with those countries are concluded.\u00a0<\/p><p>In relation to trade\u00a0Dispute Settlement, Article XXIV of the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) &ndash; the principal agreement under which the WTO operates - provides for the establishment and operation of Free Trade Agreements between parties to the WTO. The EU is currently operating approximately 70 preferential trade agreements in place world-wide, representing 40% of total EU trade.<\/p><p>The WTO&rsquo;s Dispute Settlement Mechanism (DSM) has been in operation since 1994 under the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement (Annex 2 to the main agreement). This mechanism provides an effective means of settling disagreements on whether a Member State has acted in conformity with its international obligations. This system of dispute resolution has been an effective mechanism in resolving disputes at the WTO.<\/p><p>The European Union has included a dispute settlement mechanism based on the WTO DSM in all of its Free Trade Agreements since 2000. The principals of the WTO DSM are mirrored in the dispute settlement procedures within FTAs negotiated by the EU. The FTAs stipulate consultation among the parties, referrals to a panel for arbitration, with a decision or recommendation issued on the substance of the claim. Decisions are binding with the losing party required to amend their trading practice and\/or provide compensation to the injured party.<\/p><p>All EU-related FTAs are fully compliant with GATT and, in particular, Annex XXIV of the main agreement and Annex 2, the Dispute Settlement Mechanism. <\/p><p>Since 2015, the European Commission has followed a new approach to investment dispute settlement. The Investment Court System (ICS) was introduced as the EU&rsquo;s preferred investment dispute settlement mechanism in bilateral trade agreements to replace Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS), which was first introduced in the 1960s.\u00a0 ICS was developed after a thorough consultation process which began in 2014 and involved the European Parliament, EU Governments and civil society at large. The development of ICS was a direct response to problems identified with ISDS. ISDS is a system based on the principles of commercial arbitration whereby parties who have a dispute appoint arbitrators who hear and resolve cases, often &quot;in-camera&quot;. The problems with ISDS included a perceived lack of legitimacy, inconsistency, and a lack of transparency.\u00a0 ICS, by comparison, is based on the features of a permanent public domestic or international court including independent\u00a0panel members\u00a0and transparent and efficient proceedings.<\/p><p>The ICS model was first presented in September 2015 and it was first included in CETA, signed in October 2016. Since then, ICS has been the EU&rsquo;s preferred mechanism for resolution of investment disputes for inclusion in its Trade and Investment Agreements. The EU-Singapore Investment Protection Agreement and the EU-Vietnam Investment Protection Agreement both include ICS.<\/p><p>As the EU-Vietnam IPA, the EU-Singapore IPA and CETA are agreements of &ldquo;mixed competence&rdquo; &ndash; i.e.\u00a0covers competences\u00a0shared between the EU Commission and the Member States - they can only fully enter into force, including the CETA Investment Dispute Settlement elements,\u00a0once each individual EU Member State has approved them in line with its own national procedures.<\/p><p>Insofar as the Deputy&rsquo;s specific questions on CETA are concerned, CETA has been provisionally applied since 21<sup>st<\/sup>September 2017. The provisional application has allowed for the removal of customs duties, substantially improved access to the Canadian public procurement market, opened up new sectors of the Canadian services market, reduced regulatory barriers, and provided more transparent rules for market access.\u00a0 The provisions within CETA which relate to areas of shared competence, between the EU and the Member States, including the Investment Court System (ICS) have been excluded from provisional application. This means that Ireland and the other Member States will not be bound by these provisions until they are ratified by all Member States in accordance with their national laws.<\/p><p>In 2017, Belgium requested an Opinion (1\/17) from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the compatibility of the ICS in CETA with the European Treaties.\u00a0 The Advocate General delivered his Opinion on this case on 29<sup>th<\/sup>January 2019, which found that the mechanism for the settlement of disputes is compatible with the EU Treaty, the FEU Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. While this Opinion is not binding, and the final Opinion of the Court may differ, it is often an important indicator for the final ruling.\u00a0 The Opinion of the CJEU on this matter is expected on 30<sup>th<\/sup>April 2019. My Department awaits this Opinion, which will inform\u00a0my plans for ratification of CETA. To date, 12 EU Member States have ratified CETA: Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Portugal, Spain and\u00a0Sweden.<\/p><p>In relation to EU &amp;amp; National Studies on Free Trade Agreements, I can inform the Deputy that the European Commission published its second annual report on the implementation of trade agreements on 31<sup>st<\/sup>October 2018. The report covers 2017 and shows that trade under existing EU trade agreements grew in 2017.\u00a0 For example, exports to South Korea increased by over 12%, exports to Colombia by more than 10%, and EU exports to Canada rose by 7% in the nine months following the entry into force of the EU-Canada Agreement.\u00a0 EU agri-food producers are among the main beneficiaries of\u00a0the abolition of\u00a0customs duties, with strong export increases last year.\u00a0 However, the report also found that European exporters could benefit even more \u00a0from the opportunities offered by the Agreements in place.\u00a0 As a result, the European Commission is increasing its efforts to inform and help EU companies, especially SMEs, to benefit from trade deals. The report can be accessed at: <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>Separately, my Department has commissioned a study to examine the economic impacts for Ireland of EU Free Trade Agreements that were recently agreed or are under negotiation, including Korea, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Mercosur, Australia and New Zealand. The objective is to understand the impacts of these FTAs on the economy such as output, trade, employment and income. It will contain a range of recommendations to assist Ireland in capitalising on the benefits of the agreements and guide us on further actions to reduce barriers to implementation. This report is due to be completed by Q2 2019.<\/p><p>At EU level, the European Commission regularly undertakes impact assessments of Free Trade Agreements. These assessments provide evidence and information to inform decisions on trade policy. Impact assessments identify problems and solutions; and describe the likely economic, environmental, social and human rights impacts of those solutions. For trade agreements, they aim to address questions as to how negotiations will improve trade relations with a specific partner and what issues should be covered in the negotiations.\u00a0 An impact assessment also includes an online public consultation of interested parties. The impact assessments are available at: <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>On 18<sup>th<\/sup>January 2019, the European Commission adopted proposals for &ldquo;Negotiating Directives&rdquo; &ndash; or Mandates &ndash; for its proposed trade talks with the United States; one on conformity assessment (making it easier for companies to prove their products meet technical requirements on both sides of the Atlantic), and one on the elimination of tariffs for industrial goods (excluding agricultural products). The Commission published the draft mandates at the same time as submitting them to the EU Member States.<\/p><p>The proposed negotiating directives are currently being discussed by Member States and if approved by Council, the finalised mandates would set the parameters for formal negotiations to commence. However, it is important to note that these two mandates are of a limited scope, covering two distinct areas agreed in the July 2018 EU-US Joint Statement. They do not constitute a mandate for negotiations on a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement, which would involve negotiations across a far wider range of sectors and topics, including sustainable development.\u00a0 My Department has engaged directly with stakeholders in Ireland on the terms of these mandates which has informed our approach.\u00a0 As these negotiations are sectorally-focused based on the July 2018 Agreement between Presidents Juncker and Trump, the EU\u00a0will not be negotiating on agricultural products\/access.<\/p><p>Finally, the tabular information requested by the Deputy is as follows:<\/p><p>Figure 1: EU Free Trade Agreements entered into since 2000 which include a dispute settlement mechanism based on the WTO dispute settlement mechanism\u00a0<table><tr><th>Title<\/th><th>Parties<\/th><th>Date of Signature<\/th><th>Date of Entry into Force<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Albania-EC Association Agreement<\/td><td>EU, Albania<\/td><td>12\/06\/2006<\/td><td>01\/04\/2009<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Algeria-EC Association Agreement<\/td><td>EU, Algeria<\/td><td>22\/04\/2002<\/td><td>01\/09\/2005<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bosnia-EC Stabilization Agreement<\/td><td>EU, Bosnia-Herzegovina<\/td><td>16\/06\/2008<\/td><td>01\/06\/2015<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Chile-EC Association Agreement<\/td><td>EU, Chile<\/td><td>18\/11\/2002<\/td><td>01\/02\/2003<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EC-Egypt Association Agreement<\/td><td>EU, Egypt<\/td><td>25\/06\/2001<\/td><td>01\/06\/2004<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EU - SADC EPA Group Agreement<\/td><td>EU, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland<\/td><td>10\/06\/2016<\/td><td>05\/02\/2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EU - Georgia Association Agreement<\/td><td>EU, Georgia<\/td><td>27\/06\/2014<\/td><td>01\/07\/2016<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EU - Japan Economic Partnership   Agreement<\/td><td>EU, Japan<\/td><td>17\/07\/2018<\/td><td>01\/02\/2019<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EC-Jordan Association Agreement<\/td><td>EU, Jordan<\/td><td>24\/11\/1997<\/td><td>01\/05\/2002<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EC - Lebanon Association Agreement<\/td><td>EU, Lebanon<\/td><td>17\/06\/2002<\/td><td>01\/04\/2006<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mexico-EC Cooperation Agreement<\/td><td>EU, Mexico<\/td><td>27\/02\/2001<\/td><td>01\/03\/2001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EU - Moldova Association Agreement<\/td><td>EU, Moldova<\/td><td>27\/06\/2014<\/td><td>01\/07\/2016<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EU-Montenegro Association Agreement<\/td><td>EU, Montenegro<\/td><td>15\/10\/2007<\/td><td>01\/05\/2010<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EC-Morocco Association Agreement<\/td><td>EU, Morocco<\/td><td>26\/02\/1996<\/td><td>01\/03\/2000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EC-Macedonia Association Agreement<\/td><td>EU, North Macedonia<\/td><td>09\/04\/2001<\/td><td>01\/04\/2004<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EC-Serbia Association Agreement<\/td><td>EU, Serbia<\/td><td>29\/04\/2008<\/td><td>01\/09\/2013<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EU-Korea FTA<\/td><td>EU, South Korea<\/td><td>06\/10\/2010<\/td><td>13\/12\/2015<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CARIFORUM - EC EPA<\/td><td>EU, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint\u00a0Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Dominican Republic<\/td><td>15\/10\/2008<\/td><td>Provisionally applied from 29\/12\/2008<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EU-Cameroon Interim EPA<\/td><td>EU, Cameroon<\/td><td>15\/01\/2009<\/td><td>Provisionally applied from 04\/08\/2014<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CETA<\/td><td>EU, Canada<\/td><td>30\/10\/2016<\/td><td>Provisionally applied from 21\/09\/2017 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EU-Colombia\/Peru\/Ecuador FTA<\/td><td>EU, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador<\/td><td>26\/06\/2012<\/td><td>Provisionally applied between EU\/Peru from 01\/03\/2013;

Last year, I provided funding of &euro;500,000 to support the work of Men&rsquo;s Sheds throughout Ireland. <\/p><p>- The LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 which will provide &euro;250 million in financial resources to address the challenges facing rural areas over the course of the programme period, particularly under the themes of economic development and social inclusion.<\/p><p>In addition, other actions in the current Action Plan for Rural Development being delivered by Departments across government that will help those who feel isolated or vulnerable include:<\/p><p>- Investment of &euro;46 million in Garda fleet to ensure that Garda&iacute; are mobile, visible and responsive to prevent and tackle crime.<\/p><p>- Maintaining the network of senior helplines in operation throughout the country, which offer a listening service for older people to help address issues such as loneliness and isolation in rural areas.<\/p><p>- Continued support and prioritisation of community crime prevention through schemes such as Neighbourhood Watch and Text Alert.\u00a0Since its launch in September 2013, community Text Alert has grown quickly with a total of 164,000 subscribers and in the order of 3 million text messages sent annually.<\/p><p>- Continued improvements in the Rural Transport Programme, including the provision of new routes. A total of 65 new evening\/night time Local Link services were approved for funding in 2018, with the majority of approved services commencing operation in July 2018. Funding was provided for services operating up to 31 December 2018 (six month pilot). New regular scheduled Local Link services were launched in 2018 in Donegal, Sligo, Waterford, Galway, Cavan, Monaghan, Offaly and Kerry.  <b><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040300072#WRH03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1334"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Broadband Scheme","counter":441,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040300072#WRH03800"},{"type":"question","counter":442,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[15634\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040300072#WRH03900","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the extent to which his Department addresses such issues as local connectivity in rural areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":443,"content":"<p>The availability of a high quality, high speed broadband network and of reliable mobile phone coverage are essential components underpinning the connectivity and development of rural communities in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce was established in July 2016 to identify solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and to investigate how better services could be provided to consumers prior to full rollout of the National Broadband Plan. <\/p>  <p>  The Taskforce published its report in December 2016, which set out 40 actions aimed at addressing the issues associated with mobile phone and broadband connectivity, particularly in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  A cross-Departmental Implementation Group, which I chair, was established in early 2017 to ensure that the actions identified by the Taskforce are implemented in a timely manner.

The position of these tenants is significantly improved by the change, which commenced on 7 April 2016, as they now benefit from the following: <\/p><p>- Increased security of tenure;<\/p><p>- Access to Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) dispute resolution procedures, including free mediation;<\/p><p>- Binding obligations on AHBs as landlords to, <i>inter alia<\/i>, register all tenancies, keep dwellings in good repair and allow peaceful occupation. <\/p><p>A number of measures have been introduced in recent years with the objective of improving security of tenure for tenants.  Security of tenure provisions under the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2016 apply once a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months, with no notice of termination having been served during that time.  On completion of the 6-month occupation, the tenant is entitled to specific protections under the Residential Tenancies Act as long as the tenant complies with their own obligations. One of the protections relates to the tenant&rsquo;s entitlement to remain in occupation for up to 4 years from the commencement of the tenancy, where the tenancy commenced prior to 24 December 2016, and for up to 6 years, where the tenancy commenced on or after 24 December 2016. <\/p><p>Section 62 of the Residential Tenancies Act requires a landlord to state in a tenancy termination notice the reason, or reasons, for termination.  Section 34 provides that a landlord must state a reason for the termination in any notice served, in accordance with the grounds for termination set out the Table to section 34 of the Act. A landlord may not terminate a Part 4 tenancy except on clearly defined grounds which are set out in the Table to section 34 of the Act. However, an approved housing body cannot terminate a Part 4 tenancy on the grounds that it wishes to occupy a dwelling. <\/p><p>If a landlord is terminating the tenancy on the grounds that he or she intends to substantially refurbish or renovate the dwelling in a way that requires the dwelling to be vacated for that purpose, the notice of termination must include a statement:<\/p><p>(a) specifying the nature of the intended works and providing a copy of any related planning permission. Where planning permission is not required, the notice or statement must specify the name of the contractor and the proposed dates for the works; and<\/p><p>(b) that the landlord is required to offer to the tenant a tenancy of the dwelling if it becomes available for re-letting within a period of 6 months, subject to certain conditions.<\/p><p>Section 56 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 provides for situations where there is an abuse of the termination procedure in Section 34 of the Act.<\/p><p>It is important to note that where a tenancy is terminated for the purposes of substantial refurbishment or renovation and the required works are completed with the dwelling becoming available for re-letting within 6 months of the termination, it must be offered for re-letting to the former tenant.<\/p><p>The landlord must confirm that the existing or current tenant has the option of commencing a new tenancy in the refurbished or renovated dwelling, if it becomes available within 6 months from the end of the notice period given (or if there is an RTB dispute on the validity of the notice, within 6 months of the end of that dispute).
