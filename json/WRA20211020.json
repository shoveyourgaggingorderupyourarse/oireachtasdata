The Sub-group, chaired by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, published the Action Plan for Insurance Reform in December 2020. This is one of the most important programmes of reform that this Government will undertake. Implementation of the Plan is on track with the first six-monthly Implementation Report published in July 2021, showing that work is progressing well to implement the Action Plan, with 34 of the 66 actions completed. This work is driven by the Cabinet Committee Sub-Group on Insurance Reform, the next meeting of which\u00a0 will be convening this week to review progress to date and consider progress of the remaining actions\u00a0 in a timely manner.<\/p>  <p>  Among the actions completed are the introduction of the Personal Injuries Guidelines which came into effect on the 24th of April. Since the implementation of the Guidelines, the average PIAB award has decreased by approximately 40% with 71% of awards now &euro;15,000 or less compared to 30% of PIAB awards in 2020. Although Government will continue to monitor the      situation closely, the\u00a0new Guidelines clearly represent a significant shift in the manner in which general damages are awarded in our country and in the level of those damages and should exert downward pressure on insurance costs. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to actions under my Department, as Minister of State with responsibility for PIAB I have met regularly with PIAB and a range of representative bodies to assess the role of PIAB and develop proposals to enhance and reform the agency. Heads of a Bill have been developed in consultation with PIAB, which I am considering. I am also progressing legislation to strengthen competition law in Ireland. The legislation will break new ground in this area, giving competition authorities, such as the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), enhanced powers including administrative sanctions and other tools in dealing with anti-competitive practices.<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021 was signed into law in June 2021 and commenced on 28 July 2021.\u00a0 The legislation provides a clear definition of perjury and should enable the offence and related offences to be more easily prosecuted in the courts.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market has been established within the Department of Finance, chaired by Minister of State Fleming and supported by my Department. The work of the Office includes engaging with sectoral stakeholders to understand gaps in the insurance market, with a view to expanding the risk appetite of existing insurers. It is also involved in exploring opportunities for new entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance. This Office provides a coordinated Government policy approach to increasing competition in the insurance sector.<\/p>  <p>  The scope of the National Claims Information Database has been widened to cover Employer Liability and Public Liability with a first report published by the Central Bank in July.<\/p>  <p>  While progress on these actions is welcome, Government is committed to doing more to reduce insurance costs. The Minister for Justice is considering legislative proposals to reform the law in the area of occupier&rsquo;s liability. Under the Action Plan, the Department of Justice is working on several actions in the area of fraud. We will also enhance the National Claims Information Database. Ministers and I have met regularly with stakeholders to understand the issues they face and to inform our policy making process.

The increase in the rate by &euro;7.50 in Budget 2022 brings the overall rate to &euro;41 per tonne. The increase applied from 13 October 2021 for diesel and petrol, and will apply from 1 May 2022 for all other fuels to allow for the winter heating season.<\/p><p>A predictable schedule of carbon tax increases, in conjunction with other measures such as investment in active mobility and energy efficiency measures, and a progressive replacement of the private car fleet to electric vehicles, will allow households and businesses to plan for increases in carbon tax and, over time, this will change consumption and investment decisions.<\/p><p>On foot of a commitment in the Programme for Government, the ESRI published a report entitled, &quot;Carbon taxes, poverty and compensation options,&quot; on 13 October 2020. The report identified a series of targeted direct social protection payment interventions that could be used to address the effects an increase in the price of fossil fuels would have on lower income households and examined the effect of each of these. This report subsequently informed the introduction of a number of social welfare measures in Budget 2021 designed to mitigate the impact of increasing the rates of carbon tax on lower income households. <\/p><p>This year&rsquo;s carbon tax increase was again accompanied by a series of parallel measures, introduced by the Minister for Social Protection in Budget 2022, intended to assist low-income households:  <\/p><p>- an increase to the Qualified Child Payment of &euro;2 per week for children under 12, and &euro;3 per week for children over 12; <\/p><p>- an increase in the Living Alone Allowance of &euro;3 per week;  <\/p><p>- an increase to the Fuel Allowance of &euro;5 per week; and <\/p><p>- an increase in the income threshold for the Working Family Payment of &euro;10 per week.<\/p><p>My Department defines energy poverty as an inability to heat or power a home to an adequate degree. It is currently measured as a requirement to spend more than 10% of a household&rsquo;s income on energy needs, which is an accepted and recognised method of assessing the likely level of energy poverty. The ESRI carried out an analysis of the number of households at risk of experiencing energy poverty in 2019 and again in 2020. This showed that the share of households needing to spend more than 10% of their income on their energy needs was 17.5% in 2020. <\/p><p>While the ESRI report referred to above updates the measurement of energy poverty to 2020 levels, it did not specifically link this measurement to a proposed approach for the redistribution of carbon tax revenues. Instead the report noted that, due to difficulties with measuring energy poverty with accuracy, there is a compelling case for focusing on the net impact of any rise in the carbon tax on more established measures of poverty, such as the official at risk-of-poverty rate. The report shows that by doing this it is possible to raise the carbon tax while reducing poverty in general. It is important to note that the ESRI has also previously found that energy poverty and poverty in general are closely linked in Ireland and, that by targeting supports towards those at risk of poverty, it is likely that those in energy poverty are also supported. In line with this, Government supports for those at risk of energy poverty focus on both income supports and energy efficiency upgrades. Free energy efficiency upgrades are only available to those in receipt of certain welfare payments and those living in social housing, meaning that the support is targeted to lower income households. A review of the implementation of the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty will be completed this year and will inform next steps in relation to the development of a new strategy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000069#WRB02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":55,"content":"<p>Question No. 72 answered with Question No. 71.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan","counter":56,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000069#WRB03100"},{"type":"question","counter":57,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[51587\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000069#WRB03200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when a village (details supplied) will be connected by National Broadband Ireland;if this has changed to the initial plan in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":58,"content":"<p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i>, shows the areas which will be included in the National Broadband Plan (NBP) State led intervention as well as areas\u00a0targeted by commercial operators.

Ireland&rsquo;s international supply chains are similarly challenged.<\/p><p>In relation to shipping, shipping costs across the globe have risen considerably. This is largely attributed to the disruption caused to the global supply chains by the COVID-19 pandemic. On a more local level, the end of the Brexit transition also represented an inevitable disruption to normal trade flows as businesses adjust to the effect of the UK becoming a third country.<\/p><p>In the first half of 2021, the volume of goods traded globally increased significantly as economies reopened. Surging demand coupled with moderate supply growth caused upward pressure on shipping charter rates. The surging demand was evident on all major containership routes. Disruption to supply lines during initial waves of the pandemic has meant that capacity in the containership industry has not kept pace with demand, driving shipping charter rates upward.<\/p><p>Within the aviation sector, cargo-only flights continued to operate during COVID but the grounding of the majority of scheduled passenger services, with the consequential loss of bellyhold capacity, had a significant impact on the price of air cargo. I expect to see a phased reintroduction of a number of European routes from Dublin towards year-end. Together with the impending relaxation of US travel restrictions, we should see an increase in capacity for belly hold air cargo over the coming months.<\/p><p>In the road haulage sector, the demand for use of the UK landbridge for accessing EU markets has fallen considerably as a result of Brexit. This has driven the simultaneous decline in Ireland-GB traffic and an increase in direct Ireland-EU traffic. However, land borders across the EU remain fully open and no delays, outside of the norm, are being seen.<\/p><p>There is however a shortage of HGV drivers. This is not an issue confined to Ireland, but has been a growing issue across Europe and globally for number of years. It has been exacerbated in an Irish context by COVID and Brexit. Both the Irish Road Haulage Association and Freight Transport Association of Ireland have informed my Department that Irish road transport operators are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit and retain qualified HGV drivers from Irish labour supply and from abroad.<\/p><p>Overall, like many countries across the EU and globally, Ireland&rsquo;s supply chain remains under considerable strain. In terms of mitigating actions, my Department has and continues to meet with stakeholders from the shipping, aviation, haulage and exporter associations in relation to the range of issues they are experiencing, and rapidly responding to, due to Covid and Brexit. In relation to shipping supply lines, the Irish Maritime Development Office continues to monitor maritime traffic, trade and the global shipping market data.<\/p><p>In aviation, as part of Budget 2022, the Government announced a substantial aviation package of &euro;90m to be used by state airports to further incentivise the restoration of connectivity and associated bellyhold capacity.<\/p><p>In response to HGV driver shortages, a National Logistics and Supply Chain<b><\/b>Skills Group is in place since 2019 and various actions have already been taken by the Group in collaboration with the industry to promote the training opportunities available. In addition, Minister of State Hildegarde Naughton has asked the \u00a0Group to examine the driver shortage problem and to make recommendations for mitigation. A number of interim actions are already being progressed including the acceleration of HGV driver licence exchange agreements with additional non-EEA countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000069#WRB04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000069#WRB04600"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[51364\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000069#WRB04700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he or any official from his Department has held meetings or conducted correspondence with a company (details supplied) from 1 January 2017 to date; if his Department has engaged the services of the company for any purposes from 1 January 2017 to date; if so, the nature of such services and the costs incurred; if a tender process was conducted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":73,"content":"<p>Neither I, nor any official from my Department has held meetings or conducted correspondence with the company named in the period 1 January 2017 to date, as far as I am aware.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000069#WRB04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus Services","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000069#WRB04900"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[51434\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000069#WRB05000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on a proposal for an electric bus in Killarney, County Kerry (details supplied); if there is a grant available to get the bus up and running; and the steps that can be taken to progress the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>Providing a sustainable, low-carbon transport system is a key priority of the Irish Government.

At the core of these measures is identifying and targeting the smuggling of illicit tobacco products into the State, with a view to disrupting the supply chain, seizing the products and, where possible, prosecuting those involved. Revenue&rsquo;s strategy involves developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources on a risk-focused basis. In that context, I am aware that Revenue monitors trends in the illicit tobacco trade on an ongoing basis and adjusts its actions and redeploys its resources in response to new developments or methodologies employed by the criminal gangs involved in that trade.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has achieved considerable success in tackling the illicit tobacco trade. In 2020, it seized 48.2 million cigarettes valued at &euro;32.8 million. In the same year, it obtained 35 summary and one indictable conviction relating to the sale of illicit tobacco, with fines of &euro;83,500 imposed. In addition, there were 8 convictions relating to tobacco smuggling in 2020, 4 of which were on indictment, with fines of &euro;10,000 imposed. <\/p>  <p>  To the end of September 2021, Revenue seized 42.4m cigarettes valued at &euro;30m. In addition, it obtained 22 summary convictions relating to the sale of illicit tobacco with fines of &euro;51,750 imposed, and 8 summary tobacco smuggling convictions with fines of &euro;20,000 imposed. <\/p>  <p>  The smuggling of tobacco products is an illegal transnational activity.\u00a0 The production and distribution of illicit cigarettes crosses international boundaries. In response Revenue, in conjunction with national and international partners, undertake a programme of activity to counter those involved in such illegal activity. Considerable success has been achieved internationally as a result of the Revenue programme of work in this area. In June 2021, Revenue identified illicit movements of raw tobacco and engaged in international operations that led to the seizure of 6.5 tonnes of tobacco in Glasgow and the identification and dismantling of a counterfeit hand-rolling tobacco factory in Stoke-on-Trent.\u00a0 In July 2021, as a result of a significant operation between Revenue and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), an illicit cigarette manufacturing facility was identified in Northern Ireland, leading to the seizure of 1.6 million cigarettes and 11 tonnes of tobacco along with non-tobacco materials used in the manufacturing process.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Revenue engages in joint operations with international partners, including OLAF (the EU&rsquo;s anti-fraud agency), Europol and the World Customs Organisation in countering the activities of those involved in the illicit international tobacco trade.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue is very conscious of the threat that tobacco smuggling poses to health, to legitimate business interests and to the Exchequer. I commend Revenue and all the relevant State agencies for their work in this important area and I am satisfied that there is an appropriate focus on tackling this form of criminality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":87,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":88,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[51354\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he or any official from his Department has held meetings or conducted correspondence with a company (details supplied) from 1 January 2017 to date; if his Department has engaged the services of the company for any purposes from 1 January 2017 to date; if so, the nature of such services and the costs incurred; if a tender process was conducted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":89,"content":"<p>Deputy, in relation to your question concerning Kinzen Limited previously known as Neva Labs, I wish to advise that no meetings have been held and no correspondence has been conducted with this company, either by myself or by any official from my Department. <\/p><p>I can also confirm that my Department has not engaged the services of Kinzen Limited previously known as Neva Labs and that no payment has been made to this company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":90,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE00800"},{"type":"question","counter":91,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[51409\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department will ensure e-cigarettes and other so-called risk products are taxed at the same rate as traditional cigarettes in the forthcoming review of the EU Tobacco Excise Directive to make them less attractive to young smokers following publication of data from the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America showing disposable e-cigarettes use among high school students increased from 2.6% in 2019 to 26.5% in 2020, a 1,000% increase; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":92,"content":"<p>Council Directive 2011\/64\/EU sets out EU rules on the structure and rates of excise duty applied to manufactured tobacco.

The purpose of the Directive is to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market and a high level of health protection.<\/p>  <p>  Every four years, the European Commission is required to submit a report to the Council on the rates and the structure of excise duties, accompanied &ndash; where appropriate &ndash; by a proposal for the revision of the Directive. The latest report was prepared by the Commission on 10 February 2020 and on 2 June 2020 the Council approved conclusions setting out its priorities in relation to the review of the Directive. A public consultation, open between 30 March 2021 and 22 June 2021, sought to ensure that all relevant stakeholders had an opportunity to express their views on the current rules and on possible changes to these rules. The Commission is expected to bring forward a new legislative proposal later this year or early in 2022 and the impact of this can be assessed when the proposal is available.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission Report and the Council conclude that it is necessary to upgrade the EU regulatory framework, in order to tackle current and future challenges in respect of the functioning of the internal market by harmonising definitions and tax treatment of novel products (such as liquids for e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products), including products that substitute tobacco, in order to avoid legal uncertainty and regulatory disparities in the EU. Revision can also address the issue of tax-induced substitution across products and enable further measures to combat the illicit trade in tobacco to address tax control, revenue collection and health protection issues.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland welcomes the review of the Directive to ensure that the rules remain fit for purpose, safeguard the proper functioning of the internal market and, very importantly, provide for a high level of health protection. This latter point is particularly significant in the context of the plan in the Programme for Government to introduce a targeted taxation regime to specifically discourage &lsquo;vaping&rsquo; and e-cigarettes as well as in the\u00a0European Action Plan against Cancer\u00a0and our own national policy,\u00a0Tobacco Free Ireland, both of which recognise that taxation plays a pivotal role in reducing tobacco consumption, in particular in deterring youth from smoking. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to a policy of high taxation of tobacco to encourage people to quit smoking.

It sets out the categories of alcohol and alcoholic beverages that fall within scope of taxation and the basis on which excise duties on such products are to be established. Council Directive 2020\/1151 amends Directive 92\/83\/EEC and includes a new Article 13a which allows Member States the option to grant up to 50% excise relief to independent small producers of fermented beverages such as cider. The amendments to the Directive do not take effect until 1 January 2022. Therefore, I am not in a position to introduce any excise relief measures for small producers of fermented beverages such as cider until after this date. <\/p>  <p>  Up until this point, it has not been possible to offer reduced rates to small producers of cider, in the same way as applies to small producers of beer, as the application of Article 4 of the Directive is restricted to beer. Ireland is not an outlier, as other Member States have been in the same position. Ireland fully supported the introduction of amendments to the Directive to allow Member States introduce excise reliefs for small producers of cider. As I outlined in my Budget Speech last week, I see the introduction of such a relief as having a similar positive effect as that provided for small independent producers of beer. <\/p>  <p>  The new Article 13a is structured differently to what is permitted under Article 4. Therefore, the existing relief in Irish legislation for beer could not be simply extended to cider.\u00a0 It will be necessary to provide a separate new relief, which would be similar in concept but different in detail. While this measure will be broadly modelled on the existing relief arrangements for beer, further considerations will need to be given to ensure clarity in relation to scope of the relief and also to its design and implementation so as to minimise the administrative burden and any compliance risks. My Department is considering these matters further and will engage with the sector and with the Revenue Commissioners over the coming months.

The Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021, signed into law on 19 July, provided for the extension of EWSS to 31 December 2021, ensuring that the scheme continues to provide ongoing and necessary employment support for eligible businesses as the economy returns to a full re-opening.\u00a0\u00a0 In my Budget Day announcement, I\u00a0confirmed\u00a0that the scheme would continue to operate in a graduated form\u00a0until 30 April 2022. <\/p>  <p>  The EWSS legislation\u00a0provides that for employers to be eligible for the EWSS, they must be able to demonstrate that their business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders for the calendar year 2021 compared to the calendar year 2019 and that this disruption to normal business is caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  The employer can self-assess for EWSS eligibility on the basis that there has been at least a 30% reduction in the turnover of the business or customer orders. I have been advised by Revenue that if a reduction in customer orders is the basis to determine eligibility, as a transport operator, the business must demonstrate at least a 30% reduction in the following:<\/p>  <p>  - the volume of online bookings for passenger journeys; or <\/p>  <p>  - the number of passenger journeys; or <\/p>  <p>  - the value of passenger ticket sales.<\/p>  <p>  Where a reduction in turnover is the basis to determine eligibility, when undertaking a review of the potential reduction in turnover, employers need to include all sources of trade income specifically including sales, donations, State funding, etc. This would include income from fares, Free Travel Schemes and potentially NTA funding support. However, the treatment of Government grants and public funding for the purposes of determining a reduction in turnover is dependent on the nature of the grant or funding arrangement. In reviewing their eligibility, employers should consider the specific nature and terms of the funding arrangement having regard to the applicable accounting standards and required recognition treatment of such grants or public funding arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  The EWSS legislation requires that immediately at the end of each month, from the introduction of the scheme in August 2020 onwards, each employer availing of the scheme must carry out a self-review of its business circumstances and if it is manifest to the employer that it no longer meets the eligibility test for qualification for the scheme, then the employer must immediately cease claiming wage subsidy payments.<\/p>  <p>To assist employers in conducting a monthly review of its continuing eligibility for the scheme, Revenue is providing an EWSS Eligibility Review Form through its Revenue Online Service (ROS). From 21 July 2021, completing and submitting an EWSS Eligibility Review Form to Revenue is necessary to avail of EWSS supports, with details of an employer&rsquo;s monthly eligibility review check to be submitted by the 15th of the following month.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Timely submission of the form will provide assurance to both employers and Revenue that subsequent EWSS claims are appropriate and in line with the terms of the scheme. This, together with Revenue&rsquo;s EWSS ongoing real-time compliance program, will reduce the possibility of employers, inadvertently or incorrectly, claiming EWSS amounts to which they are not entitled and having to subsequently repay those amounts to Revenue.<\/p>  <p>  Any employers who have queries relating to the EWSS eligibility criteria should contact the Revenue office that deals with their tax affairs for assistance.\u00a0 In addition, detailed information relating to amounts to be included in the calculation of turnover for EWSS purposes is set out in Revenue&rsquo;s published eligibility guidelines which can be found at: www.revenue.ie\/en\/employing-people\/documents\/ewss\/ewss-guidelines.pdf.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":102,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE02000"},{"type":"question","counter":103,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[51584\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will introduce a two-tier stamp duty rate for land with a reduced rate applying to active farmers who work the land directly in order to increase output and production; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":104,"content":"<p>The current stamp duty rate for non-residential property, which includes agricultural land, is 7.5%. <\/p>  <p>  Farming is first and foremost a business, and indeed section 655 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997\u00a0states \"For the purposes of the Tax Acts, farming shall be treated as the carrying on of a trade or, as the case may be, of part of a trade, and the profits or gains of farming shall be charged to tax under Case I of Schedule D.\"\u00a0\u00a0It is therefore appropriate\u00a0for acquisitions of farmland\u00a0to be subject, in the normal course of events, to the rate of stamp duty applicable to other non-residential property.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  However, in respect of agricultural land, there are\u00a0a range of generous and targeted reliefs from stamp duty, specific to that type of\u00a0property, which remove in full\u00a0or reduce the rate of stamp duty payable on the acquisition of farmland,\u00a0currently available.

The principal change extended the residential element of the scheme to landlords, who may now claim the relief by way of accelerated capital allowances for the conversion and refurbishment of property, which was built prior to 1915, where such property is to be used for residential purposes.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to property-based reliefs more generally, taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government through which to boost overall housing supply. In line with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines, consideration of whether a tax measure is the most appropriate policy tool for a given purpose is required. The presumption should be that non-tax measures should be considered before the use of a tax&ndash;based measure. The primary responsibility for direct expenditure based policy in this area lies with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in this sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":109,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[51609\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is satisfied with the way in which the obligations for the new valuation period of 2022 to 2025 for the local property tax was communicated to taxpayers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":110,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[51610\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if additional supports will be made available to older persons who may have had family members avail of the local property tax online options previously and who remain unaware of the obligations for the new valuation period of 2022 to 2025; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":111,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[51611\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE02900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if taxpayers can defer the obligations for the new valuation period of 2022 to 2025 for the local property tax if they were unaware of the notice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":112,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90, 91 and 92 together.<\/p>  <p>Local Property Tax (LPT) is a self-assessed tax.\u00a0 As such, for the new &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo; of 2022 to 2025, it is a matter for residential property owners themselves to determine the market value of their property as at 1 November 2021, calculate the LPT due and submit an LPT Return to Revenue by 7 November 2021.\u00a0 This is the case regardless of whether a property owner has received a formal notification from Revenue or not.<\/p>  <p>  However, I am advised that Revenue has issued over 1.4 million notices to property owners, setting out what is required to meet Local Property Tax (LPT) obligations for the new &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo;. This includes approximately 200,000 hard-copy LPT returns to property owners who have not previously availed of the online options and may not be able to avail of, access or use the LPT online services. <\/p>  <p>  In recent weeks, Revenue has commenced a comprehensive LPT media campaign, highlighting the obligations for the new &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo; and the assistance available to enable property owners to fulfil their LPT obligations. Revenue spokespeople have taken part in several national and local media interviews and continue to do so. The LPT media campaign will continue over the coming weeks, in the lead up to the 7 November filing date, using both print and digital channels. I am also advised that Revenue has actively engaged with various representative groups to further enhance the public communications campaign.<\/p>  <p>  The Revenue website includes a dedicated page outlining what property owners are required to do for the new &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo;. When determining the market value of a property for the new &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo;, property owners can use online sources, such as the Revenue interactive valuation tool, which can be found on the Revenue website.\u00a0 Other online sources include the Residential Property Price Register or property sales websites such as daft.ie and myhome.ie.<\/p>  <p>  Where property owners cannot use these online facilities to value their properties, sources such as the property pages in newspapers (local and\/or national) or checking the information displayed in local auctioneer offices can provide useful guidance.\u00a0 Property owners are not required to determine an exact valuation of their property, they are only required to value their properties within a &lsquo;valuation band&rsquo;.\u00a0 There are 20 valuation bands, the first band is &euro;0 - &euro;200,000, the second band is &euro;200,001 - &euro;262,500 and all other valuation bands are &euro;87,500 wide.<\/p>  <p>  To assist property owners who may be experiencing difficulties meeting their Return filing obligations Revenue is operating an LPT Helpline (01-7383626), which operates from 9.30am to 4.30pm, Monday to Friday. Property owners who have not received a notice from Revenue, or a hard-copy LPT Return and are unable to file online should contact the Helpline for assistance.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the service the Helpline agents will assist with both the Return filing and payment selection processes. In advance of calling the Helpline, property owners will need to have determined the market value of their property so that the Return can be completed. They should also have their PPSN, Property ID and PIN to hand. The Property ID and PIN numbers can be found on any LPT correspondence previously received from Revenue. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the deferral of any LPT obligations, the LPT regime includes arrangements whereby a person may opt to defer, or partially defer (50%), payment of the tax in certain circumstances. These circumstances include income level, hardship and personal insolvency. They do not include the circumstances the Deputy has referred to in Question No. 51611\/21, i.e. where a person was unaware of their obligations for the new &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo;.\u00a0 A liable person must make a claim for a payment deferral in writing to Revenue setting out his or her personal circumstances.\u00a0 Comprehensive information on the deferral arrangements are set out on the Revenue website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":113,"content":"<p>Question No. 91 answered with Question No. 90.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":114,"content":"<p>Question No. 92 answered with Question No. 90.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":116,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[51624\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will address concerns that the current system of tax individualisation may be discriminatory in practice as it penalises one income married couples by making it necessary for them to pay more tax than two income married couples; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":117,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[51625\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider initiating a review of the current system of tax individualisation to ensure that it is not, either directly or indirectly, creating conditions in which it is more difficult for one spouse to remain at home without incurring additional tax liabilities as a one income married couple; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":118,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 94 together.<\/p><p><b>Background<\/b><\/p><p>Prior to 2000, income tax allowed for full joint assessment of married couples.\u00a0 This meant that the earner in a single income couple could use the combined tax credits and standard rate band available to both individuals &ndash; i.e. double the personal tax credit and rate band available to a single earner.\u00a0 As a result, where the primary earner of a couple had sufficient income to use the available reliefs in full, the second earner faced the marginal rate of tax from the first pound of income earned, which acted as a disincentive to workforce participation for second earners.<\/p><p>A process of moving towards an individualised system of income taxation began in the tax year 2000\/2001 with the stated economic objectives of increasing labour force participation and reducing the numbers of workers paying the higher rates of income tax. Many European countries have made similar moves towards a partial or fully individualised income taxation system on the grounds that it improves equality and economic independence for women. <\/p><p>Individualisation was progressed to some extent in later years but never completed. The result is that we now have a hybrid system. Up to &euro;9,000 of the standard-rate band can be transferred between spouses and the married personal tax credit, can be allocated in full to one spouse. Because the income tax system allows married couples to choose whether to be jointly or individually assessed, there can be a difference between the tax liabilities incurred by married couples on the same household income, depending on the method of assessment chosen. <\/p><p>However, in lieu of\u00a0fully transferable rate bands,\u00a0a Home Carer Tax Credit may be claimed where one spouse works primarily in the home to care for a dependent person, such as a child. This credit was introduced in the context of the move towards individualisation, in recognition of the choices made by families where one spouse stays at home to care for children or the elderly. <\/p><p>I would make the point that when looking at an issue such as individualisation there are a number of perspectives to consider, for example, on the one hand the points raised by the Deputy and also on the other hand the implications for labour force participation, in particular in respect of female participation in the labour market. There are of course other non-tax factors that also have significant impacts on female workforce participation, including the cost of childcare. <\/p><p>My Department keeps the issue of individualisation of the income tax bands under review.Most recently, the matter was considered in 2019 as part of the Tax Strategy Group deliberations ahead of Budget 2020.However, I have no immediate plans to revisit issue.<\/p><p><b>Tax Code<\/b><\/p><p>The Tax Code sets out the basis on which an individual is assessed to tax and provides for a significant number of credits, reliefs and exemptions, eligibility for which is subject to a wide range of conditions. While the basis of assessment and the credits, reliefs and exemptions available vary depending on the facts and circumstances applicable in each specific case, there is no discrimination in the Tax Code.<\/p><p>Basis of Assessment<\/p><p>Parts 44 and 44A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA 1997) provide for joint assessment of a married couple or civil partners who live together. Where joint assessment applies, the couple are chargeable to tax on their combined total income. The couple may however apply to be assessed to tax separately, meaning that each individual is taxed as if he or she were not married or in a civil partnership. The couple may choose whichever basis of assessment is most beneficial to them, based on their personal circumstances. <\/p><p>Standard Rate Band<\/p><p>Section 15 of the TCA 1997 provides for the standard rate band, i.e. how much of an individual&rsquo;s income is liable to tax at 20%. For the 2021 year of assessment, the standard rate band is &euro;35,300 per person. In the case of a married couple or civil partner, each individual is entitled to a standard rate band of &euro;35,300. <\/p><p>If the couple is jointly assessed to tax and either spouse or civil partner has insufficient income to fully utilise his or her own standard rate band, he or she may transfer a portion of their unused rate band to their spouse or civil partner. The maximum portion of the standard rate band which one spouse or civil partner may transfer to the other is &euro;9,000 and any excess unused rate band above this amount cannot be transferred. This is the case irrespective of whether the couple has one or two incomes.<\/p><p>Tax Credits, Reliefs and Exemptions<\/p><p>Part 15 of the TCA 1997 provides for a wide range of tax credits, reliefs and exemptions. Whether or not such credits, reliefs and exemptions are available to an individual or couple depends on the circumstances of the specific case and the eligibility criteria for the individual credit, relief or exemption. <\/p><p>One such credit is the basic personal tax credit, which is provided for in section 461 of the TCA 1997. For the 2021 year of assessment, the basic personal tax credit is valued at &euro;1,650 per person. In the case of a married couple or civil partnership, each spouse or civil partner will be entitled to his or her own basic personal tax credit of &euro;1,650. Again, this is the case irrespective of whether the couple has one or two incomes.<\/p><p>The home carer tax credit of &euro;1,600 is available to married couples or civil partners that are jointly assessed, where one spouse or civil partner stays at home to take care of a dependent person. The carer may earn up to &euro;7,200 per year without affecting the amount of the credit awarded. Where the carer&rsquo;s income exceeds &euro;7,200, the amount of credit available is reduced by one half of the excess over &euro;7,200, subject to a maximum income limit of &euro;10,400. <\/p><p>Further information on the above may be accessed at the following links:<\/p><p>- Revenue website - www.revenue.ie\/en\/life-events-and-personal-circumstances\/marital-status\/marriage-and-civil-partnerships\/index.aspx <\/p><p>- Tax and Duty Manual Part 44-01-01 - www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax-professionals\/tdm\/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax\/part-44\/44-01-01.pdf.<\/p><p>- Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-29 - www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax-professionals\/tdm\/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax\/part-15\/15-01-29.pdf <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":119,"content":"<p>Question No. 94 answered with Question No. 93.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE03800"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[51675\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention or that of his officials has been drawn to reports (details supplied) that the Central Bank is using off balance sheet structures to help in the concealment of losses; and if he or his officials have engaged with the Central Bank regarding the number of IBRC transactions that keep losses and liabilities off balance sheet.","asker":"1489","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":122,"content":"<p>I am aware that officials in my Department have sought clarification from the Deputy in relation to this parliamentary question.

Under the Act the Assessor is required to determine this value having regard to the following items:<\/p>  <p>  - on the basis of the true financial state of Anglo Irish Bank on 15 January 2009, taking into account the underlying market values of Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s assets and the extent of its actual, contingent and prospective liabilities on that date;<\/p>  <p>  - having regard to the rights attaching to each class of transferred shares; and<\/p>  <p>  - assuming that no financial assistance, investment or guarantee (other than the guarantee already provided under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008) would in future be provided to or made in Anglo Irish Bank, directly or indirectly, by the State.<\/p>  <p>  The final report of the Anglo Irish Bank Assessor states that, in his opinion, absent the provision of recapitalisation funds from the Government that the former Anglo Irish Bank was unlikely to be able to continue to trade as it was \"both cashflow and balance sheet insolvent\", as at 15 January 2009. <\/p>  <p>  The Project Atlas October 2008 report, which PwC prepared, was based on Anglo&rsquo;s IFRS balance sheet as at 30 September 2008 which was after the Government bank guarantee.\u00a0 The report stated that the balance sheet showed that the bank&rsquo;s assets exceeded its liabilities. <\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0note that the work conducted by the Assessor cannot be compared to the reports undertaken by PwC under Project Atlas given the different dates involved and the fact the Assessor's report was conducted on the assumption of no further future support being provided to the bank (in line with the requirements of the Act).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE04200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":123,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE04100"},{"type":"question","counter":124,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[51359\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000070#WRE04200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he or any official from his Department has held meetings or conducted correspondence with a company (details supplied) from 1 January 2017 to date; if his Department has engaged the services of the company for any purposes from 1 January 2017 to date; if so, the nature of such services and the costs incurred; if a tender process was conducted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":125,"content":"<p>I wish to advise\u00a0the Deputy that my Department has not engaged any services from the named company during the period specified.

Schools have a responsibility to provide for this, in consultation with parents, having regard to the ethos of the school.\u00a0 Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary junior cycle. Relationships and Sexuality Education (or RSE) is required at all levels, from primary through to senior cycle. The Department has set out the content for each of these programmes in SPHE syllabuses and guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  The current SPHE\/RSE curriculum at both primary and post primary facilities teaching and learning about consent. <\/p>  <p>  At primary level, the Stay Safe Programme has been introduced and is a mandatory part of the SPHE programme. The primary SPHE programme as a whole is also due to be updated by the NCCA as part of the work resulting from the NCCA&rsquo;s review of RSE provision in schools.<\/p>  <p>  At post primary level, two programmes are in place which come under the heading of Personal Safety. One of these programmes is for junior cycle which addresses personal safety in relationships and explores topics such as healthy and unhealthy relationships, consent and domestic gender-based and sexual violence. The other programme, which is for senior cycle, addresses topics such as domestic violence, sexual harassment, dating violence and rape. Both of these programmes were designed by the Professional Development Support Service (PDST) and are intended to be taught as part of the wider SPHE\/RSE curriculum. Professional development support is available to teachers, directly linked to these resources. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government states that &lsquo;this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) across primary and post-primary schools, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In April 2018, the then Minister for Education and Skills asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to undertake a major review of RSE in schools across all stages of education to ensure that it is fit for purpose and meets the needs of young people today in modern Ireland. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary schools was published by the NCCA on 11th of December, 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA was asked to look at a number of specific issues in respect of RSE and the curriculum. These included but were not limited to consent; developments in relation to contraception; healthy positive, sexual expression and relationships; safe use of the Internet and social media and its effects on relationships and self-esteem; and LGBTQ+ matters.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The immediate focus\u00a0of the work of the NCCA is\u00a0on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE\/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPHE\/RSE may be approached in a more holistic way. This work is progressing well and sections of the toolkit (a portal repository of teaching and learning resources linked to the Primary SPHE Curriculum, the SPHE JC Short Course and SC SPHE Framework) have now\u00a0been published.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The NCCA online SPHE toolkits will be expanded during 2021-2022 to include age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address issues of consent, gender and sexual discrimination and violence, and related topics within the SPHE classroom. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with the development of the online Toolkit, preparation for redeveloping and updating the SPHE curriculum has begun. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle. \u00a0It is expected that public consultation on the draft updated Junior Cycle SPHE specification will begin in early 2022.<\/p>  <p>  In redeveloping the SPHE curriculum, the NCCA will be making explicit the importance of consent education and naming consent within the learning outcomes for RSE, across all levels, based on the principle that consent is a core dimension of all healthy interpersonal relationships.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to developing updated curricula and support materials the NCCA will contribute to facilitating interagency collaboration and linkages between the formal and non-formal education sector to enhance the sharing of expertise, learning and resources related to RSE. The NCCA will also initiate networking between groups\/agencies working to support schools on targeted initiatives, such as consent and LGBTQI+ issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000072#WRG05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Admissions","counter":257,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000072#WRG05900"},{"type":"question","counter":258,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[51606\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000072#WRG06000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her engagements with the teaching unions and parents in relation to the shortage of school places in areas such as Dundalk, County Louth acknowledging the challenges this has on families at an already stressful time of year; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":259,"content":"<p>My Department\u00a0is aware of\u00a0increasing pressures and demand for school places in a number of school planning areas\u00a0including the school planning area to which the Deputy refers.<\/p><p>Where capacity issues arise it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:<\/p><p>- Duplication of  applications\u00a0&ndash; pupils have applied for a place\u00a0 to a number of schools in the area<\/p><p>- School of choice &ndash; pupils\u00a0can&rsquo;t get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town\/area<\/p><p>- Some towns\/areas have single\u00a0sex schools and while places are available in the school there are not\u00a0available to all pupils<\/p><p>- External draw &ndash; pupils\u00a0coming from outside the local area<\/p><p>The true extent of any capacity issue is the subject of my Department's ongoing engagement with the relevant school authorities.

A\u00a0victim of crime, a member of their family, or a third party person acting on their behalf can register with he Victim Liaison Office in the IPS in order to be kept informed of significant developments in the sentence management of a prisoner.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Victims registered with the Service are provided with information on when the offender will be released from prison and about any form of temporary release.

When completed, this work\u00a0will ensure victims have confidence that the criminal justice system will support them, keep them informed and treat them with respect and dignity at every stage of their journey through it.<\/p><p>The commitment of this Government to combatting domestic, sexual and gender based violence and to supporting victims is reflected in the funding allocated under Budget 2022, with a total of &euro;13m\u00a0allocated to my Department for this.\u00a0This represents an increased allocation of &euro;5.35m and will enable us to roll out specific awareness raising and training programmes to combat domestic, sexual and gender based violence. It will also allow us to provide additional supports to NGOs and specific domestic violence intervention programmes and it will support a number of front line activities. <\/p><p>As part of this, an additional &euro;1.1m will be used to put in place a legal advice and legal aid service in court for victims of sexual violence and &euro;1 million is being provided to the Garda vote to refurbish and upgrade the Divisional Protective Service Units. This will allow us to better support and protect vulnerable victims. <\/p><p>The additional funding secured under Budget 2022 will allow us to continue to build on the work undertaken this year. We will continue to improve the system for victims, to better support them and through various means to raise awareness of, and to combat, all forms of domestic, sexual and gender based violence. <\/p><p>Furthermore, I<b><\/b>understand that Minister O'Gorman has secured an increase of &euro;41m for Tusla under Budget 2022 which includes the budget for funding organisations that deliver frontline services, including the funding of refuge spaces. <\/p><p>Since 2014, this part of Tusla's budget\u00a0has almost doubled from &euro;17.5m to &euro;30m in 2021. While I understand Minister O'Gorman, in consultation with Tusla, is finalising\u00a0the detailed allocation of funding resources to various programmes\u00a0and service areas, I am assured that the budget\u00a0for 2022 will allow Tusla to maintain supports for DSGBV services, which have seen a significant increases in demand in the context of Covid-19, and to progress recommendations emerging from its review of refuge accommodation provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000076#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":444,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000076#WRL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":445,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[51667\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000076#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the date on which she and or her officials were first informed by the Garda Commissioner in view of a statutory obligations under section 41 of the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to inform her of such matters without delay of the cancellation and or downgrading of computer-aided despatch and 999 calls in the first instance and further matters disclosed by the Policing Authority on 14 October 2021.","asker":"1489","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":446,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, I consider any inappropriate cancellation of 999 calls a very serious matter.

The Scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.<\/p><p>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card.\u00a0In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.<\/p><p>In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses.<\/p><p>In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000077#WRM01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":508,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000077#WRM01700"},{"type":"question","counter":509,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[51444\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000077#WRM01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans for the roll out of Covid-19 booster vaccinations for residents of elderly care homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":510,"content":"<p>On 8 September, I announced an update to the Covid-19 vaccination programme following advice from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).<\/p><p>The NIAC has recommended a booster dose of an mRNA vaccine (irrespective of whether the primary vaccination course was of an mRNA or adenoviral vector) for residents aged 65 years and older living in Long Term Residential Care Facilities (LTRCFs) and for those aged 80 years and older living in the community.

CHI have advised that all patients with a diagnosis of scoliosis require a pre-operative work-up prior to spinal surgery, including multiple diagnostic investigations and review by a multi-disciplinary team. The plan of care which is implemented for each patient is tailored to best meet the patient's clinical requirements.

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. <\/p><p>In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p><p>In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school. <\/p><p>The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys.

To advance this, the Government is committed to establishing a new, statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services, which the Department of Health is currently developing.\u00a0It is intended that the new scheme will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality services based on a person&rsquo;s assessed care-needs.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Work is on-going within the Department to progress the development of the new scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms. This work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise\u00a0(i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (regulations); and HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. The Department recently commenced a targeted stakeholder consultation on these draft minimum requirements. In addition, HIQA recently ran a public scoping consultation to inform the development of their National Standards for Home Support Services.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In parallel to this, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for home support. Within this context, funding was secured in 2021 for the HSE to progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; the pilot of a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and the establishment of a National Office for Home Support Services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The testing of the reformed model of service delivery for home support is scheduled to commence in November 2021 in CHO 8\u00a0 (Longford \/ West Meath).\u00a0 Recruitment issues associated with backfilling of posts has impacted on release of interRAI Care Coordinators in CHO 2 (Galway), 4 (South Lee) and 7 (Dublin West). This has necessitated phased introduction of pilot sites however it is expected that all will be fully operational by January 2022. A comprehensive and robust operational model for the roll-out of the interRAI has been developed which will facilitate effective, efficient, fair and transparent care needs assessment and planning and appropriate service delivery. The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to inform legislative and funding decisions in relation to the statutory home support scheme.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  130 posts have been funded for the national rollout of the interRAI Ireland system as the standard assessment tool for care-needs and recruitment for these posts is scheduled to commence in this quarter. In addition, a National Home Support Office will be established before the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021&ndash;2023\u00a0commits to the advancement of the development of the new home-support scheme in 2021 and to the commencement of its implementation in 2022. While the new home-support scheme is under development, the Government is prioritising improving access to home-support services. As part of Budget 2021, funding for an additional 5 million hours of home-support was provided. This additional allocation will be maintained in 2022. This increased investment will contribute to meeting the\u00a0Programme for Government\u00a0commitment to providing equitable access to home-support services.\u00a0\u00a0Data which has been provided since the cyber-attack is provisional and subject to change.\u00a0\u00a0At the end of August 2021, the preliminary data indicates that about 13.2 million home support hours had been provided to 53,905 people.

accordingly, funding for free contraception, starting with women aged 17-25, has been allocated in 2022. <\/p><p>The scheme will provide for:<\/p><p>- The cost of prescription contraception <\/p><p>- The cost of fitting and\/or removal of various types of long-acting reversible contraception and administration of contraceptive injections plus any necessary checks, by medical professionals certified to fit\/remove same;<\/p><p>- The cost of training and certifying additional medical professionals to fit and remove long-acting reversible contraception;<\/p><p>- The cost of a maximum of two consultations per annum with GPs and other doctors to discuss forms of contraception suitable for individual patients and to enable prescription of same.<\/p><p>- Training and certification of additional GPs to fit long-acting reversible contraception <\/p><p>It is envisaged that a wide range of contraceptive options, currently available to medical card holders, will be made available through this scheme. This includes contraceptive injections, implants, various types of intrauterine system (IUS) or device (IUD; commonly known as the coil), the contraceptive patch and ring, and various forms of oral contraceptive pill.<\/p><p>As noted by the Report of the Working Group on Contraception, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, the justifications for the phased and incremental introduction of free contraception are based on the differential barriers faced in accessing the most effective forms of contraception by different age cohorts, and likely supply-side constraints.<\/p><p>The initiative is gradually being introduced by age cohort, starting with younger women who are least likely to be financially independent and where cost has been shown to be a greater barrier to accessing the most effective forms of contraception, long acting, reversible contraception, or LARCs.<\/p><p>The Report advises that an issue highlighted by both the research review, and by many stakeholders, is a possible lack of capacity to deliver some forms of contraception. Many forms of LARC require specialised certification and training in terms of fitting and removal. The costs of prescription contraception medications and\/or medical devices are currently covered under the GMS scheme, for those holding a medical card, while clinical costs are covered under both the medical and GP visit cards.<\/p><p>However, for private patients, the up-front costs of various LARCs were estimated by the Report at &euro;250 - &euro;350 in 2018-2019; with the majority of stakeholders reporting this as a barrier to access, particularly for younger women. The removal of cost barriers is almost certainly going to increase demand for these services.<\/p><p>In developing the scheme, this has been taken into account and funding has been provided in Budget 2022 for training and certification of additional GPs to fit LARCs,. However, this upskilling is likely to take time, hence the adoption of a phased approach to implementation, as outlined in the Programme for Government.<\/p><p>Providing free contraception to the age cohort of 17-24 year old women was one of the recommended options in the Report.

Food Vision provides a framework within which more detailed plans and processes on the wide range of issues facing the sector will be progressed and developed, overseen by an implementation committee. Some 200 actions under 22 goals are proposed, guided by four high-level missions:<\/p><p>1. A Climate Smart, Environmentally Sustainable Agri-Food Sector<\/p><p>2. Viable and Resilient Primary Producers with Enhanced Well-Being<\/p><p>3. Food that is safe, nutritious and appealing: trusted and valued at home and abroad<\/p><p>4. An Innovative, Competitive and Resilient Agri-Food Sector, driven by Technology and Talent. <\/p><p>Food Vision states that the tillage and horticulture sectors are the most carbon efficient sectors of Irish agriculture and it is important that the area under cultivation in these sectors is at least retained, with an ambition to increase both. <\/p><p>Although there is no specific target to increase tillage production, Food Vision 2030 acknowledges the importance of the tillage sector as it provides high quality grain to the animal feed industry, and straw for feeding and bedding, while also making a significant contribution to the food and drinks sectors in the form of malting barley, milling wheat and oats for the breakfast cereals industry. <\/p><p>Action 27 in Mission 2 (Viable and Resilient Primary Producers with Enhanced Well-Being) states that Stakeholders will work to develop the sector to take advantage of potential growth in: 1) high value output (malting barley, wheat, oats and rye) to distilling and brewing; 2) high value food markets such as oats (particularly organic oats), oils and salad &amp;amp; chipping potatoes; 3) meeting domestic protein crop demand for livestock diets. <\/p><p>The Department and I will continue to work with the sector and to provide supports as appropriate. The success of Food Vision 2030 will depend on effective implementation and oversight. For this reason, a Monitoring and Implementation Framework is included in the Strategy. This highlights areas for collaboration and partnership within the sector but also with key external stakeholders. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000082#WRR00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Industry","counter":788,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000082#WRR00800"},{"type":"question","counter":789,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[51627\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000082#WRR00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of the Programme for Government commitment to review the role, structures, and strategic focus of State agencies in the food sector and to ensure that their programme of work is fully aligned with future Government and emerging EU policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1510","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":790,"content":"<p>I work closely with the State Agencies under the Department's remit on an ongoing basis, and there is continuous collaboration across the wide range of our shared responsibilities.  <\/p><p>As well as this ongoing liaison, the implementation process for our agri-food strategies provides a more formal opportunity for coordination of our work. <\/p><p>For some twenty years, the Irish agri-food sector has benefited from having a coherent, stakeholder-led vision and strategy to underpin the sector&rsquo;s continued development.
