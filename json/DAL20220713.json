Legislative amendments to the Planning and Development Act are, therefore, being brought forward to address this issue.<\/p> <p> Since the April 2019 commencement of the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, a number of technical matters have come to light regarding the legislative procedures for progressing ministerial directions on statutory plans.  Minor technical amendments to the Planning and Development Act are required to address cross-referencing, standardised wording, notifications and consistency in procedure, to benefit all stakeholders including local authorities and the wider public.<\/p> <p> Amendments relating to flexibility in planning applications will address a recent High Court judgment concerning the design envelope approach in planning applications that require a degree of flexibility as the final details of the development may be unconfirmed at the planning application stage.  The amendments will introduce a pre-application procedure to facilitate a subsequent planning application being made, incorporating flexibility in respect of certain specified details of the proposed development, while providing sufficient clarity to allow planning authorities to consider what level of information is appropriate on a case-by-case basis, while also providing appropriate safeguards for environmental assessment.<\/p> <p> The amendments to judicial review provisions in the Planning and Development Act will require the courts to consider whether there is an adequate appeal or other available administrative remedy and if so, it should not grant leave for judicial review.

That is not only a breach of proper procedure, but it is also treating this House and its Members with appalling disrespect.  More important, it shows disrespect to the public, many of whom will be directly impacted by the negative and possibly unintended consequences of some of these amendments significantly.<\/p>  <p>  The Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill is already controversial legislation.  We should have had two and a half hours to deal with detailed Opposition amendments to that before concluding that Bill.  Late last Thursday, we received 48 pages of amendments to an 18-page Bill.  Those amendments cover six other legislative areas that have nothing to do with Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill relating to substitute consent.<\/p>  <p>  One of the areas of potential amendment the Minister of State mentioned, which is the sanctions on platforms advertising non-compliant short-term lets, is a welcome move.  I introduced a Bill to give effect to such a proposal, which was passed a few weeks ago.  However, because we cannot scrutinise it, we do not know if something that is good in principle will be good in practice.  For instance, the former Minister, Eoghan Murphy's, short-term letting regulations, which were also good in principle, turned out to be bad in practice.  We do not have adequate time to scrutinise that.  Other amendments relating to the Valuations Acts and the Office of the Planning Regulator are not controversial.  The real problem the Minister of State will hear from all Opposition Members shortly relates to those amendments to judicial review and to design envelope flexibility for planning authorities particularly with respect to the Maritime Area Planning Act.<\/p>  <p>  When technical and complex changes to planning law are introduced, the potential for negative impacts, unintended consequences or creating further confusion and uncertainty for applicants, third parties and the legal process is enormous.  We have seen that year after year when similar last-minute changes have been introduced.  That lack of scrutiny is real problem because we take our job as legislators seriously.  Even when we are broadly supportive of something the Government is doing, we want to ensure that whatever we are asked to put our names to is fit for purpose and does what it says on the tin.  We will simply not be able to do that in two and a half hours and deal with significant issues relating to substitute consent.<\/p>  <p>  How many times have we seen profound changes to planning law have negative and unintended consequences?  The strategic housing development legislation is a case in point.  We were told the mandatory ministerial guidelines on building height and design standards for apartments were efficiency measures to streamline the planning process, but all they did was undermine public confidence in that process and lead to lengthy and complicated litigation that has been costly for the taxpayer as a result of dramatic increases in judicial review losses by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p>  <p>  Some of these changes also move the goalposts where applicants or third parties are engaging in the judicial review process.  Judges are now being mandated to make decisions that will have a significant impact of people's access to justice in line with European law and particularly with the Aarhus Convention.  I have said this previously.  We will be back here in a year or two and we will be saying we told the Government so, pointing out that it has not improved the process but in fact made it worse.<\/p>  <p>  Some of these amendments are not even necessary.  The idea of non-consequential amendments, as I understand it, is either to deal with small minor technical drafting things - we have a few of those and that is okay - or matters of great urgency.  One could argue that the short-term letting regulations are a case in point.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State and departmental officials for providing us with a briefing on Monday.  At that meeting I asked how many cases the proposed changes to judicial review proceedings will affect.  We were told it was a very small number and they listed some of the types of cases that arose.  I asked if there was any urgency in introducing these changes now particularly given that we will have substantial legislation reforming the Planning and Development Act and the judicial review proceedings later in the year.  I was told there was not any urgency.  I asked why they are being introduced now and the answer was the Attorney General said they could be.   Lots of things could be but should they be?  Absolutely not.  The last time I checked the Constitution, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage was responsible for policy, not the Attorney General.  The Attorney General provides legal advice, but the Government decides when to move forward.<\/p>  <p>  This is, therefore, not about streamlining, improving or assisting much-needed offshore wind farm or good quality residential development.  These changes will make things more complex, more problematic, more difficult for the public to engage with and more expensive for everybody.  On that basis, I urge the Government to withdraw amendments Nos. 25 and 26 with respect to judicial review changes; amendments Nos. 12, 13 and 40 to 42, inclusive, with respect to the design envelope and planning authorities; and amendment No. 77 with respect to the design envelope and the Maritime Area Planning Act.<\/p>  <p>  The design envelope is a good case in point.  I am open to being convinced of the merits of that.  If it is designed in the right way, it could be useful.  However, the Minister of State has given us no time to consider whether this has been done in the appropriate manner and consistent with good planning practice in line with Irish, EU or international legal obligations.  On that basis, I oppose the motion and urge the Government to withdraw those amendments.  Let us get on with important business we have of the substitute consents legislation later today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300004#B00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1657699800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>The Labour Party will oppose this motion.  In recent weeks, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has driven a coach and horses through the long-established process for bringing legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  He rammed through the mica redress Bill, and every Stage of the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 has brought complex and substantial amendments outside the original scope of that legislation.<\/p> <p>Later today, 72 Government amendments made in the Seanad to the Electoral Reform Bill will be dealt with in 45 minutes of debate before going to the President for signature.  It is an appalling way to make law that will determine the future of our democracy.  Now the Minister is introducing, at a very late stage, six sets of complex amendments to the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill that run to 48 pages.  The original Bill was only 18 pages long and dealt with some technical issues.  He will triple the length of the Bill with his new proposals.<br\/><br\/>One of the sets relates to short-term lettings.  While potentially welcome, the Labour Party has warned for years of the need for stronger regulation of so-called Airbnbs.  As far back as 2017, my former colleague, Mr. Kevin Humphreys, introduced a Bill to provide for a register of properties, with fines for those who do not comply.  It is good to see the Government finally catching up now, five years later, but it should not be rushed through like this.  There has been no scrutiny of the proposals at committee and no engagement with stakeholders or teasing out of how these new laws will work in practice.  Many of the proposals being legislated for also relate to the Minister cleaning up mistakes previously made by proposals passed by this Government and its predecessor.  Some of these are technical in nature and relate to ministerial directions and the OPR, flexibility in planning applications, maritime area planning and the Valuation Acts.  What is not clear is why these could not have been progressed in the Seanad or introduced when the Bill was originally published.<br\/><br\/>The most controversial set of amendments relates to judicial review.  It was the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage under Fine Gael, and supported by Fianna F&aacute;il, that created the crisis in An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the avalanche of judicial reviews when it introduced the strategic housing developments legislation, bypassing the normal two-stage planning process.  We warned at the time that this would result in a significant increase in court activity, and that has been borne out.  There was no compelling reason to bypass local authority planning, as it has done nothing to speed up the planning process, and An Bord Plean&aacute;la was clearly not equipped to deal with the massive increase in large and complex housing developments that require local planning expertise.  However, now, without any pre-legislative scrutiny or Second Stage debate, the Government is planning to limit the ability of people to take judicial reviews and even when the courts find mistakes made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it will allow it to fix its own homework to pretend it never happened.<br\/><br\/>Planning law solicitor, Mr. Fred Logue, has helped to highlight the problems with the Minister's approach.  It effectively moves the goalposts for anyone who legally challenges a planning decision.  He said in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>yesterday: &quot;Under European law, the system has to be fair, equitable and not prohibitively expensive.&quot;  I wonder where the St. Anne's campaign would be now if this legislation had been in place before the campaign began.  With the sudden resignation of the deputy chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la at the weekend, it is crucial that the Minister now fast-tracks the publication of the report by senior counsel, Mr. Remy Farrell, in full.  It is essential that people have full confidence in the planning process and if the report reveals more systematic and seismic issues in An Bord Plean&aacute;la, they must be addressed.  Transparency and fairness are the bedrock of any democracy, and trust in the planning system is vital.<br\/><br\/>The amendments being forced through raise serious questions about the crisis at the heart of our planning system.  These changes raise serious questions of European law and constitutional concerns about the restriction of access to the courts.  That is why we oppose the motion.  If the Minister wants to understand why there are so many successful judicial reviews of planning decisions, it is because a dysfunctional Department and a willing Minister keep bringing forward last-minute legislation.  The actions of the Minister also raise serious constitutional questions about the level of scrutiny afforded to our legislation.  He has a proven track record now of bypassing the processes and Standing Orders of the House to get his plans put into law.  Rushed law is bad law, and the Labour Party opposes this motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300004#B00300","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657700400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>First, there are media reports this morning that one of the amendments is being withdrawn.

I would have thought that the courtesy that should have been given to the D&aacute;il is that we should have been told that in the opening statement rather than relying on media reports.  That is just the latest in how this has been very poorly handled by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  I oppose and object to the approach by the Government in the strongest possible terms.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, we were told at the briefing on Monday, which took place after the deadline for submitting any amendments to the Government's amendments, that these amendments relating to judicial reviews only relate to a small number of cases and there is no urgency with them.  Why, therefore, are they being rushed through in this manner?  Why is no time being given for scrutiny?  In fact, detailed scrutiny is needed because these are complex, detailed matters regarding planning and judicial reviews.  Why is the Government and the Minister avoiding scrutiny of this?  That is what we need to hear from them.<\/p>  <p>  A deeply cynical approach is being taken.  The original Bill is problematic in respect of the issues relating to substitute consent.  The housing committee was asked to do its pre-legislative scrutiny of that as quickly as possible last September.  It was concluded a long time ago and then the Bill appears to have just sat with the Government and appears to have been deliberately timed to come to the House right at the end of the legislative process.  If that is not the case, why have we not heard any explanation from the Government?  Then in a highly cynical move we get these 48 pages of amendments that are not consequential to the Bill.  We heard from the Department during the briefing that many of them are not of an emergency nature and relate to a small number of court cases.  It is welcome that amendment No. 25 has been withdrawn, but I call for amendment No. 26, which also relates to judicial review, to be withdrawn too.  If the Government has seen sense and seen fit to withdraw amendment No. 25, it should do the same with amendment No. 26, which relates to similar issues in respect of judicial review, and just give the democratic process, the Oireachtas and the people of Ireland the courtesy of having it scrutinised and debated.  If the Government is going to make profound changes in planning law, it should at least allow them to be scrutinised.  Why not do that?<\/p>  <p>  I also call for amendments Nos. 12, 13, 40 to 42, inclusive, and 77, which relate to the design envelope, to be withdrawn, again to allow time on that.  There could well be merit in some of the proposals, but let us try to get them done right by having them scrutinised.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the changes in planning and judicial reviews, this is being done in the context of multiple allegations being made with respect to An Bord Plean&aacute;la that are currently under investigation and the reports on which have not been published.  At the very time a key allegation is being made that there has been a concentration of power by a small number of individuals, that files were not randomly allocated and that a significant number of planning decisions in An Bord Plean&aacute;la were made by a tiny number of individuals with no explanation as to why they were allocated the files and why the files were not randomly allocated, the one safeguard people had in that respect over the past number of years had been their ability to try to hold An Bord Plean&aacute;la to account through the courts process.  That has been a limited safeguard, incidentally.  Most people and communities simply have not had the resources to exercise that.  Some have, and in the cases where people have been able to do that, most of the cases were either conceded by An Bord Plean&aacute;la or won.  It is in that context, with all those questions hanging over the board, that the Government is proceeding with amendment No. 26, even though amendment No. 25 has been withdrawn, and with other amendments that will curtail the ability of people to hold An Bord Plean&aacute;la to account.  That is quite shocking.<\/p>  <p>  All the wording about this in terms of flexibility, streamlining and so forth makes it sound as if these amendments are of no consequence when, in fact, they are profound.  If the Government is going to make profound changes to planning law, it should do the people of Ireland the courtesy of not trying to brush them off as being merely streamlining or merely about flexibility.  Do not treat people as if they do not understand what is actually afoot here.<\/p> <p>People are well able to understand, when language is being abused and misused to try to brush off profound changes, that is not what is at stake here; there is much more at stake.  I urge the Government to stop treating the people of Ireland with contempt and allow those who are elected to represent them to engage in proper scrutiny and detailed analysis of any changes to the planning law it is trying to bring forward that will have profound effects in this country.<\/p> <p> This is no way to enact legislation.  The President of Ireland has commented on it.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has analysed it and shown the vast bulk of legislation brought forward by this Government was brought forward in the last couple of weeks of December and the end of June and into July.  Members of the Government and others in this House are quick to criticise poor process in other democratic countries, and countries where democratic norms have been eroded, but this is an erosion of the democratic process.  Measures that seek to undermine judicial discretion in respect of court cases is also an erosion of judicial independence.  If the Government wants to bring forward any amendments, it should withdraw everything that is now on the table, bring them back at a later stage to allow for scrutiny and await publication of the reports into An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the planning review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300005#C00600","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657701000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>This is incredibly sharp practice on the part of the Government.  It makes a mockery of any sort of proper oversight of legislation.  We had a briefing on Monday from officials on these 48 pages of amendments.  These are substantial amendments in the areas of planning that will affect the rights of people to access justice through judicial reviews and will affect what is, broadly, a good objective as regards short-term lettings but, as others have said, the objective and the actual translation into legislation may not be the same thing.  Everything of that sort needs to be scrutinised properly.  I had to ask for an explanatory memorandum at that briefing.  As with all legislation, we get an explanatory memorandum to try to translate what is often and, in this case, is, quite dense legislative language into relatively plain English so we can understand what we are looking at and voting on.  I received this explanatory memorandum on these 48 pages of last-minute amendments from the Government to a Bill that is being guillotined so in reality we will not have time to look at and scrutinise it properly at 8:58 a.m., two minutes before the debate started.  That is just an absolute joke.  It is the Government laughing at the Opposition, and showing utter contempt for the legislative process, democracy and the public.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments the Government is bringing forward are far outside the scope of the original Bill we started to deal with on Second Stage.  If we tabled amendments that were anything even remotely similar in being outside the scope of a Bill, we would just be laughed out of court.  They would be ruled out of order and would not be allowed.  The Government, however, can do it by putting forward this motion, ramming it through and then guillotining the debate on the Bill later so we do not have proper time to scrutinise the amendments.<\/p>  <p>  The substantial amendments that are of particular concern relate to planning matters and the question of judicial reviews.  These are important issues.  I wonder about the timing of the amendments.  I suspect they result from lobbying by the private offshore wind industry.  That is what I think.  It has lobbied the Government to do this and that is why it is being done.  It is so that industry can get flexibility in planning applications for offshore industrial wind turbines.  In essence, the amendments amount to, from the perspective of planning and the public, buying a pig in a poke because they will give the industry the flexibility to apply for one development, but for the development it actually develops to be a different development.  That is what the flexibility amounts to.  The height and design of the wind turbines can change.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will say there are safeguards and the industry has to show the different options and so on and so forth.  All of that should be subject to serious scrutiny but in actuality we are dealing with a serious matter, namely, the ability of private developers because that is what we are talking about here - probably most particularly on these legacy projects or relevant projects as they are described - to be able to put in a planning application for offshore industrial wind turbines, where the public has to respond to a particular type of planning application.  However, what is actually developed later may be something completely different and the ability of people to take judicial reviews against developments that are being applied for, which may affect them or the environment and so on, will then be limited.  That is unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure the Government does not give a hoot that we think it is unacceptable.  There is laughing.  That is what it does at this time of year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300006#D00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1657701000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I was not laughing.

At last week's Business Committee meeting, we allowed an extra hour for discussion and debate on the Bill but that was before these amendments came in.  There is a case to be answered regarding why this is being done in such a ham-fisted way.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the amendments to the Valuation Acts and to short-term lettings.  I also agree we need to do something about judicial reviews and having more inclusive and co-operative planning processes so we can do things quicker.<\/p> <p>If we push through legislation in this manner, it will be like manna from heaven to the people who want to object and employ lawyers to bring this legislation through the courts.  The fact that it has not been sufficiently scrutinised and is being put through the House in such a ham-fisted manner is a concern.<\/p> <p> On planning and the examples of planning at a local level, Galway County Council has not had any pre-planning meetings for the last two years because the planning department does not have the resources to deal with pre-planning meetings.  The reason is that the council has been starved of funding for a number of years.  Council staff are now dealing with up to 90 applications per day.  It is absolute mayhem.  The planning department has a statutory process to go through and timelines to meet.  The risk of making a wrong decision is there all the time when planners are working under pressure like that.<\/p> <p> To be fair, we must start off by asking how we get our planning system right.  We must ensure the local authorities have the resources required to deal with the planning applications.  For example, Galway County Council does not employ an architect or ecologist.  It is processing planning applications in a very seat-of-the-pants manner.  Some applications are simple enough while others are highly complicated, with the result that there is a huge amount of confusion within Galway County Council as to how planning will be delivered.  The very simple and basic pre-planning meeting is a must.  We need to have such meetings.  The only way to ensure we have them is for the Government to provide the funding for local authorities, such as Galway County Council, to enable them to employ the cohort of staff they need.  That is very important.  <\/p> <p> We have to do something about objections and the issue of people appealing planning decisions to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I will provide an example.  The HSE was building a new community nursing unit in Tuam to replace the existing &Aacute;ras Mhuire community nursing unit.  The building was no longer deemed fit to house patients or long-term residents.  Galway County Council granted planning permission for the development.  An objection was subsequently submitted by an individual living in the midlands, whose ground for objection was the idea that the nursing unit should not be based in Tuam, but in Galway city.  The objection was submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, delaying the whole project for over seven months.  Thankfully, An Bord Plean&aacute;la upheld the decision of Galway County Council and the project is now proceeding.  Hopefully, it will be completed by the middle of next year.  We must stamp out the practice of permitting vexatious objections.<\/p> <p> There is also a problem with serial objectors who object to anything and everything.  I do not know from where or how they are being funded, but they are creating mayhem in the planning system and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I do not know what is behind it.  I can see it in different aspects of projects that are being planned.  Objections are being put in and we expect them to be put in.  An appeal has to be based on merit or there must be something about the process or development, in particular, that the objector feels is not right.  Objections cannot just be vexatious.  It is too simple, currently, to put in an objection to a planning application on the basis that the objector does not like or is jealous of the developer or does not want to see a particular development in his or her neighbourhood.  It it important we get this right.  <\/p> <p> On the flexibility of our planning system, one of the biggest areas affected by the lack of flexibility is housing.  There are so many processes in our planning system that it is delaying the delivery of social housing.  I am sure it is a frustration for the Department that houses cannot be built quicker.  I spoke about the issue yesterday.  It is important we build social housing as a matter of urgency.  We should be able to fast-track the planning of social housing so that units can be delivered quicker.  We cannot be looking for an opportunity to object to developments and shout about and ask for social housing to be built at the same time.  We need to build social housing units.  We must deliver them rather than just talking about doing so.<\/p> <p> On flexibility within the planning system, I believe that if there is engagement within the planning system between the applicant and the planning authority, we will get better, more efficient planning and fewer objections because it will be done right.  There has to be greater flexibility in that.  There must be joined-up thinking regarding the objectives of a planning application when it is submitted.  We must consider whether the planning, in principle, is good.  If it is good, we must ensure that planning permission is granted in a way that meets the legal requirements.<\/p> <p> There are many issues to consider here.  As I said, I am concerned at the manner in which this legislation is being rammed through.  I am concerned that Deputies have learned, through the media, that an amendment has been withdrawn, rather than being told about it by the Minister of State in his opening remarks in the D&aacute;il.  Perhaps the Minister of State was not aware that the amendment had been withdrawn.  However, it is important that we are clear with one another as to what is going on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300006#D00800","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657701600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I highlight how disappointed, shocked and upset I am at the manner in which the guillotine procedure is being used today.  There is a lack of confidence in the whole planning system and the process around the granting of planning permission that is compounded by a number of factors.  On top of everything else, the manner in which this legislation is being passed is going to further erode people's confidence in the system.  If the Government seriously believes it is right and proper for us to come in here and to have less than one hour to debate, scrutinise and go through 48 pages of amendments, it is totally wrong.  It is completely unfair.  This is politics at its worst.  The job of legislators is to go through legislation and amendments properly.  I have no problem in the world with Members or the Government bringing forward pages and pages of amendments.  However, we must be given the opportunity to go through them.  The Government is not doing that.<\/p>  <p>  There is a significant lack of confidence in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Even though I would be entitled to do so, I will not go into the details of what I would refer to as the shenanigans of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  However, I wish to make this point on record.  An inspector from An Bord Plean&aacute;la can go out and inspect a project, produce a report and put it before the members of the board.  People might think that meetings of the board are well organised, convened and structured.  They are no such thing.  The meetings involve a few people turning up willy-nilly if they are on time.  Meetings can take place at 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock in the evening.  Members can be in whatever state they wish to be in because there is nobody there to scrutinise or oversee what they are doing.  An inspector can lay a proper report before the board.  If there are three people attending the meeting, including two board members and the inspector, the two board members can reject the inspector's report and overturn the findings of it.  These board members may have never been in the county, town or village of the planned development that is up for discussion.  The members may not have read the inspector's report.  However, if they do not like the individual developer or something about them, they can overturn the decision of the inspector.  How can that be right and proper?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300007#E00200","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1657701600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I am a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, along with other colleagues who are present.

I am involved in a lot of planning in County Limerick.  The granting of planning permissions in the county is being held up by serial objectors.  There is also a lack of clarity in the process.<\/p> <p>Businesses that have put structures on their premises during the pandemic still have not get clarification as to whether they are exempt even though special circumstances pertained.  SMEs and other companies that put up solar panels to bring down their electricity costs still do not have clarity on the size of array they may have.  On the lack of infrastructure, local development plans now specify that there will only be development in areas where there is infrastructure.  That wipes out two thirds of County Limerick because the infrastructure in the county is at its maximum capacity.  Under the new housing regime, the Land Development Agency is only going to build in Limerick city and in towns and villages that are within 15 minutes of it because of transport issues.  This again takes out two thirds of Limerick.  There has been a massive surge of planning permissions in County Limerick but no houses are being built because of cost inflation and the lack of builders.  Planning permission should be granted to any person who wants to return to their home locality whether on a site they own or within their home town or village.  It is the responsibility of the Government to ensure the infrastructure is in place to allow people to return home.

The Government really does not care about democracy.  It will railroad these changes through anyway.  Some of these amendments have been around since last summer so there was plenty of time to move a Bill but I do not think the Government wants people to see what it is at.  That is why these amendments are being pushed now.  It is because there will be no scrutiny of them as there physically is not time.  The Government will push them through, which shows a shocking disregard for this House, the democratic process and the citizens of this country.<\/p><p>To add insult to injury, the Minister of State arrived in the Chamber without copies of his speech.  We have to wait for these to be delivered.  We then find out from Deputy Cian O'Callaghan that amendment No. 25 has been withdrawn.  I would say the Minister of State knew that because he answered very quickly that it was withdrawn but he was not going to tell the House before this debate.  We were having a debate on these amendments but the Minister of State was not going to tell the House that one of them was not going to be put forward.  That says a lot about the process and about the Minister of State and his Government's view of it.  What is really shocking with regard to this legislation is the way the Minister of State views the whole thing.<\/p><p>Obviously, it is about hiding things.  One of the amendments relates to judicial review.  I am looking at some of the statistics.  In 2020, An Bord Plean&aacute;la decided 2,600 cases, of which 83 or 3% of the total number of applications went to review.  The Government's proposals will benefit that 3%.  It would be very interesting to look at who makes up that 3%.  I am sure it includes big-money developers.  That is who the Minister of State's Department and Government represent.  They are the only people who benefit from this.  Some Members spoke about the number of cases that go to judicial review.  I am no legal expert but, as far as I know, the courts determine whether legal processes were followed before they allow a judicial review to be taken as these reviews are taken on legal matters.  The court therefore recognises that there is a <i>prima facie<\/i>case that the legal processes and the law were not properly followed.  If An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the planning authorities actually followed the law and did what it says, there would not be judicial reviews because they would not be allowed to be taken in the first place.  People could apply for them but they would not be allowed to be taken because the law was followed.  That would say a lot more.  <\/p><p>If the Minister of State wants to make the planning process work properly for people, he should push a system whereby developers are required to obtain consent.  There are three parties in the planning process, namely, the developer, the planning authority and the community that has to host the development.  If they were all treated equally and with respect, an awful lot more planning applications would go through the process with the consent of the people.  That would do an awful lot to streamline the planning process under the Acts.  However, it is not in the Minister of State or the Government to do that because they represent private developers and money.  That is what they are all about.  Unfortunately, that is also what all of this is about.  These amendments will be rushed through today and this Bill will be law tomorrow without any scrutiny.

The Title of the Bill should make clear what we are trying to achieve here.  For the vast majority of people who are impacted by the current housing crisis, the need for a Bill that will reduce the extortionate, frankly obscene and completely unaffordable rent levels is more than patently obvious, and this Bill attempts to do that.  It seeks to bring rents back to levels that will be affordable for ordinary working people because they have reached an utterly unaffordable level.  The consequences of that are utterly disastrous for some, with record numbers of families, individuals and children forced into homelessness, overwhelmingly because they simply cannot find anywhere that is affordable within the housing assistance payment, HAP, limits if they are eligible for the HAP, and of course, huge numbers of people who desperately need help meeting the extortionate rents they are being charged are not even eligible.  Because they have crept a few euro over the income eligibility threshold, they are not entitled to any support and are expected to pay rents that are off the Richter scale in terms of affordability for the vast majority.  I refer not just to low-earning workers but even to people who earn pretty decent wages and salaries.<\/p>  <p>  That is what the Bill is trying to do.  It is a matter of absolute urgency that something of this sort be done, and I will now set out the manner in which we will do it.  We propose that a national rent authority be set up and that this authority ensure that landlords cannot charge more in rent than 25% of the median household income, whether the national or local median household income, whichever is the lower, given we do not want people in low-income areas to be charged rents based on incomes in high-income areas.  The broad principle is that people will not spend more than 25% of their income on putting a roof over their head.  We propose that any newly constructed house or apartment, once the Bill has passed, that is going to rented out will immediately be subject to this rent control and the landlord will not be able to charge more than the median household income, as set by the national rent authority.  For rental property that already exists and that, almost invariably, costs considerably more than that, the landlord will have one year to bring the rent back to that level, after which all rental property will be subject to that rent control.  We make an exemption for luxury properties because, frankly, we do not want to control the rents that are paid by the super-rich, where they might rent luxury penthouses.  We have no particular interest in protecting them against those rents or ensuring they will pay rents that would be far lower than their income would allow.  We are interested in protecting rents for ordinary people.<\/p>  <p>  The need for this is self-evident.  Average national rents are now in excess of &euro;1,500 a month.  That means a person needs to earn about &euro;17,000 a year just to pay rent, which is about 45% of the median income.  They are the national rents; the picture gets far worse when we look at Dublin, where the average rent is now &euro;2,000, or &euro;24,000 in after-tax income required just to pay rent.  More than 50% of the national median household income is what is being asked for.  It gets even worse in my area, where in the past six months average rents were &euro;2,600.  That is absolutely obscene.  This is totally unsustainable and we can see the consequences, with the homelessness figures rising week on week.  Of course, the main feature of the surge in homelessness we are seeing at the moment, in almost all the cases I am dealing with, is that it is people who are working who are being made homeless.  They are often two working people in one household and still they cannot afford the rents out there.<\/p>  <p>  In many cases, such people are not eligible for social housing support because the Government and previous Governments, for ten years, have refused to raise the income eligibility thresholds in what is clearly a deliberate strategy to make it look as though fewer people are in need of social housing support when, in fact, it is self-evident that more people than ever before need social housing support.  The proportion of households that are entitled to social housing support, as the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, recently documented, has dropped dramatically.  Whereas 47% of households ten years ago were eligible for social housing support, that figure had fallen to 33% by 2019, and while we do not have figures for what it is now, it is clearly well south of that.  The number of people who are getting help is lower than ever before and is being reduced constantly in a stealth cut, whereas the need for that support is greater than ever and we are facing a dire situation for huge numbers of families.<\/p>  <p>  It is equally evident that this is a uniquely disastrous failure of the Government in this country.  ICTU, in its recent publication on the social wage, showed that accommodation costs in this country are 78% higher than the EU average.<\/p> <p>While rents have gone up by about 13% across Europe over the last decade, here they have gone up by over 70%.  In my area, they have gone up by over 100%.  This is a unique failure of Irish Governments, way beyond the failure of governments in other countries.  <\/p> <p> When we raised this issue yesterday with the Taoiseach, he said the legislation would not fly, was \"illiterate\" and could not be done.  Strangely enough, they do it elsewhere in Europe.  Is it not very odd that they have succeeded elsewhere in preventing this kind of dire housing crisis and these extortionate, obscene increases in rent levels?  It is not that rents have not gone up in Europe, but they have not gone up to anything like the levels they have reached here.  That is because other countries have rent controls.  In France, they have recently introduced further rent controls whereby if they see rent reaching levels beyond what is affordable for ordinary people, they cap them with maximum rents.  In the Netherlands, where rents are too high there is a legal power to reclassify housing as social housing and charge social housing rents.  Germany has a rent control regime in place whereby if rents in particular areas are way out of sync with other parts of the country, they can be controlled, capped and brought back down to reasonable levels.  The United States has multiple forms of rent controls.  The idea this cannot be done is not true.  Are we open to amendments that would tweak how we do this?  Of course we are, but we want to establish the urgent need and viability of introducing a regime that ensures people can afford the rents being charged.  It is done elsewhere and can be done here.<\/p> <p> The reason the Government does not want to do it is the same reason we have a housing crisis in the first place.  It is because its housing and rental policy is being dictated by propertied interests, including developers, speculators and investors, rather than by the needs of our people for secure, affordable rental accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300009#G00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657703400,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Yesterday, when questioned about this at Leaders' Questions , the Taoiseach said if we passed this Bill to reduce rents for ordinary people, there would be no landlords left in Ireland.  Across the country, thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of people who are struggling to pay &euro;2,000 or &euro;2,500 of rent per month and others who live at home well into their late 20s or 30s because they cannot afford to rent are thinking &quot;Taoiseach, don't threaten us with a good time&quot;.  The Taoiseach's comment encapsulated in one sentence the ideology and approach of the Government to housing, which is that the only conceivable way to provide homes for people is not to consider housing as a basic right but as a commodity that must be provided for profit in the market.  That is the essence of the Government's approach to housing.  We have to incentivise developers to build homes for profit by shovelling public money at them and we have to incentivise landlords to provide the service they provide by not saying rents should be linked to what people can afford to pay but that landlords are free to charge whatever the market says they can get away with.  That is the essence of the Government's approach.<\/p><p>It begs the question of what service landlords provide.  What wealth do landlords produce in this economy?  What added benefit is created by having a class of landlords?  Nothing.  That is the truth.  There is no benefit in having this layer of corporate landlords in our society.  Big corporate landlords, as a class, are parasitical on the economy.  They take money generated by workers creating wealth out of the economy and keep it for themselves.  Almost &euro;1 billion per year in various State supports - public money - goes into the pockets of landlords.  Billions of euro from ordinary workers go into the pockets of landlords, and that amount of money has exploded over the past ten years.<\/p><p>Let us say, hypothetically, that the Taoiseach is right and if we pass a law providing that rents should be at a level people can afford to pay, which is a very radical idea, the Taoiseach's nightmare scenario transpires and every landlord in the country leaves the market.  What will they do?  Will they pack up the apartments into their bags and go off to wherever they go?  Will they strap the houses to their backs and go to America or Germany where the corporate landlords are based?  They cannot take their properties with them.<\/p><p>The key point is what will happen to the tenants.  We have no problem with small landlords but if small landlords cannot afford to operate on the basis of renters being able to afford to rent and not being crucified, then the State should agree to buy those homes at market rate from the small landlords who want to get out and turn that into public housing, keeping the tenants <i>in situ.<\/i>There you go - there is no longer a crisis.  When it comes to corporate landlords, IRES REIT, Kennedy Wilson and the rest of them, we should follow the example of what the people in Berlin voted to do by expropriating and nationalising this housing.  It does not provide any social use for ordinary people.  We should take it into public ownership and turn it into public housing on the basis of affordable rents.  We should create a universal model of public housing where housing is not treated as a commodity for profit but as a basic right for people.  That is the difference of approach between us, thinking about the interests of ordinary people, and the Government, saying we have to shape the market in such a way as to enable these people to make as much profit as possible.<\/p><p>There is a happy coincidence between the ideology of the Government and the self-interest of the class of landlords it represents, including the landlords in the Government and on its backbenches.  Their interests all happen to coincide.  This is not just a Government for landlords; it is a Government by landlords.  Last night, the Government won the motion of confidence by 19 votes.  By my calculation, if the landlords of this House had not voted, the Government would have lost that vote.  The same will presumably apply when we vote on this Rent Reduction Bill this evening.  If the landlords in the House absented themselves and said, as they should, that they cannot vote on this because this is voting about whether-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300010#H00200","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1657703400,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Does that include those from the Opposition?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300010#H00300","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1657703400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>All across the House.  The vast majority of the landlords are on the Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael side and among the Independents who voted with the Government.  If those landlords absented themselves tonight, as they should, and said it is too much to do with them, will impact their income and that it is clearly inappropriate for them to vote, there is every chance this Bill would pass.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth looking at who these landlords are.  Rory Hearne did very good work recently outlining the reality of these corporate landlords.  IRES REIT, the largest private landlord in Ireland, owns close to 4,000 homes.  US property corporate Kennedy Wilson owns close to 3,300 rental apartments.  Irish property investor Urbeo is developing build-to-rent units, advertised as studio units, in Citywest in my constituency for &euro;1,500 per month and two-bed apartments for &euro;2,000 per month.  US fund Greystar pre-bought 342 apartments being built in Griffith Avenue and advertises for a one-bed at &euro;2,140.  Rory Hearne also cites CSO data on new-build activity in Dublin in the first three months of this year showing that 1,151 newly built units were sold.  Of these, first-time buyers bought just 217, or 19%.  Non-household purchasers, overwhelmingly investor funds and REITs, bought 726, or 63% of all new builds in Dublin in the first quarter of 2022.<\/p> <p>These corporations are getting massive public funds.  IRES REIT got &euro;8.7 million in rental income from the State via HAP in the first half of 2021.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have turned the Irish State into a vast funnel through which it can direct public moneys to landlords.<\/p> <p> The Housing for All plan is completely dependent on the private market and on global investor vulture funds in particular.  Of the &euro;12 billion a year required to build the planned 33,000 homes each year, &euro;10 billion will come from private capital sources.  Of this, the \"majority will be required from international sources\", coming from well-established investors.  The private market and investors are to provide 83% of new homes, with the State playing a small role and providing less than one fifth of all new builds.  This encapsulates the disaster of the for-profit market and the commodity-driven approach to the housing crisis, which is why the crisis gets worse and worse day by day, week by week and month by month.<\/p> <p> I presume we will hit the Government bingo later on and that the Minister of State will say this is unconstitutional as it interferes with the right to private property.  We dispute that.  We think the Government should do this and should then defend the case in the Supreme Court if that is where it goes.  Even if the Government is right, that is precisely why we have introduced a Bill to insert the right to housing into the Constitution.  We think the vast majority of people out there would agree that the right of ordinary people to housing comes before the supposed right of vulture funds, cuckoo funds and others to maximise their profits.<\/p> <p> The Government won the confidence motion last night but I still do not think it has the confidence of ordinary people.  As the slogan of the Arab Spring goes, what the Parliament does the streets can undo.  This is now a weak Government.  It is a Government that can be pressured and pushed from below if we manage to build a cost-of-living and housing movement like we did with the water charges.  Such a movement, which will be holding a protest at 5 o'clock today in front of the D&aacute;il and a major national protest on Saturday, 24 September, can force concessions out of this Government.  At a certain time it will bring this Government down and open the possibility of a Government that does not govern in the interests of the big corporate landlords but instead in the interests of ordinary renters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300010#H00400","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657704000,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for bringing forward this Bill.  However, the Government will be opposing it.  Aside from its technical and practical operational shortcomings, it would in all likelihood quickly face significant risk of legal challenge and is likely to have a severely detrimental effect on the supply of much-needed rental property.  The Government is acutely aware that rents are very high in many areas as a result of pent-up pressures and supply constraints.  The most effective way to assist renters is to increase supply and accelerate delivery of housing for private renters, including for cost rental and social housing.  While supply builds, the Government has in place legally permissible and targeted measures to control rents.<\/p><p>It is not clear to me from this Private Members' Bill but I suspect the potential impacts of this Bill have not been adequately considered or proofed from a legal or economic perspective.  The reduction of rents in an arbitrary fashion is not going to increase the supply of rental accommodation and is highly likely to fall foul of the Constitution.  Supply is our constraint.  Rents rise if demand outstrips supply.  This Bill will not stop landlords leaving the sector or encourage new landlords to enter the market.  We all want affordable rents for people but we must recognise the need to secure the provision of additional supply of rental accommodation.  The Government has to strike a balance between restricting the level of rents tenants are paying and keeping ordinary landlords in the system.  The Government seeks balance and fairness in residential rental accommodation.  We will carefully examine and consider any impending proposals from the Housing Commission, including from a housing tenure perspective.  The simple fact is we need residential rental accommodation.  We need landlords.  The Deputies proposing this Bill will be aware of the exodus of small landlords from the market and the effect this is having on tenants and tenancies.  We are all aware of people seeking our assistance as their landlord has served them a notice to quit because they are selling their house.  We need to support small landlords to remain in the market while we increase supply.  Unfortunately, this Bill would do the opposite.<\/p><p>We need strong regulation and enforcement to deal with any unlawful activity in the sector, including the setting of unlawful and unaffordable rents.  Only 2% of all tenancies become subject to dispute resolution in the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  Redress is available to all tenants and all registered landlords through the RTB.  The Government has a proven record in quickly addressing pressures on rents.  The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 introduced measures last July to extend the operation of rent pressure zones, RPZs, until the end of 2024 and to prohibit any necessary rent increase in an RPZ from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP.  From 11 December 2021, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2021 caps rent increases in RPZs at 2% per annum <i>pro rata<\/i>, when the HICP inflation rate is higher.  The 2% cap remains necessary and effective in the context of fast-rising inflation.  Data from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, for May 2022 show HICP inflation of 8.3% while the flash estimate for June 2022 is 9.6%.  Therefore, under the current law, a potential rent increase of 9.6% in line with inflation is capped at 2%.  This cap has resulted in far lower rent increases, where they were sought, for the estimated 75% of all tenancies covered by rent controls.  These Government measures are legally sound.  I do not believe the same can be said for the measures in this Bill.<\/p><p>I will address the substantive issues with this Bill.  The key aim of the Bill, via section 2, is to reduce rents by limiting them to not greater than 25% of local monthly nominal median household disposable income for households of the relevant size or 25% of local national nominal median household disposable income for households of the relevant size, whichever is the lower, as determined by a national rent authority.  The Bill seeks to establish this new State body at additional cost to the Exchequer.  I am not clear on how the body is to interact with the RTB or whether any interaction is proposed.  The Bill provides for the State body to be comprised of tenant and employee representatives.  I do not see the necessary balance, independence or fairness in the Bill generally but the proposed composition of the new State body is of particular concern.<\/p><p>The Bill also seeks within 12 months to reduce, if necessary, existing rents to no more than 25% of disposable income.  An exemption to the blanket rent restriction is to be provided for luxury accommodation.  The Bill proposes to empower the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to make regulations to establish a new State body whose functions will include determining the criteria for the designation of certain properties as luxury accommodation.  No more than 5% of all accommodation can be so designated in any local area.  Other Deputies across the House would agree it would be more appropriate to establish any new State body through primary law debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Costs to the Exchequer will arise in the operation of a new State body and its establishment would need to be on a sound legal footing.  The proposed method of determining rent price ceilings by linking them to household size could incentivise landlords to favour larger households and would bring a risk of overcrowding.<\/p><p>I stand over the Government&rsquo;s actions to date to enhance the operation of the rental market.  Our interventions and the actions we are taking are comprehensive, targeted and legally sound.  As Deputies will know, a key element of existing policy centres on the designation of RPZs in areas where rents are highest and increasing most.  The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 introduced a rent predictability measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where rents are highest and rising fastest.  The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 introduced measures in July 2021 to extend the operation of RPZs until the end of 2024.<\/p> <p>The current rent pressure zone rent increase cap of 2%, where the inflation rate is higher, is a considerable advancement since 2016.  No rent set can exceed market rent.  The RTB continues its work in resolving tenancy disputes.  Lawful rent setting is being enforced.  The Government will be addressing the rising costs in the upcoming budget and is fully aware of the affordability challenges being faced by people throughout the country, including by renters.<\/p> <p> I do not believe that the Bill before us would ultimately help renters.  Forced rent reductions would negatively impact on the supply of rental properties, ultimately building further pressure on rent levels.  It would drive many small landlords out of the market and it would direct more tenants into homelessness.  The measures introduced by the Government to date provide timely, effective and proportionate responses to help all tenants in rent pressure zones.  Tenants outside of rent pressure zones can have their rent increased every second year, which provides rent certainty for at least two years.  Aside from the legal issues, the Government believes that a blanket reduction of rents could be counterproductive.  It puts a significant risk on the investment in the supply and upkeep of rental properties.<\/p> <p> I genuinely thank all the Deputies for their contributions on the matters put forward in this Bill.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and the Government are working very hard to try to put forward a comprehensive response, through Housing For All, to this huge challenge being faced by the State.<\/p> <p> With regard to comments made at the start by Deputy Boyd Barrett and Deputy Murphy, they will be happy to hear that I am not a landlord.  I do not know what data the Deputies have on the Opposition Members and where the largest landlords in the State are among representatives in this House.  It is absolutely incredible to state that a majority of this D&aacute;il, which last night voted confidence in this Government, is anything to do with the composition of its Members and their backgrounds.  All of us in this House are elected by the people.  They have the ultimate control around who represents them in this democracy.  I hear the Deputies, week in and week out, elegantly talking about the rental issue.  I wonder how many more housing units the Opposition will object to for visual amenity reasons?  It is more than 1,000 at this stage in their own communities.  This really prevents people trying to get stable housing and stable tenancies.  As a Government, we are trying to increase supply while the Deputies opposite are trying to stop it.  It is the reverse of what we are trying to do.  We are all meeting people in our clinics and our constituencies throughout the country who are very frustrated.  The Opposition is focused on sound bites and coming in here to shout every single week-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300011#J00200","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657704600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Not shouting; projecting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300012#K00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1657704600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>-----but they are putting forward no solutions.

He has just said the Government's interventions in housing are targeted, legally sound and effective.  Is this why, when polled and asked, the majority of people in the State say that housing is the number one issue for them?  Is this because the Government has been so successful in its targeting, its legally sound legislation, its timeliness and its effectiveness?  It does not add up.<\/p>  <p>  There is a theme in this Government that any alternative proposed by the Opposition is a fantasy, unrealistic, unworkable and, worse, is not politically real or serious, unlike the great statesmen and women of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  There is a phrase, TINA, which means \"there is no alternative\".  Margaret Thatcher used this frequently.  She meant there was no alternative to capitalism, no alternative to the market, no alternative to mass unemployment or to the devastation of people's living conditions.  I believe the Government and its Deputies are the children of Thatcher&rsquo;s politics, which is the political and economic view that says we cannot interfere in the market or in the need of corporations to make profits.  Today we say loudly and clearly that there is an alternative; there must be.  Whether it is housing, the health crisis or the climate crisis, the market is not the answer.  The market is often the cause of the crisis.  There is an alternative, and there must be, for the more than 60,000 renters who are spending more than 30% of their income on rents, for those in Dublin who now routinely spend 60% of their  income on rent, and for the more than 300,000 people in private rental accommodation who are dreading the next rent hike or a possible eviction notice.<\/p>  <p>  A proposal to reduce by law the rents inflicted on people may be greeted by the Minister of State and the Deputies in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael with fainting and gasps of horror.  They may say the Opposition is illiterate and that it will drive the poor suffering landlords out of the market.  This is odd when daily we are told they are already leaving the market and at a time of historically high rents.  The Minister of State might need smelling salts when trying to rubbish this proposal.  Horror of horrors, we want to set rents by interfering with the market.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, we proposed a law that would set up fair rents, would ban increases and would reduce rents by linking them to income.  One year later, the Fine Gael-led Government brought in rent pressure zones, but what has happened?  We have had total failure.  We repeatedly brought proposals to ban evictions during the housing crisis.  Again, there was widespread fainting and gasping by the Government.  We were told this would risk the utter destruction of the market, as we are being told again this morning.  Then, in 2020 the D&aacute;il legislated to ban evictions during the Covid crisis.  I have a newsflash for the Minister of State: the sky did not fall in.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputies opposite say we cannot interfere in the market.  We can improve the lives of the people in this State.  We can interfere in the rights of property and the rights of profit and, guess what, the Earth will keep spinning.  What may happen and what should happen is that life becomes a little bit better and a little less unequal for tens of thousands of people.  The world does not end with rent reductions or rent controls.<\/p>  <p>  This is not 1980.  This is not the era of Thatcher and Reagan.  We can intervene in the market and we must do so, especially when it is inflicting huge misery and poverty on the people in this State.  This proposal only appears revolutionary to the Government because it has a limited way in which it places the corporate landlords and their profits at the heart of what society does in a housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  We do not allow education provision to be determined by the market, nor should we.  We do not allow access to life-saving medical care to be determined by the market, although we do to a certain extent.  In Ireland, however, the right to access decent shelter and accommodation is determined in the private sector and the market.  It is enshrined in laws of the State that the rents should be set and guided by the market.  We must demystify the market.  Currently, the market rent is not what people can afford and it is not about what people can voluntarily contribute.  The market is about what landlords can extract.  Unlike other products where prices are determined by the choices people make, people have no other choice in this regard.  People need shelter as a basic for being able to live.<\/p>  <p>  Rents have increased by 76% in the past 12 years because they can.  This is a housing crisis where the State has failed to provide decent public housing for its people, and where the private rental market has forced up those rents and extracts every penny it can from ordinary, decent workers.  While rents have gone up by 76% in 12 years, what has happened to wages or to welfare?  The Government and the Minister of State would attack with glee any group of workers who would put in a pay demand for 76%.  The Government would say those workers wanted to wreck the economy and bring down the State.  The Government would talk of treason and of holding the State to ransom.  When workers demand a pay rise of 10% let alone 70% or 80%, they are lectured on the perilous state of the country&rsquo;s finances and told sternly that the Government could not give in to such blackmail.  It is, however, no issue at all for the Deputies on the opposite benches if Hibernia, Irish Residential Properties REIT, or some corporate landlords boost their investor profits and expect returns that are multiplies of that sum.  There appears to be no problem with profits or rents that hit the stratosphere.<\/p>  <p>  In these 12 years when rents have risen by 76%, landlords have crammed people into sheds, into corridors, and into double beds with strangers.  State subsides of private landlords by HAP, rent supplement, and RAS has hit &euro;1 billion annually.  Stories of websites advertising sex for rent are commonplace.  We have not seen a single substantial or real improvement in tenants' rights or security of tenure.  What has happened elsewhere?  Did wages rise by 76% during this 12 years?  Not according to the Central Statistics Office, which says the average industrial wage rose by less than 20%.<\/p> <p>Did welfare rise by 76%?  Not at all.  According to the Department of Social Protection, welfare has risen by 10% in the past decade.  What is so mystical about rents that the thought of controlling them by linking them to people's actual earnings evokes such a visceral reaction from the Minister of State and Deputies on the opposite benches?  We need to provide decent public housing that is administered and that has rents linked to people's income, to what workers can actually afford.  This Bill is more realistic, more grounded, and more based on real life than the ideology posing as <i>realpolitik<\/i>that I hear from the Government and its supporters.<br\/><br\/>In Dublin, one estimate is that a single person trying to rent would need a net income per month of &euro;6,574.  That is more than an annual gross salary of &euro;100,000.  Those in government are the real fantasists when they think that is a realistic option for the vast majority of workers today, or that the centre can hold when the centre is based on that sort of rental market.<br\/><br\/>It is an interesting question as to why this crisis has happened.  The Minister of State has talked about various ways, but he did not mention the war in Ukraine.  Members of Fianna F&aacute;il sometimes like to say it is because they had to make very tough and brave decisions when they decided to bail out the banks.  Fine Gael often likes to blame Fianna F&aacute;il.  It could also have been when the Labour Party and Fine Gael changed the laws to lure in real estate investment trusts, REITs, and vulture funds with promises of tax breaks.  Alternatively, it could have been when Fianna F&aacute;il rewrote the tax laws to allow various tax fugitives and exiles to rest their money here.  Another possibility is that it was when the Government stopped building public housing.  The simple answer to explain the housing crisis is that it is not really a crisis.  It is policy - the very definite, thought-out result of political, economic and social decisions taken by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael through the decades to placate the corporate sector.  The profits are not an unintended consequence of the housing policy.  They are the intended consequence of commodifying housing, changing laws to lure investors and halting and denigrating public housing.<br\/><br\/>We have the consequences of policies that are entirely predicted by the politics of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael with their occasional little mates in the Labour Party or the Green Party.  That amounts to 10,000-plus people in emergency accommodation, tens of thousands on the social housing list, and another 60,000 in receipt of HAP or other State support so as to have shelter tonight.  These are victims of an entirely planned and thought-out economic and social policy.  If that is allowed to continue, the future disaster awaiting the next generation is also foreseeable.  The ESRI recently looked over the hill and was able to tell us that for those aged 44 to 55 currently in rented accommodation, the future is absolutely dire.  They will be in insecure and unaffordable accommodation when they near retirement.  They will be unable to carry the burden of renting.  The home ownership rate is dropping.  If we continue down this road, the adults in this room, the Minister of State and his fellow Deputies, will be responsible for the failed policies that will deliver insecure rented accommodation, leaving tens of thousands of ordinary people and pensioners prey to the market and the whims of corporate landlords just to have shelter in old age.  That is the future unless we challenge it.  Unless we challenge the logic of the market and those who kneel before it like it was some god, we are in for big trouble for future generations.  I remind the Minister of State that we live in a society, not a market, and that society needs shelter and decent accommodation as a basic right for all people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300012#K00400","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657705200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Renters desperately need a break.  Renters are paying rents that are far too high, and they are continuing to rise.  Tenancies are increasingly insecure and there is a very significant rise in family homelessness, as evidenced in Dublin.  The most recent <i>daft.ie<\/i>rent register shows that the cost of an average rent for a whole year is &euro;24,000.  In Cork city, the Taoiseach's constituency, the cost of an average rental is &euro;16,000.  In the Minister of State's constituency of Longford-Westmeath, in Westmeath it is &euro;14,000 a year and in Longford it is &euro;11,000.  In those two counties we are seeing faster increases in rent in the past 12 months than in some of the larger urban areas.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has long argued for a package of measures that would not only address the spiralling cost of rent but would ensure genuine affordability is built into the housing system in the medium to long term.  We desperately need a ban on rent increases for all private sector tenancies, existing and new, for three years.  After that, we need to link private rents to an index such as wages so that it follows the movement of people's earnings.  We need to cut rents.  Our proposition is to put a month's rent back in renters' pockets and to do so through a refundable tax credit.  Crucially, we need a level of investment in affordable cost rental to deliver at least 4,000 cost rental units a year at prices that are genuinely affordable, not the &euro;1,200, &euro;1,300 or &euro;1,400 a month proposed under the Government's plans.<\/p><p>We are supporting the Bill today.  It has the same objective as ours, although it is trying to achieve it through a different mechanism.  I wish to respond to the Minister of State's point about whether what is being proposed is legally sound.  When we were developing our policy package, we looked at a set of proposals not unlike the ones in the People Before Profit Bill.  We took extensive informal legal advice.  The advice was that it could be constitutional unilaterally to reduce rents.  However, there are some problems.  One is that it would have to be in line with the proportionality requirements in the Constitution.  Another is that there would have to be an appeals mechanism for landlords and that would be potentially cumbersome and slow to set up, which could lead to long delays before the reductions in rent could be introduced.  We were also advised that even if we could get around those constitutional challenges with a formal appeals mechanism for individual landlords, we could run into breach of contract issues for existing tenants and, therefore, there could be a whole plethora of litigation against tenants in the Commercial Court.  For those reasons, we took the view that the quickest and most effective way to give renters the relief they desperately need is through a refundable tax credit.  Having said that, I think anybody on this side of the House who makes a proposal to try to assist renters deserves to have it properly scrutinised.  While we do not necessarily agree with the same mechanism as our colleagues in the Opposition, we think it deserves to be considered in the committee, as well as for there to be further legal consideration.  On that basis, we are more than happy to support the Bill.<\/p><p>The Minister of State used the word &quot;effective&quot; a little too much in his speech, and he did so with a straight face.  The difficultly is that a private renter's response would be that nothing the Government has done in the past two to six years has been effective.  That is why rents are continuing to spiral upwards and security of tenure is ever more precarious.  That is also why landlords, in particular semi-professional and accidental landlords, are leaving the market in droves, leading to an increase in notices to quit and homeless presentations.<\/p><p>The Minister of State also said the most effective way to help renters is to increase supply.  That is not the case.  A third of renters should be in social housing.  They are subsidised by HAP, RAS and rent supplement.  They do not want to be in the private rental sector.  At least another third of the 300,000 private rental tenancies should be in affordable housing - affordable purchase and cost rental, so if we were trying to design a proper housing system, our private rental sector would not be 20% of the total housing system but probably around 10%.  In fact, what two thirds of renters need today is social and affordable housing, not more high-end, high-cost, build-to-rent supply.<\/p><p>The Minister of State says supply is our main constraint.  That, again, is not the case.  That is a woefully inadequate way of understanding the housing system.  To fix the housing crisis, we need the right kind of supply at the right price in the right place.  Allowing the private rental sector to determine the answers to those questions is the reason we are in the current crisis.  A far greater level of direct State investment in social, affordable rental and affordable purchase homes, as outlined in the Raise the Roof motion, tabled by the Opposition last night, is the way to go.  That would require 20,000 public homes, between social and affordable housing need, every single year for a decade, not the far lower number that is being provided for by the Government.<\/p><p>We are happy to support the Bill.  We urge the Government to realise it is getting it wrong in the private rental sector.  The sooner it realises that, the better, not just for us but, crucially, for renters who need that break.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300013#L00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1657705200,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I thank People Before Profit for the opportunity to discuss rents today.

We are opposed to sweetheart deals with developers for the building of private homes at unaffordable prices on publicly-owned land.  This week, South Dublin County Council announced plans for the development of 266 public homes on public land as part of the Clonburris strategic development zone, SDZ.

The Clonburris strategic development zone includes 8,500 homes, built on a mixture of private and public land in the Clondalkin and Lucan area.  There will be a phased process of construction infrastructure such as schools and transport links.  I was the Sinn F&eacute;in lead on this development when I was on the council.  I tabled a successful motion that would see more than 2,500 public homes be built.  This was supported by People Before Profit and other members of the council.  Government parties only wanted 850 public homes in this development.  The Fianna F&aacute;il party did not support the Clonburris SDZ for 8,500 homes.  The Minister of State's party, and a current Fine Gael Deputy, went even further.  Not only did she oppose the building of 8,500 homes, but the party went to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and delayed the process.  It stood alongside developers and NAMA like an unholy trinity, delaying the building of these homes during a housing crisis.

I can categorically say that every town and village is impacted by this crisis.  The Government's failure to tackle the escalating disaster is causing social and economic upheaval among our younger generation, leaving people with no chance ever to own their own home or save for a deposit.  The latest reports on the rental market in Ireland show that my county, Wexford, had a staggering 14.2% year-on-year increase in rental prices.  The report from the previous quarter showed a 15.7% increase.  There is a clear upward pattern.  These increases are piled up along with the cost-of-living crisis currently being borne by working people and their families.  They are facing extortionate heating costs, with gas prices increasing by 29% and electricity prices increasing by 10.9% in August, as well as increases in carbon tax, rip-off insurance and soaring childcare costs, which are the highest in Europe.  Grocery bills have increased by more than 20%.<\/p>  <p>  Rents are continuing to rise.  Logically, this will result in even more people returning to living in box rooms in their family homes or becoming homeless.  The Government has failed to get to grips with this.  Ordinary people, both young and old, are suffering the soul-destroying consequences.  We look forward to debating this Bill further and working out the detail of how best we can achieve protection for renters and homeowners.  Sinn F&eacute;in's solution to the rental crisis is a three-year ban on rent increases, followed by linking rents to an appropriate index, such as wages, coupled with a refundable tax credit to put a month's rent back in every private renter's pocket.  We would combine this strategy with the delivery of 4,000 affordable cost rental units annually, through a significant increase in capital spending in budget 2023.<\/p>  <p>  We believe these proposals would bring relief as soon as possible to citizens who are in dire need.

We see spiralling rents in every part of the country.  I raised Knocknashee and Tobercurry with the Taoiseach a couple of months ago.  People there were paying &euro;800 a month in rent, then the landlord increased it to &euro;1,500 a month overnight.  That happened to ten people in a housing estate, because the landlord owned many houses there.  The Government made an excuse that it is not part of a rent pressure zone, so there was nothing it could do about it.  That is the situation for people in many parts of the country, with rents spiralling out of control.  There are many decent landlords who keep rents at a reasonable rate, provided they have good tenants who look after the property with no problems.  That is the case for many people.<\/p>  <p>  There are landlords who will use every excuse they can to push rents through the roof.  They are mainly doing that because of the example set by corporate landlords, which drives rents to exorbitant rates, especially in our cities.  Many people are trying to rent in the city of Dublin, including people from the country looking for student accommodation, which is totally unaffordable.  They might also try house shares, which have also become unaffordable.  It is a serious crisis.  The Government needs to recognise that soft talk will not solve this problem.  We need real, determined action from the Government.  The proposal in the Bill may be part of the solutions needed to drive change in this situation.<\/p>  <p>  The other clear problem in the country that the Government has promised to address for so long is the income threshold for people to get on the housing list.  It is very low in many parts of the country.  It is absurd that a person has to be earning less than &euro;25,000 per year to get onto the housing list in many counties.  It is ridiculous and the Government needs to recognise that.  We have to take action on these issues.  If we do not take action on them, we will be left with a situation where matters continue to get worse.  That is the experience of the vast majority of people across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has a choice to make.  I hear the dog whistles about objections to houses.  In the town of Ballinamore in my constituency, there is a little housing estate called Lahard.  It is an old, county council housing estate, which has been there for years.  Leitrim County Council proposed building ten houses on land at the far side of Lahard.  Two councillors on Leitrim County Council opposed those ten houses being built.  One was a local Fine Gael councillor and the other was a local Fianna F&aacute;il councillor.  All the other councillors supported it.  In fairness, some were from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael too.  That is the problem.  We hear here that Sinn F&eacute;in is opposing the building of houses.

Reducing rents in the private rental sector should be central to the Government's aims but it seems that a continuation of pro-developer subsidies is the main concern.  The option of renting is impossible for more and more people.  The latest report from daft.ie states that rents increased by 11.7% across the State in one year, from the first quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022.  In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, rents increased by 18.6% in Cavan and 12.6% in Monaghan in the same period.  The number of evictions has risen dramatically since the start of the year.  My constituency office has been inundated with people who are extremely distressed and have few or no options open to them because there are very limited options in the private rental market.  Many of these are housing assistance payment, HAP, tenants, but the maximum HAP that can be received in Cavan is &euro;490, for a couple or individual with three children.  The council is not even sanctioning that, because the rents are too high, making it unsustainable for renters to pay the remainder of the rent, since it would drive them into poverty.  Renters then go to the landlords to ask them to declare a lower rent so that they can claim HAP and pay the difference in cash.  It is unbelievable and driving people into poverty.<\/p>  <p>  Middle-income families are even worse off because they do not qualify for any sort of housing support.  I agree with my colleague that the social housing thresholds must be raised.  They have not been updated since 2011.

Rents are more than 50% higher than they were at the peak of the Celtic tiger in 2008.  This is causing misery for my constituents in Dublin Bay North.  We must conclude that the housing market has failed.  We need much stronger State intervention to increase supply through the direct building of social and affordable housing.  We need stronger controls on rent increases and we need to limit the causes of evictions.  Even at this late stage of the rent crisis, the whole country still has not been designated a rent protection zone.<\/p><p>It is not too late for the Government to take some action.  Tax rates on speculators need to rise rapidly.  The calls for rent relief for landlords already enjoying record rent levels must be firmly rejected.  The State needs to take on those engaged in land hoarding and speculation.  Use must be made of compulsory purchase orders, the windfalls on development land must be heavily taxed and the LDA must be transformed into the dominant provider of affordable housing.  If we want to reduce rents in this country in the long term, there is one clear way to do that.  The Government must build tens of thousands of State-owned cost-rental units and destroy the business model of those who expect to make rack-rent profits from the rents paid by ordinary workers.<\/p><p>Since 2016, this House and the Seanad have debated a multitude of housing Bills and motions, many of them dealing with the issue of renters and the protections they need.  The Labour Party in government froze rent increases for two years in 2015 but, since then, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have allowed record rises.  In our Social and Affordable Housing Bill 2016, my party proposed to limit increases for new properties for lease to align with prices for comparable properties in a particular area.  This would have stopped landlords evicting tenants or terminating leases in order to get a new renter in to pay the latest market rent.  Fine Gael in government voted that Bill down in December 2016, with the abstention of Fianna Fail.  As rents got higher and higher, we repeatedly called for a freeze on increases for a minimum of three years to allow supply to catch up.  That was one of the key issues in the 2020 general election.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il refused to act.  Landlords were allowed to set whatever rent they wanted for a new tenancy and to increase it by 4% a year for existing tenants.<\/p><p>The refrain from the Government parties was that our proposal was unconstitutional, despite it having been implemented by the Labour Party in government for two years from 2014.Whenever the Constitution is invoked on property rights, we should always remind ourselves what it actually states.  It recognises a right to private ownership but it goes on to state in Article 43.2&deg;:<\/p> <blockquote> \t1&deg; The State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice.<br \/><br \/>2&deg; The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good. <\/blockquote>  <p>The principles of the common good and social justice are set out in the Constitution in reference to private property.  When people can barely afford to live, when Irish rents are out of kilter with those in the vast majority of similar European countries and when more than 10,000 people are homeless in the State, we can all agree that a case for protecting the common good could be strongly made.<\/p><p>Our Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill 2021, which we introduced last September, would have massively restricted the grounds for eviction and frozen rent increases.  The Minister made soothing noises at the time about working with us on it but nothing substantial happened.  As a result of his failure to act, there is a plague of evictions now happening across the country as landlords seek either to sell properties at the top of the market or use any excuse to get their existing tenant out in order to put a new one in place.  A commercial tenant has more rights if the shop he or she leases is sold than does a family when its home is sold by an investor.  Why is this?  It is because, for some reason, the Government believes the investor must be allowed to achieve the maximum price he or she can.  Where is the common good in that, as laid down in our Constitution?<\/p><p>We all know the result of this lack of action.  More than 10,000 people, and rising, are homeless, including 5,054 single people, 3,028 children and 1,366 families.  A modern tragedy is happening right in front of us.  Simple changes to the laws covering evictions would shield a lot more people.  If the Minister wanted to change the law today, he could do so.  He has no compunction about rushing through changes on electoral reform and planning but God forbid he do something to stop a family being evicted or a child going into homelessness.  Why not change the law to make it binding that any landlord who wants to sell a house with an existing tenant must first offer it to the State?  We should put in place a default compulsory purchase order law for people's homes whereby the seller would get the market price, the family would get security and the State would save on having to deal with another homeless case.<\/p> <p>As I said during the debate on our Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill 2021 last September, it just makes us all wonder what is the priority of this Government.  Whom in the housing market is it trying to protect?  There is no equivalence between the danger the renter faces and the danger a landlord faces.  We are constantly told that landlords are fleeing the market, but the number of households living in rented accommodation was more than 500,000 in 2020 and that figure has doubled over two decades.  The State is subsidising the mortgages and profits of tens of thousands of landlords and investors through the HAP, rent supplement, RAS and other schemes because of decisions made by Fianna F&aacute;il in the late 1990s to get out of the direct building of social housing.  The consequence of that is that more than &euro;1 billion of current spending now goes to vulture funds and private landlords instead of towards investment in assets that could provide multigenerational security.  We can change that, but it will not happen through the continuous outsourcing of provision to developers that Fianna F&aacute;il is once again engaged in.  The State must build and it must challenge the for-profit driven housing model.  We can change things, but it is clear that it will not happen under this Government or under this Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300015#N00300","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657707000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>The Social Democrats will support this Bill going on to Committee Stage.  Any issues with it, technical or otherwise, can of course be engaged with then.  While we would take a somewhat different approach in respect of solutions in this regard, we very much support the direction, intent and principle of this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  There is a real lack of urgency from the Government on this issue.  It seems to stem from a lack of a fundamental awareness of what is happening right now.  We are probably within days of reaching a record in the number of people homeless.  The official figures do not reflect the reality.  It is becoming increasingly difficult for people who are homeless to get into emergency accommodation.  With regard to the official figures for emergency accommodation, I am hearing reports from all around the country from people who are homeless and looking for emergency accommodation but who are being turned away by local authorities.  They are being told that emergency accommodation is simply full and that they cannot access it.  Some local authorities are coming up with a myriad of different criteria, which are all new and grossly unfair.  Those local authorities are using these criteria to avoid providing emergency accommodation, as they are obliged to.<\/p>  <p>  People living in tents are being refused access to emergency accommodation.  Recently, I was assisting someone and Dublin City Council, DCC, stated this person could not prove homelessness.  This was a person living in a tent and who had had this certified by one of the homeless outreach groups.  Yet DCC was trying to say that the person had not provided proof of homelessness.  This is how ridiculous this situation is getting and, therefore, the numbers for those in emergency accommodation do not in any way reflect the reality of the situation.  Even regarding those numbers in emergency accommodation, however, we are probably within days of those reaching record levels.  People are becoming homeless primarily because rents are so high and because of a lack of affordable supply and affordable rental supply.  This is causing great misery and trauma.  Children are living miles away from their friends and their schools.  They have no stable home life, with their parents doing the best they can to support them and to hold down jobs in the middle of all of it.  <\/p>  <p>  We get the sense that this human trauma does not seem to impact sufficiently on the Government.  It seems to be only economic arguments around housing that impact.  It is only when we see the knock-on effects in respect of childcare providers not being able to provide places anymore for children, which means people not being able to get into the workplace or withdrawing from it,  and when we see the issues affecting teachers or those working in the hospitality industry - and much of that sector is simply not opening at certain times because it cannot get workers - that we wonder if the Government will act urgently as a response to these issues.  We do not, however, see urgent action from the Government on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I will address a couple of the points the Minister made.  He spoke about landlords exiting, which is a real problem.  There are two key drivers in this regard.  One of them is capital appreciation and the rise in house prices.  We heard news again today that house prices increased by more than 14% in the past year.  This of course is driving many landlords to exit because this is a good time for them to realise the capital appreciation in the value of their homes and, therefore, if we want to stop them exiting, we must do something about rising housing prices and affordability in that context.  Of course, though, one of the key drivers of landlords exiting in the past few years, which the Government does not mention when it addresses the problem, have been the measures that Fine Gael, and indeed the Labour Party, brought in between 2011 and 2014.  There was an exemption to capital gains tax, CGT, for people who bought in as landlords or investors.  That exemption could only be availed of if the landlord sold up before the end of 2021.  Therefore, Fine Gael brought in these CGT exemptions that have been helping to drive landlords out.  More than &euro;500 million of CGT exemptions incentivised landlords to sell up and get out.  No mention is made of this of course.  When we are told that rent regulation is a problem, then, I feel that such an attempt to blame rent regulation for landlords exiting is a form of gaslighting, when in fact these CGT incentives have been a key part of it.<\/p>  <p>  Let the Government not pat itself on the back too much in respect of RPZs and the associated regulations.  There are two key problems with this aspect.  The first is that all over the country those areas not in RPZs are not included in those measures.  People have been faced with rent increases of up to 75% and 80% outside of RPZs.  These people are living in areas that will never become rent RPZs because of the way the rules are written.  In rural parts of the country, it is unlikely there will ever be a rent level that will exceed the average outside the greater Dublin area.  This is how the rules are constructed.  Therefore, for an area in County Donegal, for example, to become an RPZ, it would have to achieve an average rent level above those we see in Galway city, Cork city and Limerick city.  Is it the Government&rsquo;s policy that it will undertake no rent regulation in those parts of the country until the rents exceed the average, which include those city areas?  That is absurd.  Equally, however, many of these areas will never qualify as RPZs because there is not sufficient data.  They do not have more than 30 new rental tenancies registered each quarter, which must be the case to qualify as an RPZ.  These rules are, therefore, designed to fail.  Regarding those areas where we have RPZs, let us be clear that a great number of breaches are occurring.  Greystar was this week reported as seeking double-digit rent increases.  It is already charging rents of between &euro;2,140 and &euro;5,220 per month in Dublin.  Those are phenomenal rents.  <\/p>  <p>  Let us not kid ourselves that more and more supply at the higher end is doing any good.  We can walk out of here, go down the quays and look at some of the high-end supply any evening.  Later in the summer and during the winter evenings, we will see lights on in approximately one third of the apartments in those developments.  We will never see lights on in the other sections of those buildings because they are empty and vacant.  That can be seen in my constituency.  There are high vacancy rates in the newer developments on Griffith Avenue.  People on incomes of more than &euro;80,000 have been turned away.  Those people have been told they do not meet the financial criteria for those developments.  Therefore, we need affordable supply and not high-end, high-rent supply that is left vacant.  Data from the CSO told us that 20% of our rental supply was empty on census night.  More than 35,000 rental properties were completely empty so what we need is affordable supply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300016#O00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1657707000,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this legislation.  When we are talking about rent reviews, we must discuss several aspects.  Before I go any further, I must state that I have a vested interest.  I have properties that I have rented out.  We do, however, need to regulate rents.<\/p> <p>We need to set standards that are fair for both the renter and landlord.  A rent authority would probably be a good mechanism whereby someone with a fair-minded view could look at this and make sure that the rents being set are affordable and that landlords, especially accidental landlords, are not being pushed out of the market or forced to sell their property.  When a property is put up for rent in my constituency, a significant number of people want it and that creates a supply-and-demand issue, which is not good.  It is creating a false economy as well because it will not be sustainable for landlords to continue to receive these type of rents going into the future.<\/p> <p> Some landlords and people with a second property are exiting the market and selling their properties.  They have told me that there is no real glory in renting out a house, meeting all the regulations and dealing with tenants and all of that.  We have to keep this argument balanced.  I am aware of a few tenants who have not been fair when renting a property.  The way they treated the property and landlord was not great.  I have seen pictures in one case that show how they treated a house in which the landlord was left with a bill of approximately &euro;14,000 to get the house back in rentable condition.  That is a fact.  It has happened on a number occasions and, therefore, the landlord is not the devil.  Landlords are trying to do their best.  Extortion is going on in terms current rents and how they are increasing and we need to do something about that.<\/p> <p> I have received many complaints from landlords about the RTB in recent months.  The fee is now to be paid annually as opposed to every three years.  People find the payment system to be cumbersome and they say it is failing because properties are not being registered.  If a cheque is sent in, the board denies that it was received.  If the fee is paid online, the payment is taken from landlords' accounts but does not seem to be arriving in the RTB account or the system does not show that the landlords have conformed by paying their fee.  Properties are not being registered properly by the board and it is creating angst among landlords.  Will the Minister of State bring this back and look at what is going on because it does not look right?  The RTB should do things properly.  The board brought in a new system that it cannot use so how can it expect landlords to use it?<\/p> <p> Going back to the basic point, rents should be set in a fair way for both the tenant and the landlord.  Rents should be based on some sort of indexation so that rates do not fire ahead when supply becomes tight.  This comes back to the original question of why we have high rents.  It is because we are not delivering houses quickly enough in this country to make sure the supply is available.  We need to do more on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300016#O00300","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657707600,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I support the premise of the Bill.  The idea that people are paying 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and sometimes 70%, of their income on rent is incredible.  There needs to be a tight relationship between the income people earn and the rent they pay for accommodation.  This proportion is way out of whack in terms of people's ability to live.  The Bill seeks to reduce rents by limiting them to a maximum of a quarter of the monthly income of a household.  That would be a fair level across society in terms of what people should be paying and it is not the case now.<\/p>  <p>  Rents are on average &euro;250 per month higher than they were at the peak of the Celtic tiger era.  That is an incredible legacy and record for the Minister of State and his political party to have.  What that does is it radically reduces the spending power of the families for a generation.  Money going towards paying rent is money that is taken away from other elements of those families' lives.  We in Aont&uacute; have been calling for a rent cap for a long time as an emergency measure to make sure that rents do not increase further.  The Government has pushed back over and over again on the idea of a rent cap.  Any measures it has brought in allow for continuous rent increases to happen, even in RPZs, which is also wrong.<\/p>  <p>  In my county, Meath County Council provide a discretionary fund for people who are homeless so that they can get emergency accommodation.  What is happening is that landlords see this discretionary fund as a cheque and are looking to increase the charges for those rooms and houses so that they can gouge the council for the rental of those rooms for individuals who need emergency accommodation, which is wrong.<\/p>  <p>  In times of crisis, protections need to be put in place so that the average citizen and those most exposed are protected.  However, the Government is not treating this housing crisis as a time of crisis.  It is not treating it as a national emergency.  In all the aspects of Government housing provision regarding vacant homes, Airbnb and REITs, the Government is allowing business as usual to continue in the housing market.  We have to get to a situation where it is understood that homes are considered to be shelter for families, yet the major element of Government policy is to allow homes to be speculative investments.  That is what is wrong at the core of Government policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300017#P00200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1657707600,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for putting forward the Bill.

We cannot just close down such places.  I am sure many people would be very glad of those bedsits if they were available now, especially the homeless people.  I am not saying that they should live in inferior accommodation or anything like that but the Government keeps pruning away and driving landlords out of the market with taxation.

These are the people falling between the cracks.  The Government's Housing for All plan is nothing more than a rebranding of old Fine Gael policies and does nothing constructive to tackle pressures in the rental market in the short term or to address longer term supply needs.  It does absolutely nothing to tackle the exorbitant taxation charged on small Irish landlords.  Instead, the policy favours only the large institutional investor model.<\/p>  <p>  A functioning housing policy must include the following.  All tenants should have access to a good quality, safe and secure home.  All tenants should be able to treat their houses as their homes and be empowered to challenge poor practice.  All landlords should have information on how to comply with their responsibilities and be able to repossess their properties when necessary.  Landlords and tenants should be supported by a system that enables effective resolution of issues.  Local councils should have strong and effective enforcement tools to crack down on poor practice.  Councils must get back to the model of building social housing.  That is not occurring on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  More than half of households renting the home receive some form of State support.  A recent ESRI report showed that almost 300,000 households received support for their housing costs in 2020, up from 134,000 in 1994.  That works out at 16% of Irish households overall and 54% of all renters.

That puts me in a good position to talk about this very important subject.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the debate, but some of its content will not help to solve the problem.  What we have heard from an awful lot of the Deputies to the right is the demonisation of people who have properties they rent out.  They are doing nothing wrong.  The majority of people who own property are highly respectable, and this is a highly regulated sector.  They pay mortgages on properties and they rent out those properties.  Of course there are foreign investors who set themselves up not to pay tax.  The one fact that is forgotten about, however, which I have not heard anybody to my right-hand side acknowledge, is that if the majority of people who rent out property bring in &euro;1,000 in rent, &euro;520 of that goes to the Government.  I would like to hear that discussed today but it is not spoken about.  Less than half the rental income is left to buy property, insure and maintain it and pay to fulfil all the necessary obligations.<\/p>  <p>  While I would be delighted if the State could provide the accommodation that is required, not only this Government but successive Governments have failed to do so.  There is a place for the private rental market.  Of course it has to be regulated.  Of course we want to see affordable rents that people can live with.  It is wrong that people would have to rent forever.  If people can get on the property ladder at some stage, that is the ideal scenario and that is what we all wish to see happen.  Again, however, if a landlord outside the Chamber were to hear a lot of what has been said here today, all it would do is add to the 26,000 landlords who have already left the private rental market and sold their properties, which are no longer available to rent.  That is making the problem worse and worse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300018#Q00200","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1657708200,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I thank People Before Profit for allowing us this discussion.  I appreciate that everyone is trying to do their best but, sadly, I see in this proposal a lot of nonsense that just will not work.  The Bill does not state whether it is referring to local authorities or otherwise.  In my view, the local authorities assess income and treat people on lower incomes accordingly.  Those people pay less rent.  Those who tabled the Bill must be referring to private landlords.<\/p>  <p>  To add to what the previous speaker said, many landlords pay 52% tax, and maybe something could be done about that to ensure that landlords will stay in the market and continue providing housing.  I suppose the Government has a role in this.  It could give more money to the local authorities to purchase more land and build more houses in places like Gneevgullia and Rathmore, for instance.  The Government, however, is now putting on pressure to ensure that Airbnb is ruled out of order.  There is a reason landlords opt for that market, and that is that they have control over their houses.  I deal with many people looking for houses to rent.  I also know many decent landlords who want to get out of the market but cannot do so because the Residential Tenancies Board is more in tenants' favour and will not allow landlords to get out.  Many tenants are staying on in their houses and refusing to go even though they have been given proper notice.  That is why landlords are getting out of the market.  They do not have control of their houses.  The Government needs to do something about that if it thinks private landlords are going to stay in the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300018#Q00300","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1657708200,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I thank People Before Profit for introducing the Rent Reduction Bill, which I support.  I think many will consider the proposal in the Bill to reduce rents in the private rental sector revolutionary, but a revolutionary approach, a practical and realistic proposal on behalf of renters, is what is required.  The right to a secure, affordable place to live, a home, is an essential human right that has been denied to an increasingly large proportion of the population.  We have a housing crisis, and none of the measures taken by this Government and previous Governments have come close to tackling the problem.  I remember the then Minister with responsible for housing, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, stating in 2016 and 2017 that there would be no homeless families in hotels and bed and breakfasts by July 2017, and we still have a crisis.<\/p>  <p>  A key factor in the crisis is the unaffordable rents demanded in the private rental sector.  Rents have risen by 100% in the past ten years.  There is certainly no evidence of a 100% rise in the cost to landlords of maintaining a property or of a 100% increase in workers' wages over that period.  We now have a year-on-year inflation rate of 10%, but there was nothing like that in the past ten years.  Building costs have risen, particularly for apartments, with the cost of buying a new apartment now ten times the average wage of &euro;47,000 a year.  The only people who can afford to buy or build are major international investment funds as long-term investments.  When people cannot afford to buy, they are forced to rent in a market dominated increasingly by such big investment funds.  I got an email just yesterday from a renter in Lansdowne Gate.  IRES REIT has notified him that a further 2% rent increase will come into effect from 1 October 2022.  That follows a 4% increase last year.  He feels the residents are being manipulated by the vulture funds in the interests of their shareholders.<\/p>  <p>  In 2021, two-bedroom apartments in Dublin were being advertised at &euro;2,250 a month.  Even for somebody earning &euro;50,000 a year, which is above the average wage, that equates to 70% of their take-home pay.  For the majority of working people who earn below the average wage, this is an intolerable situation.  Even with an effective rent freeze, which we do not have, rents will remain unaffordable.  For example, for someone earning &euro;30,000, a rent set at 25% of take-home pay would be approximately &euro;480 a month; for someone earning &euro;40,000, it would be approximately &euro;625 a month.  Those are affordable rents.  At a minimum, therefore, rents in the private sector need to come down by 50% to be affordable.  There would be a hue and cry from the usual suspects that that would force the individual or so-called accidental landlords out of the system, but that is already happening, mainly to cash in on extremely high property prices.  The Government should fund local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs, to buy those properties and let them back to tenants at affordable rents and with security of tenure.<\/p>  <p>  The problem of supply will be met only by a State-led programme to build on already zoned public land 100,000 public housing units in a mix of traditional council housing and cost-rental housing.  That should have been initiated years ago.  If it has been, we would not be in the situation we are in now.  We need a sea change in our approach to solving this crisis.  It is an emergency.  If that means a revolution in thinking and approach, that is what is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300018#Q00400","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1657708800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important and necessary Bill.  I absolutely support this legislation establishing a national rent authority and reducing rents to affordable levels by limiting them to a maximum of a quarter of households' monthly incomes.<\/p><p>As we all know, this is the last week the D&aacute;il will sit before the recess.  Although we have unnecessarily rushed through a lot of very important and heavy legislation, we have actually done very little to help to ease the cost of living for families.  People are struggling to get by and keep up with continuous spiralling costs and it seems disingenuous of us to pass Bill after Bill without any of them addressing this.  I welcome that People Before Profit has introduced this legislation to address properly the everyday struggle that people are facing.  This legislation would have a huge impact on the many in this country who are part of Generation Rent.  Due to the failed housing policies of successive Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments, facilitated by the Labour Party and Green Party, which keep them in power, people do not have the option to buy their own homes and as a result are being forced into the rental sector.  Renters make up a considerable number of today's population and the rises in rents they have been subjected to are completely unacceptable.<\/p><p>In my constituency, Donegal, the average rent increased by almost 20% in 2021 alone, and this has only got worse in 2022.  The latest report from daft.ie shows that rents in Donegal rose by 23% in the first three months of 2022 by comparison with the same period last year, with the county's rents rising at a rate beyond those of any other major city in the country.  There is a serious scarcity of homes in the area.  On 1 May, there were just 36 homes available to rent between Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan, which is a drop of nearly 40%.  What is more, we will now have many more pushed into the rental market in Donegal due to homes being affected by mica.  I have discussed in depth the many issues with the defective concrete blocks Bill and I know this will also be discussed in the Seanad this afternoon, but I want to point out again that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is not only failing mica-affected homeowners through that<b><\/b>legislation, but he is also failing them by not implementing the legislation before us, that is, by not ensuring that rents cannot increase any further.  I strongly believe rents should be linked to people's incomes and to ability to pay.  It is only fair.  We cannot go on allowing for rent to take up most of a person's income.  It is not acceptable and it certainly is not sustainable.<\/p><p>I would like to condemn the Taoiseach's remarks on this Bill.  He said it would undermine the capacity of many working people to afford many things.  This type of thinking is completely ridiculous and nonsensical.  Is the argument that people want to pay more?  I can assure the House that this certainly is not the case.  If the argument is that people would like to afford to pay their own rent then that is of course the case and that is why this legislation is so important.  It is to allow people to do just that.<\/p><p>The Government has prioritised helping developers and vulture funds over their own citizens for far too long, but it is them that it really represents.  It does not represent the citizens of this country but the vulture funds, developers and foreign companies.  It is they that it wants to represent.  In that case, it is doing it very well.  It is doing a very good job of it.  We are starting from the wrong place because we are giving the Government credit for actually wanting to help citizens.  That is not what it wants to do.  We are starting from the wrong place all the time and expecting the Government to come to us.  We should actually be starting where the Government is starting from and then we would see that, probably in its own mind, it is doing a good job.  This process needs to end.  Government Deputies need to remind themselves who they are here to represent: citizens, not vulture funds.  They need to start listening to their constituents, who are crying out for help.  It is time for their voices to be prioritised.  The Government now has the opportunity to do that by passing this Rent Reduction Bill.  We know it will not do it.  Even though the Minister of State who is present, Deputy Noonan, is a Green Party Minister of State and is probably sympathetic to what is in the Bill, he will not accept and pass it.  That is the reality because Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have decided that the vulture funds are the ones they are looking after.  Those are the ones the Government will pursue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300019#R00100","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1657708800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis na Teachta&iacute; go l&eacute;ir.

I apologise again because I cannot address all the issues raised.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputies for their contributions.  I am grateful for the opportunity to close the debate for the Government on People Before Profit's Rent Reduction Bill 2022.  The Government is opposing the Bill for the reasons outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, earlier.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the challenges that tenants face.  We know that rents are unaffordable for many people and that rent increases can exacerbate financial difficulty.  We know that many would prefer to own, and not rent, their home.  We know that people want a secure home.  We know they need a residential rental sector with an adequate supply to ensure rents are affordable.  The Government has implemented and will continue to implement measures to promote equity, fairness and security of tenure in the private rental sector.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing the supply of housing of all types is the key to relieving the pressure on the existing rental stock.  The Government's plan Housing for All sets us on a path of delivering 300,000 new homes between now and the end of 2030, including 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable-purchase homes and 18,000 cost-rental homes, as referred to by Deputy Joan Collins.  It is a plan with genuine ambition, guaranteed investment and fresh ideas to deliver housing for people to create a long-term sustainable housing system.  Housing for All is backed by &euro;20 billion in State investment in housing to the end of 2026.  It gives certainty and stability to those who want to finance and build homes.  To deliver housing at the substantial scale we need across the country, capital from all sources, including private investment, is required.  Housing for All focuses on tackling supply and affordability issues in the rental market.  Guaranteed State investment in housing of over &euro;4 billion per year is aimed at increasing supply, and the increased supply of all properties, including purpose-built rental accommodation and cost-rental accommodation, will relieve the pressure on the existing rental market stock.<\/p>  <p>  Through a range of measures, we are incentivising the supply of different tenures &ndash; social, affordable and private rental, including cost rental, and private ownership.  The investment of &euro;4 billion in Exchequer funding in 2022 will provide approximately 9,000 new-build social homes and help to fund the provision of 4,100 affordable homes to rent or buy.<\/p>  <p>  Affordable-purchase schemes are coming on stream.  These schemes, along with the first home shared equity scheme, will increase access to homes for first-time buyers.  Housing for All is working.  The Government is making progress.  The numbers of new dwellings, completions, commencements, permissions, home purchases, first-time buyers and mortgage draw-downs are all increasing.  This year, the Government's target is the delivery of 24,600 homes.  In the year to the end of March 2022, 22,219 new homes were completed.  We received 44,491 planning permission applications for residential units in the same period.  Commencement notices for the construction of almost 30,233 new homes were received over the past 12 months.  This is 18.5% higher than in the previous 12-month period, June 2020 to May 2021.  Notices for 2,746 homes were received in May alone.<\/p>  <p>  Some &euro;250 million has been allocated for a local authority home loan, which is available for first-time buyers and other eligible applicants for the purchase of new or second-hand residential properties or for self-builds.  Eligible applicants can borrow up to 90% of the market value of a property or purchase price.<\/p>  <p>  The first home shared equity scheme was launched last week, on 7 July, and will support approximately 8,000 affordable home purchases by 2025, primarily for first-time buyers in the private market, with overall funding of &euro;400 million.  The scheme delivers on the programme for Government commitment to progress a State-backed affordable home purchase scheme to promote homeownership.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has acknowledged that many families are currently facing housing affordability issues.  To address this, it has committed under Housing for All to the delivery of 18,000 cost-rental homes by 2030, or an average of 2,000 homes per year, which will make a genuine difference for families experiencing affordability issues.  The intention is initially to target cost rental in more urban areas where the affordability issues are most acute and where the most significant reductions in market rents can be achieved.  Not only does cost rental provide security of tenure but it also targets rents at a discount of 25% below market rents for comparable units.  As the rents are based on the cost incurred in the provision of a cost-rental home, State subventions can help to reduce starting-cost rents that are ultimately charged to the tenants, taking into account long-term maintenance needs.  The Government has put in place a cost-rental equity loan scheme to assist approved housing bodies with cost-rental delivery and local authorities can avail of supports from the affordable housing fund to deliver cost-rental units.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's first 50 purpose-built cost-rental homes were completed in quarter 1 of 2022 at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside.  These were delivered by Tuath and Respond approved housing bodies in collaboration with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and with &euro;4.5 million in funding provided through the serviced sites fund, the precursor to the affordable housing fund.  The cost-covering rent for the two-bedroom apartments is &euro;1,200 per month, which represents a very significant discount on market rents in the area for the same type of unit.  To date, approval in principle has been confirmed for approximately 900 cost-rental homes to be delivered by approved housing bodies under the cost-rental equity loan scheme in the period to 2023.<\/p> <p>The Government has committed &euro;70 million for cost-rental equity loan scheme funding this year.  The scheme funds 30% of the cost of acquiring cost-rental homes.  The remaining 70% is also committed by the State through loans from the Housing Finance Agency.  This commitment is given on a multi-annual basis in line with the Housing for All targets.<\/p> <p> The first 65 cost-rental homes under the scheme were tenanted in Ireland by Cl&uacute;id in 2021, with 25 in Taylor Hill, Balbriggan, and a further 40 at Barnhall Meadows in Leixlip, County Kildare.  Both developments delivered cost-covering rents at least 40% below comparable open-market prices.  The second quarter of 2022 saw a further 119 cost-rental homes tenanted at Barnhall Meadows in Leixlip, Parklands in Citywest, The Paddocks in Newbridge and Kilcarbery Grange in Clondalkin.  Funding from the cost-rental renewal scheme covers up to 30% of the capital costs of each development.  The Housing Finance Agency provides support for the remaining 70% of capital costs.  This will bring the number of cost-rental homes in Ireland to 234 less than 12 months since the passing of the Affordable Housing Act last July.  As the model continues to be rolled out, it will provide long-term secure rental accommodation for thousands of renters.  It will also add certainty to the rental market and provide more options for people.  It is also expected that the development of the cost-rental sector will have an impact on the wider rental market, reducing rents over the longer term.<\/p> <p> Any proposed measure that would impact on private property rights requires detailed consideration and scrutiny, having regard to the provisions of Article 43&deg; of the Constitution and associated legal complexities.  Rent pressure zones are a targeted instrument the Government has enhanced over the past 12 months, taking into consideration rising inflation, whereas the rent restriction proposed in the Private Members' Bill would apply to all areas regardless of the level of rent pressure.<\/p> <p> The Government will oppose the Bill.  I recognise the intent is to help tenants.  The Government also seeks to help tenants.  I assure the Deputies the programme for Government recognises the important role the private rented sector plays in housing many people and will continue to do so.  The Government is addressing the challenges in the sector, including with standards.  The Department continues to work hard with the Residential Tenancies Board to continue to strengthen its function and delivery of assistance to tenants and landlords.  The board is highly responsive, particularly in the fast-moving context of Covid-19 in recent times, to the needs of tenants.  The Government is continually providing up-to-date assistance.  I record the Government's sincere gratitude to the RTB for its continuing efforts in this regard and for the help of MABS, Threshold and all other NGOs, approved housing bodies and local authorities that help to deliver in addressing the evolving housing crisis.<\/p> <p> The Government is committed to supporting an adequate supply of residential tenanted accommodation to ensure equity and fairness for landlords and tenants alike.  Improving standards, security and affordability for renters is a priority for me and the Government.  We are making significant changes in recognition of the fact that tenants continue to face challenges in the rental and housing markets.  Our approach to any necessary legal change will continue to be carefully balanced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300019#R00200","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657709400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Landlords have never had it so good, to coin a phrase.  Corporate landlords are having it really good.  Corporate landlords were brought here after the crash by Fine Gael for one reason only, which was to make huge amounts of money.  This is what they are doing.  They own huge portfolios of apartments and houses throughout the State.  In some cases they are getting paid by the State after getting a huge reduction in the cost of some of these houses.  It is sickening to see it.  There is a terrible legacy with regard to landlords in this country and there is the psyche of the Irish people.  We fought against landlords when the Brits were here and we drove them out.  That psyche and legacy are still here.<\/p>  <p>  A total of &euro;1 billion per year is given to private landlords.  This is indefensible.  This money is going to private landlords.  Half of it could build hundreds if not thousands of houses but we continue this policy.  The Minister of State is a member of the Green Party.  This policy is ideologically driven.  We have a housing crisis and 11,000 people in emergency accommodation because of ideology.  It is because of the decision to leave housing to the market and forget about the ideology of public housing.  This is what it comes down to.  This is the reason we have a housing crisis and all of the by-products and misery that come with it.  I do not know whether the Minister of State can defend that.  He is swimming with sharks in Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  These people are maniacs who have no social conscience when it comes to people in situations such as this.  In the South Dublin County Council area I am from, the average three-bedroom house costs &euro;2,400 to rent.  Who the hell can afford that?  Average working people who can afford that will be pinned to their collar and will have very little money for anything else.<\/p>  <p>  What is wrong with rent control?  It is a good idea that in a particular area if rents are very high, the State can say that rents must be certain level.  It is a good idea.  Other countries have done it.  Why can we not do it?  Otherwise we will let the free market run wild.  The invisible hand cannot be touched.  I do not understand why this is being allowed to happen.<\/p>  <p>  Rent pressure zones were introduced five or six years ago.  Even though rent pressure zones do not really work, they are an acceptance by the Government that we have to interfere somewhere on rent control.  The rent pressure zones have failed.  We need to go beyond rhetoric and have rent controls where people have a standard of living and not situations where people are homeless or cannot find a place.  It is not acceptable.  The Minister of State has to look at his position in government in defending these policies.  This is what Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have been all about.  It is why we have a crisis.  It is because of ideology.  I do not know whether the Minister of State believes in that ideology.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300020#S00200","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speech","time":1657709400,"counter":89,"content":"<p>We have an absolutely dire rental and housing crisis.

The Minister with responsibility for housing does not even bother to come in.  I find that really sickening.  Yet again, I do not get an answer, although I am not surprised, on why the Government broke its promise to tell us what is happening with the review of the social housing income eligibility thresholds.  We were promised they would be announced before the summer recess.  The promise has been broken.  Many people are suffering as a result.  Rents have reached &euro;2,000 and &euro;2,200 a month in Dublin.  This year, rents have increased by 10% in Dublin and Cork, 13% in Galway, 15% in Limerick, 16% in Waterford and 24% in Leitrim.  Record numbers of families and homeless people are on the street.  The Government will go off on its summer holidays while people are suffering misery.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State reeled off statistics.  I will give him statistics.  He mentioned D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  There are 4,000 households in need of permanent secure homes in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  Over the next five years that are covered by the plan, another 2,825 will join the list.  The Housing for All plan the Minister of State said will work will deliver 2,318 homes.  There will be more people on the housing list in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown at the end of the plan than there are now.  The situation now is that people on the housing list are waiting for 20 years.  People cannot get a house from the council.  The HAP rates are not high enough.  In many cases, people cannot even get on housing list or become eligible for housing support.  Amy, who has a family of three, was homeless once five years ago.  She is overholding and will be evicted in the coming weeks.  She will not go back into homeless accommodation.<\/p> <p>Shauna is over-holding on her lease, has three kids, serious mental health issues and nowhere to go.  She is faced with homeless accommodation.  Joanna, who has three children, is faced with eviction at the end of July and there is nothing within the HAP limits in the area.  Maria actually works for a housing charity and faces eviction in October.  She cannot find anywhere to rent.  Karen faces eviction on 3 September.  She has a child with a severe ASD diagnosis.  Emily has one child and has been put into emergency accommodation in Dublin city centre.  \"D\", whose full name I will not mention, is working, was previously homeless, is being evicted from a HAP tenancy, cannot find anywhere else and will be back into emergency accommodation.  Another mother with two children was removed from the housing list because her mother works part time.  She has gone over the limit by &euro;400 and is entitled to absolutely nothing.  Jason works for the council and lives in his car.  Helen is sleeping rough in Glasthule.  I could go on and on.  There is nothing for them and the Minister cannot even bother to come in to address it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300020#S00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657710000,"counter":91,"content":"<p>We are out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300021#T00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1657710000,"counter":92,"content":"<p>We are not.

Berlin brought in rent-cap legislation in 2020 to do precisely what we are looking to do, which is not to allow rents go above levels that are affordable.  It was brought in throughout Germany in 2020.  In Paris, it was brought it in 2018.  If there is a tense situation, we can introduce extraordinary rent controls, but the Government will not do it.  We have declared an emergency, but the Government still will not do it.  No matter how much human misery there is, the Government will not do it.  It is not possible.<\/p>  <p>  Then, as Deputy Paul Murphy said, we hear the real reason.  The landlords would not like it.  They would flood out of the market.  If the landlords cannot deliver rents that are affordable, they should not be landlords.  If they exit the market, as Deputy Murphy said, they cannot take the houses and apartments with them.  The local authorities should step in and buy them.  One of the reasons we have the highest levels of rents is that we have the lowest levels of social housing.  We have 9% social housing in Ireland, against 25% in Austria and 19% in Denmark.  We would get a lot of extra social housing if all the landlords exited and the State just went in and bought the houses and charged affordable rents.  There is no problem.  In fact, it would bring down the excessive rents and house prices in the market.

This happened on two occasions between March and April 2020.  The bereaved parents had believed that the organs of their babies, who had been subject to autopsy, would be cremated or buried in a sensitive and dignified manner and that they would be contacted before this happened.  As we now know, none of that happened.  These revelations were met with understandable public outrage and we can only ever imagine the extreme hurt and distress that these families have experienced.<\/p><p>A review of practices at Cork University Maternity Hospital was commenced at that time and a HSE internal audit to establish the organ-retention and disposal practices at public hospitals across the board.  That audit, according to media reports, reveals that the inappropriate disposal of organs was still in use at that time, at University Hospital Limerick and our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  Incredibly, the same month that the review got under way into the scandal at Cork University Maternity Hospital, the organs of two babies born in University Hospital Limerick were sent for incineration, again to Belgium.<\/p><p>The investigation has also uncovered that multiple public hospitals across the State have retained organs from children for more than the one year specified by HSE policy.  This happened in hospitals in Dublin, Tullamore, Limerick, Waterford and Port Laoise.  At Crumlin children's hospital, the organs of one child were kept, it seems, for more than 20 years.  The breaches of care and dignity with regard to the treatment of organs are widespread and these revelations have emerged when the families affected by the initial scandal at Cork University Maternity Hospital are still waiting for answers.<\/p><p>These parents have been told on four separate occasions that there will be a delay in giving them the report of the review team despite the fact that the review is complete.  These are parents who lost their babies in tragic circumstances and had to endure the heartache of hearing that their child's organs were disposed of, alongside medical waste.  Ms Katie Quilligan is one of those.  Her son, James, was one of the 18 babies and she says:<\/p> <blockquote> \twe are still waiting for answers... I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be able to fully accept or process what happened until we get those answers.  Waiting is like going through the grieving process all over again ... the HSE is letting us down. <\/blockquote>  <p>I am sure that the Taoiseach agrees that all of this is unacceptable.  It is unacceptable that these parents are still kept in the dark.

Guidelines were established.<\/p>  <p>  It is difficult to comprehend that hospitals are still, albeit not the same scale as prior to that inquiry, nonetheless engaging in practices such as incineration or retaining organs beyond the timelines that they are required to retain organs and that in certain instances, again, there was no proper consultation or engagement with parents or family members.

At least I take something from that in that it did a robust audit and has revealed the latest incidence with regard to hospitals in Limerick, Drogheda and elsewhere.

Last September the housing committee was asked to do pre-legislative scrutiny of the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2022.  It ran to 18 pages.  More than ten months later, late last Thursday, an amended version of the Bill was circulated by Government.  It ran to 60 pages, with the addition of 48 pages of amendments.  The Bill, which the Government has sat on for almost an entire year, had mysteriously tripled in size.<\/p><p>Some of the proposed amendments on challenging decisions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the courts were extremely far-reaching.  For example, one provision would allow An Bord Plean&aacute;la to change retrospectively decisions that were wrong in fact or in law after the court challenge to the decision had been lodged.  A person or group would take a High Court challenge, which is a highly onerous and expensive undertaking, and discover mid-proceedings that An Bord Plean&aacute;la had changed the decision on which the entire proceedings were based.  The <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>informed us this morning that particular provision has been withdrawn.  The Government did not bother telling the Opposition that.  My colleague, Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, had to prise that information from the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, in the House this morning.<\/p><p>Other changes to the manner in which the courts deal with planning challenges remain in the Bill, along with a host of other problematic amendments.  The fact the Government would try to shoehorn these kinds of planning amendments into a Bill that is supposed to deal with non-consequential issues when there are three separate investigations under way into An Bord Plean&aacute;la really beggars belief.  The controversy swirling around An Bord Plean&aacute;la has already resulted in the resignation of the deputy chair, Mr. Paul Hyde, late last Friday.  While he is a central figure to the three current investigations, his resignation will not end the problems of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, some of which have their origins in the bypassing of the planning authorities, thereby changing the nature of the planning appeals board.  That change also happened before a recess in December 2016, when the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, introduced strategic housing developments, SHDs, which were an idea brought to him by the construction industry.  The industry commented afterwards that he had introduced their ideas lock, stock and barrel.<\/p><p>Why is the Government ramming this legislation through the D&aacute;il when its own review into the planning laws has not yet been completed.  Will he tell us why the Government sat on this Bill for an entire year and only brought forward the 48 pages of amendments this week, just before the recess?

There are two separate issues here but I accept there is a connection in terms of overall planning.  On the amendments coming forward to the Planning and Development Act, four sets of amendments were initially considered for inclusion by Government in the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill.  All four sets of amendments were identified by Government for inclusion in the next available planning Bill, which was the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, and these amendments were flagged in the Minister's Second Stage speech on the Bill in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 6 April.  The legal drafting of the specific amendments was not ready for inclusion in the Bill when it was before Seanad &Eacute;ireann and therefore the amendments are being introduced on Committee Stages in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>  <p>  Two further amendments were more recently identified for inclusion where the Government is anxious to introduce new regulatory rules on short-term letting and a number of streamlining-type amendments to judicial review provisions in the planning Act as soon as possible.  There is a current supply shortage in the private rental sector.  Many people in the House have raised the issue of short-term lettings and the need to tighten that up to create a greater availability of supply in the rental sector, specifically in rent pressure zones, which are the areas of highest housing demand, thereby delivering increased units to the sector and stabilising rents.  There is also a need to improve efficiencies in terms of the way in which judicial review cases are handled in the courts.<\/p>  <p>  There will be a more comprehensive planning Bill in the autumn, but the consistent call in this House has been for rapid action on housing to enable greater supply in the housing market.  Department officials briefed Members of the Seanad on the proposed amendments, except for the short-term letting one, on 25 May and latterly briefed the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the proposed amendments on 11 July in advance of Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il set to take place today.<\/p> <p> The issue relating to An Bord Plean&aacute;la is serious but we must allow for due process in that regard.  The Minister has commissioned a review by Mr. Remy Farrell, senior counsel, into certain allegations made against an individual in respect of his previous role as deputy chairperson of the board.  The senior counsel is now due to report to the Minister by 29 July 2022.

Irish agriculture is one of the most sustainable in the world despite media commentary suggesting otherwise.  Irish farmers produce food of the highest quality with a low environmental footprint.  Farming and the wider agrifood sector are the backbone of economic activity in rural Ireland.  It is Ireland's largest indigenous sector, providing employment to more than 300,000 people, directly and indirectly.  Despite wider economic challenges, exports from the agrifood sector were &euro;14.5 billion in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has indicated the sectoral emissions ceiling range for agriculture will be the equivalent to a percentage emissions reduction of between 22% and 30% compared with 2018.  Achieving a reduction of 22% will be extremely challenging for the sector but any higher than 22% is likely to have a devastating economic and social impact on rural Ireland.  The IFA is adamant that the ceiling for agriculture should be set no higher than an equivalent of a reduction in emissions of 22% compared with 2018 levels.  The climate action plan provides a pathway to achieve a 22% emissions reduction through improved efficiencies and the adoption of new technologies and new practices.  There is no pathway to a 30% emissions reduction that does not result in a significant reduction in cattle numbers at the level of individual farms.  A 22% emissions reduction would recognise the technical challenges associated with the monitoring, reporting and verifying of emission reductions in agriculture, the timeframe required for the wide-scale adoption of new technologies, and the unique ability of the sector to sequester carbon and offset emissions through on-farm renewables that would support other sectors to meet their emissions reduction ceilings.  The IFA report shows that an emission reduction of 22% could have very significant consequences for the sector with a need to reduce the numbers of livestock, even if the mitigation measures set out in the climate action plan are adopted.  However, the consequences of a 30% reduction would be devastating, with a 12% reduction in livestock numbers, a drop of &euro;3.8 million in output and a loss of more than 56,000 jobs, predominantly rural-based.<\/p>  <p>  As set out in the Food Vision 2030 report, there must be a balance between economic, social and environmental sustainability.  This is most important because we must ensure we protect our family farms and that, whatever happens, it will not lead to a reduction in our cattle numbers, because that would be devastating to the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300023#V00600","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1657711200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and accept the sincerity of the case he is making in respect of the climate action plan and the need to reduce emission ceilings.  I think the Deputy agrees there is an overall need to create emission ceilings and to reduce emissions in all sectors of the economy, including agriculture.  It is important the Irish Government supports the Irish agricultural industry.  We also need balance in the debate and should consider words such as \"devastating\", \"catastrophic\" and so on.  The dairy industry has grown exponentially over the past decade or so.  It has been going extremely well since the removal of the milk quota.  This year will be significant for the dairy side of the industry, given the global situation.  That is the reality of where we are coming from.  That is the base.<\/p>  <p>  We are providing substantial funding.  We recently announced a new and pioneering &euro;1.5 billion agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES, that will pay farmers up to &euro;10,500 per farm, on average.  There is funding for biodiversity, for example, and the introduction of results-based actions and the proposed ACRES will allow for qualitative payments for biodiversity, which is anticipated to reward high-quality habitats and support the delivery of improved outcomes from lower-quality habitats over time.  The scheme will address water quality.  There are farm sustainability planning processes.  ACRES will target action in various areas, such as riparian margins, unharvested cereal margins, planting new hedgerows and trees, results-based low-input grassland, extensively grazed pasture and environmental management of arable fallow.  It will also touch on climate measures around water quality and reducing chemical nitrogen usage.  Actions to be taken through ACRES will include catch crops, low-input peat grassland and the planting of trees.  All of that will make a significant contribution to the achievement of the agricultural measures under the land use change and forestry chapter of the climate action plan.  A lot is being done and much investment is going into agriculture to assist the industry.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Cahill, who has said we should have a specific technology fund to help agriculture, and farmers in particular, to adapt to new technologies that would also help in the reduction of emissions.  That has to be worked out a bit more but it is an interesting idea that the Deputy has championed.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Healy-Rae is correct that there is work under way in respect of emission ceilings.  In the coming weeks, sectoral emission ceilings will be established for the agricultural sector and all sectors, and that will give clarity to the sector.  I understand where agricultural interests want the baseline to be and what level they want it set at.  The Government's objective remains that, whatever the ceiling, it will allow for the sector to maintain food production in our beef, dairy, sheep and pig sectors.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, has been very consistent in this regard.  I think the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, has approached this in a very balanced, effective way in terms of marrying the challenge of food security in the world with doing it as efficiently as we can from a carbon emissions perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300023#V00700","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657711800,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I also wish to point out that 2,000 ha of land was planted last year &ndash; it should have been 8,000 ha.

I have raised this issue on numerous occasions with Ministers in the Department of Health and with the Taoiseach, both publicly and privately.  I will not give up on the fight to maintain long-stay care for the elderly people of Roscrea.  The people of Roscrea deserve the security and comfort of knowing that their own and their family members&rsquo; lives can be lived out in their own town.  This has been the case for generations.<\/p>  <p>  As I speak, a group of elderly people are worried and anxious about what the future holds for them.  Older men and women are being reduced to tears of despair at the thought that the place they call home will be snatched away from them.  They are troubled and unsettled at the idea of being moved to a different town, to a place that is some 20 miles away from family and friends and will end lifelong connection with their home town.<\/p>  <p>  Loyal and committed staff have been kept in the dark.  The HR department has convened a meeting of staff for next Wednesday, presumably to advise them on their options of redeployment.  The voices of these people have remained unheard since all of this began.  They have no desire to move to a unit in Nenagh.  The voices of those who have spoken out for Dean Maxwell and petitioned their case feel ignored and abandoned.  They are now ready to take to the streets and protest in solidarity with the patients and staff of Dean Maxwell.<\/p>  <p>  The Government and the HSE will see true community spirit and the fierce loyalty Roscrea is renowned for.  The people are united in defiance of this HSE plan.  We have been through all the glib explanations and excuses.  The truth is that the 25 long-stay beds were covertly transferred from Roscrea to justify the building of a new 50-bed nursing home unit in Nenagh.  The elderly patients from Roscrea were just used to make up the numbers.  The human cost was irrelevant.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has never engaged in a transparent fashion.  Queries were met with evasive responses.  The HSE stonewalled approaches for information and refused point-blank to admit the true position.  The HSE has been implementing a policy of closure by stealth.  It had neither the courage nor the honesty to admit it.<\/p>  <p>  We have one last opportunity to redeem the future of Dean Maxwell.  It can only be saved through political intervention and political direction.  I am requesting the Taoiseach make a personal intervention to remedy this injustice.  I suggest that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, would meet with the representatives of the local action group.  At that meeting, the local committee will outline the footprint of an alternative viable proposal to protect and enhance services and supports for the elderly population of Roscrea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300024#W01000","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1657711800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>First, I want to thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  He has been consistently raising this issue for quite some time along with Deputy Cahill, who has been very persistent on it.  We are aware of the depth of feeling among the people in Roscrea associated with the Dean Maxwell Community Nursing Unit.  The Deputy gave the background to the decision making that led to where we are.  It serves the community very well.  Its location is right in the centre of the town, which facilitates all who wish to visit those who live in the facility.  Access is important to relatives.<\/p>  <p>  It is registered for 27 beds, of which 20 are long-term residential care beds.  It also provides seven palliative, respite or short-term care beds.  They are counting 19 long-term residents who live in Dean Maxwell and there is currently one respite bed in use now.  As the Deputy knows, HIQA has had concerns about the current design of the building.  It is very old and work is ongoing to redress these issues.<\/p>  <p>  To be fair to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, she has worked with the Deputy and local representatives to make sure that nothing happens in the immediate sense and the HIQA registration for beds in Dean Maxwell was renewed in 2020 will remain valid until 2023.  The HSE intends to continue to admit residents to Dean Maxwell when there is bed availability.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is fully committed to exploring all available options.  She has been meeting with public representatives, as the Deputy knows, and engaged on 21 April last when she invited public stakeholders to accompany her on a visit to CareBright at Bruff, County Limerick just to see the potential.  She has put much work into this, to be fair.<\/p>  <p>  I would be happy to meet the local action group with the Ministers in question to hear its presentation.  As I said, Deputies Lowry and Cahill have asked for this and that is something I will be prepared to do.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has committed to exploring and proposed options in conjunction with the HSE.  She had a meeting with public representatives in Tipperary and community stakeholders last April.  As the Deputy knows, there have been discussions on the construction of dementia-specific independent living centre on a greenfield site, coupled with the development of new facilities on the current Dean Maxwell site.  Both, by the way, would represent very significant capital allocations.  It will have to meet, obviously, the needs of the local community.<\/p>  <p>  In short, I would be prepared to meet them and I accept that there is a depth of anger and concern.  We have to work communities to effect change.

This was the first visit to Ireland by a US congressional delegation since April 2019, when Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Congressman Richard Neal led a delegation to visit Dublin, London and Northern Ireland.  The bipartisan delegation was led this time by Congressman Richard Neal, co-chair of the Friends of Ireland Caucus and chairman of the influential Ways and Means Committee in the House of Representatives.  The delegation comprised nine members of Congress, three members of the Republican Party and six of the Democratic Party.  The majority of the delegation also sit on the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over revenues, taxes, trade agreements and tariffs.  The representatives were accompanied to Government Buildings by US Ambassador Claire Cronin and other officials.<\/p>  <p>  Our meeting in Government Buildings was an opportunity for a broad-ranging discussion covering Northern Ireland and Brexit, international support for Ukraine, and Ireland-US bilateral relations.  The delegation apprised me of its visits to Brussels and London immediately before it arrived here, where its members had held meetings with the European Commission Vice President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d, the European Commission Executive Vice President, Valdis Dombrovskis, the British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and the International Trade Secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan.  Northern Ireland, including the safeguarding of the Good Friday Agreement, as well as Brexit and the protocol, were high on the agenda for those meetings, including broader issues on Northern Ireland.  The delegation also shared its plans for a visit to Belfast the following day before returning to the United States.<\/p>  <p>  Congressman Neal and the other members of the delegation were unwavering in their commitment to peace in Northern Ireland.  Like us, they recognise that there are genuine concerns about aspects of the implementation of the protocol, but these can only be addressed in a sustainable manner through intensified European Union-United Kingdom discussions and agreed solutions.  We agreed that unilateral actions are divisive and unhelpful, and contrary to the long-standing approach to resolving issues relating to Northern Ireland in a spirit of partnership.  I very much welcome the continued, unequivocal support of the US Administration and Congress on this matter, which is testament to the deep and historical bonds between our two countries and the strong attachment of US elected representatives to the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The question of a special envoy was not discussed during our meeting but I know the issue is still under consideration.  I also thanked the members of the delegation for their continuing backing of immigration priorities.  We discussed the devastating war in Ukraine and our shared commitment to providing humanitarian assistance for the people of Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to arriving in Dublin, the delegation was in Kerry where its members undertook a cultural visit, including music from, and a tour of, the Great Blasket Island.  They had a two-day political, economic and cultural programme in Dublin, which included a meeting with President Higgins and other Members of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300028#AA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1657714200,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for that update.

They have spoken about the difficulty of agreeing a UK-EU trade deal if the UK threatens the Good Friday Agreement and overrides the Northern Ireland protocol.

I had the opportunity to meet with the delegates and I found all of them to be extremely interested in, and very focused on, the needs of our country and very well-informed on the politics of all of our island.  It is not just when they are here that those individuals show interest in our country.  On a regular basis, they pass unanimous motions in both US Houses of Congress in support of the Good Friday Agreement and condemning recent British Government decisions.  From engaging with the delegates, it is clear they do not just want to see the agreement protected; they also want to see its potential maximised.

We had a detailed discussion with the delegation in respect of the issues around the protocol.  The delegates included both Republicans and Democrats and some had expertise in the trade area.  They found it very difficult to comprehend what the issues were on the UK side.  Their view was that the protocol issues could easily be resolved with proper negotiations and discussions.  They have made it very clear to those they met in the UK system that they expect this issue to be resolved by negotiation and that anything that would undermine the Good Friday Agreement would cause very significant challenges all around.  I will say no more than that.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Haughey raised a number of points that I would agree with in terms of the successor to Boris Johnson.  We all want a sensible, managed relationship between the UK and Europe.  The EU wants that and many people in the UK want it.  We want a professional relationship that adheres to existing agreements.  If agreements need to change, then we do it together in terms of identifying the issues, renegotiating or re-amending, but unilateralism would not form part of that approach.  It is likewise in respect of the relationship between Ireland and the UK.<\/p>  <p>  I agree we need to maintain our vigilant presence on Capitol Hill, through our US ambassador and politically as well.  There is constant engagement with the US Administration.  I recently met with President Biden in Madrid to do exactly what the Deputy is saying.  One of the reasons I went to Madrid was to engage with a range of political leaders, including President Biden.  We took the opportunity there to raise certain issues.  As the Deputy said, what we want is an intelligent and sensible approach in respect of these relationships.  I would like that to be the case in the event of a new British Prime Minister appointing a new Government.  In the post-Brexit situation, we need a new dynamic between the UK and Ireland.  Formerly, as members of the EU, UK and Irish Ministers and officials met very often.  That is no longer the case because the UK is out of the EU.  We need a new structure to deal with the bilateral issues between Britain and Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I think it is interesting that Deputy Paul Murphy said I get sensitive when there is criticism of US imperialism.  I do not get sensitive but I am always struck by the sort of singular focus the Deputy has in respect of the US and no one else.  While there is a terrible immoral and illegal war raging on Ukraine, I am always struck by his reluctance really to go there in any exchange with me or anybody else.  His overwhelming focus is always on the US and sometimes on the EU itself.

I was pleased to host him and his delegation for a working dinner at Farmleigh House.  Ireland and the Netherlands are like-minded on a wide range of issues, and we co-operate closely at EU level.  Coming ahead of the special meeting of the European Council at the end of May, and its regular meeting in June, my meeting with Prime Minister Rutte was a useful opportunity to discuss current EU and international issues, especially Russia's war on Ukraine, its consequences and our collective response to it; climate action, especially in the field of energy; and the EU's relationship with the UK. <\/p>  <p>  With our EU partners, Ireland and the Netherlands have been steadfast in our outright condemnation of Putin's unprovoked and immoral war on Ukraine.  The EU has acted swiftly and with great unity in our political, humanitarian, economic and military response.  My discussion with Prime Minister Rutte covered all dimensions of the issue as it stood at that time: the humanitarian situation and the financial supports that will be needed by Ukraine in the immediate and longer terms; and the range and impact of sanctions on Russia.  We also touched on Ukraine's application for EU membership in response to which, as the House will be aware, the June European Council granted Ukraine candidate status.  We also discussed how to accelerate decarbonisation of our economies and societies, break our dependence on fossil fuels, and provide a more resilient, secure and sustainable energy system for future generations.<\/p>  <p>  I briefed the Prime Minister on Ireland's climate policy approach and on the legislative framework now in place to support achievement of our targets.  We also expressed our strong support for the EU Fit for 55 legislative package, on which significant progress has been made by the French Presidency over recent months.  We reflected on our respective experiences of responding to the Covid-19 pandemic, and on the unprecedented work at EU level on vaccines and the economic recovery package, Next Generation EU.  I also briefed the Prime Minister on developments in Northern Ireland and on the protocol.  Prime Minister Rutte reaffirmed his very strong solidarity with Ireland, and his support for the work of the European Commission in seeking to find practical solutions to problems that have arisen in implementing the protocol.  I took the opportunity to convey my thanks to the Prime Minister for his country's solidarity and support.

Does this feed into the wider concept that has emerged subsequently in the EU of a need for a new form of a Marshall Plan for Ukraine?  I think a conference in Switzerland is planned on this aspect soon.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, told the House last week about a pledging amount and how Ireland could co-operate with the Netherlands on this aspect.

As we know, this concluded on 9 May 2022 and listed 320 measures and recommendations.  It recommended treaty changes regarding making health a shared competence, switching from unanimity to qualified majority voting and increasing the powers of the European Parliament.  How likely is it that these three matters will be advanced?  I think it is unlikely that there will be any treaty change advanced as this issue is considered.  Additionally, I am told that a detailed assessment of all the recommendations will be undertaken across all relevant Government Departments in the coming months, which will be overseen by the Department of Foreign Affairs.

That country has a points system for the quality and size of a property.  The majority of properties below a certain standard are subject to maximum rent caps.  This means that the Netherlands does not have the exponential rental crisis we have that is immiserating so many people.  The Taoiseach should know that our housing costs are 78% higher than the EU average.  Our rents have jumped by more than 70% in the last ten years, while rents in the rest of Europe have only increased by 13% on average.  This has been the case because the Dutch, the Germans and the Austrians have rent controls, and we could go on through that list.  Therefore, the next time the Taoiseach is chatting to the Dutch Prime Minister, he should ask him how the rent controls work in the Netherlands and perhaps consider introducing something similar here<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300030#CC01100","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1657715400,"counter":251,"content":"<p>It sounds like the discussion about solidarity with Ukraine took up a fair amount of time during the talks with Prime Minister Rutte.

Debt repayments this year amount to &euro;6 billion more than the total education budget of Ukraine.  Some &euro;2.5 billion of those repayments is owed to the International Monetary Fund, IMF, alone, which is the biggest holder of Ukrainian debt.  The truth is that Ukraine's debt is growing because of the crisis that has arisen as a consequence of the horrendous and brutal Russian invasion of the country.  Ukraine's debt has already grown by more than &euro;5 billion this year.  Surely then it does not make sense on the one hand to have a Marshall Plan for Ukraine - and we are in favour of investment to help the reconstruction of the country - while on the other hand to continue to say that the odious and illegitimate debts that are the consequence of the oligarchisation of Ukrainian society should continue to be paid.

There are two elements to this.  There is the current financial crisis facing Ukraine.  I met with President Zelenskyy and I was the first Taoiseach to visit Kyiv.  I just received a letter from the President thanking Ireland and me personally for supporting the historic decision of the European Council of June 23 to grant Ukraine the official status of a candidate country for membership of the EU.  President Zelenskyy has written to us articulating his gratitude to Ireland for our proactive support.<\/p>  <p>  EU leaders have now agreed to support Ukraine via exceptional macro financial assistance of up to &euro;9 billion in 2022.<\/p> <p>That is to try to enable Ukraine to deal with current budgetary issues.<\/p> <p> There is a further issue around the reconstruction of Ukraine post the war or in parallel with it continuing.  The Ukraine Recovery Conference took place in Lugano at which Ireland was represented by the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming.  We joined in the signing of the Lugano declaration, which sets out seven principles to guide Ukraine's recovery process.  The Ukraine-led draft of the recovery and development plan presented at Lugano recently is the overarching framework guiding the recovery process and allows for co-ordinated multi-stakeholder participation and partnerships.<\/p> <p> We contributed towards non-lethal elements of the European Peace Facility, bringing our total support to approximately &euro;44 million of the overall &euro;2 billion in support provided under the four packages.  We provided a further &euro;20 million in humanitarian aid, as well as medical assistance and supplies amounting to &euro;4.3 million.  That covers some of what Deputy Murphy raised.<\/p> <p> When I spoke to President Zelenskyy, we discussed Ukraine's economy and finances.  There has been a 50% reduction in its GDP.  Its economy is in crisis because of the war.  Therefore, a number of strategies need to be deployed.  It is not a simple matter of waiving debt.  That is not the way these issues will be resolved.  I also met with Ukraine's Prime Minister, Denys Shmyhal.  He met with the International Monetary Fund, IMF, to develop a structured approach not just to the current budgetary issues, such as continuing to pay civil servants and keeping everyone going, but also to the reconstruction of Ukraine.<\/p> <p> On Deputy Haughey's points about the Conference on the Future of Europe and treaty change, I would keep an open view.  He is correct in that it will be very challenging to get agreement on a treaty change among the 27 EU states.  I support the idea of making public health a shared competence given our experience of Covid-19, the procurement of vaccines at a European Union level, the establishment of the Humanities in the European Research Area, HERA, institute, and the need to upgrade the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC.  There are a lot of lessons we should learn from the handling of Covid at a European level.  The difference between the European Union's approach to Covid and its approach to SARS in the early 2000s, when I was the Minister for Health, is unbelievable in terms of the scale of co-ordination this time around compared with the previous time.  I believe it worked, so we need to be open minded about that in terms of treaty change.  Getting treaty change is a huge challenge in itself.  We will keep the House informed of the development of detailed analysis by the Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs regarding the recommendations of the Conference on the Future of Europe.  The Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, is actively working on that.<\/p> <p> We have rent controls.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300030#CC01300","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657716000,"counter":254,"content":"<p>What?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300031#DD00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1657716000,"counter":255,"content":"<p>Ireland has a rent pressure zone, RPZ, rate of 2%, and that is a fact.

Some 55% of secondary school principals say they have unfilled vacancies, and an incredible 84% of principals who then advertise those vacancies say not a single teacher applies for the jobs.  The consequence is that some Dublin schools seem likely to have to cut optional subjects.  Una Mullally pointed out in a recent article that a teacher starting out in a secondary school in Dublin will pay two thirds of his or her income on very modest accommodation.

We have the highest number of planning permissions in over a decade.  We have the highest number of completions in over a decade.  We have established a high-level housing delivery group.  Unfortunately, in the past two years we have been hit by Covid first, with two lockdowns, and now by a war on Ukraine, which is affecting commodity prices, in particular the prices of steel and timber, and, in turn, causing inflation.  House construction has gone down slightly, according to the May BNP-Paribas report, but the predominance of the decline was actually in other sectors, not housing.  We have increased the capacity of the industry in respect of skills, with a 40% increase in construction apprenticeships.  We have expanded the help-to-buy scheme and set up the new First Home shared equity scheme.  More than 1,000 people have already applied.  Deputies opposite attack such schemes, yet the people are voting with their feet in applying to them because they find them useful.<\/p>  <p>  We have introduced a new &euro;30,000 grant for vacant properties.  We have introduced a new subsidy to activate apartment building in city centres for owner-occupiers.  We have expanded the tenant purchase scheme to include pensioners.  We are building the first affordable homes in over a generation through the local authorities.  We have passed the first ever Affordable Housing Act.  We have revamped the Land Development Agency to focus on affordable homes and put the agency on a statutory basis.  We have put in place the first ever cost rental units in the history of the State.  We have banned co-living.  We have capped rent increases and strengthened tenants' protections.  We have enhanced the local authority home loan.  We have reduced interest rates for State-backed mortgages to make it easier for single people to avail of such mortgages.  We have launched the largest State-led social housing building programme ever.  We have slashed red tape with a new single-stage development approval process for outlays of up to &euro;6 million to accelerate social housing delivery.  We have expanded the repair and leasing scheme from 40,000 to 60,000 to bring vacant properties into use.  We have brought more than 6,000 voids back into use.  We have delivered in excess of 700 Housing First tenancies.  We have launched a new housing strategy for disabled people to run from 2022 to 2027.  We have provided &euro;81 million in funding for housing adaptation grants for older people.  We have established the national homeless action committee.  We have secured a local government rates waiver of more than &euro;1 billion to support local businesses and services.  We have launched &euro;1.3 billion in urban regeneration funding for towns and city centres, which will help house construction infrastructurally.  There is a &euro;50 million water investment scheme for rural towns and villages.  There is a &euro;61 million fire services capital programme.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a lot of action and work.  Objectively, no matter the views of Deputies opposite, they cannot dismiss the level of activity in the past two years.  Notwithstanding the Covid pandemic and the war, we will do everything we possibly can.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, in 2021 about 20,400 houses were built.  Some 12,600 of those were bought by households in the private sector; 5,200 were social housing.  Therefore, the social houses and households generally accounted for 87% of the total, with 2,600 classed as others.  Sometimes, listening to the debate in this House, one would imagine that the others accounted for the 87% instead of 2,600 and not realise the fact that the vast bulk of houses built last year went to private households or to social housing.  There has been a lack of balance in the narrative surrounding housing and in the debate, with the suggestion that this is all investment funds and so on.  It is not at all.  It is the same this year.  However, it suits politically and suits the sound bite environment in which we live in contemporary politics to create the narrative and the story that housing policy is limited to looking after vulture funds and so on, as Deputy Boyd Barrett and Deputy Murphy hammer out every day.  In fact, 87% of all housing completed last year went to a combination of private households and social households.  That is a fact.  We are looking at a similar situation in 2022.  We need balance and objectivity in the debate, which we are not getting.<\/p>  <p>  As for the issue in education, there is no doubt rents are too high.  We need more and more supply across the board.  By the way, the State is now the biggest actor in housing supply.  There is no question about that.  Deputy Boyd Barrett and Deputy Murphy can nod all they like.  Whether social housing, affordable housing through local authorities, cost rental or State involvement in respect of the First Home scheme, the State through the Government is the biggest actor in housing, not funds and not anybody else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300032#EE00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1657716600,"counter":277,"content":"<p>We pay; they profit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300032#EE00400","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1657716600,"counter":278,"content":"<p>This does not apply just to education but to anybody living and working in Dublin or in the major cities in respect of any profession.

Until we get supply to a really significant level, we will continue to be in difficulty here.  We will look at other measures, such as through tax measures, to alleviate the pressures people are under.  Pay in the private sector has gone up 10% over the past two years.  There is the public service pay deal the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform negotiated last year, Building Momentum.  A further negotiation has commenced and adjourned.  It is the Government's desire that we would have a pay deal with the public service and then, in the context of the budget, that we would have proposals on tax and social protection in parallel with a pay agreement.  Then, overall, we can help to alleviate the pressures on teachers and others working in the public service and in the private sector, also through tax measures.  Parallel with that, we would have a cost-of-living package that would focus on families and children and reduce the burden on them.  What the Government envisages providing now is an overall cost-of-living package that will be once-off and will be applied in this calendar year, before the end of the year, in order that people would have funding from that package and that the budget measures themselves would enable us to come through the winter and put in place more medium-term policies on childcare, spending on education and in all the various Departments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300032#EE00500","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657716600,"counter":279,"content":"<p>Is f&eacute;idir teacht ar Cheisteanna Scr&iacute;ofa ar www.oireachtas.ie.<br \/><br \/>Written Answers are published on the Oireachtas website.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Post-European Council Meeting: Statements","time":1657716600,"counter":280,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300032#EE00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1657716600,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I attended a meeting of the European Council on Thursday, 23 June, and Friday, 24 June, in Brussels.  The meeting was preceded by a meeting of European Union and western Balkans leaders, in which I also participated, and was followed by a meeting of the Euro summit, at which leaders were joined by the President of the ECB and the President of the Eurogroup.  It was the fifth meeting of the European Council since Russia began its full-scale war on Ukraine on 24 February.  We discussed a number of dimensions of the war - military, humanitarian and economic - and their impacts in Ukraine, across Europe and in the wider world.  We took the historic decision to grant European Union candidate status to Ukraine and to the Republic of Moldova, based on a thorough analysis and the positive recommendation of the European Commission.  As I said, we have received correspondence from President Zelenskyy thanking us for the proactive role Ireland played in that respect.  We agreed that we are ready to grant the status of candidate country to Georgia, once the priorities specified in the Commission's opinion have been addressed.<\/p>  <p>  We expressed our full and unequivocal commitment to the European Union perspective of the western Balkans and called for acceleration of the accession process.  We held a strategic discussion on the European Union's relations with its partners and neighbours in wider Europe and had an exchange of views on a proposal to launch what is called a European political community.  At the Euro summit we discussed economic issues, including rising energy prices and inflationary pressures and how we can work together to increase the resilience of our economies.  We took note of the proposals set out in the report on the outcome of the Conference of the Future of Europe submitted to the three co-presidents.  We also had a session on external relations issues focused on relations with Belarus and, separately, with Turkey.  In his contribution, the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will address the Conference on the Future of Europe and will provide further detail on the meeting of the Euro summit.  I will address all other issues.<\/p>  <p>  Before turning to the meetings in Brussels, at which the situation in Ukraine was top of our agenda, I wish to update the House on my recent visit to Ukraine on 6 July.<\/p> <p>I visited at the invitation of President Zelenskyy and I was honoured to be the first Taoiseach to pay an official visit to the country.  I was also glad to be able to visit in the wake of the decision of the European Council to grant Ukraine candidate status.  While in Ukraine, I visited the towns of Borodianka, Bucha and Irpin, which are in the northern part of the Kyiv region and which were occupied by Russian forces in March.  It was very clear to me that these are residential towns with no military or strategic significance in which civilians were attacked and killed.  Missiles were launched against what were clearly residential buildings, without any regard for human life.  I heard harrowing accounts from people who were there at the time and saw for myself the devastation caused to the built environment by Russia's bombardment.  It is plain to me, and to any reasonable person, that these are war crimes.<br\/><br\/>I visited an exhibition of artefacts and artworks of the war.  I laid a soft toy at a memorial in remembrance of the children killed in the war since February.  I also had the opportunity to visit an exhibition on the role played by rail workers in the evacuation of the people fleeing the war, largely women and children.  Throughout my visit, I was struck by the exceptional trauma that the war is visiting on the children of Ukraine.  Many have been killed or maimed.  Many have experienced the terror of bombings or have spent nights in dark, underground bunkers.  Many have had their loved ones killed, their families separated and their education disrupted, including those being welcomed into our schools.<br\/><br\/>I visited the national memorial to the Holodomor, Ukraine's catastrophic man-made famine in the 1930s, which has resonances with our own history of famine.  It was particularly poignant given Putin's despicable weaponisation of food in the current context.<br\/><br\/>I had the opportunity to have a meeting and working lunch with President Zelenskyy, and I heard directly from him about the critical security, humanitarian and economic challenges facing his country.  I expressed to him the full support and solidarity of the Irish people.<br\/><br\/>I congratulated President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people on achieving EU candidate status, which required significant work by them under the most difficult of circumstances.  President Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude for Ireland's strong support in achieving that outcome.  He was also very aware of and grateful for the generosity of the Irish people in hosting Ukrainians fleeing the war.  He naturally looked forward to their being able to return safely to their country and their homes as soon as possible.  We discussed plans for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war.  There is no doubt it will be a monumental task, requiring a global effort, given the destruction being wreaked by Russia.<br\/><br\/>Separately, I met Prime Minister Shmyhal, who briefed me on the recent Ukraine Recovery Conference, which he had co-hosted the previous day in Lugano, Switzerland, and which the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Fleming, attended on behalf of the Government.  President Zelenskyy recalled warmly having visited Ireland in a previous capacity, and I invited him to visit again once he is free to do so.  I expressed my strong hope that that day will come soon.<br\/><br\/>At its meeting on 23 June and 24 June, the European Council took the historic decision to grant the status of candidate country to Ukraine.  Every sovereign country has a right to determine its own future, free from external pressure and duress.  The people of Ukraine have chosen a future in the European Union and they deserve our full support.  I have long advocated this outcome.  The decision has provided a great boost to the people and government of Ukraine, who have stood firm in defence of democratic values in the face of the most appalling war being waged by Russia.  I told President Zelenskyy that Ireland will walk every step of the journey towards membership with Ukraine, providing whatever support and encouragement we can along the way.<br\/><br\/>As I have said previously, we know from our own experience that membership of the EU is transformative, and we are determined that others should be able to benefit from opportunities we have enjoyed.  On 23 and 24 June, we also agreed to support Ukraine via exceptional macro-financial assistance of up to &euro;9 billion to meet its immediate humanitarian and liquidity needs.  The funding mechanism for a &euro;1 billion tranche was subsequently agreed this month.  It is essential that we make the full funding available without delay.<br\/><br\/>Leaders also discussed the impact of Russia's war on third countries.  Russia is solely responsible for the shock to global food security it has provoked through its destruction and blockade of Ukrainian ports.  This has been affecting the least developed and most fragile countries.  The EU is assisting Ukraine to export agrifood commodities via different land routes and EU ports.  Discussions are ongoing between the UN and the government of Turkey to facilitate the safe shipping of grain from Ukraine's ports.  We must continue to work to ensure that the world's most vulnerable are not victims of Putin's war.<br\/><br\/>On sanctions, we said that work should continue to strengthen their implementation and prevent circumvention.  We called on all countries to align with EU sanctions, in particular EU candidate countries.  Discussions on a seventh sanctions package are now expected to get under way in Brussels next week.<br\/><br\/>At the meeting of the Council, leaders discussed a proposal for a European political community, open to EU members and also like-minded European countries currently outside the Union.  Importantly, we agreed that any European political community would not be intended as an alternative to either the enlargement process or ambitions of those seeking to join.  Our discussion was an initial exchange and I look forward to further discussions when we revert to this issue in the autumn.  We will next meet in Prague on 6 and 7 October.<br\/><br\/>Resolving the current slow rate of progress associated with the enlargement process in the Western Balkans, and the resulting disillusionment, is a priority for Ireland and a majority of member states.  At our meeting with Western Balkans leaders on 23 June, a number of them made clear their frustration at the slow pace of progress on their paths to EU accession.  Acknowledging this frustration, EU leaders expressed our full and unequivocal commitment to the EU membership perspective of the Western Balkans and called for the acceleration of the accession process.<br\/><br\/>In advance of the meeting, the French EU Presidency had made strenuous efforts in support of discussions between Bulgaria and North Macedonia, which it was hoped could unlock the door to accession negotiations for both North Macedonia and Albania.  There is a real opportunity now to resolve these issues and ensure a green light for the beginning of accession negotiations with both.  I welcome that, on 24 June, the Bulgarian Parliament voted to lift its veto on North Macedonia on certain conditions.  It is positive also that the North Macedonian Prime Minister, Mr. Kova\u010devski, has indicated that his government has given agreement for a revised proposal to go forward to the national assembly for approval.  I earnestly hope that all involved will do all they can to get this issue over the line.<br\/><br\/>We also welcomed the political agreement reached on 12 June 2022 by the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is needed for the stability and full functioning of the country and to respond to the aspirations of the people.  We will discuss Bosnia and Herzegovina again, including its application for candidate status, when we meet in the autumn.<br\/><br\/>The Council expressed deep concern over recent actions and statements by Turkey.  We are clear that Turkey must respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all member states.  I encourage Turkey to take positive steps in this regard.<br\/><br\/>The Council underlined the democratic right of the Belarusian people to have new, free and fair elections.  We called on the Belarusian authorities to uphold human rights, democracy and the rule of law, end repression and release political prisoners.  It is wholly unacceptable that the Lukashenko regime is abetting Russia's further invasion of Ukraine.  Ireland will continue to keep the issue of Belarus on the international agenda and support civil society and the opposition movement where we can.<br\/><br\/>We also discussed a range of economic issues and met in Euro Summit format, whereby we were briefed by the President of the European Central Bank, Ms Christine Lagarde, and the President of the Eurogroup, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, on the economic situation and outlook.  Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine is causing significant economic disruption and inflationary pressures that are being felt right across the Union.  Leaders at the meeting were very focused on the uncertain prospects for the autumn and winter ahead, not least on the possibility that Russia will restrict or even cease gas delivery.  All were agreed that the best approach to these challenges is a joint one, with member states continuing to work closely and co-operatively together, as we did on the pandemic.<\/p> <p>While economic prospects remain uncertain, with global growth slowing, inflationary pressures and continuing disruption to supply chains, leaders also acknowledged that the European economy remains strong.  EU leaders remain united in our determination to further strengthen the resilience of our economies and will continue co-ordinate our response to this crisis.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will further address economic issues, the Euro Summit and the Conference on the Future of Europe later in his wrap-up remarks.  I will continue to report to the House on discussions at the Council.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300032#EE00800","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657717800,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I welcome the decision by the EU to grant candidate country status to Ukraine and Moldova.

Every effort must be made by the international community at every available forum to end the targeting of civilians.  It is right and proper that all democratic states and institutions, including the EU, apply the necessary sanctions to help bring the conflict to an end at soon as possible and, if necessary, to build on existing sanctions to stop the Russian aggression.<\/p>  <p>  What reviews have been undertaken at EU level on the effectiveness of the sanctions?  What efforts are being taken to ensure public support for sanctions is maintained?  What measures is the Government taking to alleviate the financial impact of sanctions on the Irish people and to educate and inform our citizens of the purpose and impact of the sanctions?  This will become particularly important given it is generally accepted that Russia will attempt to leverage gas and fuel shortages and price increases over the coming winter to weaken the resolve of European nations.  It is important the Government uses its position as a member of the UN Security Council, and as a military non-aligned nation, to work with like-minded nations in an unsparing attempt to seek a peaceful resolution to this bloody and illegal conflict.<\/p>  <p>  Having given a commitment to take in 500 Ukrainian refugees who are in Moldova as far back as March of this year, at a time when Moldova was attempting to deal with the initial influx of hundreds of thousands fleeing the war zone, to date, the Government has taken in only a mere 19.  This is simply not good enough.  It fails Ireland's commitment to alleviate some of the pressure on the Moldovan authorities as they attempt to address a crisis unprecedented in its history.  The failure of the Government from the outset to co-ordinate its decision to accept refugees from Moldova or to lay out any clear timeline of its plan to do so speaks to a worrying level of \"ad hocery\" at the heart of the Government.<\/p>  <p>  Failure by the international community to address the international food crisis will lead to a humanitarian catastrophe.  The war in Ukraine has compounded the crippling impacts of climate change, regional conflict and the failure of the international community to fund initiatives such as the World Food Programme, the funding for which was decimated prior to the war in Ukraine.  President Michael D. Higgins has described the situation in the Horn of Africa as potentially the greatest humanitarian crisis since the Second World War.  Throughout parts of Africa and the Middle East there is huge dependency on Russia and Ukraine for grain and other food stuffs.  The continuing Russian blockade of Ukrainian ports has led to the weaponisation of food.  I welcome the response of the EU, which is establishing solidarity lanes to allow attempts to ship grain and other food supplies from Ukraine by road, rail and barge as alternatives to traditional shipping routes.  With the best will in the world these efforts will not come anywhere close to achieving the result required to transport the up to 25 million tonnes of grain locked in Ukraine.  These are badly needed to stave off disaster and it is critical that efforts continue to get the Black Sea ports open again.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the future of the Irish protocol and rebuilding relationships between Britain and the EU, few fair-minded individuals committed to a prosperous future for peoples throughout Europe will lament the political demise of Boris Johnson as British Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party.  Unfortunately, it has precipitated a race to the right among the majority of candidates now looking to replace him.  It is deeply concerning that whatever the origins of the political outlook of senior Tories, advancement in the party is predicated on approval from the keepers of the flame of Brexit in the European Research Group.  To all intents and purposes, we are now being forced to deal with what is fast becoming nothing more than an English nationalist party.  The best outcome we can hope for is the victory of the least worst candidate.  With growing Brexit fatigue among our colleagues in the EU, it is important that the Government works to keep the issue and importance of the Irish protocol and the peace process to the forefront of the minds of all EU leaders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300034#GG00200","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1657717800,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I was not present for the beginning of the debate because the transport committee had the news that Aer Lingus was refusing to come before it next week to deal with the issues we are all hearing about left, right and centre regarding cancelled flights.

People to whom I have spoken recently are trying to get whatever flights they can that are not operated by Aer Lingus.  It is an absolute disgrace on its part.

First, I wish to hear a little bit more about what exactly is understood by the European political community.  A preliminary discussion was had about it.  In the Council conclusions, such a community was described as an aim to &quot;foster political dialogue and cooperation to address issues of common interest so as to strengthen the security, stability and prosperity of the European continent&quot;.  It is a sort of response to the initial French view that there should be some sort of second tier of European Union, where people would not sign up to the <i>acquis<\/i><i>communautaire<\/i>or be subject to the institutions of Europe but would, somehow, be tied in to a broader concept of Europe.  It is a very nebulous thought right now and some of our fears of a two-tier Europe are still a cause for concern.  I ask the Minister of State to flesh out what he understands the political community to be and what his and Ireland's attitude is to how it might develop.<\/p><p>Second, our ongoing solidarity and the very strong solidarity of the European Union with the people of Ukraine are very important indeed and the preparation of a seventh package of sanctions is to be welcomed.  We have to understand, however, that it has consequences for us and those need to be spelled out and prepared for.  The issue of food security and the impact of the land-locking of Ukraine and its very significant world production of wheat, maize and sunflower seeds were discussed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs this morning, with the representatives of the European Commission.  It is quite clear that alternative paths are being looked at to export those products from Ukraine, but the capacity will be, at best, a fraction of what it is when the Black Sea ports are used.  I would be interested to hear exactly how the Minister of State thinks progress is being made with regard to opening the Black Sea ports.<\/p><p>I know the conclusions said that we were supporting the initiatives of the UN and Turkey in that regard, but unless we open channels of export from the Black Sea, barges or trains will not be able to replace anything approaching the production capacity of food from Ukraine.  Although we are assured that it will have no food impact on the Continent of Europe, it certainly will have an impact on east Africa, in particular, and on the Middle East.  We need to ensure that while we protect ourselves in terms of food security, it is not done to impact on world wheat or grain markets in a way that would impoverish or bring famine to other parts of the globe.<\/p><p>Third, I will raise the enlargement of the European Union.  Obviously, I warmly welcome the decision to give candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova.  We visited Moldova.  There is an understanding that this is not an instant process.  It is a slow process, but these countries wish to feel embraced and on track to be part of the European family and that they would be supported in developing their own systems to ensure that they measure up, if you like, to the standards we would expect of all EU member states, on a reasonable timeline.  Obviously, Georgia has its own set of problems but it too has to be embraced and not allowed, if you like, to drift away from the European family and be embraced by others.<\/p><p>The final point I will make is on the Western Balkans.  We cannot leave those countries, which have a real expectation of membership, leap-frogged or out of focus.  I hope that the Minister of State would give us a very clear timeline of his expectations for the Western Balkan countries to join the EU on a horizon that is within reach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300035#HH00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1657718400,"counter":288,"content":"<p>The Czech Presidency of the EU has listed five priority themes to be advanced over the coming six months; managing the refugee crisis and Ukraine's post-war recovery, energy security; strengthening Europe's defence capabilities and cyberspace security; strategic resilience of the European economy and resilience of democratic institutions.  As we know, Europe faces many challenges at this time.  Other global challenges include food security and the fact that millions of people, worldwide, are experiencing hunger and famine, as we speak.  Linked to this is the ongoing challenge of climate change.  If that was not enough, there is the prospect of a global recession caused by energy insecurity and inflation.<\/p>  <p>  Where to start in all of that?  I will begin on an issue closer to home, mainly that of the Northern Ireland protocol and the fact that there will be a new British Prime Minister by September, at the latest.  As we know, the legislation to set aside parts of the Northern Ireland protocol is still winding its way through the House of Commons.  The legislation, if enacted, will break international law.  It is also strongly supported by the outgoing Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, as well as members of the European Research Group within the Tory party.  The clear aims and objectives of the protocol are to avoid the creation of a hard border on the island of Ireland and, more generally, to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland peace process.  This legislation is a worry.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has suggested that the election of a new British Prime Minister is a chance to reset the relationship between Ireland and Britain.  He is, of course, being very diplomatic in his choice of words.  I intend to be equally diplomatic in my choice of words with regard to the fall of Boris Johnson.  Needless to say, the election of a new leader of the Tory party is entirely a matter for the membership of that party and we should certainly not try to influence its decision in any way, even if we could.  However, I hope, in earnest, that the next British Prime Minister will adopt a sensible and open approach to future negotiations within the EU, that he or she will commit to implementing the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and will restore trust, generally, and respect for international law.<\/p>  <p>  I will also draw attention to the remarkable solidarity shown to Ireland by fellow EU member states on the protocol issue.  Most recently, the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, and the German foreign minister articulated strong support for the Irish position, which is greatly appreciated.  I am sure our EU colleagues have much on their minds and wish that the problem would go away, but they have stuck with us on it, for which we are grateful.<\/p> <p> I also wish to say a few words on the Conference on the Future of Europe.  This was a major exercise, which was brought to a conclusion on 9 May under the French Presidency.  Of the 320 recommendations it produced, most can be implemented over time by the various institutions but there are three areas where treaty change would be required.  These are making health a shared competence, switching from unanimity to qualified majority voting and increasing the powers of the European Parliament.  It is unlikely anything involving treaty change arising from the conference will be followed up on.  I do not believe we in Ireland are ready for a referendum on these matters just now, although I note the Taoiseach's point that we should have an open mind on treaty change as part of this process and have regard to making health a shared competence, for example.<\/p> <p> On unanimity versus qualified majority voting, it would be better for the EU to try to reach consensus on the various issues and alleviate any concerns member states may have.  Compromise will always be required in politics and democracy must be respected.  I understand there will be a detailed assessment of all the recommendations the conference made and this will involve all relevant Departments and will be overseen by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I hope the Minister of State will keep the House briefed on this assessment and fully briefed on that process generally.<\/p> <p> Then there is the issue of enlargement of the EU, which Members have spoken about already.  Ireland supports enlargement of the EU as a general principle.  Our membership of the EU has been transformative over the past 50 years.  Future enlargement will bring about further peace and stability in the various regions.  The decision to grant candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova is greatly welcomed, having regard to the new geopolitical realities following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but we should all support the other states waiting at the door, especially the western Balkan countries of North Macedonia, Albania, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo, as well as Georgia, which was not given candidate status with Ukraine and Moldova.  Instead, it was granted potential candidate status and asked to deal with 12 key priority areas of reform, including addressing political polarisation and implementing commitments on \"de-oligarchisation\", which is a new word.  On a recent visit to Georgia as part of a delegation from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, I found there was disappointment with the decision of the Commission and Council.  Equally, there was a determination to press ahead with the necessary reforms, provided they can be clarified and quantified in a practical way.  On the 12 recommendations, there was a little confusion about how some of these can be clarified and quantified.  I refer, for example, to addressing political polarisation.  We have seen polarisation in this House.  We have certainly seen polarisation on Capitol Hill.  Perhaps polarisation will be part and parcel of politics in future.  In any event, I wish Georgia well in its endeavours and hope it will not have too long to wait for its final accession the EU.<\/p> <p> The House will be aware there is currently a severe famine in east Africa, specifically in the Horn of Africa.  It is mainly affecting three countries, namely, Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya where more than 23 million people are experiencing extreme hunger.  These countries have now had their fourth successive dry rainy season.  The UN has stated &euro;4.2 billion is needed to prevent a humanitarian disaster in the region.  D&oacute;chas has made a number of recommendations in this regard in its 2023 pre-budget submission, including the need to increase Irish aid, but it is clear a global response is now needed.  These countries experienced a similar humanitarian disaster in 2011 and the world promised at that time it would not happen again.  It is happening again and the world must act.  I hope Ireland will be to the forefront, through its membership of the EU and the UN Security Council, in awakening the global community to this catastrophe and calling for appropriate action to be taken before it is too late.  Again, Russia is also contributing to that problem through its blockade of Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea.  The UN must be encouraged to try to get the wheat, maize and sunflower oil out and exported so these countries do not suffer the humanitarian crisis we all fear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300035#HH00300","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657719000,"counter":290,"content":"<p>The European Council again discussed ways to curb energy prices.  Gas is now five times the price it was a year ago, which is a threat to households and the wider economy.  The impact on small businesses is also ferocious.  One of our local shops has been landed with a &euro;4,200 electricity bill.  This is despite its operators doing everything possible to reduce it, for example, switching off fridges and lights and taking every measure they can just to stay in business.  The nearest shop to that one is 15 miles away.  Another supermarket has seen its bills increase from &euro;3,000 to &euro;9,000.  I raise this matter because a recently-produced national energy security framework estimates that electricity costs will have increased by between 45% and 60% above 2021 levels later this year.  That would mean a &euro;700 increase per household.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is not doing enough to address the crisis.  We are sleepwalking towards a winter where people will really struggle.  We have no gas storage in this State, which is hard to believe.  We have underinvested in our electricity grid and we have an electricity pricing system that allows gas to set the price of all electricity, despite the fact that almost half the electricity generated here comes from wind.  The price of gas has increased fivefold, as I said, but why are we paying more for wind-generated electricity?  In the past year, I have raised the need to examine the EU-prescribed system for pricing electricity with the Minister of State, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Taoiseach.  We need to reform the system as we enter an era of even higher prices.  Even the President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the market system no longer works and we must reform and adapt it to the new realities.  Spain and Portugal have already introduced a price cap on gas for power generation to try to address this problem.<\/p>  <p>  If we are to have gas prices at five times the 2021 level for a sustained period, we need to look seriously at how we price renewable electricity.  We need to urgently examine all options for reducing the price of electricity for households and small businesses.  I keep raising this subject because we need a more robust response in Europe.  There is more we can do to address the structures there.  There is no reason whatever that gas should set electricity prices when so much electricity us produced from renewables.  It does not make sense when it is the small businesses I mentioned and households that are really suffering.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to also address the issue of those who have provided services and accommodation to the local authorities for our Ukrainian refugees.  There seems to be a block in the system as payments are not being made.  Small businesses in particular cannot sustain the credit facility they have provided.  There is a block somewhere and I would appreciate it if the Minister of State examined the matter to free up the blockage so the local authorities can get this money and distribute it to the providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300036#JJ00200","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1657719000,"counter":291,"content":"<p>Some of the points I intended raising have already been made so I will stick to those that have not been raised.  On the issue of accession to the EU, we welcome the decision to grant candidacy status to both Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova, as discussed at the most recent European Council meeting.  However, it would be remiss of me not to speak about Georgia in great detail, as many other Deputies have done.  One point that has not been made is that Georgia has paid a massive price already for its aspiration to become part of the EU.<\/p> <p>The country was partially invaded by Russia in 2008 and is still occupied by Russia.  The West turned its back.  There were protests on the streets of Georgia in June by citizens who simply want to be part of the EU.  I appreciate that there are steps to be taken to become a member of the European family but I do not think we can simply ask countries to implement 12 recommendations, particularly when some of them are extraordinarily difficult to measure.  We cannot ask them to wait outside until such time as we deem them suitable to join.<br\/><br\/>Ireland has a role to play in this regard.  Georgia is a small country of just over 4 million people.  It is similar in size to Ireland.  A couple of thousand Georgians live in Ireland, some of whom are constituents of mine.  I have Georgian friends.  We have a part to play in helping Georgia into the European family.  It also shares a land border with Russia and is partially occupied by Russia.  Thousands of Georgians have been murdered and tortured by Russia.  We cannot simply say we will bring Moldova into the European Union and accept Ukraine as a member, and rightly so, but we are not yet ready to admit Georgia.  Leaving Georgia isolated presents dangers and has implications.  It could potentially diminish that aspiration to join the European family.  We need to be more engaged with Georgia.<br\/><br\/>I will move on to consider inflation, energy and security costs.  We all know the war has far-reaching consequences.  Ireland now finds itself facing the highest levels of inflation in almost 40 years.  It was forecast that inflation would peak at 8.5% this year but EUROSTAT estimates a figure nearer the 10% mark.  It is clear that inflation will continue to rise in the short to medium term and the cost-of-living crisis will worsen.  Sanctions have rightfully been placed on Russia.  The European Union needs to intervene to ensure those sanctions are not felt in the stomachs of people all over Europe and Ireland, and that people do not experience cold.<br\/><br\/>The point I want to make is on migration policy.  The unified approach taken across the European Union and the willingness to provide safety and support to all those fleeing Ukraine have been nothing short of extraordinary.  This is the largest movement of people since the Second World War, with some 14 million people being forced to leave to date.  The EU acted quickly to implement the temporary protection directive, which has granted temporary protection status to almost 3.4 million people so far.  This provides access to the EU labour market, accommodation, social welfare assistance and medical care, as well as education.  It is right to do that.  However, this could not be any more different from the approach that has been taken in respect of other countries, such as Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Myanmar, whose people were forced to flee atrocities that no human should ever have to witness.<br\/><br\/>In 2015, approximately 1.5 million Syrian refugees fled to Europe as a result of an horrific civil war.  By 2021, more than 2 million Afghani refugees had fled to neighbouring countries.  Once the West pulled out of Afghanistan, at least 500,000 more people fled the country in just a few months.  Climate change is also beginning to bite in terms of migration patterns.  Climate change is contributing to desertification, extreme weather events and rising sea levels.  Deputies will agree that a perfect storm is now upon us.  I could give many more examples but I am conscious of time.<br\/><br\/>In June, the Committee of Permanent Representatives adopted a number of first stage texts under the pact on migration and asylum.  These will seek to commit EU countries to a &quot;voluntary, simple and predictable solidarity mechanism&quot;.  Oxfam is just one organisation that has been clear in its opposition to this.  It has stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tIt allows EU countries to continue to shirk their responsibility towards refugees and leave countries at the EU&rsquo;s borders to manage Europe&rsquo;s refugee response [or the lack thereof].  As past years have shown, the result will be overwhelmed reception and asylum systems, overcrowded camps filled with people left in limbo and more pushbacks at Europe&rsquo;s borders.  Apart from being temporary and voluntary, the proposal allows EU countries to cherry-pick their asylum seekers.  It also allows them to turn away asylum-seekers and, instead, pay for a Fortress Europe by footing the bill for border surveillance and detention centers. <\/blockquote> <p>What is the Irish position in respect of this policy?  Are we one of the 21 member states that have adopted the declaration of solidarity?  Are we in favour of warmly welcoming refugees, as we should, while agreeing to turn back others?  I am sure there is no rational justification for the difference in treatment of African and Arab refugees and asylum seekers compared with those fleeing from wars close to our borders.  How does the EU continue to justify this approach?  I hope we can challenge that and assume a leadership role in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300036#JJ00300","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657719600,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive update on what was discussed at the European Council.

That is not a term to be used lightly but it is an assessment with which I fully agree.  It is good that international organisations are being tasked with getting to the bottom of that.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Brady referred to the artillery war that is being waged in Ukraine but, of course, it is much more and much broader than that.  We are seeing the weaponisation of human misery.  We are seeing that directly expressed in Ukraine with the indiscriminate targeting of civilian populations, as the Taoiseach said, and places that had absolutely no military or strategic outcome whatsoever.  That approach saw sickening expression in the forced relocation of Ukrainian children across the border into Russia.  The Taoiseach spoke more widely about the impact of that on the childhood of a generation of children.  We see it in our own country but the most egregious possible example is forced relocation.<\/p>  <p>  In Europe, we are seeing human relocation and displacement being weaponised.

Deputy Boyd Barrett's glib commentary in the face of what is unfolding in the Horn of Africa is misplaced.  We are seeing human misery unfolding at an unprecedented level.  I am being told by people who are experts in the area, including representatives of Oxfam and D&oacute;chas, that this is dwarfing the unthinkable situation that occurred in 2011.  We said we would not allow that to happen ever again, yet 11 years later the situation is worse.  We know that is also the result of climate change and the absence of rain for four years.  We also know it is the result of deliberate policy.  I do not think this is incidental; it is intentional.  The Taoiseach referenced the Holodomor, which was a human-created famine in Ukraine.  We are seeing another human-created famine now as a result of the implications of climate change and the blockading of the ports.  The latter has meant that many people who are reliant on Russia and Ukraine will not be able to avail of food exported from those countries.  That issue has been outlined by other Deputies, including by Deputy Haughey in some detail.  Some 23 million people in just three countries, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya, are being exposed to crisis levels of hunger.<\/p> <p>It is an unthinkable level of hunger.  We are seeing livestock, which are people&rsquo;s entire way of life, being wiped out and decimated.  Looking at the reasoning behind it, the director-general of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, delved into this a little when he stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tMany people are already starving or food insecure and are increasingly on the move in search of food and pastures...  I am deeply concerned about the impact this will have not only on health but on overall national and regional security. <\/blockquote> <p>As I said, I do not think this is incidental.  I think it is intentional and aimed at creating instability within Europe through energy costs and instability worldwide through food costs.  It is the weaponisation of human misery.  It poses a challenge to us, as a small country, with respect to what we can do about that in an international context.  First, we have to support in every way we can the development of those solidarity lanes, notwithstanding Deputy Howlin's point that this can only provide a fraction of the capacity that sea transportation can.  I very much support the ongoing UN initiative with Turkey to leave no stone unturned in seeking to reopen the sea routes because nothing else will provide the export capacity we need.<br\/><br\/>In the longer term, we need to look at energy and food security within Europe and domestically.  Deputy Conway-Walsh mentioned that our renewables are increasingly coming on stream.  We know generation is intermittent and we need to build baseline capacity so that we integrate renewables into our system in a more coherent way that will allow us to move further away from fossil fuel sources.<br\/><br\/>We also need to think about root-and-branch restructuring of our agricultural systems.  Is it right for us to import fodder when we know people across the world are dying as a result of a lack of grain?  In that context, do we need to review our agricultural systems?  We need to continuously push on the development of a loss and damage facility.  Ireland is at the forefront on that.  Some headway was made at COP26 but the issue needs to be revisited in COP27, which will be held in an African country.  I hope that will bring more focus to bear on a loss and damage facility.  <br\/><br\/>The Taoiseach gave firm commitments on climate financing but we need to build capacity within our own system to deliver on that expansion in capacity he promised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300037#KK00800","speaker":"1617","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657720200,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words on the latest European Council meeting.  It is welcome to see the continuation of support for Ukraine in light of the despicable war brought about by the aggression of Russia.  We have done much in this country to play our part in offering safety to the many Ukrainians who have been forced to flee their country.  As a neutral country, nothing less could be countenanced.  We must remember that given the influence the Russian war of aggression is having in the discussion at European level.  Granted, we are in a new world, one that is much different from our world before the illegal invasion of Ukraine.  Security, both in domestic EU terms and global terms, is to the forefront of our minds.  The European Union now has a war on its doorstep that threatens its borders and integrity.<\/p>  <p>  The war has led to much talked about military spending.  We must ensure our traditional stance as a neutral country is not diluted by this focus on military spending or used as a means to interfere by those in this House who would wish to see neutrality scrapped.  Throughout this, we must remember who we are and what we stand for.  We stand with Ukraine and the EU and we also stand for neutrality. <\/p>  <p>  Another weapon of war, one which was mentioned at the Council meeting, is food.  The actions of Russia have had profound impacts on global food security and these will be further concentrated as time goes on.  This is where the EU should come into its own and back up its words with actions.  I am referring to giving assistance to countries to manage their food supply chains and develop sustainable food production in countries that are least prepared or able to adjust as quickly as may be necessary.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen the impact the war has had in this country.  Our farmers see it as they face increased fertiliser, grain and fuel costs.  This is having an impact on the sector and farmers will struggle to keep their heads above water.  They must be assisted.  However, for developing countries, the challenge is more acute.  This must be recognised in more than words; it must be acknowledged through actions.<\/p>  <p>  Consumers must also be assisted, especially those in most need.  Sinn F&eacute;in has called for an emergency budget, and while our calls were ignored, the challenges facing the old, infirm have not become less, nor are they confined to our own backyard.<\/p>  <p>  Traditionally, there are those who capitalise on misfortune.  These can be warlords who create man-made famines by restricting emergency food supplies or countries that are ready to capitalise on the desperation of others.  We must be mindful of all these factors and act accordingly.  This must also be borne in mind when considering proposals for the restructuring of Ukraine.  I ask the Minister to ensure we do not allow this war to become an opportunity to further influence and we must not enable others to do so either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300038#LL00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1657720200,"counter":302,"content":"<p>When I refer to murderous military aggression, illegal occupation, destruction of homes and key infrastructure, crimes against humanity and war crimes, what country am I talking about?  Is it Palestine or Ukraine?  Of course, the answer is that it is both.  This Government is more than willing to do something to condemn and take actions to deal with illegal occupation, murderous unjustified military violence, destruction of infrastructure and homes and the killing of civilians when it comes to one of those places, but is willing to do absolutely nothing when it comes to them being done in another one of those places, namely, Palestine.<\/p>  <p>  I find that, frankly, nauseating.  The latest example of it is a letter from a constituent I got.  I will not identify the person.  Her son was born in Ireland and is an Irish citizen, while his father is Palestinian.  The child&rsquo;s father cannot leave Palestine and be with the child&rsquo;s mother and his son.  The son has an Irish passport and was born in Ireland but also has Palestinian identity.  When he goes to Israel, his Irish passport is not accepted.  That is apartheid.  He is an Irish EU citizen but Israel does not care.  It held him and his mother, a mother of an Irish child with a Palestinian passport, for hours, subjecting both to humiliating interrogation and so on.  Israel does not recognise the Irish passport of the child.  When he reaches the age of 16, he will never be allowed to Jerusalem, where his family lives, and will not be allowed into Ben Gurion Airport or to travel anywhere outside specified areas in the West Bank.<\/p>  <p>  That child&rsquo;s cousin who lives in Jerusalem was recently picked up by the Israelis on Israeli nationalist flag day on Jaffa Street, where and a dozen other children were just gathering on the street and doing nothing.  He was arrested and taken to the police station where he was blindfolded and his hands and feet bound tightly with metal cuffs.  He was then brought to an area of the station with no cameras and beaten all over his body by six heavily armed soldiers.  They beat him with their fists and M16 rifles on his hand and back in an area where there were no cameras, knowing that he could not defend himself.  After that, he was put in a windowless cell for six days, where he was not allowed to contact his parents or a lawyer.  His mother had no idea where he was.  He asked for a blanket because he was so cold but he was denied it.  Another child prisoner from Nablus lent him one to keep him warm.  On the last day, he was due to attend court and the television was turned on in his cell.  On it were videos and images of other Palestinian detainees screaming and being tortured.  This was a deliberate psychological tactic to traumatise the young men.  He was then taken to court.  When he looked at his parents who were in the court he was beaten again for doing so.  I could go on but I do not have time.<\/p>  <p>  The father of the Irish-born EU citizen is also Palestinian.<\/p> <p>This is what happened to him when he was arrested and interrogated by the police when he was 16 years old:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe interrogation was one of the most difficult times in my life.  The Israeli interrogators tortured me and it affected my education because it affected my mind and my psychological state.  It was a really bad time.  I was tied to a small chair.  I fainted ... they put their fingers on my neck as if to strangle me.  I think they studied [the art of] how to hurt someone until they [thought they] are almost going to die.  They hit me in my private area with their legs and batons.  They did it slowly and then finished with a big kick. [...] They put pencils between my fingers and squeezed them tight.  They threatened to rape my Mom and sister. <\/blockquote> <p>I could go on.  That is how the father of a Palestinian-Irish boy who is an Irish citizen and was born in Ireland was treated.  That is how his nephew was treated.  All those Israelis can come here without a visa but Palestinian families cannot even meet their own family members and this is what they have to put up with.  There are 1,200 children in Israeli prisons but the Government does nothing.  How are we honestly expected to believe that the Government or the European Union really care about brutal and unjustified aggression against innocent people when they allow this to happen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300038#LL00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657720800,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the most recent meeting of the European Council.  I am grateful to the Taoiseach for his report on the meeting.  There is much to cover, as there always is with these Council meetings.  I suspect all Members could make different speeches on different topics relating to the meeting.  There are three issues on which I will offer my thoughts.  The Minister of State may wish to respond on some of my questions.<\/p>  <p>  The first issue relates to the notion of a European political community that was floated at the Council meeting and will be reflected on in more detail in Prague in October.  This is a matter on which President Macron, following his re-election in France, has put much focus.  It has garnered a certain amount of attention in respect of who it would attract and how it is not an alternative to the accession process for the many countries that aspire to be a member state of the European Union.  I note that today is the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the European Coal and Steel Community, the body that kicked off what we now know as the European Union.  It is understandable that so many countries want to become a member state but I have always believed there has to be something more than applicant status.  Unfortunately, there is a tendency to leave countries as applicants for far too long.  They are left in limbo.  The European political community offers an opportunity for countries that may not know their way or may never be fully in line with the Copenhagen criteria.<\/p>  <p>  Reference is made to countries that are in the neighbourhood.  Obviously, the country with which the EU has the closest relationship is the only country that, sadly, has left the EU, namely, the United Kingdom.  That brings me to the serious concern in respect of the protocol-busting Brexit-type Bill that is going through Westminster today for its Third Reading.  It has been wrapped up in the internal wranglings of a Conservative Party leadership election in which all the candidates, regardless of whether they are for remain or for leave, are threatening to get a better deal to get Brexit done, make it work and unleash a cavalcade of opportunities.  It is all nonsense.  None of them has said they will uphold their responsibilities to international law, be that to the Brexit withdrawal agreement or to the tenets of the Good Friday Agreement.  What reply is the European Council preparing for when a new British Prime Minister forces that legislation through the House of Commons and enacts legislation that will break international law and be in breach of the withdrawal agreement?  That has to be met with a realistic response.  All present want a negotiated solution to this and we all want good relations but it cannot be one-way traffic.<\/p>  <p>  As regards Ukraine, there has been reference to the importance of the sixth round of sanctions.  It is clear that the six rounds have not worked, however.  They have not crippled the Russian regime to an extent where it has had to cancel this war and withdraw its troops.  When can we expect a seventh round of sanctions?  What can we expect that to include?  More important, what is the European Union going to do?  What will it ask of third-party countries with which it has extremely close relationships but which simply do not view this war in the same way that we in the EU do?  These are countries that are more than happy to continue to do business as normal with the brutal regime in Moscow.<\/p>  <p>  The need for reconstruction has previously been discussed in the House but we are still seeing an unadulterated campaign of disinformation and misinformation.  That has been evident in the past couple of days, with the Russian ambassador to this country saying the most false and vile things about the visit of the Taoiseach to Kyiv but also, more generally, about Russia's vicious war.  Will the Government please look once again at not just expelling the current Russian ambassador but also closing down the Russian Embassy?  It is located on Orwell Road, in my constituency of Dublin Rathdown.  This is increasingly becoming a practical issue at constituency level.  Residents and constituents in the area are extremely concerned at what is going on in their near neighbourhood as well as the attention it is attracting.  The simple solution to this is expulsion.  It is long past time for that to be done.  We have seen what happened in Lithuania and Bulgaria.  There is precedent across the European Union for such measures.<\/p>  <p>  The final issue I wish to address did not receive massive attention at the European Council and probably will not receive much attention in this debate.  It relates to the Conference on the Future of Europe.  The Minister of State was a delegate to the conference as part of the European Council, while I was a delegate on behalf of the Oireachtas, along with Deputies &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Niamh Smyth and Senator Higgins.  As the Minister of State may recall, the findings were much celebrated.  The conference served a useful purpose as an exercise in engaging European citizens on key issues but, to be honest, it is just a publicity or public relations exercise if the recommendations are not considered seriously and appropriately acted on.  There is a recommendation for treaty change.  It refers more pertinently to the health aspect and the competency of health within the European Union.  Having come through the plenary sessions of the conference, the Minister of State, in his initial briefing to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, stated the Government would not necessarily be in favour of treaty change.  Has that changed?  Is the Government open to the prospect of European treaty change?  Is it still against that or does it have an open mind?  Is it something that it favours?  We should not fear treaty change.  I appreciate Ireland is the only member state that would be compelled to have a referendum on such a change, but doing so would not be a problem.  Let us have the referendum.  Let us have a frank and robust discussion.  Let us make it about the issues that are up for discussion rather than, as happened in previous referendums, the discussion going off on tangents to areas not specifically relevant to the vote.  We should not be fearful of treaty change.<\/p>  <p>  The conference made recommendations that reflected the current situation for the European Union.  There were recommendations for the EU to do things it is already doing  They were not necessarily recommendations to do them better.  Unfortunately, there was a lack of information provided.  The European Commission is brilliant at paying people to give out about it.  It paid Nigel Farage a salary for a couple of decades.  Perhaps it needs to do more to get into communities and show people what the work of the European Union is.  The EU can be an easy punching bag on which certain individuals can rely domestically when needs be.  The conference showed that, unfortunately, there is an element of disconnect between politics at European and member state levels and, more important, local and regional levels.<\/p>  <p>  One of the things I found disappointing about the conference was that the discussion on the Friday and Saturday and the plenary session was simply a repeat of the discussion that had previously taken place in plenary week of the European Parliament.  Unfortunately, that discussion was often removed from the issues at hand.  It was caught up in internal EU debates, such as the power struggle between various European institutions or existing European legislation that was stuck at a trilogue stage, rather than discussing the recommendations and reflections of the citizens' panels that were brought together at great inconvenience, given that most of this was done at the height of the pandemic, but also at great cost.  Their opinions needed to be heard and debated in good faith.  The challenge now is for the European Council to act on that, to have the convention and see what needs to come of it.  The conference was a worthwhile exercise and it should be repeated every five or ten years if needs be, but there is no point doing it unless it is followed up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300039#MM00200","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1657720800,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  Last month, on statements in advance of the European Council meeting, I raised my deep concerns in respect of the recent trip of Ursula von der Leyen to Israel and her praise of the apartheid system that openly operates there.  The message the President of the European Commission delivered was clear for all to see.  For increased energy co-operation, the EU is willing to see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil.  Unfortunately, Ireland is complicit in that policy approach.  The Minister has stated in the House that Ireland will not break away from the consensus within the European Union.<\/p>  <p>The consensus within the European Union seems to be \"see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\", so Israel can do what it wants, when it wants and there will be no repercussions.  We have often spoken here about Ireland's commitment to Palestine over the years.  Irish Aid, along with other EU partners, has worked on so many projects that have had a profound impact on the daily lives of thousands of Palestinians.  I have worked in Palestine, in the Gaza Strip.  It has always been a source of great pride to me to see various villages around the Gaza Strip with signage showing that various projects have been supported by Irish Aid and by the Irish State.<\/p> <p> That is why I find it disturbing to see images of what is now happening and what is being allowed to happen in the Masafer Yatta area, to see, the week after Ursula von der Leyen's visit, the Israeli Government announcing plans to demolish more villages such as Khallet ad-Dhabe.  These are villages whose infrastructure was supported by Irish Aid and EU humanitarian aid funds.  An EU sign in the village reads \"Humanitarian Support to Protect Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem From Forced Transfer\".  The apartheid state of Israel has designated a part of Masafer Yatta, including this village, as a firing zone.  Approximately 20% of the West Bank has been designated by the Israelis as a firing zone.  This is going to have a devastating impact on more than 5,000 Palestinians from 38 different communities.  What is the EU doing to protect these Palestinians, many of whom are living in villages supported by Irish and EU aid?  We need to see the European Council, Ireland, and the Minister of State himself standing up to Israel and saying it cannot keep destroying the investments that Ireland has put into Palestinian communities.  That is what is happening.  When will Ireland stand up and say Israel cannot keep carrying out apartheid, cannot keep destroying investments that Ireland has made in Palestine?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300039#MM00300","speaker":"1555","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657721400,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the Taoiseach's update on his recent trip to Ukraine.  It was important that visit went ahead.  He got to see how bad things are out there and how much assistance will be required by Ukraine, in particular during the reconstruction phase.  I also welcome the opportunity to comment on the outcome of the recent European Council summit on 23 and 24 June in Brussels.  I agree with most of the recommendations and minutes, especially in regard to welcoming Ukraine and Moldova and granting them status as accession countries to the European Union.  That is a good thing.  I also welcome the fact it has been extended to Georgia as well once certain conditions have been met.  That is a positive development.  I note the Irish embassy in Ukraine is back up and running - that is my understanding - but I do not believe we have anyone in Moldova.  We only have a consulate that is run from Romania.  If we are genuinely interested in guiding Moldova through the accession process, this might be worth considering into the future.  I would certainly be in favour of that.  The current caretaker Prime Minister of the UK would be of the view that the EU is the devil incarnate, but obviously the EU is doing something right if so many countries, particularly in eastern Europe and the Balkans, are keen to join.<\/p>  <p>  It is only right the Russian war in Ukraine was mentioned a good deal at the conference.  That is appropriate.  I agree with the EU's call for a cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of Russian troops.  There is little chance of that happening.  I note with concern its view on the multiple reports of abduction and forced relocation of children from Ukraine.  That is very concerning.  I also agree with the condemnation of the deliberate targeting by Russia of civilian infrastructure and civilians.  This is totally unacceptable.  I welcome the sixth package of sanctions.  I look forward to the seventh package but there needs to be more focus on the implementation aspect.  I welcome the call for more military, humanitarian, economic and financial support for Ukraine.  It has an inherent right to self-defence in this scenario.  It is obvious who the aggressor is.  We certainly should offer any support we can.  The extra &euro;9 billion will make a difference.  That is certainly something to which we should contribute.<\/p>  <p>  The food security issue, especially in the port of Odessa has been mentioned other Deputies already, in particular Deputy Howlin.  We have a great tradition in this House of commenting on matters that have already occurred.  I hope that over the summer there will be some international operation, negotiated in advance, and I believe the UN Secretary General is working on this at the moment involving Russia, Ukraine and perhaps Turkey, to get as much grain as possible out of Odessa through the Black Sea.  Mines will have to be moved, merchant shipping made available and perhaps Russian or Turkish naval assets might be used to secure a corridor.  I agree with the proposal to move as much grain as possible over land via rail and road, but as Deputy Howlin said, there is not the capacity to move everything, so we have to look at a freighter option from a maritime perspective as well.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the energy crisis, I do not need to tell anyone here how bad the energy crisis is, even in Ireland, but there was mention in the minutes of how the EU could explore options with its international partners to curb prices.  I would be in favour of that.  Specific mention was made of a temporary import price cap.  I agree with the principle and it sounds right, but I am not sure how that would play out or what it would look like.  If the Minister of State could elaborate on that in his closing remarks, that would be very much appreciated.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, I welcome the outcome of the summit and look forward to the next one in October in Prague.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300040#NN00200","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1657721400,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I too am glad to speak on this.

The Taoiseach practically ignored me, but then I asked him a second time he said no, neutrality was never mentioned.  Our neutrality is being undermined daily and sidelined, with warships coming into the Port of Cork.  There were two recently: one British and one Canadian.<\/p>  <p>  I am also intrigued and concerned about another issue.  Farmers are harvesting now, the weather is great, thankfully, and they have a fine, promising crop.  Almost a thousand tonnes of corn was imported from Russia in recent weeks - from Russia - when we have sanctions against it.  What kind of games are being played with the people?  It will drive down the price for the co-operatives when buying the farmers' produce.  There are games going on here.  We are being told there are sanctions and we cannot import, yet this came in.  It was actually 2 tonnes short of a thousand tonnes in shiploads of grain.  Who is fooling who?  There is awful suffering going on in Ukraine - we know that - and it is an awful, horrendous and horrific war -do not let me be accused of anything unfair in that regard - but we are ignoring plight, war and persecution in many parts of the world.

Even the Green Party coalition in Germany is preparing to reopen coal plants while other governments have moved to cut energy taxes.  In Ireland, our Government has remained the outlier, doing either nothing or much too little.  Even Frans Timmermans, the second most senior official in the EU, as Executive Vice-President of the European Commission, has now issued a stark warning to EU governments that helping citizens with the record energy and food costs in each member state must take precedence over the climate crisis.  It certainly will not in Ireland.  That comes first and foremost.  Let Paddy and Mary starve on the side of the road or rob them with carbon tax penalties and VAT on fuel but do not help them in any way, shape or form.  This warning comes as the European Commission Executive Vice-President stated that the threat of unrest this winter due to the cost-of-living crisis must be taken seriously by governments.  Therefore it appears that everyone, even unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, is recommending that governments like the Irish one act as such.<\/p> <p>When will the Government wake up and some long-overdue action be taken?  The EU Commission is warning that Europe is in danger of highly damaging strong conflict and strife this winter over high energy prices and that member state Governments should make a short-term return to fossil fuels to head off the threat of civil unrest.

Up until then, most Irish people were benignly supportive of the EU and thinking in terms of CAP, European funds etc.  In the past five years, there is greater recognition of the role of the EU in global affairs, whether it is the war in Ukraine, reining in the tech companies, tax justice, energy or food security, because those issues are now top priority for everybody.  In that context, we are maturing as a country in our relationship with the EU.  That is good because we can then look at the realities, the benefits and the challenges of EU membership.  It also helps to prevent misinformation spreading about EU policy.  On too many occasions, I have heard politicians take a specific issue and twist it into something unrecognisable just for their own narrow political purposes.<\/p>  <p>  The EU makes many mistakes.  It gets stuff wrong, but there is a greater sense that this is now our community and it will help us to navigate a number of global threats.<\/p>  <p>  Speaking of global threats, obviously, food and energy security top the list.  As Deputy Howlin said, we had a good discussion today on food security at the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  A number of the Council proposals I agree with, but it was pointed out that land-based transport not only will perhaps deliver 50% of what we need but there will obviously be greater costs there.  The significant increase in the cost of the importation of fertilisers was raised and that certainly is a matter that needs action from Government.<\/p>  <p>  Everybody is worried about energy security and the cost of energy.

No doubt the European Council has a considerable impact on our lives.  It will be interesting to see how that impact will increase over the years to come.  I wish I had Deputy Harkin's confidence in what Europe will do in terms of Ireland and that we should be looking out for and happy with what they will do.  Unfortunately, I do not believe that we should.  Even when it comes to Brexit, for instance, in terms of the fishing community, we saw that Europe looked after the French fishing communities but shafted ours in the negotiations.  That was partly our own fault because the Minister did not bother even talking to the European negotiators in relation to it in the run-up to Brexit taking place.  From October through to the end of the year, there was no contact from the Government at all in relation to fishing with the EU negotiators.  There is probably an element of us being a little responsible for that as well but there is no doubt that in Europe might is right, they look after themselves first and then if anybody else benefits from it, that is well and good.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Council meeting that took place, we should give a cautious welcome to the fact that Ukraine and Moldova have been given candidate status for joining the EU.  That is cautiously welcome because the EU, in a report on Ukraine only last October, stated that Ukraine was the most corrupt country in Europe that it had worked in.  What has changed in relation to that?  Ukraine has had the difficulty of an invasion and what the Russians are doing there is completely wrong, but Ukraine will still be a corrupt country at the end of it.  That process has to be resolved and has to be dealt with.  While Ukraine joins the European Union, that corruption will have to be sorted out and dealt with.  Zelenskyy presided over that corruption before the war with Russia and that has to be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300041#OO00500","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1657722000,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300041#OO00600","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1657722000,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I wanted to talk about food security, but also about how Germany wants to reduce the criteria on decision making.

It is generally an idea to offer a platform for political co-ordination in countries across the Continent.

It is a clear apartheid, racist policy, not just directed against Palestinians within occupied Palestine, but directed now against Irish citizens.

There are no sanctions on corn and Russia is still free to export it because we do not want to interfere with the food supply.  At the same time, Russia is trying to stop the food supply coming out of Ukraine, which is very important.  I can give a detailed answer on that if the Deputy wants because many Members raised it.  Russia is responsible for the shock to global food security.  The blockading and destruction of Ukrainian ports has affected the least-developed countries and the most fragile countries, and it has also affected prices here, as consumers are seeing.<\/p>  <p>  What are we doing?  As I said, we can talk about it in the D&aacute;il but there is also action happening.  The EU is doing a huge amount of work to help Ukraine to produce and export agrifood products through different land routes and EU ports.  Further efforts will be made through the rapid implementation of what is called the solidarity lanes action plan to bring Ukrainian grain back onto global markets.<\/p> <p> As well as our efforts at EU level, we are also working on the issues at the UN.

I will address the issues the Taoiseach indicated I would address, namely, the economic issues and the Conference on the Future of Europe.<\/p>  <p>  As is usual at this time of year, the June European Council generally endorsed the country-specific recommendations for this year's semester process.  We are broadly happy with the four country-specific recommendations agreed for Ireland this year.  They are consistent with national policy orientations that we have firmly established.  On energy matters, leaders reaffirmed their commitment to ensure close co-ordination of efforts and actions with a view to securing energy supply at affordable prices, taking into account the work being done by the Commission.  The Government recognises the cost-of-living pressures stemming from increasing energy prices, as well as broader-based inflation, are a serious issue facing households.  As such, a range of measures have been introduced.  On a cumulative basis, approximately &euro;2.4 billion has been announced in cost-of-living measures to date.  One of the best and most recent examples of this is free school transport next year for everybody who has a Bus &Eacute;ireann school transport ticket.<\/p>  <p>  The June European Council also welcomed the fulfilment by Croatia of all the convergence criteria set out in the treaty and endorsed the Commission's proposal that Croatia adopt the euro on 1 January 2023.  The formal agreement and signing ceremony took place yesterday.  I extend our best wishes to the government of Croatia and the Croatian people as they advance their preparations for the changeover from the kuna, which is a currency I got to know in my Interrailing days, in the months ahead.  This is very welcome.  Croatia joined the EU in 2013 and is now joining the euro.  Together with what is happening generally on enlargement, I hope this development will help to bring some of Croatia's former colleagues in the old Yugoslavia into the EU as separate independent countries and proud nations.<\/p>  <p>  Leaders also met in Euro Summit format on the Friday morning of the European Council.<\/p> <p>The President of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, and the President of the Eurogroup, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, reported on the latest assessment of the economic outlook.  Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine is fuelling high global energy, commodity and food prices and increasing uncertainty factors that are dampening growth and exacerbating inflationary pressures globally.  The European economy and the Irish economy, however, remain fundamentally strong due to the sizeble policy actions taken at EU, euro area and national levels, in the context of this House.  EU leaders remain united in their steadfast determination to further strengthen the resilience of our economies and will continue to be well co-ordinated, determined and agile in their response.  Leaders also welcomed the Eurogroup statement on the future of the banking union, which provides that, as an immediate step, work on the banking union should focus on strengthening the common framework for bank crisis management and national deposit guarantee schemes.  Leaders also called for stepping up efforts in deepening the capital markets union.<\/p> <p> On the Conference on the Future of Europe, leaders noted the proposals set out in the final report, as presented at the closing ceremony in Strasbourg on 9 May.  The European Council invited effective follow-up by all three institutions, the Council, the Commission and the Parliament, each within its own sphere of competence and in accordance with the treaties, while ensuring high levels of transparency for Europe's citizens.  As Minister of State with special responsibility for European affairs, I engaged widely, virtually and in person, with many individuals and groups as part of Ireland's national deliberations.  I was encouraged by the interest shown in the process and by the thoughtful contributions.  I will release a report soon enough on this aspect from a national point of view.  <\/p> <p> It has been an open and inclusive Continent-wide democratic exercise that has offered citizens from across the EU the opportunity to provide their views on the EU's optimal future directions.  More than 320 interesting and innovative measures and recommendations were presented during the conference, spanning virtually the entire spectrum of EU activity.  The Council and the Commission have prepared assessments on the proposals and have expressed the view that the vast majority of the proposals can be implemented if agreed through existing policies without the need to reopen European treaties.  Nationally, a detailed assessment of all the EU-level recommendations will be carried out across all Departments, which will be overseen by the Department of Foreign Affairs.<\/p> <p> In looking ahead to Europe's future, our guiding principle must be: how can we best prepare our Union to continue to meet the needs of its citizens into the future.  This includes the value of subsidiarity, while protecting and strengthening our commitment to our shared values.  Ireland is ready for this debate.  We will work constructively to shape our future in this new European context and we are open to considering treaty change if it is necessary.  We should first, however, do what we can within the existing framework.  We are Irish, we are Europeans and we work constructively within the EU.  That has benefited the country and our citizens.  Equally, Ireland, and every other member state, has brought benefits to the EU and to other European citizens as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300043#QQ02300","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657723800,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an D&aacute;il ar fionra&iacute; ar 3.54 p.m. agus cuireadh t&uacute;s leis ar&iacute;s ar 4.54 p.m.<br \/><br \/>Sitting suspended at 3.54 p.m. and resumed at 4.54 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Sick Leave Bill 2022: From the Seanad","time":1657724100,"counter":370,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300045#XX00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657724100,"counter":371,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il went into Committee to consider amendments from the Seanad.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657724100,"counter":372,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300045#XX00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657724100,"counter":373,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 1:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657724100,"counter":374,"content":"<p>As amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are grouped, I will speak to both amendments.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 1 makes a minor but useful change to the Minister&rsquo;s power to set the number of sick leave days by order.

The other is on the insertion of subsection 2(b) into section 13 of the Act.  That is not an amendment before us but it is important to the overall debate, as I have acknowledged.<br \/><br \/>At the discretion of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, let me deal with the issue of the retrospective application of this Bill.  The political direction I gave to those involved in drafting the Bill and the Office of the Attorney General was that, to the greatest extent possible within legal parameters, I wanted the additional protections provided for in the Bill to be retrospective.  That is the clear political direction I gave as Minister on the issue.  I assured this House and the Seanad that I would achieve that, and that is what I have done.<br \/><br \/>Let me put on the record some important points on this matter.  I am satisfied, having listened to the legal advice I have received, that what I requested has been achieved.  Within the constitutional parameters in which we must all operate, we have secured the retrospective application of this Bill to the greatest extent possible.  As I have said in previous statements to both Houses, the scope of the Oireachtas to make laws retrospectively is limited by the Constitution.  In this regard, I have quoted Article 15.5.1&deg;, which I do not need to do again.  This limits how far laws can be retrospectively applied.  The reasons for this provision in the Constitution are obvious.  Retroactive laws pose a challenge to the fundamental principles of equality, certainty and predictability underlying the rule of law.  Individuals should be able to rely on laws in the expectation that the State will not afterwards interfere with individuals&rsquo; rights.<br \/><br \/>Paragraphs 2 and 3 of Schedule 7 apply to workers already within the scope of the 2014 Act who reported before enactment but suffered retaliation after enactment.  Given that these workers are already protected by the 2014 Act, the additional benefits these provisions confer are the reversal of the burden of proof during proceedings of the Workplace Relations Commission and the courts and access to interim relief at the Circuit Court against penalisation.<br \/><br \/>Paragraphs 4 and 5 apply to persons added to the scope of the legislation by this Bill.  These include shareholders, volunteers and board members who reported before enactment but who, again, suffered retaliation after enactment.  Also included are job applicants.  Since these workers had no entitlement to protection prior to this amendment being made, the cohort will receive the greatest benefit from these provisions, namely protection from penalisation at the Workplace Relations Commission, including the reversal of the burden of proof, the right to sue for damages in court, again including the reversal of the burden of proof during proceedings, and access to interim relief at the Circuit Court for dismissal and other forms of penalisation.<br \/><br \/>Paragraphs 6 and 7 apply to workers already within the scope of the 2014 Act who reported and suffered retaliation before enactment, provided the workers have not initiated proceedings in the Workplace Relations Commission or the courts at the time of enactment.  Given that these workers are already protected by the 2014 Act, the additional benefit this measure confers on them is that they will be entitled to the reversal of the burden of proof during proceedings.  I acknowledge how important the reversal of that burden is, in addition to the extension of that protection to so many workers and other persons who now qualify under this Bill.<br \/><br \/>Amendments submitted by Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, to which I am sure she will speak in a moment, seek to extend the provisions of paragraphs 6 and 7 to persons who have already initiated proceedings under the 2014 Act.  That is the kernel of the issue on which much of the correspondence and parliamentary questions in recent days have focused.  The primary effect of the amendments would be to apply the reversal of the burden of proof to cases that are already before the Workplace Relations Commission or courts.  I cannot accept these amendments.  To provide for the burden of proof to shift during the currency of pending legal proceedings would involve substantial interference with the administration of justice and would be liable to be unfair to litigants and generate significant uncertainty in the conduct of litigation.  This would be particularly true in relation to part-heard cases or cases where a judicial decision has been already given.<br \/><br \/>Paragraphs 6(b) and 7(b) of Schedule 7 are necessary to avoid interference with the conduct of pending litigation, with potential unfairness and uncertainty for litigants, which a retrospective application of the shifting of the burden of proof to pending proceedings would involve.  It is standard for such significant and substantive interferences with the conduct of proceedings to be applied, as here, only to proceedings initiated after the commencement of the provision concerned.  It is not usual to apply new rules to already-existing proceedings.  To accept these amendments would set a disturbing precedent.  The Oireachtas would, in effect, be interfering in cases that are currently before the courts.  To do such a thing would, I am advised, clearly be repugnant to the Constitution, the underlying right to fair procedures in litigation and the rule of law.<br \/><br \/>I gave the commitment to go as far as I possibly could in terms of the retrospective application of all the additional protections in this Bill.  That was my key objective in introducing this Bill; however, as I have said, I am advised by the Attorney General that we can go no further in providing retrospective protection than is already set out in the amendments.<br \/><br \/>Let me touch briefly on the specific issue that Deputy Howlin has raised, because it has been raised several times in parliamentary questions in the past few days.  There is a misinterpretation of what the relevant section provides.  Section 13 of the Protected Disclosures Act provides that if a person causes detriment to another person because the other person or third person made a protected disclosure, the person to whom the detriment is caused has a right of action in tort against the person by whom the detriment is caused.  Section 22 of this Bill provides for the insertion of a new subsection (2B) into section 13 of the 2014 Act, to which Deputy Howlin referred.  It provides:<\/p><p>In other words, the effect of subsection (2) is to reverse the burden of proof in any tort proceedings taken under section 13 so that the court must assume that the alleged detriment occurred because of a protected disclosure unless the defendant can prove otherwise.  In other words, the reversal of the burden of proof is in favour of the whistleblower as a result of the insertion of the provision.  I will leave it at that because I realise colleagues want to contribute.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657725000,"counter":409,"content":"<p>We have been down quite a long road on this.  It has been a very positive example of how the Government can engage with the Opposition and the relevant committee.  The Minister has taken on board many of the suggestions put forward by me, Teachta Buckley and others.  That has been really positive.  I am aware this is our last opportunity to speak on this.  I thank the whistleblowers who have engaged with us over the course of dealing with this Bill.  They spoke out for the common good.  We have heard from the witnesses about the huge strain placed on them privately and professionally as a result.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout our discussions, we have grappled with the issue of retrospectivity, on which the Minister has just touched.  Throughout his time dealing with the issue of retrospectivity, he has mentioned that he was seeking advice on it from the Attorney General.  I was wondering whether it is possible to see this advice.  Can it be shared with us?  As the Minister knows, many of the whistleblowers we have heard from feel completely and utterly let down by the way they have been treated.  I included my amendments because I do not believe it is right to exclude a section of whistleblowers.  The section I am referring to includes those whom the Minister mentioned, namely those currently engaged in live proceedings.  I fear the message they will receive from this Bill will be that they have been left behind again.  They have been failed so many times and we must not let that happen again.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that, throughout the committee hearings, we heard from whistleblowers about how they have been penalised.  We should not exclude those engaged in live proceedings from this greater protection whereby any penalisation is presumed to have occurred as a result of the whistleblowing.  The issue of the burden of proof is undoubtedly a fundamental aspect of the enhancement of provisions in this Bill and there should be an extension to the cohort in question.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to ask the Minister a number of questions on this.  I understood what he was saying but have some questions I hope he can answer.  We have spoken about the issue of retrospectivity at length.  If there can be retrospective application for some, why can there not be for others?  I understand this issue falls under Article 15.5.1&deg; of the Constitution, as the Minister mentioned.  It states the Oireachtas cannot declare that certain actions contravened laws that were not in place at the time of those actions.<\/p> <p>When the Minister introduced the amendments in the Seanad he said that constitutionally they could not include people who are before the Workplace Relations Commission or the courts.  Will he explain why this is the case?  I do not understand how it would be the case with Article 15.5.1&deg;.<\/p> <p> I will give an example of where it was possible to make a retrospective ruling for a live proceeding.  It was through the European Court of Justice in the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft case, C-684\/16.  The case was brought by the German court.  After the termination of employment a company refused to pay the employee for annual leave not taken.  The German courts were unsure whether the EU law precludes national legislation providing for the loss of paid annual leave not taken.  The European Court of Justice ruled the employer must prove it gave the employee the opportunity to take the leave in the time allocated and particularly to have provided adequate information on doing so.  The point is that the burden of proof lay with the employer and in this case it was granted in a live proceeding.  Again, I question why this cannot be done in this case.  Would the denial of this right lead to cases similar to the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft case?  I was also struck when reading about the case that the German courts were unsure as to whether EU law precludes national legislation providing for this.  Would this mean EU law has primacy over our domestic law and, therefore, the directive would have primacy here?<\/p> <p> Another issue I know the Minister is acutely aware of is that of reporting directly to the Minister.  I want to mention this as the Minister spoke on it.  It is regression not to have direct reporting to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300047#ZZ00200","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657725600,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I am conscious I did not deal with the Bill as my colleague Deputy Nash did.

There is a clear distinction between the retroactive creation of a legal right and the retroactive outlawing of a breach of such a right.  The latter would offend Article 15.5.1&deg; of the Constitution but the former would not.  I can quote legal cases where this has been determined in the courts.  In other words, we can retrospectively confer rights but we cannot retrospectively withdraw those that have already been adduced in the courts.  I am very conscious the Minister has embraced this with a very open mind.  He has engaged with the committee.  He has done a fine job.  That is why it is unfortunate we have only ten or 11 minutes to resolve these matters.  There are no time constraints on us in respect of this Bill, which is not time-sensitive.

There are many examples of schemes that are introduced where there is cut-off point whereby people are in the system and have started proceedings or a case or they have not.  That is fair enough.  The door has to close at a certain point.  The fact the Minister will not allow people who are already before the Workplace Relations Commission or the courts to be included in the provisions is fundamentally unjust.  What is the Minister saying to these people?  He is telling them to cease their proceedings and go back to square one.  The implications of that are enormous, timewise and for costs.  Without doubt, these people are being denied the justice to which they should be entitled.  We have to take their concerns and rights into consideration and I do not believe the Minister is doing so.  I urge him to accept the amendments tabled by Deputy Farrell to protect, and ensure the rights of, those people already in the system.  It is a reasonable request.

I do not know whether it was published.  A debate on this that will conclude within five minutes is simply unfair not only to the House but to the whistleblowers caught in the process of a court case.  John Barrett, who has been mentioned in the House numerous times, is one such individual caught in it.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill flies in the face of the directive we are transposing into Irish law.

Reflecting on what the whistleblowers told us during the course of the hearings, I am very concerned about the rush to conclude this.

I acknowledge there has been very good collaboration from all sides.  The committee chaired by Deputy McGuinness did excellent work during pre-legislative scrutiny.  It identified this issue.  It is my view that we have gone beyond the recommendation in the pre-legislative scrutiny report on the retrospective application of the additional protections in the Bill.  What we are doing is not in breach of the directive.  In fact, the directive is silent on the question of the retrospective application of the protections.  It does not make any such recommendation.<\/p>  <p>  As I have said, my clear directive at political level to those involved in drafting the Bill and those providing legal advice was that I wanted to maximise the retrospective application of the Bill to the greatest extent possible.  I set out in my initial comments on this set of amendments the various categories of people who will benefit from retrospective application of the Bill and from the additional protections that have been provided.  In essence, what I am being asked to do is ignore the advice of the Attorney General and accept the advice of other legal persons.  I do not call into question their competence but in the position I have the privilege of holding, it is the advice of the Attorney General that is pre-eminent on legal issues.  Colleagues from across the House are aware of this.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to what the advice says, I laid out much of it and its language in the remarks I made earlier.  In essence, it is that providing for the burden of proof to shift during pending legal proceedings would involve a substantial interference in the administration of justice.  It would be liable to be unfair to litigants and to generate significant uncertainty in the conduct of litigation.  This would clearly be an infringement of the right to fair procedures and would undoubtedly not stand up in the courts.  The advice I have is that what we are doing is at the limits of what is permissible under Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and I cannot go beyond it, irrespective of what personal wish I may have as Minister.  The advice is the advice.

This amendment is an enabling one and it will allow for the seamless linking up of licence application and process, as envisaged in the 2021 changes made to the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The full independence of the EPA in determining whether to grant or refuse licence applications is not affected by this amendment.  The EPA remains fully independent in that function and there is no statutory role for a Minister in that regard.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 34 creates a new part in the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 to transpose the requirement in Article 59(1)(<i>b<\/i>) of the internal market for electricity directive, to give the Commission for Regulation of Utilities the power to ensure compliance by market participants that are not electricity undertakings with their obligations under the directive.  These market participants include smaller actors in the electricity market, including citizen energy communities that are not engaged in the activity as their main business or economic activity, and therefore it is not appropriate to subject these actors to the more onerous licensing regime already in existence for electricity undertakings.<\/p><p>This is a significant new development in the Irish electricity regulatory framework that creates a regulatory framework for the participation of new actors in the electricity market and is an essential step in providing new ways for customers and a greater diversity of actors, including citizen energy communities, to participate in the market via electricity activities, including generating and trading electricity, aggregation, demand response and energy storage.  It is an important component in building resilience in the electricity market in Ireland and it will help to accelerate the decarbonisation and democratisation of the market.  By doing so, this new framework acts upon the European Commission's call to speed up the transposition of the internal market for electricity directive, which is the subject of a letter of formal notice and is designed effectively to allow consumers to participate in energy markets, as set out in the European Commission's recent communication, REPower EU, which sets out the Commission's response to the war in Ukraine.<\/p><p>There is a double urgency to transform Europe's energy system, to end the EU's dependence on Russian fossil fuels, and to tackle the climate crisis.  The shift away from fossil fuels towards renewables is part of the circular transition, as provided for in the circular economy strategy.<\/p> <p>The strategy is a key addition to the Government's drive to achieve a 51% reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and to get on a path to reach net zero emissions by not later than 2050, as per commitments in the programme for Government and the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021.  The less we use non-renewable material resources like fossil fuels, the more circular and less resource-intensive the economy becomes.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 3 provides for the immediate commencement of these provisions on the enactment of the Bill.  Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 29 to 32, inclusive, provide for a change in Long and Short Titles of the Bill to the Circular Economy and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill to take account of these changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300049#BBB01500","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657726800,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his introductory remarks.  I repeat the same thing I have heard said many times this week by quite a number of Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la and Opposition Members, that is, what is happening here with legislation and last-minute changes shoehorned into Committee and Report Stages in the Seanad is deeply disturbing and an attempt by the Government to bypass the D&aacute;il and any scrutiny of contentious and often complex legislation.  Moreover, in many cases this week it is legislation that has the potential to have profound effects on the lives and rights of many people for years to come.<\/p>  <p>  In formal terms, I must acknowledge that with this Bill we had a good Second Stage debate and Committee Stage discussions and the Minister of State took on board some Opposition suggestions in some areas, though not in any of the more important sections of the Bill and areas we felt urgently needed attention.<\/p>  <p>  My problem with the Bill from the outset is it has very little to do with the circular economy.  Much of it was taken up with changing the law around the use of CCTV, for example.  However, I now find that while the select committee spent hours looking over the provisions of the Bill, such as they were, we now have before us a different animal entirely, with two substantial amendments from the Government to two completely different Acts coming back from the Seanad.  There are substantial amendments here to the Environmental Protection Agency Act and the Electricity Regulation Act.  The Minister of State may well say these are vitally important, necessary and good amendments.  It is hard for us to know that, considering we have had absolutely no time to consider or examine them or to question him on them.  Now we have 30 minutes to discuss them.  I do not want to gobble up all the time from other Deputies but for a Government that loves to lecture the Opposition on shoddy legislation and unintended consequences of poorly drafted Bills, it has taken some liberties this week with the entire legislative process.<\/p>  <p>  On the changes to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the issuing of licences, yet again a substantial change to existing law is proposed because of the urgency and the need to speed through the emergency purchase of electricity generation to head off power cuts in the period 2023 to 2034.  I say again this entire crisis and the panic is, despite repeated denials from the Minister of State's party and Government Ministers, rooted in the insane policy of this and other Governments on the proliferation of data centres.  I am certain we will be proved right on this in the end.  The Government can deny it as much as it wishes but there are clear warnings from the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, that it is data centre proliferation that is driving up the unforeseen demand for electricity.  It is not the electrification of transport or other areas and none of this is a natural by-product, but instead the policy of the Government is responsible for this.  While decrying attempts to ban or place a moratorium on data centres, Ministers are now saying we effectively have a moratorium through the CRU's instructions to EirGrid.  We have a delay for new applications but we know up to eight massive centres have approval and will be connected in the coming years.  Therein lies the panic and the sight of Green Party Ministers justifying the purchase of what will be gas-fired emergency generators.  When these arrive, the very fact of their existence and the need for them will be further used to justify support for, and the building of, liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminals here.  All of these, needless to say, will have an impact on our emissions targets and on any hopes of cutting CO2 in the coming years to the level required by the Climate Action Act or indeed the Paris Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  I frankly do not know if the changes to the EPA process of issuing these licences is a simple thing or a good thing.  I do not know if it is a box-ticking exercise with no unintended consequences down the road.  What I know is we are being bounced into this because of a panic caused by a policy to allow data centre expansion and that will, I have no doubt, come back to haunt us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300050#CCC00200","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1657726800,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I wish to speak to amendment No. 1 in respect of applications to the EPA for licences.  I highlight to the Minister of State an anomaly of which I am sure he has been made aware.  It relates to polyethylene terephthalate, PET, plastics and the ludicrous situation whereby we have the facilities to recycle those plastics in this State, but according to information Deputies and Senators have received, a substantial quantity, if not the vast majority, of PET plastic collected in this State is exported internationally for recycling.  At the same time, those indigenous operators that can carry out such recycling are forced to import similar quantities of PET plastic.  That indicates the exact opposite of what a circular economy should be.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons for this.  The first ludicrous situation is that the PET that is exported, which brings an increased carbon footprint, is actually subsidised by Irish taxpayers.  We pay those people who collect that plastic material and then export it with no obligation on them to try to ensure the most environmentally sustainable mechanism by which to recycle it.<\/p>  <p>  The second glaring issue concerns the taxation of virgin plastic material.  This Government, our green Government, is refusing to enact a tax on virgin plastic, as other member states have.  Instead it says this needs to happen at a co-ordinated EU level.  However, the Government has no problem when it comes to putting charges on ordinary workers and families for their use of products to which they by and large have no alternative, as they pick them off the supermarket shelves.  The Government can introduce taxation arrangements at a domestic level almost immediately but it will not do it when it has an impact on large multinational corporations.  In this instance it is the corporations using virgin plastic material.  This is important because, as other member states have taxation arrangements on that material, producers of plastic commodities want to use recycled plastic.  What are they doing as a result?  They are paying above the odds for Irish bottles that have been put into our recycling bins.  I am sure the Minister of State accepts that is an absolutely crazy situation.<\/p>  <p>  The reason I have an interest in this and am so aware of it is one of the companies, if not the only one, with the capacity to carry out this recycling is Shabra Plastics in my constituency.  It is an excellent company and an excellent employer.  It is a company that should be a flagship of this Government's promotion of the circular economy.  Instead, this Government's actions could put that company out of business.  I urge the Minister of State and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, to come to County Monaghan, visit Shabra Plastics and see what is in place.  Then they should put in place a taxation regime for virgin plastic and for once target waste at the source in relation to those companies producing plastic commodities rather than ordinary consumers.  The second action is to stop subsidising the exportation of plastic material out of this State when that material can be recycled here in this State.  I make that appeal to the Minister of State.  I hope he can give us a substantive and positive response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300050#CCC00400","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1657726800,"counter":444,"content":"<p>In the interests of brevity, I will make a quick point just to have it on the record again.  We dealt with the EirGrid Bill.<\/p> <p>Pre-legislative scrutiny was waived, under protest, on Second Stage and Committee Stage.  We in the Opposition were pontificated to.  We were told we had ample time and opportunity to discuss matters but we most certainly had not.  Every time we engaged on the Bill, there was additional information.  Gaps in the information remain.  Not only that but because of the rushed nature of the process, the Government has had to bolt miscellaneous provisions onto the circular economy Bill.  The approach taken to the EirGrid Bill, in particular, was not a good way to do legislation and this is another case in point.  I wanted to put that on the record as I have on every Stage of that Bill.  The same approach has now transferred to the circular economy Bill.<\/p> <p> I support the comments made by Deputy Carthy in respect of the perverse situation in which we are left.  A crazy set of circumstances has led to a situation whereby products which could be delivered in a circular economy on the island of Ireland are having to be transported over and back to mainland Europe.  The effect of that is that the carbon footprint is 48 times more intense and impactful than it would otherwise be.  I appeal to the Minister of State to intervene directly.  I know he is interested in this and as Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said, the Minister of State has taken on board recommendations from the Opposition in a way I have not seen from other Ministers.  I personally appeal to him to intervene in that case, take a personal interest in it and go to County Monaghan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300050#CCC00500","speaker":"1507","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657727400,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies.  I have been in Monaghan on a number of occasions in the past year.  I met Deputy Carthy's brother in Carrickmacross.  I asked my Department to engage directly with Shabra Plastics some time ago.  They have been engaging and that will continue.  In general, our facilities infrastructure for recycling plastics in Ireland is not well developed.  One of the consequences of this Bill is that there will be a greater supply of segregated material as a result of directing better streams and better segregation, particularly from the business sector.  There will be more material available, which I expect to facilitate more plastic recycling and other types of recycling, including food recycling, throughout the State.  That will help.  I am, of course, always happy to listen to and engage with any company that is having difficulty, and particular in this sector.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments which relate to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, are directly consequential to changes to the Planning and Development Act 2000 that happened last year.  They are a necessary corollary.  They are needed now because of the emergency legislation to ensure we do not have power cuts.  That is why they are included here.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith asked what is the connection between CCTV and the circular economy.  The connection is that if an illegal commercial operator is being paid money to dispose of waste material by throwing it into a field instead of bringing it to a recycling bin, it is avoiding the circular economy.

We have had to balance in those provisions the right to privacy, on one hand, and the right to live in a clean environment on the other.  The result will be a more circular economy.<\/p>  <p>  The electricity amendments are straightforward.  They are required because of a European directive.  We received a notification reminding us we have to include them.  They are a good thing.  They allow local communities to take part in the electricity market.  They can generate and store electricity, and manage demand.  For example, a group of farmers can come together and take part in the electricity market, which they were not allowed to do in the past.  We have set it in such a way that those farmers do not have the same burdensome amount of bureaucracy to go through as would be the case for the ESB or somebody else.

I want to tease out his response a little.  We talk about recycling but what we do in Ireland is collect and separate.  We have a small recycling capacity.  Shabra Plastics is an example of that in the PET area.  Because of the incentives within the market, the subsidies on the one hand and the taxes elsewhere, there is a risk that the small industry in existence will be uncompetitive and will struggle to be sustained.  Those levers within the market are disadvantages to companies.  There are subsidies for export and virgin plastic taxes elsewhere, which we can introduce but have decided not to on the basis that we want to move as a part of the European Union as a whole.  The company in question is affected every working day by the implementation of levies elsewhere.  Does the Minister of State see the perfect storm at play here in respect of the industry as it exists?  I wish to ask the Minister of State about those two specific measures, the subsidies for export and the virgin plastic taxes elsewhere.  How does the Minister of State intend to develop an industry here when the existing industry is struggling because of those measures?  Somewhere along the line, the Government is going to have to address these issues or there will be no industry.  It will be always more profitable to send products somewhere else, with a massive carbon footprint, to the detriment of local economies in Ireland and certainly to the detriment of the environment.

If there is a situation whereby there is a virgin plastic tax in a nearby jurisdiction, that creates an incentive to export goods from Ireland to be processed in that jurisdiction.  There is a mismatch in that regard.  It makes it harder if that country is no longer a member of the EU and is not subject to the same rules.  We must decide if we are going to impose a plastic tax in Ireland at the same rate and consider whether that is the right thing to do.  At the same time, we must consider what the effect will be on consumers and prices.  We must also ensure not to create something like the cash for ash situation where a particular payment is unsustainable and unpayable.  I accept we need to watch the incentives available in other countries.  We must ensure our market is not distorted and that is why we are continuing to engage with the company the Deputy mentioned earlier, which I believe is the only PET recycling firm in the country.

We are not competitive here and we are not competitive in other markets either.<\/p> <p>This is the solution.  If the Government is not going to introduce a virgin plastic tax here, will it take away the subsidy for people to export?  It is not recycling; it is exporting for recycling.

indicated to the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office that I wanted to raise a point of order at the outset of the debate.  It sits into the real concerns that many Members have had with the way business is being conducted.  I know it will be a cause of personal concern to you, Sir,, as Chairman of this House.<\/p><p>Substantial amendments were tabled in the other House that were never debated because it was guillotined.  They have come back here and are most unlikely to be reached in the 45 minutes that we have for the debate.  I believe there are fundamental errors in the drafting of the Bill because it has been so rushed.  It is an unfair of dealing with legislation.  It is unfair to this House and the staff of this House, particular in the Bill&rsquo;s office and in your office, Sir.  It is not a way to proceed.<\/p><p>In particular, I want to draw our attention, Sir, to amendment No. 31, which came to us from the Seanad.  It includes a square bracket around the word &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; under section 161(7).  This is a very important issue because the subsection states: <\/p> <blockquote> \tWhere, in the opinion of the Commission, a person to whom a [mandatory] code of conduct is addressed is failing or has failed to comply with the code, the Commission may apply, by motion, to the High Court for an order directing the person to comply with the code, and the Court may, as it thinks fit, on the hearing of the application, make or refuse to make such an order. <\/blockquote>  <p>Legislation cannot be drafted with a square bracket around a word like &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; because it changes the meaning of the section.  How is any citizen or court to interpret the intentions of the House?  Is it a mandatory code or is it just a code?  This is clearly an error, because this was obviously a drafting stage section where the square brackets were not actually removed or the word was not removed &ndash; either one or the other.  The square brackets appeared in amendment No. 103 on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  The guillotine fell and the amendments were never reached and discussed, and now the square brackets are appearing in amendment No. 31 in the list before the D&aacute;il today.<\/p> <p>I submit, as I did in writing to you, a Cheann Comhairle, that it is not open to the D&aacute;il to adopt an amendment such as this.  It is not fit for purpose and it is not possible to correct it because if we take out the word within the square brackets, that changes the meaning of the Bill as passed by the Seanad.

The Committee on Standing Orders and D&aacute;il Reform today considered matters relating to pre-legislative scrutiny and I have introduced a measure which, when implemented, will shorten the timeframe of pre-legislative scrutiny.

I did not deal with the Bill originally; my colleague Deputy Nash did so.  He wrote to the Minister of State a week ago on another matter, relating to an amendment we have tabled that is unlikely to be reached, which the Minister has explained to the House has a meaning that clearly is not encompassed in the draft he has put before us.  We will not have time to reach that amendment.  This relates to the serious matter of the obtaining of foreign donations for a political party.  It is clearly the intention of the Minister, as he stated, that any moneys accrued from a fundraiser in New York, for example, could not be expended in the State.  If we pass the amendments that have been laid before the House, however - amendments that we will not have a chance to read - it will be possible for those donations to be expended in this jurisdiction, despite the explanation of the Minister.  My colleague, Deputy Nash, wrote to the Minister of State a week ago on this issue but we have not had the courtesy of a reply despite the fact that the Bill is being bulldozed through.

Section 161(7) provides that where a person to whom a mandatory code is addressed has failed to comply with the code, the commission may apply to the High Court for an order directing the person to comply with the code.  The word \"mandatory\" is in square brackets in the text.  I am satisfied that the text is referring to a mandatory code.  Clearly, the commission could not apply to the court seeking compliance with an optional or non-mandatory code.  That simply would not be possible or make sense.

The first group of amendments assigns a monitoring and investigatory role to an coimisi&uacute;n<b><\/b>toghch&aacute;in<b><\/b>in order that an coimisi&uacute;n can protect the integrity of our electoral processes in the online sphere, in particular during electoral events.  Members will appreciate that the online world now provides unprecedented opportunities unprecedented opportunities to spread false or misleading information very quickly and to create a false impression that a particular position has widespread support, thus giving it unwarranted credibility.  Against this background and having regard to similar issues that arose during pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, when publishing the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 my colleague, the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, signalled that he had asked the Attorney General to prepare proposals and options for inclusion in the Bill with a specific focus on the protection of integrity of electoral processes that could include a role for an coimisi&uacute;n in this regard.  The new provisions in Part 5, which were published on 10 June, will place Ireland in a much better position to combat potential threats to the integrity of elections and referendums.<\/p><p>Seanad amendment No. 1 amends the Long Title to provide for the insertion of a new Part 5 in the Electoral Reform Bill 2022.  In terms of consequential amendments, the insertion of a new Part 5 and the additional functions assigned to an coimisi&uacute;n toghch&aacute;in to protect the integrity of our elections and referendums gives rise to a small number of consequential amendments to Part 2.  Seanad amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, and No. 7 all relate to consequential amendments having regard to the insertion of the new Part 5.  <\/p><p>I turn now to provisions in respect of the new Part 5 itself, which comprise amendments Nos. 12 to 40, inclusive.  To better understand the principal threats to the integrity of elections and to perceptions of the integrity of how elections are conducted, a number of key concepts are set out in the new Part 5, specifically in section 142, on which I will now elaborate.  Definitions of &quot;disinformation&quot;, &quot;misinformation&quot; and &quot;manipulative or inauthentic behaviour&quot; are included in this Part.  Following on from these broad concepts the provisions of the new Part 5 will provide an coimisi&uacute;n with new monitoring and investigations functions with regard to the dissemination of disinformation relating to online electoral information and misinformation relating to online electoral processes, information as well as functions to prevent manipulative or inauthentic behaviours online.  These are sections 143, 148, 157, 158 and 162.  <\/p><p>Section 146 requires online platforms to report possible disinformation, misinformation or manipulative inauthentic behaviour in the online sphere to an coimisi&uacute;n at the beginning of an electoral campaign period.<\/p><p>Section 147 requires online platforms to put in place a notification mechanism for users to report possible disinformation relating to online electoral information and misinformation relating to online electoral processes information.<\/p><p>Section 144 requires an advisory board to be established to provide advice to an coimisi&uacute;n on the nature and effect of disinformation and misinformation and on the use by an coimisi&uacute;n of its powers under Part 5.  <\/p><p>Section 145 provides for the establishment of a stakeholder council to provide advice and opinions to an coimisi&uacute;n generally and on the preparation and use of codes of conduct under Part 5. <\/p><p>Sections 151 to 155, inclusive, provide powers to an coimisi&uacute;n in respect of its monitoring and investigatory functions.<\/p><p>Sections 159 and 160 also provide for an appeal mechanism against any notices or orders issued by an coimisi&uacute;n.<\/p><p>Section 150 requires that an coimisi&uacute;n will be required to consider the impacts of its actions on specified rights under the Constitution. <\/p><p>Section 161 provides that an coimisi&uacute;n may publish codes of conduct that will be developed in consultation with the advisory board and stakeholder council.  These codes of conduct may apply to online platforms, candidates at an election, political parties, third parties and other relevant persons. <\/p><p>Finally, section 163 provides for offences and penalties in respect of a failure to comply with any of the proposed notices under order or orders issued under Part 5; section 16 for making certain false statements regarding electoral period or an election campaign period; section 165 for using undisclosed bots to mislead or influence an election or referendum; and section 166 for a failure to comply with the obligations placed on online platforms.<\/p><p>Part 4 and the new Part 5 are required to be notified to the European Commission under EU Directive 2015\/1535 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical regulations and of rules of information society services, otherwise known as technical regulation information system, TRIS, notification process.  Consultation periods are ongoing on Parts 4 and 5 under the TRIS process.  This provides an opportunity for stakeholders and the European Commission to provide comments or observations on the relevant provisions in the Bill.  Any comments or observations arising from consultation process can be considered in advance of the commencements of Parts 4 and 5.  <\/p><p>In conclusion, the insertion of a new Part 5 and the additional functions it provides to an coimisi&uacute;n toghch&aacute;in to protect our democracy against the spread of disinformation, misinformation and manipulative or inauthentic behaviour online will place Ireland in a much better position to combat the potential threats to the integrity of our elections and referendums in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300054#GGG00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1657729200,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I wish to return to the general principle.  It is more than 100 years since this D&aacute;il was established.  We will soon be celebrating the anniversary of De Valera's 1937 Constitution, Article 15.2.10 of which states: \"The sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is hereby vested in the Oireachtas: no other legislative authority has power to make laws for the State.\"  This is not a case of the Oireachtas making laws for the State.  There are amendments that have not been reached in the Seanad and are not going to be reached here.  They have never once been discussed in this Oireachtas.  The President is, of course, part of the Oireachtas.  The President will have to scrutinise them but, according to the Constitution, he has 14 days to scrutinise every Bill that we are ramming through now, and he has to sign them.  He does not have a discretion.  He has either to sign them or send them to the Supreme Court.  Lots of people will protest that he signs this, that or the other.  He or she, whoever the President is, has to sign the Bill.  This is not the Oireachtas making laws.  It is not what we were elected to do.<\/p>  <p>  This point has been raised and the Ceann Comhairle has expressed his sympathies with the Minister.  The Minister is a fundamentally decent man from a fundamentally decent party but does it ever occur to Ministers to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;, this is not how we do our business&rdquo;, or \"I will not be led by the nose around the place by my Civil Service and there is a point at which I say 'No'?\"  That is what it is; what is happening here is patently obvious to anybody.  I do not wish to sound anti-Civil Service but we have to have a democratic Government that controls the Civil Service, which implements its programme and its legislative agenda and does so at its behest, not a Government that is elected and Ministers go into a Department and says, &ldquo;What do I have to sign now?  What do I have to do now?  Where do I have to go now?  Oh God maybe they will not like the fact that we cannot discuss this Bill.  Well sure, if they do not, too bad.&rdquo;  <\/p>  <p>  I remember once when Deputy Howlin was a Minister I thought it was bad &ndash; and it was bad &ndash; Bills were guillotined.  It was very rare though.  In one instance I tabled an amendment and the civil servant smiled and said &ldquo;We are not going to reach your amendment, are we because we are going to guillotine the Bill?&rdquo;  The best of luck to him, a much cleverer man than I, a far more knowledgeable man, maybe a man much better versed in the Constitution, but he did not have a mandate; I did.  That is what democracy is supposed to be about.  My constituents could get rid of me; indeed they did and they will again some day, I have no doubt about that.  It is a matter of when; that is the same for all of us.  However, you cannot get rid of the civil servant sitting beside you.  That is not a democracy.  It is a democracy when if you do not like what is happening, you can change it.  We seem impervious to change.  It does not matter whether it is the Green Party, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the best of luck to Sinn F&eacute;in when it gets into power.  It is not going to change much, unless it changes how we do our business and the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, which was the result of a War of Independence which was what it was all about, is addressed.  <\/p>  <p>  Boris Johnson is an abomination but at least he implemented his programme.  At least it is a democracy over there and they are getting rid of him, but we cannot get rid of our permanent government here because nobody takes control of anything.  It is just, &ldquo;Where is the latest photo opportunity?&rdquo;  I am asking the Minister of State a question.  I have no doubt about his commitment to democracy or to the ideals on which he was elected.  At what point does it become unacceptable to bring a Bill through two Houses and give neither House time to discuss many of its provisions?  How is that democratic?  How does he think that is acceptable?<\/p> <p>Before we get into the minutiae of the Bill, although we will not get into the minutiae, can the Minister of State answer that overarching question?  It is not just this Bill.  There is another Bill coming through in a couple of minutes and it is the same conveyor belt process.<\/p> <p> How we do our business is the Government is elected to govern and to be held accountable.  At the previous election, I noted there were some Ministers giving out about civil servants and that they could not implement their programme.  It is the job of the senior Minister and junior Ministers to manage the Department.  This is not a Minister managing a Department but a Department managing a Minister.  I am sorry.  This is not personal and it has nothing to do with the Minister of State.  This is simply unacceptable and undemocratic.  It is not what the State and Constitution are about.  When this legislation goes to the courts, as it will given that it is a complete mess, deference will be given.  What the Oireachtas, in its wisdom, is doing is failing to even consider the Bill.  It might as well be toilet paper but the courts will give deference to what the Oireachtas does here.  I am sorry but I will not vote any further on this Bill.  It is a sham, not because I disagree with what the Minister of State wants to achieve but because how he is doing it is wrong.<\/p> <p> I look forward to the questions that I have raised being answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300054#GGG00300","speaker":"1518","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657729800,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I assure the Deputy that we will come back to the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300055#HHH00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1657729800,"counter":540,"content":"<p>In speaking to this group of amendments, it not only confirms the concerns of the Deputies who spoke earlier but demonstrates how much worse it is than that.  This was meant to be really important legislation.  We have spent in committee a considerable amount of time working on a cross-party basis, probably more so than on any other legislation we have dealt with in this Oireachtas, to ensure the Electoral Reform Bill and the important and long-overdue provisions would secure cross-party support and, therefore, public support because it makes a series of major changes to the electoral system.  We spent an awful lot of time on the impact of digital social media and online social media on the electoral process, not only in terms of threats but also opportunities, such as the democratising nature of social media when it is properly managed and access of first-time candidates and smaller parties to more flexible forms of promotion of their agendas, candidacies, etc.  In fact, all of us expressed the strong view at the committee that the provisions of the Bill, as initially proposed, with respect to online media regulation during elections was too weak.  We received significant and positive advice from some of the country's and Europe's leading experts on these matters.  We are now in a position where something we really wanted is being presented to us in detailed technical form and neither this House or the other House had a chance to discuss it.<\/p>  <p>  I am less concerned about the discussion.  I completely agree with Deputy McNamara that we will not even have time to properly scrutinise and seek expert advice - legal, technological and advocacy advice - to ensure that what is in this text will do what we and the Minister of State would like this legislation to do.  The reason this is so concerning is that the expert, the leading advocates and monitors of these kinds of technologies, told us that these technologies are accelerating at such a pace that even if what is in the Bill is okay, and I am not even sure it is, technology will have moved on dramatically.  The experts and some of the country's most eminent political scientists who specialise in Irish and global elections recommended that some of these matters should be functions of the electoral commission to ensure that what it is recommending to Government is based on the most up-to-date evidence and best practice from across the world.<\/p>  <p>  I will highlight a few concerns with the amendments as presented.  The difficulty is that the moment I start raising questions someone who might be mischievous - not anybody in this room - might say that I am not in favour of regulating online social media platforms, tackling disinformation and ensuring the integrity of the democratic process.  It is quite the opposite; we argued that we needed those measures in the Bill.  However, for example, the definition section refers to \"manipulative or inauthentic behaviour\".  Many members of the public may say this is not a phenomenon that is limited solely to online political activity.  In fact, they might say it has been the bread and butter of certain types of politics since Greco-Roman times, but the definitions are incredibly general and brief and, therefore, open to wide interpretation.<\/p>  <p>  I am a strong critic of micro-targeting, particularly when it happens without the consent of the person whose data have been mined to target.  However, to give an example, in non-digital media there are forms of micro-targeting.  We take advertisements in specialist magazines because we know certain types of people read them.  On Facebook, for example, many first-time candidates and small-party candidates will use some of the boosting functions, which are open and transparent.  That is a form of micro-targeting.  That is not what anybody is concerned about in terms of the impact on the integrity of the electoral system.  We are concerned about the Cambridge Analytica type of activity that we saw, for example, in the Brexit referendum.<\/p>  <p>  Then there is \"misinformation\".  If I read this correctly, the definition states it \"means any false or misleading online electoral process information that may cause public harm...\"  Then there is a definition of process information, which is actually just information about the electoral process, registration, voting, candidates, etc., as opposed to wider meanings.  We have not been given time to consider whether these are the right definitions.  If they are not, everything else that flows from them is deeply problematic.<\/p>  <p>  On the definition of \"online platform\", I do not understand why we are setting the bar so high in terms of applying this to online platforms of at least 100,000 unique monthly users.  We know of the big platforms but we also know increasingly there are sub-platforms, small platforms or websites that may not fall within the scope of that.  Are we saying, for example, that it will be wrong to engage in manipulative or inauthentic behaviour through various forms of micro-targeting and online electoral processing information but that will only apply to platforms that meet the high threshold set down in the criteria and I am free to go off and do that on my own website or through some other mechanism?  That seems to be what is provided for.<\/p>  <p>  The definition of \"public harm\", the foundation of this section, \"means any serious threat to the fairness or integrity of an election or referendum\".  These definitions are so broad that it is hard to understand who will get to decide.  Deputy McNamara is correct that this legislation will end up in the courts and some judge will have to decide.  If we are being asked to simply rubber-stamp this at such short notice and without adequate scrutiny or adequate expert advice from people far more qualified than us to give us a sense of this, that is a problem.<\/p>  <p>  I am all in favour of the intention behind this set of amendments.  I am deeply troubled not only that the Bill is being rushed through the House but about its drafting.  I mean no disrespect to the officials.  I say this at this point every year and I have a slightly different take on it than Deputy McNamara.  The officials are put under an enormous amount of strain by Ministers who want to be seen to get things done and demand the churning out of legislation so that they can get the photo opportunity, as Deputy McNamara said, with the Bill they have passed.  I have enormous sympathy for the officials and staff in the Bills Office who have to deal with all of this stuff.  I am saying that honestly.  However, if all of that pressure is being place on the officials and legislation does not go through the various screening processes, we could approve something here that, in and of itself, could undermine the integrity of the electoral process.  That is a profound worry.<\/p>  <p>  These amendments should be withdrawn given how cross-party and collegiate Members have been.  We have been having fights, not only yesterday in this Chamber but also in the committee on all sorts of issues, but we were pretty much at one on this Bill.  These amendments should have been brought back to the committee.  There is no reason an amending Bill could not be introduced later in the year to go through proper pre-legislative scrutiny and proper scrutiny on Committee Stage with an opportunity for amendment.  We could then agree an electoral amendment Bill that everybody is happy with.  We had an unholy row at the end of the D&aacute;il stage on amendments the Minister of State did not draft and probably did not even want to see on the floor of the D&aacute;il, and which should not have been in this Bill.  Here we are again souring the end of an important and predominantly positive piece of Oireachtas work with this set of amendments.  I do not want to oppose the amendments because I support the intention behind them but I am not convinced they are right.  Therefore, a withdrawal at this point is the correct course of action for the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300055#HHH00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1657729800,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I very much agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  Withdrawal is the responsible thing to do here.  It is worth saying that these issues were discussed at the committee.  Legislation to address these issues around online political activity was sought but to bring these amendments in now without any level of scrutiny, given the seriousness of the issues and the requirement that they be scrutinised, is the wrong approach.  They should be withdrawn and draft amendments should go to the committee to be scrutinised.  We should also be able to get expert advice on this.<\/p>  <p>  What is being attempted here needs to be done.<\/p> <p>Nothing like this has ever been done before in Ireland, certainly in terms of trying to regulate online electoral and political activity.  Having clarity around the processes and the terminology is very important.  Many of these definitions on misinformation, disinformation and so forth, and the very strong powers that are to be given to the electoral commission, rest on the definition of &ldquo;public harm&rdquo;.  The legislation defines &ldquo;public harm&rdquo; as meaning any serious threat to the fairness or integrity of an election or referendum.  Given that the Minister of State, Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Howlin and I will all have different ideas on what &ldquo;fairness&rdquo; could be, how the electoral commission decides what is fair and is not fair needs a lot of scrutiny.  That is a huge power being given to the commission that gives it the power to take decisions and issue takedown notices and everything else that can and will affect the outcome of elections.  It is a very serious responsibility that it is being given.  For us not to have clarity around that definition, not to have that properly scrutinised, not to know what are the safeguards that are being built into these powers that are been given to the commission, or not to know what level of accountability is being put on this is not acceptable.  To hand all of those powers to the commission and not to know what the thinking is behind that, to me, is deeply problematic.<\/p> <p> I hope the Minister of State can give us information on that now.  The thing to do would be to withdraw these amendments and let them be scrutinised properly, so all of us, across the political system, can be happy with these amendments and can support them, as has been done to date with the parts of the Electoral Reform Bill that were brought through the committee process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300055#HHH00400","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657730400,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I am at a disadvantage to other Members here because I did not deal with this Bill, which my colleague did, and I am not a member of the committee.  I was asked to look at these matters because my colleague has Covid.  I am deeply concerned.  I know the Ceann Comhairle is an advocate for the proper working of these Houses.  The previous D&aacute;il, perversely, because it was a minority Government, ensured there was no guillotining of Bills because the Government did not have a majority to do it.  Everything was scrutinised and everything was the better for it.  It was frustrating for Ministers occasionally, I have no doubt, and I have been on that side of the House too.  However, the notion that fundamental law is created without proper scrutiny is a disaster.<\/p>  <p>  I echo Deputy &Oacute; Broin&rsquo;s suggestion that the new amendments that had not been looked at in the Seanad should be withdrawn now.  We can pass the Bill with any amendments that are needed that are of a technical nature and then come back in the next session with a short amending Bill, with proper time for pre-legislative scrutiny and with proper committee debate and input from the experts in regard to it.<\/p>  <p>  I go back to the point I made.  There are aspects of this Bill where, if we enact it, it will not be what the Government intends it to be.  My colleague wrote a letter to the Minister of State on 6 July in regard to this Bill and the Minister of State has not replied yet.  In that letter, he legally sets out the Minister of State's stated intent and why that is not the actual wording of the Bill, and where the Minister of State briefed a journalist to say that is the intent of it, but that is not the actual impact of it.  It is clear that we need a better go at this than is being afforded in this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious that this is fundamental to the working of our democracy.  It is our electoral system.  We have been talking about an electoral commission for a generation, in truth, and it is very good that the Minister of State has got to this point and has built such a political consensus on it.  I commend the Minister of State and his officials on that.  However, he should not upset that consensus now for the sake of giving us the additional time.  We need to have the commission established and we can do all of that by passing this Bill now, but I ask the Minister of State to withdraw the amendments that are contentious and bring them back in a short amending Bill in the new session.  In that way, we can all be content that the electoral law, upon which our very democracy is based, is secure and we can buy in on a cross-party basis, which I know and believe is the Minister of State's objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300056#JJJ00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1657730400,"counter":544,"content":"<p>Points were made specifically in regard to this important part of the Bill.  I closely followed the deliberations of the Oireachtas joint committee, where it was widely debated.  I commend the committee on its deliberations at pre-legislative scrutiny stage.  These were concerns that were raised in pre-legislative scrutiny, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned.  They are fundamental citizens&rsquo; rights and fundamental to the robustness of our democracy and, from that point of view, they are very important to us.  I appreciate the comments made by Deputy Howlin in regard to the collegiate nature of bringing the Bill to this stage.  I want to reassure the Deputies that the Attorney General has been central to the drafting of these amendments.<\/p>  <p>  The definition of an online platform is consistent with the definition in Part 4 of the Bill.  Specific questions were raised by Deputy &Oacute; Broin in regard to definitions.  First, &ldquo;disinformation&rdquo; is defined in the new Part 5 to refer to false or misleading content that is spread with the intention to deceive and which may cause public harm.  Second, &ldquo;misinformation&rdquo; is broadly taken to mean false or misleading content shared without harmful intent, though the effects may still be harmful.  Finally, a broad principled approach is taken with regard to the meaning of &ldquo;manipulative or inauthentic behaviour&rdquo;, given this type of behaviour is ever-evolving, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin said.  In this regard, &ldquo;manipulative or inauthentic behaviour&rdquo; means tactics, techniques and procedures that constitute a deceptive use of services or features provided by an online platform, including user conduct, having the object of artificially amplifying the reach or perceived public support of particular content; are likely to influence the information visible to other users of the platform; by reason of their nature, character, context or any other relevant circumstance give rise to the inference that they are intended to result in the dissemination, publication or increased circulation of false or misleading online electoral information; and may cause public harm.

This demonstrates that many of the most pressing threats to the integrity of our democracy and electoral processes are based on harmful techniques for distorting or manipulating public expression.  In that context, it is important to note that the State has obligations, under both the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights, to support and protect each citizen's right to become informed about their democracy in a free and unfettered manner and the right of both citizens and representatives to participate in robust political debate under a fair and equal process.  In this regard, the new provisions explicitly require the electoral commission, in considering the exercise of its powers under this part, section 150, to consider and give due weight to the right to freedom of expression, the right to freedom of association, the right to participate in public affairs and the obligation of the State to defend and secure the fairness and integrity of elections and referendums.  It will be essential that any actions proposed by the electoral commission under this part will pass a proportionality test which will require assessment of a number of key factors, including the nature of the conduct being targeted and the extent to which it threatens election integrity to ensure that such actions are necessary and compatible with our rights under the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate the point on the establishment of the commission&rsquo;s research and advisory functions.  On that point the Deputy makes about emerging technologies and how this space is changing rapidly, that research and advisory function in the commission is critical to advising and changing how this all evolves.  I had a meeting with Technology Ireland in regard to its issues around it and assurances have been given in that regard.<\/p> <p> It is important, taking on board the points made by all the Deputies, to acknowledge our appreciation for the goodwill that was generated around the development of this Bill.  A huge amount of work has gone into it and this particular issue is an important and integral part of it.  It has been devised, as I said, in view of concerns raised by Deputies and Senators at pre-legislative scrutiny and it is an important aspect of the Bill.  The situation is evolving for us all and we probably are into new territory in terms of how we deal with these issues in Ireland.

Did the Chief Whip agree that this wonderful and novel legislation is going to turn us into a shining light of democracy across the Council of Europe area, as the Minister of State just described, or did he think it a load of codswallop and decide to give only 45 minutes of D&aacute;il time to it?

Amendment No. 82 provides for consequential alteration to the Long Title to allow for the amendments to be brought forward on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>I wish to respond to recent misleading reports in the media that the Government is trying to ram through or to rush legislation without proper scrutiny.  This is simply incorrect.<\/p> <p>The Government amendments being considered on Committee Stage are broadly technical in nature or are urgent.  For example, the few short Valuation Acts amendments are needed in advance of a legislative deadline to publish out-of-date pre-pandemic property valuations in September 2022.  The similarly brief short-term letting amendments are urgently needed to help address the current supply shortage in the private rental sector, specifically in rent pressure zones, RPZs, which are the areas of highest housing demand, thereby delivering increased numbers of units to the sector and stabilising rents.<\/p> <p> The section 31 amendments will introduce clarity and consistency of language and procedure into the ministerial direction process.  These amendments need to be operational as soon as possible in advance of the end of the summer to benefit from the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, and stakeholders such as the public, planning authorities, regional assemblies and the Minister in the review of several ongoing statutory development plans, which plans are otherwise due to be adopted by the end of the summer.  The design-flexibility provisions have been worked on for some time by my Department with the assistance of the Office of the Attorney General.  Equally, they are being applied to the maritime area planning amendments, which are urgently needed to facilitate up to eight expected large-scale applications for offshore wind farms.  Initial maritime area consents, MACs, are currently being considered by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications in advance of the commencement of a pre-planning process with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Such renewable energy projects will go a long way towards helping to achieve Ireland's renewable energy targets for 2030.  If the flexibility provisions are not in place, together with the numerous other minor technical amendments to the maritime area planning legislation, the developers might delay their application processes to wait for this innovative and useful legislation.<\/p> <p> Finally, the judicial review legislation amendments, which amount to two pages only, were proposed to address straightforward issues in the judicial review process, to help move judicial review cases on quickly and to have timely decisions on them.  As I confirmed to the House this morning, we have reflected on the concerns relating to the judicial review amendments raised by colleagues in the House and have, as a result, proposed to withdraw what was known as amendment No. 25 in the combined white list of Committee Stage amendments &ndash; that amendment appeared to be raising most concerns &ndash; so it could be reconsidered in future legislative proposals by the Government.  The remaining two judicial review proposals are quite straightforward and seek to better align our judicial review process with the provisions explicitly provided for in the EU's environmental impact assessment directive outlining that administrative processes should be exhausted before recourse is had to expensive and lengthy judicial review processes.<\/p> <p> I trust the above gives a better outline of the reasons for the inclusion of the amendments today, most of which were flagged in substance on 1 April in the Seanad.  Opposition Senators were briefed on 25 May and some Deputies attended.  Further briefings were held this week.  An hour and a half was allocated but the time was not used up because members of the Opposition ran out of questions to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300060#NNN00600","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657732800,"counter":573,"content":"<p>The Minister of State should be in a pantomime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300061#OOO00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1657732800,"counter":574,"content":"<p>Perhaps we should reset the tone of this conversation because I do not think any of us will benefit if we have a row.  We are going to have some strong disagreements about the legislation but, just as we did with the Maritime Area Planning Bill and other significant Bills, we can have a rational conversation without trying to provoke each other.  To respond directly to the Minister of State's comments, I believe the media coverage is accurate.  I will set out in as non-provocative a way as I can why I believe that to be the case.<\/p>  <p>  We should be spending the two and a half hours on the substitute consent Bill.  That is significant legislation.  Not only do Deputies on this side of the House have significant concerns about its provisions but so too do many legal experts and environmental NGOs.  We have tabled significant amendments that we wanted an opportunity to discuss.  On Thursday night last week, we received 48 pages of amendments.  To put it in context, the Bill we are meant to be debating here is 18 pages.  The amendments that are going to take up most of our time amount to 48 pages.  The Minister of State is correct that some of them are completely without controversy.  The proposed changes with respect to the OPR legislation and the Valuation Acts are relatively straightforward.  They are technical and minor, and there is no issue with them.  The amendments with respect to short-term letting provisions will be welcomed by many of us on this side of the House because, as I said this morning, a Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' Bill with the same effect was supported without Government opposition some weeks ago.  However, there are some significant questions as to whether the amendments will do what the Minister of State says they will do.  In that regard, we support their intent but want to tease them out.<\/p>  <p>  To describe amendments Nos. 25 and 26, or just amendment No. 26, as technical does not reflect the potential significance, confusion and legal delays they will cause if they are got wrong.  We can get into the detail on this when we come to it.  The amendments are at the very centre of many of the public concerns that have been expressed in the newspapers.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of the design envelope was raised during Committee Stage.  It was something the Government and Department had decided not to proceed with.  My understanding is that it is on foot of the loss of a legal challenge that these proposals are now being made.  The problem is that it is not just about wind energy in that the design envelope is also being proposed to apply to terrestrial planning, including residential planning.  If we have time, we will get to this; I hope we do.  When we were dealing with the offshore wind discussions in the context of the planning regime, some of the people made a very convincing case as to why one would need or why it would be reasonable to have some design-envelope flexibility for offshore wind projects given that they take such a long period and that the technology is advancing so rapidly.  I can, therefore, understand the logic of it; however, if the legislation is got wrong or is not drafted in the right way, what is being presented as something to meet our rapidly advancing renewable energy target deadline through wind generation could make matters more difficult.  I do not understand why the Government would apply a design envelope to residential developments.  These normally take a set period.  There is a five- or ten-year planning permission and the types of building technologies used are not stipulated in it, so I have significant concerns over how the design envelope applies to offshore wind.  I am opposed to the provision as it stands, although I will listen to the Minister of State's view on how it applies to terrestrial planning and residential developments.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to information, we are very grateful that his officials briefed us for an hour and a half.  He should keep in mind that such briefings are for officials to answer technical questions; they do not represent full scrutiny.  They entail officials providing time so we can understand what is written on the page.  With respect to the amendments before us, there will be no scrutiny by outside experts and we will not know what industry and the NGOs have to say.  We will not know what some of the legal experts in this specific area or the Irish Planning Institute have to say.  Significant, profound changes are proposed.  These are not simple technical-efficiency measures; they are significant technical changes.  Not only are we not getting enough time to debate them on Committee Stage but we are not getting time for any scrutiny at all.  We can have a row if the Minister of State wants, or we can have a rational discussion.  We might not agree at the end of it, but these changes, the substitute consent Bill and the amendments we make to it will have profound impacts on people all over this State for years to come.<\/p>  <p>  I will finish with a general comment.  The profound impacts are best seen in one of the most egregious substitute consent cases in the history of the State, that of Derrybrien.  Pretty much everyone present will know that case very well.  Since Governments repeatedly got the planning rules and regulations wrong, the communities in the part of the country in question had to live with the consequences of mistakes of this House for decades.  They are still living with those mistakes because, while substitute consent has rightly been refused, the very real issue of the remediation of the enormous amount of social, economic and environmental damage in Derrybrien has yet to be resolved.  That is before we even talk about the millions of euro in taxpayers' money spent on fines.<\/p>  <p>  We have a significant discussion to have.<\/p> <p>I hope we get through some of the amendments and I hope the Minister of State listens to some of the arguments we are making.  We are not here to mislead.  A number of us here have spent a lot of time discussing planning legislation with him.  We take this stuff seriously.  I have significant concerns, even about the portions of the amendments I am minded or open to support.  The amount of time allocated for scrutiny, debate and voting is wholly inadequate.  This is why I believe that newspaper reports are accurate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300061#OOO00300","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657733400,"counter":576,"content":"<p>A mountain fell down because all the trees on the top of it were cut down and a wind farm was built.  This had devastating consequences for a community.  If we do not get this stuff right, it has very serious consequences.  A huge number of fines were then levied on this country for years.  We are now planning major industrial development in our marine area.  We have a Government that is giving a special pass, as I see it, to a number of legacy projects that will see massive industrial development all around the near coastal area along the entire east coast and much of the rest of the country.  By any stretch it will have a big impact on people, fishers and the marine environment.  God knows what it could do to the marine environment.  If these things can make mountains fall down, they can also do a lot of damage to marine life and the marine environment if we do not get them right.  We have a Government that has given a special pass to these legacy projects.  They are all projects of private corporations.  They are not projects of the State but of private corporations interested in making money from our marine when we have the lowest number of marine protected areas anywhere in Europe.  This itself is a sign of the lack of commitment in the State to protecting our marine environment.<\/p>  <p>  Now the Government has come along with a Bill that is supposed to deal with the issues of substitute consent that arose out of Derrybrien.  It introduced a Bill on this issue, which is very serious in and of itself, and then, at the last minute in the last week of the D&aacute;il session when a deluge of legislation is being piled through and guillotined, we get dozens of pages of amendments that introduce wholly new issues.  These new amendments impact on matters such as the plans for industrial development of the marine and large-scale residential developments, which I did not mention on the previous occasion.<\/p>  <p>  Let us consider what a shambles strategic housing developments were.  Of course, they were not a shambles for the private developers and the investment funds based in Guernsey and the Virgin Islands making a fortune.  They were a shambles from a planning point of view and for the communities they impacted.  They have done nothing but worsen the housing situation.  We have major amendments that will in the case of large-scale residential developments allow developers to have flexible planning applications.  Is the Minister of State serious?  What is the basis for this?  After the mess that was made of the strategic housing developments, there will be flexible applications for the replacement of such developments.  This has serious implications for public participation, the Aarhus Convention and the credibility of the entire planning process.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State has come in here very feisty I must admit and fair play to him.  He was obviously told to come in fighting.  He is saying the amendments are technical.  There is nothing technical about it.  We have a new type of planning application for something that is very controversial, to put it mildly, as a replacement for strategic housing developments and developers can ask for a flexible application in which they do not have to give all of the details of what they will build.  Immediately alarm bells start ringing when the Government comes in and says this is technical when it is self-evidently not technical.  It is very substantial.<\/p>  <p>  The massive industrialisation of our marine environment is not technical.  We all want offshore wind and renewable energy but we are deeply concerned that we have not protected as we should have the areas where this industrialised development should not take place.  The Government wants flexible applications where circumstances could dramatically change.  These changes could have a very serious impact on our marine environment.  In case anybody says that even raising these points means we are not serious about the environment let us remember the biggest carbon sink on the planet is the sea and what lives in the sea.  If we mess up the sea and marine biology in the name of addressing climate change, we will potentially do the opposite and do more damage to the climate and to biodiversity.  These are not small issues; these are very serious issues.<\/p>  <p>  Even with regard to the measures that we like, such as those relating to short-term lets, we wonder why they are being introduced for only six months.  We need to have serious scrutiny of these matters.  What sort of enforcement will there be?  Does it mean anything if there will not be enforcement?  All of this needs to be scrutinised.  None of it will be scrutinised because of the guillotine and the fact the amendments have been introduced at the last minute.<\/p>  <p>  The briefing we got the other day was not a place to argue.  We were trying to get our heads around the massive number of amendments.  Something I asked for, as Deputy Matthews knows, is whether we could please have an explanatory memorandum to explain what the hell is in these amendments.  It was not available at the time.  Because we asked for it, it was eventually produced at 8.58 this morning.  That is when we received it.  Now we are dealing with all of these amendments and the Bill is being guillotined.  If this is not a disgrace in terms of legislation I do not know what is.  Please do not tell us it is technical.  Do not try to fool the public, the media or whoever it is the Minister of State is trying to fool by saying such things.  This is sharp practice and there is no question about it.  It is sharp practice with things that have very serious implications for our environment and the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300062#PPP00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1657733400,"counter":577,"content":"<p>This is not any way to handle legislation.  What has happened here is that the Government has rolled what is effectively seven different Bills into one.  Only one of these, the original part on substitute consent, has received any scrutiny.  It alone requires significant discussion and scrutiny on this Stage.  Parts of what the Government has brought forward at the last minute are non-controversial, such as on valuations.  The part on short-term lets is welcome but very much needs scrutiny and there is no question about this.  We have to ask why the Government is so keen to avoid scrutiny of these measures.<\/p>  <p>  It is an abuse and misuse of language to describe some of these amendments as \"technical\" and \"streamlining\".  Issues regarding judicial review go far beyond streamlining and technical amendments.  For the record, this is how the amendments were presented in the Second Stage contribution of the Minister last week.  It is how they were presented during the briefing we received on Monday.  They were passed off as streamlining technical measures.  The profoundness of some of these amendments was not given consideration.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 25 has been withdrawn and this is an admission by the Government that it got that completely wrong.  Effectively it was a get out of jail free card for An Bord Plean&aacute;la if it made mistakes or broke the law when making planning decisions.  This is an incredible thing to try to do at time when we need more accountability and safeguards in respect of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This is particularly with regard to the concentration of power in the hands of a small number of individuals who decide on a vlarge number of controversial and significant planning applications. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to get planning legislation right.  The substitute consent measures are trying to fix problems with regard to the Derrybrien wind farm.  The State has paid out or owes &euro;19.5 million in fines for making mistakes and getting legislation wrong.  This is not to mention all the consultancy costs, legal costs, time and resources on top of the &euro;19.5 million and the remediation costs that will be faced for the damage done.<\/p> <p>If we want to get this legislation right and our planning legislation right, we need to get out of the Government's mindset, which is one of trying to blame the Judiciary for the job it is doing.  Our job is to get legislation right and make sure it is clear and effective.  If we do that, there will be fewer delays in the courts and there will be fewer delays in the provision of housing and infrastructure.  The mindset on this is completely wrong.<\/p> <p> The calls from the Environmental Pillar representing 32 environmental NGOs, including the Irish Planning Institute, on this need to be respected.  The strong calls for the withdrawal of amendments Nos. 12, 13, 26, 40, 41, 42 and 77 should be listened to by the Government.  They should be withdrawn and brought back.  The Government should let them go through scrutiny.  If the Minister of State is so convinced by these different measures, why not have them scrutinised?  Why not hear from experts and get these issues thrashed out?  There seems to be a lack of confidence in the amendments the Government is rushing through, which are anything but technical and streamlining, and it does not want them to be scrutinised.  That is extremely serious.<\/p> <p> There has been no public discussion or comment on the design envelope measures being extended to large-scale residential developments.  That is a significant move, which needs to be debated and scrutinised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300062#PPP00300","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657734000,"counter":579,"content":"<p>I will raise a point about this situation we find ourselves in this evening.  Maybe the Minister of State will explain to us.  Last Thursday, when we were dealing with the Bill, the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, was here.  I do not think he has any role in it, or maybe he has.  I did not get to check his portfolio, but I thought it was education.  We should all be in education because the Government needs to learn a lot from this behaviour.  Did it not even listen to Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann when he criticised, after Christmas, the volume of legislation that he had sent to him to deal with?  Some 12 Bills will be delivered in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  This is a whole new Bill, but we were shocked when the Minister, glibly and quite arrogantly, told us that he would introduce five new sets of amendments.  I think there were six sets of amendments when they arrived.  There are 69 different amendments.  The Minister of State comes in and tells us they are mostly technical.  Many of these issues are not technical at all.  This is ham-fisted and rushed and the legislation is very serious.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State then made a plea to us on this side of the House regarding how urgent short-term lettings are.  Did the Government only find out in the past couple of weeks that there was a problem with short-term lettings?  It beggars belief.  I do not know what is driving the Government, who it is working for or whatever.<\/p>  <p>  Not so long ago, we dealt with the Maritime Area Planning Act and there are a plethora of amendments before us again and the Government is telling us that if we do not take them now and deal with them, we might not reach our 2030 climate targets.  Is it only now the Government found that out?  We have been telling it that for ages.  Until such a time as we reach the targets that we have set, we must keep our lights on in some form or other, to keep them working and to have some kind of energy.  It will be slow, difficult and challenging, but we cannot sign a blank cheque here for wind developers or whoever else offshore.  I am not against this development, but we certainly need time to scrutinise it because there is ecology and wildlife in the sea that has to be protected as well.  It is very sharp practice and very poor.  <\/p>  <p>  In conjunction with this, there is an inquiry going on into An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  What will Joe public think about this?  Many felt they did not get a fair hearing.  Many of whom I am dealing with in my constituency have had issues with planning, went to appeal, the inspectors of An Bord Plean&aacute;la came down and did the job they are employed to do and gave a report.  We now know that the reports, 90% of the time, were rejected by a few members of the board.  We did not know before.  I have no insight.  There there only three members looking at the report and adjudicating.  What is the point in paying the inspectors, if this is going to go on?  First, there was nothing in this inquiry, then there was more and then there was nothing and then we saw a resignation on Friday night last week of a pretty senior person.<\/p>  <p>  Confidence in the planning system is at an all-time low.  My county, Tipperary, just finished its county development plan after considerable work.  I thank the planners and the councillors who finished it D&eacute; Luain, last Monday.  A lot of work has to bed in and settle.  We will have to live with that plan for the next five years.  We had the last plan for seven years because of Covid, delays and everything else.<\/p>  <p>  The only way we found out about An Bord Plean&aacute;la was because of judicial reviews and now, I think, the Government will try to curtail them as well.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the legislation, certainly, is to deal with a Supreme Court case, but it is kind of dealt with in such a way as to tell those learned gentlemen across the river with the wigs and gowns, not to mess with the Government, because it can change the rules to make them more compliant.  I am very disappointed.<\/p>  <p>  I am very disappointed because I know the Minister of State and I knew him before ever he was in government to be reasonable and flexible but I think he is spending too much time with the Minister.  How could I forget his name?  I call the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, the new Rambo from Dublin north because the arrogance is oozing out of him.  I would not mind if anything meaningful was being done, such as building houses that we need for the people but, instead, we are told that we are shameful and not right or responsible by not accepting these amendments.  I think the Minister of State said the Government has withdrawn amendment No. 25 relating to the judicial reviews, but the Government would not withdraw any of them if it was not challenged and he was critical of the media.<\/p>  <p>  There is a duty on us to interrogate, examine and try to amend or point out the flaws in legislation, but we cannot do that with no time.  When I questioned this last week, I was told flippantly by the Minister that we would have a briefing last Monday.  However, some of us have commitments in constituencies and we cannot just come in at the drop of a hat, because the Government has forced us in to giving a briefing on a Monday.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett said, the only explanatory memorandum that arrived came this morning at two minutes to nine.  <\/p>  <p>  In fairness to the Bills Office and the drafters of legislation, they have worked all night some nights recently.  It is totally unfair on those good people who do great work.  It is totally unfair to foist all this legislation, not only this Bill, but the five other Bills we have today, on them and expect them to work through the night to deal with them.  The best people in the world will make mistakes in those kinds of situations, such as typos, due to lack of sleep and being tired.  The Government could teach some of the dictators and their regimes out foreign about sleep deprivation.  It is a mess.  It is like filling a mixer when mixing concrete.  The Government has fired everything into the mix and hopes it will come out in a good mix, but it will not.  It will come out in a Dolly Mixture or like Liquorice Allsorts, and we will not have anything decent as a result.<\/p>  <p>  No regulatory impact analysis has been done on any of the legislation, especially this legislation, to see how it will bed in.  There is no review clause.  There is nothing.  It is wild west kind of legislation, which goes from An Bord Plean&aacute;la and short-term lets and the maritime Bill with regard to wind, to giving more power to the OPR.  How did we ever manage in our little country before we had that office?  I remember being on the county council back in the 1990s and again in the 2000s drafting county development plans.  We did not have to be looking over our shoulders or to be browbeaten by the OPR and told at every step that the office would not accept this. <\/p>  <p>  Are we taking away every last vestige of power that the elected members of the county councils have in the making of the plan?<\/p> <p>We had to fight with management and could never get independent legal advice because it was not available to us.  We had to take the same legal advice the manager got, which was totally unfair and discriminatory, unless we wanted to pay for it ourselves.  That was prohibitive and councillors could not do it.  Now we have the Office of the Planning Regulator as well.<\/p> <p> We now have all these officers and offices with brass plates on the walls, fancy furniture and nice jobs for the boys.  I said this last week and I will say it again.  I think Deputy Matthews is still here.  He was critical of me for criticising NGOs and An Taisce.  I make my criticism without fear or favour because what An Taisce did with regard to the Glanbia cheese plant in Kilkenny was nothing short of national sabotage.  I am being repetitive now but the Acting Chairman might allow me to continue.  An Taisce had no issue with the plant, the emissions licence, the planning or anything else.  Its issue was with the herd number.  How could we have a situation where An Taisce was able to object to this and go to the courts with it three or four times, I believe, and threaten to go the European court as well?  In fairness to the Taoiseach, who I do not give much praise, he did say to me one day here that this system of judicial reviews would have to be looked at.  Thank God, the sod was turned on the plant two weeks ago and it has commenced.  We are so lucky the Dutch investors stayed with us and stayed the course because this would not happen in many other places.  Now it is being built.<\/p> <p> Meanwhile, we were lorrying big laden trucks full of milk up to Strathroy and all over the country.  There was no talk of the carbon footprint of that.  That case shows the narrow-mindedness and pettiness of An Taisce.  When Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and I, along with colleagues, had a meeting with the An Taisce we got nothing but disdain.  I was never against An Taisce because it did great work on tidying villages, heritage, the Green Flag scheme and much else.  I am not dismissing it and saying it should stay at that but I question its role with that Glanbia plant and in many other areas.  Its staff are do-gooders who are well-paid, well-heeled and many of them are retired from senior positions on good pensions.  The trouble An Taisce is putting householders and people who want to build their own homes through is nothing short of disgraceful.<\/p> <p> I am not reckless; we want good planning.  However, I must pick Deputy Boyd Barrett up on one point.  His good colleague, Deputy Gino Kenny, was down walking my mountains, as I call them, the Knockmealdown Mountains, two weeks ago.  All Deputies are welcome.  Deputy Boyd Barrett might come sometime but I do not know how he would move a mountain.  He said a mountain was moved at Derrybrien.

It smacks of pure disrespect for the Opposition and everybody else.  It will be wide open for legal challenges.<\/p>  <p>  I am in favour of houses being built and everything else but I am not in favour of the big conglomerates building numerous houses.  They can get ease of access to planning and adjust it as they go along.  That is not good legislation either.  We must think of the small people, na daoine beaga, who want to build a house.

I am very disappointed at the way this Bill has come to us.  The Minister of State might give me an explanation, if he can, as to why it was the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, who was here last week dealing with this legislation.

I have been in the D&aacute;il a relatively short time but even people who have been here much longer would expect a Bill that enters on First Stage and is debated on Second Stage would bear a general similarity to the Bill that emerges at the end of the process with respect to content and intent.  That cannot be said about this legislation.  To paraphrase Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, one Bill went in but nearly seven came out, with the stuff that has been added late.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State indicated that this was flagged in April and late May.  What was not flagged to anybody at the committee, spokespersons or the House was that we would have an avalanche of 48 pages of amendments dropped on the last voting day of this session.  That is not to say, unfortunately, that this is unexpected from this Government because this is becoming how business is done.  However, planning and development has a long, sorry and negatively impactful history on communities all over our country but also on faith and trust in politics, which have been at a low for a number of decades now.  If we get to the root of that, it is due to bad planning and bad development.<\/p>  <p> That is why when it comes to scrutiny and debating legislation, we need to have time and space.  That applies especially for smaller groups and parties when we are dealing with complex areas of planning.  It is not just that it goes to the spokesperson who will have one staff member.  A large amount of resources are needed to engage with the various stakeholders, NGOs, legal experts and planning experts.  We in Opposition owe it to the people to hold the Government to account and we need to be able to do that work.  The Government is denying us the ability to do that through the way it is bringing legislation to this House.<\/p>  <p>  Take a number of the concerns we have.  On the whole, the short-term lettings measures appear to be okay but we still have not debated them.  Research carried out by our housing spokesperson, Senator Moynihan, indicated the problems with short-term lets are happening outside the rent pressure zones and throughout the country, including all along the western seaboard, but the Bill only refers to the RPZs.  That issue would have been discussed in the committee or in pre-legislative scrutiny if the Government had been honest and played with a straight bat on Bill.<\/p>  <p>  We can look at the initial reaction of various groups.  We have An Taisce and the Environmental Pillar raising concerns about this.  Who is welcoming it?  That it is the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, welcoming it is what tells the tale.  This is what gets all our backs up, raises our antennae and has us asking what is happening here and what stroke is being pulled.  The Minister of State came in here and told us this is technical.  I am sorry but no Bill of 18 pages should come out the other side following technical amendments alone at 48 pages.  Those are not technical amendments but wholesale change of legislation on planning and development at the eleventh hour that could impact short-term lets, our offshore and onshore, maritime area planning and the whole shebang.  It is an awful way to do legislation and politics.  To bring forward in this way legislation on an issue with such a troubling history in such a troubling time, given what is going on in An Bord Plean&aacute;la, means any faith we have in this Government to deal with planning and development is absolutely obliterated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300064#RRR01700","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1657734600,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I too am very concerned by the rushing of this Bill.

This Bill being rushed through like this will be at the expense of many hard-working people who are trying to do their best, create jobs and provide infrastructure.

They know their areas and the needs of the people.  We must consider the people of today who are creating jobs and employing people.  Those are the people we must respect and for whom we must try to do our best.<\/p> <p> The Government has been in office for two years and it has green all over it.  There has been talk of doing this and that for years, green energy and so forth.  How is it that the Government could not get the Bill right without the need to throw in so many amendments at the last minute?  Why could the Government not put its work together and have it ready?  It was unable to get it ready in the first place.  We are now past Second Stage.  Surely this Bill should have been tied up properly and not rushed through the Chamber at the last minute.

I know of one farm of 365 acres that was in a special area of conservation, SAC.  The local authority, in its wisdom, granted the young fellow permission to be near his ageing parents and allowed him to build a house on the 365 acres.  That application was challenged by An Taisce and sent to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  An inspector came down and agreed with the grant of permission but other members of the board refused it.  The man in question is now living 20 miles away from his elderly mother, who is living alone.  His father has died and he was the only one who was able to drive.  The son is in and out of the place every day but cannot live there with his family because he was denied that right by An Taisce, which is supposedly composed of good people.  That is what they did to this poor couple.  The same thing has happened in several other instances.

Kerry County Council, in its wisdom, granted permission.  The inspector came down and agreed with that decision.  However, the application went back to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and was refused.  That is where the matter lies.  I am sorry that is the case because the people involved are good and hard-working.  This is what An Taisce did to them.  I do not agree with An Taisce and will never stand with it when it hurts people like that.  The people it hurts are human beings.  I will never forgive An Taisce for that while there is blood running through my veins.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill amends the Planning and Development Act 2000 to regulate substitute consent procedures for applications regularising existing developments and requiring retrospective environmental impact assessments.  It will provide for a single-stage application process.  It allows for simultaneous applications for any future development to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  These are all going to be referred to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, along with substitute consent for all developments.  It also allows for the refusal to consider applications for retention of unauthorised developments in certain cases.  That is wrong.  If we do not allow an applicant the right to due process, it is undemocratic.  It is unfair for someone who may be employing people and delivering infrastructure to communities.  It would be unfair for someone to be deprived.  Who would decide?  Is it An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  Is it the regulator?  That is of concern to me.  Who is going to make that decision?  It is clearly not going to be the local authorities or county councillors.  Who is going to make the decision?  Will it be some unelected official, as Deputy Mattie McGrath said, in a mansion of an office somewhere but nobody knows where and nobody knows the person or people making the decisions?<\/p>  <p>  I will move on to consider offshore wind turbines and maritime planning.  I know the Government is rolling out offshore wind projects on the eastern side of the country.  I am far away from those people but I know they are very concerned about what is happening off the coast of Wicklow and Dublin.  They have issues and they have not been and will not be heard.  This Bill will be rammed through and those people will not be allowed a say.  No one will hear their concerns.  It will be much the same off the west coast of Kerry where issues also arise.  I am not much of a fisherman and I do not know much about the sea but I do know that in all cases, trawlers, boats and fishermen have certain routes through the bay or the ocean because there are impediments of one kind or another.  They have their routes in the same way as the planes in the sky have theirs.  There is one route and that is the route they have to use for safety and many other reasons.  I hope those people will not be infringed upon because they have been hurt enough already.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also deals with RPZs and Airbnb.  It seems to me and many other people that the Government thinks those measures will sort out the housing problem.  I can tell the Minister of State that he has no hope in the world in that regard.  People who do short-term lets will never do long-term lets.  They have their reasons.  If they have to, they will give it up, and most likely they will.  The Government will certainly not benefit from those houses.  There are other Members here shouting for that and looking to end short-term lettings.  It will not affect or help the people who are on housing lists.  It will hurt people in rural areas of Kerry, such as Killarney, which was declared an RPZ by a Deputy in this Chamber.<\/p> <p>It was meant to be for Killarney town but it has been brought out to large part of east Kerry where people used to let their second house, maybe the old family house that they did up on the farm, and derived a little bit of income from it for perhaps three or four months of the summer.  Kerry is a lovely place today and in fine weather, but it is not so attractive to tourists in the winter when it is rainy and places are not green any more.  Short-term lets were attracting a certain type of tourists to rural places.  The local pubs, shops and whatever else in the local village benefited from a few extra people being around for the few months.  If Deputies are going to stop short-term lettings, and there are other Deputies here who will vote against it, I can guarantee that these people will not rent their houses long term.  They have no notion of doing it, never did it and will not do it in the future.<\/p> <p> The Government is wasting a lot of time with this effort.  The way to help people who are on the housing list, as Lemass and de Valera did back in 1960s or whenever, is to build social and council houses.  People were housed then and they also built rural cottages.  The local authorities gave out demountable homes but are stopped from doing that now.  Unless there is a fire or a flood, the local authority will not bring out a demountable home.  However, they used to before.  If a house fell down or the roof fell in now and it was so bad that there were no windows or doors in it, they will not bring out a demountable home now.  Rather, they will try to force the person into some rented accommodation in the nearest town or village and there might not be a town or village anywhere near the person.<\/p> <p> I know of one person who died in his van.  I am sad about because I raised it with the Minister of State.  I thank him for coming back to me about it.  I will be fair to every man and woman.  The Minister of State did come back to me on that.  However, the man has died since, so I will not be on about him any more.  He died in a van because we could not get a demountable home out to him.  If the local authority wishes to bring one out, it has to look for planning permission and do so many other things that it would take 12 months.  It used to be called emergency housing, but it is not emergency housing any more.  <\/p> <p> I hear that some other kind of houses can now be built now and the Government wants to build a lot of them for other types of people in bigger towns or cities with no problem and without any planning permission.  I do not think that is fair.  I am very concerned that we are wasting time getting rid of Airbnb and other short-term lets because it will not help the housing situation one iota.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300065#SSS00500","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657735800,"counter":604,"content":"<p>To bring some clarity to the situation, this Bill started off as the substitute consent Bill, which was how we referred to it.  It came to the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage back in 2021.  There was a request to waive pre-legislative scrutiny on it because of an urgent matter to deal with.  The committee refused, but we acted speedily and availed of a briefing with the Department officials.  We have had many briefings with the Department officials on some of the very complex planning amendment legislation and planning Acts we had to pass over the past two years.  I acknowledge the Department and officials are always available to us to brief the committee members.<\/p>  <p>  The main parts of the substitute consent Bill are to streamline and tidy it up.  There is nothing wrong with streamlining or tidying up planning processes.  We have a planning system that has been amended multiple times over the past ten years and it is difficult to follow.  We have a massive amount of EU law, European law and environmental directives transposed into Irish law.  It is a difficult area, which is why I welcome the review of the planning system.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to this Bill being brought to us in committee, as committee members may remember, we had just passed another Bill, the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act.  That was done speedily and quickly in response to the Ballysax court case on the two-stage leave process for substitute consent.  An exceptionality was looked at in the leave to apply stage and then public participation in the second stage.  We had a barrier between public participation, a very important part of substitute consent, which is the judgment of exceptionality.  What Government did was move to remove that barrier to provide for public consultation at the exceptionality stage.  That was a good move.  <\/p>  <p>  The members of the committee moved speedily.  I think the court case was in June 2020 and by December 2020, we had passed that Bill.  Within six months, we had addressed a barrier to public participation in the planning system in very complex, difficult environmental law.  That is to our credit.  I am glad the committee supported that.  It just goes to show that not everything the Government is trying to do in planning is somehow underhanded, rushed or not in the public interest, as it is being presented here tonight.  The core principles of our Planning and Development Act are sustainability and proper planning underlined by the principle of the common good.  Many of the amendments to this Bill are for the common good and I am happy support many of them.<\/p>  <p>  I will not spend much time on this because there are a number of amendments and we want to get to them.  I noticed the Opposition voted not even to proceed and against Second Stage, in other words, not even to allow us to proceed to Committee Stage to scrutinise these amendments.  In a way, that is shutting down the debate.  I am happy to see the amendments discussed and debated and explained by the Minister of State, with and opportunity provided for him to take amendments or modify some that have been tabled.  We do that on Committee Stage and we have seen that regularly on Committee Stage in the Select Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage at any rate.  I do not expect tonight to be any different, but we will see how that goes.<\/p>  <p>  The measure on short-term lettings is a very positive move because it was practically impossible for local authorities to enforce the changes that were brought previously.  That included chasing down advertising on various platforms and keeping track of houses where planning permission had been sought.  It makes sense to penalise people who seek to have short-term lettings, thereby removing the house from use as long-term housing, which we all know is so badly needed in this country.  In addition, it makes sense to impose substantial fines on somebody who is not willing to comply with the law in that regard and make it easier for planning authorities to enact that law.  They are under enough pressure as it is without imposing on them legislation that was difficult and stressful to apply. <\/p>  <p>  I suggest that where a short-term let property is advertised and the owner has availed of planning permission, the planning file number should be available or easily found on the advertisement.  This is to prove that the property has planning permission and to ensure the would-be occupier of the property - the person who may wish to rent it - can be certain of compliance with planning.  People want to be sensible and rent something that is compliant with the law.<\/p>  <p>  On the ministerial directives under section 31, I note the wide criticism of the Planning Regulator.  To be honest, if we had a strong planning regulator 20 years ago, we would not have had the Mahon tribunal, for a start, and we probably would not have had many of the very poor planning decisions we have seen across this country.  Planning decisions made in local authorities by county councillors are often taken against the professional advice of their senior planners, the chief executive, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the National Transport Authority, NTA, or expert groups such as An Taisce.  We often see decisions to zone land or include other planning objectives into a plan.  The Planning Regulator, which was an outcome of the Mahon tribunal, is tasked with ensuring that those plans are compliant with national or regional planning frameworks.  I would support more powers for the Planning Regulator.  I am not suggesting that we withdraw powers from local authorities.  <\/p> <p>Where those powers and that responsibility lie with councillors, however, they must employ and use those powers reasonably rather than trying to insert objectives that do not comply with national planning guidance.  That is why we have sprawl as well as transport emissions arising from people living two-hour commutes from the city and being stuck in traffic all day, with the associated high costs.  It is why we have dormitory towns that people leave at 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and to which they do not return until late in the evening.  They are not able to participate in their communities.  That is the result of poor planning.  It is what bad planning is about.  Inserting in a development plan an objective that does not comply with national planning is not doing a favour for somebody.  It might be doing a favour for one or two individuals but it deprives the public of the common good that should be enshrined in planning.  I welcome the amendments to section 31 that we will discuss later.<\/p> <p> I have not read the amendments to the Valuation Act in detail.  I briefly read through them.  They do not cause me any concern.<\/p> <p> The changes to the Maritime Area Planning Act are sensible.  They do not strike me as particularly controversial but I look forward to discussing them in greater detail if and when we get to them further on in the Bill.<\/p> <p> As regards the issue on flexibility in design, I support that.  I support that we need flexibility in certain types of planning applications, primarily in the context of the highly technical and quickly evolving machines that are being put in place offshore.  Those turbines are in development all the time to achieve greater efficiencies, such as greater internal efficiencies that might result in a turbine needing wider blades but a lower hub or, in some cases, a higher hub.  All those design criteria have to be taken into account.  There is a long time lag between submitting a detailed plan at planning application stage and then purchase and construction and putting the machines in the sea.  Significant changes can happen in that time and we need to provide that flexibility.  We know we need to develop offshore wind.  We know the potential it has.  That has been highlighted by the war in Ukraine and the difficulties with where much of Europe currently sources its fossil fuels.  We need to get off those fuels.  Doing so is eminently sensible.  We need a planning system that is flexible enough to allow that but confined enough to allow planners to make a decision.  We do not want planners to be put in a position where the flexibility is so wide, it leaves decisions wide open to judicial review or another review or appeal, but in addition, we do not want them to be unable to make a decision on the facts in front of them.  There needs to be good guidance for planners in this regard so there is no subjectivity when it comes to what is acceptable in the context of flexibility and what is not.  I have spoken to people who are knowledgeable in this area and they have expressed concerns about the method that is being used to do it.  I support the concept of it but there are questions in respect of the method we are applying here today.<\/p> <p> As regards judicial review, I am glad amendment No. 25 has been removed or deferred.  It was a leap too far.  It was sensible to withdraw the amendment at this stage.  As the Minister of State is aware, the programme for Government contains an agreement to review and reform judicial review.  That is needed for all sides that wish to take a judicial review.  It is often a neighbourhood group or non-professionals who come together and take a real risk in taking on the very onerous task of seeking judicial review.  They do so because they are seeking justice in the planning system and access to justice.  We could never deny that access to justice.  Access to justice is one of the tenets of a free democracy.  If needed, I will stand up every day and fight for people's right of access to justice.  I am glad amendment No. 25 to section 50 has been removed.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 26 - it was amendment No. 11 in the Minister's list of amendments - relates to the exhaustion of the appeals process.  To my knowledge and understanding, it is generally at the end of the appeals process when all avenues have been exhausted and a decision has been made that leave for judicial review is granted.  That is common practice at the moment.  There are a very low number of cases.  I know the case brought by the North East Pylon Pressure Campaign is referred to quite often.  There are probably a few more cases in which a judicial review was granted before it was exhausted.  To put into law what is commonly being done provides a little more surety in the system.  It is not especially controversial.  We will have to streamline judicial review, and decisions along the lines of this will have to be taken at some stage.<\/p> <p> The second part of amendment No. 26 relates to remitting to the planning authority by the courts.  That, too, is something that is generally happening.  There have been cases, however, in which a judge has remitted it right back to square one when that may not have been necessary.  That has caused delay in cases where the development or application, if rectified, may have been compliant.  The applications were sent back a stage too far.  I do not see how an applicant for development having the opportunity to ask a judge to remit the application back to the planning authority stage is a barrier to access to judicial review.  The judicial review is complete at that stage.  The decision has been made and the applicant for development is requesting the judge to remit it back to a certain stage.  I do not see that as a barrier.<\/p> <p> I will leave it at that.  I look forward to speaking on further amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300066#TTT00200","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657736400,"counter":606,"content":"<p>I will comment briefly on a few points.  I hope our dealings in the context of the Maritime Area Planning Act demonstrate that I have listened to the Opposition.  We took a series of amendments from the Opposition, withdrew some amendments and came back on Report Stage with further amendments in consultation with the Opposition.  I firmly put that on the record.  We have listened today in terms of our withdrawal of amendment No. 25 due to concerns raised.  Deputy Matthews rightly articulated those concerns.<\/p>  <p>  I did not say that all these amendments are technical in nature, as was suggested by some Members.  I said that some of them are technical and some are urgent in nature.  I specifically went through each of the sections to which I referred and the category of each amendment.<\/p>  <p>  I did not criticise the media.  I referred to reports in the media in terms of contributions that were made in respect of the Bill being rushed.  I wish to be clear on that.  I gave my rationale.  Some members of the Opposition are passionate and make strong contributions.  I, too, have the right to stand up for my case.  I hope we can do that respectfully across the House, as is fair and reasonable.<\/p>  <p>  As regards comments in respect of the design envelope and housing, obviously, that is already custom and practice in the courts due to a High Court decision, but it is the planning authority that adjudicates on that.<\/p>  <p>  As regards flexibility in the context of applications, that puts public consultation at the heart of the planning process.  Citizens get to see every option in front of them and those options have to be presented when the application goes through the local authority rather than having a series of separate planning applications.  That is reasonable and balanced.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to judicial review, we have withdrawn amendment No. 25.  In terms of the administrative process, this involves a small number of cases, as was rightly pointed out, but there being a process that should be utilised before a judicial review is taken gives consistency.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to other aspects that have been referred to in the context of a planning application going back to a previous stage, that is already custom and practice.  The courts have already determined that in a number of applications.  Again, it underwrites that with statutory certainty, which is important.<\/p> <p>The changes in respect of the Planning Regulator are important.<\/p> <p> Sometimes when listening to the varied responses from the Opposition, particularly hearing, first, that people should be allowed object whenever they want and then, second, the same person giving out about someone taking a judicial review against a particular case.  It would be hard for a legislator to respond to some of those comments.  I want to say clearly and firmly that, as a citizen and as someone who was democratically elected to this House, I am firm in my belief that the right of the public to challenge a public decision should be protected.  That is very important.  My issue is that it should be adjudicated on in a timely manner and the vehicle to do that should be very clear in our primary legislation.  That is what we are about.  I am quite prepared to work with Members of the Opposition, as I hope have demonstrated in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300067#UUU00200","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657737000,"counter":608,"content":"<p>The Minister of State would go a long way to convince us that is true if, in the same way he withdrew amendment No. 25, he would withdraw amendments Nos. 12, 13, 40, 41, 42 and 47.

In this correction the Government recognises the issue of a significant number of properties that have been withdrawn from the long-term rental market in recent years that have instead been diverted to use in short-term lettings.  This has had significant negative impacts on the supply and availability of private residential rental accommodation, especially in RPZs which are urban areas of highest housing demand, with further knock-on implications for rental prices in these areas.  This trend has been facilitated in particular by the use of online platforms.  We need to get more properties in the long-term private rental market to help meet demand and the accommodation shortage in this area, specifically in RPZs which, as I have indicated, are the urban areas of highest housing demand.  These pressures on the private rental sector have been further exacerbated by the recent and likely future arrival of large numbers of people fleeing from Ukraine into the State who are in need of medium- and long-term accommodation.<\/p><p>This amendment essentially proposes that for an initial six-month period, which period may be extended for a further six months subject to positive resolutions by both Houses of the Oireachtas, non-principal private residences in RPZs shall not be advertised or accept bookings on online platforms or other media for short-term letting purposes without the necessary planning permission for such use being put in place in respect of the property concerned or the property concerned being otherwise exempted.  The amendment further gives the Minister regulation-making powers to require the owners of short-term letting properties or their nominated agents to provide evidence of planning compliance as certified by the planning authority or exemption from same for the purpose of confirming entitlement to advertise a non-principal private residence located in an RPZ and on an online platform or other media.<\/p><p>We will be looking at regulations to resolve the issue Deputy Matthews raised regarding the planning permission number.  In addition, the amendment proposes that non-compliance with these provisions shall be an offence for both individual property owners concerned and the online platforms or other media who facilitate the advertising of non-principal private residences in RPZs.  Offences for non-compliance with the provisions will, in each individual case, be subject to a class A fine under the planning Act, that is, up to &euro;5,000 or six months in prison or both, with a further possibility of a fine of up to &euro;1,500 per day in each day the offence continues.<\/p><p>It is my intention that, further to the supplementary regulations to be made subsequent to the enactment of this Bill, the new arrangements in regard to the advertising of non-principal private residences in RPZs will apply from 1 September next, which commencement shall be confirmed by way of commencement order to be signed further to the enactment of this Bill.  I have outlined these new regulatory controls in the short-term letting sector will be in place for an initial period of six months during which time it is envisaged that the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and F&aacute;ilte Ireland will work towards the establishment of a new registration system for short-term letting properties, as committed to in Housing for All and with a view to ensuring homes are used to best effect in the areas of highest housing need.  However, should there be any delay in the establishment of the new F&aacute;ilte Ireland registration system, it will be possible to extend the provisions proposed in this amendment for a further six-month period subject to a positive resolution by both Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>In regard to enforcement of the new provisions, the new rules should be much more straightforward to enforce than the pre-existing 2019 provisions.  In this connection, the online platforms will be required to associate an indicator with each property advertised on their platforms to confirm they are planning-compliant.  It should be relatively easy for the planning authorities to check from their own planning records whether these indicators are valid and without the need to inspect the properties concerned.  Where the indicators are not valid or where properties are advertised without the necessary indicators, enforcement action can be pursued against individual property owners concerned as well as the online platforms advertising the properties concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300068#VVV01200","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1657737000,"counter":621,"content":"<p>This is a set of amendments that I support in principle but I require a number of clarifications, if the Minister of State does not mind.  I am confused as to how this new set of regulations, the existing planning requirements and the future F&aacute;ilte Ireland registration or licensing process will interact.  Will the Minister of State talk us through whether the planning requirements as currently exist under what I call the Eoghan Murphy regulations will continue to exist or if they will they be replaced by the F&aacute;ilte Ireland registration requirement?  If it is the latter, how does a local authority determine whether a property should be a short-term or a long-term let?  While there are huge inadequacies with the enforcement of the previous set of regulations, there is a value in a planning authority being able to make a decision in terms of whether a property should get the change of use or not.  If the Minister of State will talk us through that, that is very important.<\/p>  <p>  The second thing is, why six months?  Does that imply that, if and when F&aacute;ilte Ireland has its registration process in place, there will not be a sanction on platforms for advertising properties that are not compliant with the new rules?  Will the Minister of State clarify that for us as well?<\/p>  <p>  Also, in regard to the timelines, to be clear, when does the Minister of State expect this legal obligation on platforms to take effect?  When can the local authority I presume, actually start cleaning up the act?  I was quite appalled by the Airbnb statement I read in the newspapers the other day.<\/p> <p>It has been facilitating law-breaking for a number of years.  During Covid, many properties went out for short-term let, but it has been knowingly and willingly advertising properties that do not have either appropriate exemption or planning permission.  It has been profiting from it and it is doing it now.  It is important, whatever the Government does here, that it is clear when it starts so that we can all monitor to ensure Airbnb cleans up its act and stops facilitating illegal planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300068#VVV01300","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657737600,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 4:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn the second line of subsection (1B), proposed to be inserted by section 2(a), after &quot;fine&quot; to insert &quot;or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both, or on conviction on indictment, to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both&quot;. <\/blockquote>  <p>In relation to my amendments and the class A fines proposed here, the maximum fine in Barcelona for a platform that advertises an illegal short-term let is &euro;600,000.

Will the Minister of State clarify that fine of &euro;5,000 applies to platforms as well in terms of their advertising?

There is a housing rental crisis throughout the country, not only in RPZs.  That is why I am wondering why areas outside of RPZs are not getting protection here.<\/p><p>Does the Minister of State acknowledge there is a real issue with the way RPZ rules are written because 77 local electoral areas are not currently classified as RPZs and are unlikely ever to be classified as such because of the way those rules are written?  They have insufficient data, there are not 30 registrations of new tenancies each quarter that justifies them even being considered a RPZ, and the rules around average rents include cities such as Cork, Limerick and Galway.

It is against the law but companies are doing it.

I do not understand that.  Maybe I am missing something.  If the Minister of State can explain it, that is fine.  If it is illegal and they should not be doing it, why would the prohibition on it be only for six months?  I do not understand that.  Surely if they do not have the permission and they do not have the exemption, they should not be doing it and any penalties that apply to the owner or the platform advertising should apply because they are not complying with the law.

What is essentially proposed is that the penalties to be applied should be a class A fine with the term of imprisonment being increased to up to 12 months on summary conviction and up to two years on conviction on indictment.  As I outlined in my remarks on the Government amendment on this point, it is proposed that the penalties to be applied for non-compliance will be the standard class A fine, which is up to &euro;5,000, six months' imprisonment or a combination of both, with the possibility of further fines of up to &euro;1,500 for each day the offence continues.<\/p>  <p>  These penalties, which will be applicable to both property owners and online platforms, are appropriate and will provide sufficient deterrent or a disincentive effect if properly enforced by planning authorities.  In this connection, robust enforcement by planning authorities will be key in ensuring the proposed new short-term letting provisions will have their intended effect.  Accordingly, I must oppose Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment on the fines being applied in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The second amendment proposed by Deputy O'Callaghan would, if accepted, result in the proposed new short-term letting provisions being applicable not only to RPZs but also to other areas in the country.  Legal advice provided to the Department in this regard indicates that for a measure to be able to withstand legal challenge, it must be balanced and reasonable as well as proportionate to the objective it seeks to achieve.  The principal areas where there is a shortage of long-term private rental accommodation is in designated RPZs, which are the urban areas of the highest housing demand.  We need to get more properties into the long-term private rental market to help meet the demand and accommodation shortage in these designated areas.  There is less of an acute shortage of long-term rental accommodation in areas outside of designated RPZs where rental prices are not as high.  Therefore, having regard to the legal advice provided by the Department, it is likely the measure could be deemed disproportionate if extended nationwide.  Deputies will be aware of the specific criteria an RPZ must meet.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding other queries that have been raised about the Planning and Development Act, this new regime, as soon as the law is enacted and the regulations are prepared, will come into effect quite quickly.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding planning requirements, the same criteria that currently apply for the granting of change of use will continue to apply and will transfer over to the F&aacute;ilte Ireland registration system.  As we pointed out, there are three revisions.  The first is that a non-principal private residence in an RPZ cannot accept a booking online.  Previously, it was in relation to the property owners.  That is bringing more clarity - a clear line of sight.  The second redefines so that the Minister can make the regulations in terms of the specific nature.  The third relates to the class A fine that I referred to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300069#WWW00400","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1657737600,"counter":626,"content":"<p>The Minister of State did not answer my question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300069#WWW00500","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1657737600,"counter":627,"content":"<p>It may well be I did not understand the answer as oppose to it was not answered.  The Minister of State said that the change of use function will transfer to the F&aacute;ilte Ireland registration.  It is important we clarify that.  Right now, if I am a property owner, I apply to the local authority for a change of use or I write and I get my exemption.  When F&aacute;ilte Ireland takes over this responsibility, will I still have to apply for a change of use or will I simply go to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for it to register me, and if I go to it to register me, who has the ability to make the decision as to whether it is appropriate for a short-term let or a long-term let in the location concerned because that is a planning decision?  Will the Minister of State clarify that transition?<\/p>  <p>  When the change of use function transfers to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, will the fines for the advertising of non-compliant properties continue, and if so, why is there only a six-month relevant period, albeit to be extended in this?  I am still not clear on the interaction of those.<\/p> <p> On RPZs, the criteria the Minister of State set out, particularly with respect to larger urban areas and higher rents, may have been the case when the RPZ legislation was introduced in 2016.  Anybody who has been looking at what is happening with rents in rural counties outside RPZs for the past 12 to 18 months will know there have been increases.  In fact, rents in County Galway are now higher than they are in the city, and it is the same in counties Donegal, Roscommon and Leitrim.  The scale of rent increases there is huge.  The Minister of State is not going to deal with that today, but I urge the Department to re-examine that issue, because Deputy Cian O'Callaghan makes a very important point that needs to be addressed at some stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300069#WWW00600","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657738200,"counter":629,"content":"<p>I want my question to be absolutely clear.  I think it is a similar question to Deputy &Oacute; Broin&rsquo;s, although the Minister of State is not quite getting it.  As I read it, for the next six months, if someone advertises a short-term residential tenancy for which they do not have permission for a change of use or an exemption, they will be breaking the law and they will be fined and, potentially, imprisoned.  However, in six months' time, unless the Minister renews it, they can advertise a tenancy for which they do not have permission and which is in breach of the law, and they will not be subject to a fine or imprisonment.  I do not understand that.  If someone should not be doing short-term lets because they have not got permission to do them, then why would there be a six-month expiry date on the penalties for advertising that?  Unless I am missing something, this is an example of what happens when there is rushed legislation.  It does not make any sense.  There should be no expiry date on that.

Deputy &Oacute; Broin is right that when these rules were first written, it was probably envisaged that we would not have the kind of crisis we have in areas that are not covered by RPZs, so the rules were written in a way that means some of the more rural areas will simply never get in.  In those local electoral areas, they do not have enough new rental registrations each quarter that would make them even eligible to be considered for an RPZ.  That is why, in terms of RPZs and the lack of any rent regulation, it is totally unfair that they have been excluded from these much-needed measures.<\/p>  <p>  To give one example that was highlighted by &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; on RT&Eacute;, residents in Tubbercurry have been hit with rent increases of 75% and 80%.  How can anyone deal with that sort of increase?  Right now, that is putting people at risk of homelessness and making them homeless in some of those areas because of the scale of the increase and the lack of availability of properties to rent, where there is a surplus of former rental properties that are empty most of the year and which were now short-term lets.

I have some questions regarding them.  I can see no set of reasons whereby a developer seeking permission for an LRD would need a design envelope.  If my memory about the strategic housing development, SHD, process is correct, I understand there was a provision under that fast-track planning procedure, section 146B, that allowed for alterations to a plan, but that involved public participation.<\/p>  <p>  This is not the same as with the wind technology example that I and Deputy Matthews spoke about.  Residential developments are straightforward and the technology is well established.  The planning permissions do not stipulate whether certain types of building methodologies are used.  They all must be fully compliant with building and fire safety regulations.  Therefore, I do not believe there should be a design envelope facility and there should definitely not be one without any public participation.  I will discuss this point further when we come to amendment No. 13.  I wish to know who asked for this change, because this is here because somebody lobbied for it.  I do not know whether it was the Attorney General, officials or private developers.  This provision is here, however, because some people said they thought it should be here.  It was not in the LRD legislation.  It is important that we get an answer to this question.<\/p>  <p>  Turning then to amendment No. 13, I respectfully disagree with Deputy Matthews on this element of the design envelope.  As I said at the start, I am open to the concept of the design envelope, but there is no public participation in this context at the application, decision or implementation stages.  This is genuinely problematic.  I am not against the idea of a design envelope, particularly for offshore wind, so long as it is done right.  From the start of these debates, however, I have argued that if we do not get the public participation facet right at the very start, then it will end up leading to protracted judicial reviews and delayed wind farm and renewable energy projects.  <\/p>  <p>  I am also genuinely concerned that this lack of public participation, especially at the implementation stage, is potentially in breach of the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive, the habitats directive and the water framework directive.  Regarding the circumstances relating to the proposed development, as set out in paragraph 2(e)(ii) of the amendment, the scope of this is left to the regulations.  From reading this legislation, we simply have no idea how wide, broad or deep a latitude or flexibility within design envelopes will be provided for.  The Minister is correct that he did state at an early stage that some of these amendments were technical and some were urgent.  These amendments, however, are neither technical nor urgent.  They are deeply problematic and this objective would be much better achieved by way of amending legislation in the autumn, rather than rushing this through this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300072#ZZZ00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1657739400,"counter":663,"content":"<p>A resolution of the European Parliament was sent to me which was agreed on 1 June 2021.  It relates to the impact of offshore renewable energy on fishers and the marine environment.  This resolution was adopted and recommended by the rapporteur.  To cut a long story short, what it basically states is, notwithstanding the commitment of the European Union to develop its offshore renewable resources, it should not do so in such a way that would displace fishers or do things that could potentially damage the marine environment.  It says that the precautionary principle should apply.  In other words, where we are not sure what the impact might be, the precautionary principle should apply.  This is right.<\/p>  <p>  The commitment to developing our offshore renewable resources is clear in this resolution, as well as the priority and urgency of doing this, but it is equally clear in stipulating that doing so should not damage communities with a close connection to an area, where social or economic activities could be potentially damaged by a specific type of development.  The resolution cites things such as the reef effect that can sometimes accompany the establishment of these offshore wind farms.  There is potential in this regard for a reef effect.  In other words, reefs are created as a result of putting these things in place.  This can have significant and far-reaching impacts on marine life, on fish and so on, and consequently on those who make their livelihoods from fishing.  Reference is also specifically made to the electromagnetic impact of cables, even cables buried underground, and how those cables can then impact on marine life.<\/p>  <p>  The whole predication of this amendment is that developers can come along and say they are going to put forward a planning application, but that certain details of that planning application cannot be provided when the application is submitted and that what may eventually be developed may be different from what was applied for.  The grounds given for this provision is the rapid advance of technology.  When we consider the issues at stake here, however, that makes us even more worried.  Pile driving is another process mentioned in respect of its potential impact on a specific marine environment.  Regarding the rapid advance of technology, we have already established that it is precisely the advance of those types of technologies that could have all sorts of spin-off consequences in terms of their impact on marine life.  Of course, the new technologies may have different effects from the old technologies.  The new technologies may have more impact in respect of what type of pile driving is undertaken, for example, and the technology used to undertake that operation.  Such new technologies may also create reefs or damage fish, in respect of the routes fish take and whether they will continue to inhabit a particular area.<\/p>  <p>  In fact, when I talk to the fishers in the areas where many of these legacy and relevant projects are sited near the coastal area off the east coast, some of which will be as close as 8 km and 10 km, in places like the Kish Bank, the Codling Bank, and so on, which are spawning grounds for fish etc., those people are convinced, and this point is alluded to in the European Parliament resolution, that this type of activity is not compatible with the continuation of fishing in those areas at all and that they will be gone from those areas, which are their traditional fishing grounds.<\/p>  <p>  That is bad enough as it is.  If applications are openended, however, regarding what technologies may be used for the construction of these projects or the types of cables that can be used, for example, and their potential impact on marine environments and fish, and all the rest of it, the idea that such applications could be openended based on new technology is more worrying.  Therefore, I am not convinced that this is necessary or justified.  I am most certainly not convinced that there is any justification for it in respect of large-scale residential development on land.  I do not see the need for that at all.  That has definitely been lobbied for by someone.  <\/p>  <p>  I repeat what I said earlier about SHDs and the shambles they turned out to be.  That SHD legislation was written by the developers.  I have strong suspicions regarding this openended type of planning application, which can change further down the line, and therefore bypass potentially the proper stakeholder consultations, public participation and EIAs in respect of LRDs.  I just do not see the justification for that.<\/p> <p>I would like the Minister of State to explain the circumstances in which a developer might put in an application for an LRD without giving all the details of that development, only for things to change further down the line.  I do not see the justification for that and, arguably, it breaches the environmental impact assessment directive and so on.<\/p> <p> It is similarly very concerning in terms of offshore developments.  An Taisce, which went to the trouble of writing to us this morning, is pretty clear in its view that this raises serious concerns around the environmental impact assessment and habitats directives, public participation etc.  There are simpler, more legally compliant and more effective ways to address these challenges without creating the legal and procedural problems associated with the proposed approach.  We need to discuss that, but we are not really going to because it will be a short-circuited discussion and the Bill will be rammed through.  At whose behest and as a result of whose lobbying will this happen?  Somebody requested that this be included and the Government has bowed to that lobbying.  We do not know who the lobbyists are but it does not take much to guess that they are on-land and offshore developers.<\/p> <p> I am deeply opposed to these amendments.  They should, at the very least, be scrutinised seriously or withdrawn from the Bill.  It is more sharp practice with potentially very damaging environmental, social, economic and cultural implications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300072#ZZZ00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657740000,"counter":665,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 12 is about measures to allow flexibility for emerging technologies to be extended to large-scale residential developments.  I have a real difficulty understanding the rationale behind the amendment in the context of large-scale residential developments.  They are not like wind farms which can have a delay between the granting of planning permission and the commencement of the development.  We all hope when a large number of houses are granted planning permission that the developer goes ahead with building as per the planning permission.  What is the need for flexibility to allow for emerging technologies if delays are not envisaged?  Could granting them this level of flexibility potentially create an incentive for developers to delay works?<\/p>  <p>  Who asked for this?  Who thinks they will benefit from it?  How do they think they will benefit from it?  Has this been lobbied for by those who are more interested in speculation and increasing the value of sites, in saying the planning permission they got comes with added flexibility along with other measures?  People who are interested in getting on with the building of homes would not necessarily lobby for this.  It appears to have come from speculative quarters.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 13 is about pre-approval and what goes into applications.  There are significant problems with regulations being left to the Minister and how wide open that is.  There are no parameter constraints on that.  I have serious concerns about that and the lack of public participation at the design envelope stage.  There would be no notices or submissions.  The decision from that would not be published until later in the process.  This presumably runs contrary to the EIA directive.  If you do not know what you have allowed, how can you assess it?  That is the legal problem that will, if it is not addressed, give rise to significant delays and challenges.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 14 is about the implementation stage.  It provides no obligation in terms of consent.  There is only an obligation to notify.  No consent is required.  Surely that is contrary to the EIA and habitats directives.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State is bringing forward amendments that are not legally sound, do not comply with directives, and will ultimately fail and lead to delays, and then the Government will have to come back to the Chamber to make more change, which it will probably do on the last day of a term and rush amendments through again.

I do not know where they are getting their advice from, be it from the Attorney General or whoever, but I want to hear from all the stakeholders who have a stake in this so that we can make an informed decision about whether what the Minister of State just said is true and that there is really nothing to see here.<\/p> <p>I am not convinced that that is the case, even more so because of my deep anxiety about the site selection process for these big industrial offshore \"relevant projects\" that got special designation in the marine planning Act, whereby developers chose their own sites.  That is what happened.  They decided where they wanted to build.  Even on land developers do not have that, but now, for some of the biggest industrialised development we have ever seen in the marine area, the developers have decided the sites in advance of any plan or any proper designation of marine protected areas.  Then there are little bits like this about what has to be provided when looking for this flexible application, namely, \"such other information, drawings or representations as the prospective applicant may wish to provide or make available\".  I repeat, \"may wish to\".  Surely the onus should not be on the developer to decide what he feels like putting forward in his application.  He might wish to give us some details in the application or he might wish not to do so.  This is so wide open to abuse it is beyond belief.  Developers could hold back stuff.  They could say they want flexibility when actually they plan to do something different from the outset from what they have put in the application.  Let us be honest that this is open to abuse and open to developers to say, \"This is how we get the application through, and afterwards we can disclose the truth about what is actually in the application and what we are really planning.\"  We certainly have not had the opportunity to scrutinise this legislation to ensure that this is not the case and that we have safeguards against that.  We have not heard from the experts who could really tell us whether this open to abuse.<\/p> <p> This just is not on.  It is not on to do this in the manner in which the Government has done so with the time available to scrutinise the Bill.  The letter from An Taisce says it all and is directed very strongly at the Green Party, quite rightly.  I am pretty surprised the Green Party are going along with this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300073#AAAA00700","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657740600,"counter":672,"content":"<p>As I said, there are seven to eight urgent wind farm developments to take place.

I sincerely hope I am talking to the right one.  This is the amendment that relates to the gift.  The purpose of this is to ensure that service charges are paid as a gift to workers.

The business should not include this as a stealth charge.  I specifically submitted this amendment in order to put on the record my concern with regard to a tweet from the Restaurants Association of Ireland, which was put out just after the Bill was in the Seanad.  It sounded as though it was attempting, or thought there would be some way, for it to be able to circumvent this legislation.  One of the tweets read that its understanding was that businesses are still permitted to apply a group booking charge as part of the new legislation.  This looks as though some businesses might be trying to evade or avoid it or get around it.<\/p><p>I believe that the intention is to ensure that cannot happen.  I would have thought that the wording was robust enough but, given that the tweet was put out as the Bill was being discussed, I naturally have concerns.  I imagine that the T&aacute;naiste will also have concerns, if he thinks someone will circumvent his legislation.  It does a bit of a disservice to us, as legislators, if we are very clear about what the intention is.  To be fair to the T&aacute;naiste, he has been very clear.  The ink was not even dry on the legislation before this tweet went out.

The Deputy's purpose is to extend the tax treatment of personal gifts to tips and gratuities received in the course of employment, which would mean that they would be liable for capital acquisitions tax, rather than income tax.  Having considered this issue and consulted with the Revenue Commissioners, while a tip may be perceived as a gift in the sense that it is a voluntary payment, it is in fact a reward for good services rendered during the individual's employment.  This is a key legal distinction between a personal gift and a tip.<\/p>  <p>  If the individual is not working in that position, they would not have received a tip.  Tips are explicitly linked to the service being provided by the recipient in the course of their employment.  They are not made on grounds that are purely personal to the individual, in the way that a birthday or wedding gift would be.  They are inextricably linked to the person's employment.  Therefore, I am advised that, for these legal reasons, a tip could not be classified as a gift.  I am advised that this interpretation is supported by case law and recent determinations by the Tax Appeals Commission.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to a group booking charge, it is possible for a restaurateur or hotel, or an events organiser, to impose a group booking surcharge.  Sometimes, that is necessary, because extra staff have to be taken on and perhaps paid premium pay.  What is very clear from this legislation is that the surcharge could not be described as a service charge.  It would be very clear to the customer that this was not a service charge and was not going to staff in addition to their wages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300077#EEEE00800","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1657742400,"counter":686,"content":"<p>Whether it is a big booking or a small booking, the people coming in are all paying for their service and the food.

We made a very significant change in this legislation as it developed on foot of the debate in the Seanad in particular but also the debate here.  The original plan was proprietors or employers would just need to be clear about what a mandatory service charge was and where the money went.  We have changed that now in this law.  When this law is passed and fully commenced, a mandatory service charge must be treated in the same way a tip or gratuity would be.  It cannot be used to make up basic wages.  It must be given to staff as though it was a tip.  That is very important because for years people have been not leaving a tip because they thought the mandatory service charge was the tip.  In fairness, it is something I have been asking about every time I have gone to a restaurant or a bar for the last year or two.  In almost all cases that is the case but not always.  Once this legislation is enacted and commenced it will be very clear a mandatory service charge is the same as a tip.  That is increasingly important because now more and more people leave the money electronically as they do not carry cash the way they used to, and this will do that.<\/p>  <p>  However, the legislation is not intended to abolish all surcharges and there will be occasions where proprietors impose a surcharge.  It might for example be an energy surcharge, which you see being applied in some places now, or be a group booking surcharge.  I am told if you have a very large booking of 30 or 40 people there are additional costs and you need to take on additional staff to those you would need if there were the same number of people in different groups.

I also have a further concern.  The mechanism for redress is through the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, but that would not apply in the case of cash tips.  I am sure we all do the same thing in restaurants.  If we are tipping, we ask the people serving us if they get to keep the tip if it is in cash.  They will say \"Yes\" or \"No\".  In some instances, the server will say the tips go into a glass behind the counter and are distributed.  The intention behind the Bill is to end tip theft, which is theft of money from workers who are on very low pay.  Let us not forget why we are here.  It is just as wrong for employers to skim money off credit cards and take it as it is for them to take it out of a jar intended for the workers individually.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that there is provision for a review after 12 months.  I am conscious that for workers on very low incomes, a year without protection in the context of those cash tips could be problematic.  However, redress is not available even if that is happening.  We are all deciding that is not a good thing and it should not be allowed for an employer to rob tips from workers.  However, employers can do that if it is a cash tip and the WRC redress would not be open to the employees.  It seems to me a bit of a loophole which would be open to exploitation.  It is important to say that these complaints do not apply to every employer.  We do not need to legislate for those employers who always do the right thing.  We are here to legislate for the ones who do not.  Cash tips should also be covered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300079#GGGG00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1657743600,"counter":716,"content":"<p>I acknowledge at the outset that tip theft is a problem.  It is real, and we would not be introducing this legislation if it was not.  We do not have reliable data as to how common it is or if it is more common in the case of electronic tips or cash tips but we think it is more likely to be common in the case of electronic tips because they go through the books, if you like, of the employer and proprietor who controls the money.  When a tip is in cash, it is controlled by the staff most of the time and never goes through the company books.  Tips are divided among the staff, and it is left to them to decide whether or not to declare tips as additional income.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments being proposed would extend the provisions of the Bill relating to tips and gratuities to payments made in cash as well as by electronic means.  Deputies are keen to extend the Bill in full to cover all cash tips and gratuities, and I have sympathy with that proposal.  There is a general prohibition on making deductions from an employee's tips but the full regime governing electronic tips cannot be extended to cover cash.  The reason for that is simple, that is, cash left voluntarily is not traceable.  It may never even come under the control of the employer, as I said earlier, so there is no evidence on which to base enforcement actions.  Electronic payments, however, create an evidential trail that can be examined if there is a complaint.  We should recognise that most payments are now being made electronically and that fewer people are using cash on a regular basis.  We make a considerable proportion of our purchases, including in-person purchases, through electronic transactions by means of debit or credit cards, e-wallets and so on.<\/p>  <p>  Enacting this Bill can also give consumers the confidence to tip electronically, knowing that if they do so, it will definitely go to the staff.  When they add an electronic tip, they will know that it is required to be distributed to staff and that those staff have access to the WRC if they have a complaint.  I assure the House that in a case where a customer pays a bill that includes a mandatory service charge, the bill and receipt leave an evidential trail whether the payment is made electronically or in cash.  This means that if there is a complaint about the distribution of the mandatory service charge, the WRC can consider that complaint and adjudicate on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300079#GGGG00300","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1657743600,"counter":717,"content":"<p>I hear what the T&aacute;naiste is saying and I do not dispute it.

He suggested that we cannot legislate for it because it would be difficult to prove and I do not fully understand the logic there.  One can definitely think of circumstances in which it would be impossible to prove.  In such a case, there might be paper evidence but an offence cannot be proved.  It is also feasible to think of circumstances in which it could be proved.  A series of employees might be willing to testify that every single night, the employer comes in, goes through the tip jar and takes half of the money in it.  That is very conceivable.  Surely a right of redress must be provided for those workers who are affected.

Not every case that comes before the WRC has a paper trail or includes absolute proof.  Sometimes a union official will only have the evidence that his or her own members can bring and that is enough.  One might not be able to put a hand on a receipt or some kind of electronic trail but there may be evidence from workers.  One will hear that from workers.  The T&aacute;naiste has met with workers so he will know that.  How would it work in that case?  Would such a case be precluded from access to the WRC even if there is some evidence?  I understand the issue around evidence and the fact that we cannot legislate for situations in which there is no evidence.  If there were sufficient evidence to sustain an industrial relations case, which I acknowledge is not the same threshold of proof that would apply in a court, would the T&aacute;naiste envisage access to the WRC being possible under the terms of this legislation?  If that is precluded completely, there is a problem.  There is not going to be a paper trail when a cash tip is left, but how would it work in a case where a number of workers are capable of saying that tip theft happens every evening, every second night or whatever?  Those staff should somehow come under the jurisdiction of this legislation.  If they are left out, all cases are going to be left out.

This amendment applies to the section of the Bill which deals with a situation where tips are distributed between employees.  This is the worker's money.  It is not the employer's money.  Therefore, the employees should have a decisive say in how the money is distributed between them.  There should be a negotiation between the employer and the employees within six months of this Bill coming into force to agree how tips are going to be divided up.

We are removing the reference to the fact that whether the employee is on full-time or part-time contract of employment is something to be taken into account, given that section 4B(4)(c) includes the proportion or number of hours worked by the employee.  It is entirely reasonable that would be taken into account in terms of how tips are divided.  Once you are taking that into account, then there is no need to separately consider the point of full-time or part-time.  <\/p> <p> Third, in relation to what is currently in section 4B(4)(e), \"the role and influence of the employee in providing service to customers\", I do not understand what the meaning of &ldquo;influence&rdquo; is.

As it stands, the Bill provides that the employer must consult their employees.  It also establishes a legal entitlement for workers to receive their tips and gratuities paid in electronic form with the provision that these tips and gratuities should be paid out to workers in fair and transparent manner.  Requiring the employer to obtain the agreement of the employees is a high threshold for the employer to meet and is not within their control.<\/p>  <p>  We also believe the amendment is impractical, as it would require the consent of all employees before a change in policy could be introduced.  Even one employee, or a minority of employees, could prevent a policy change against the wishes and interests of the majority of employees and the employer.  This would be profoundly undemocratic.  Seeking to introduce some form of qualified majority is equally likely to be impractical but would not be impossible.<\/p>  <p>  An important requirement of the new Bill is that the employer must provide a statement to workers showing the amount of electronic tips obtained in a period and the portion paid to individual employees for that particular period.  This will ensure transparency.  <\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 10 seems confer a new function on the WRC adjudicators of inspecting workplaces and determining whether the distribution of tips and gratuities is fair.  It is difficult to justify carrying out inspections in circumstances where nobody has made a complaint and would not be a good use of the WRC&rsquo;s resources.  Employees can have recourse to the WRC if they have a grievance and make a complaint.  I am satisfied that this will provide ample protection for them.<\/p>  <p>  Amendments Nos. 11, 12 and 14 seek to amend the factors that a WRC adjudicator can consider in determining an employee complaint on whether tip distribution is fair.  I think the factors in the Bill as it stands are well balanced.  They are relevant and, crucially, they are not restrictive.  The adjudicator can, of course, consider other factors where they consider them to be relevant.  <\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 15 would be a disproportionate intrusion on an employer.  Employees in small business where employers also do work will usually have a good understanding of the level of work the employer does.  They also already have the protection that they must be aware of the tips and gratuities policy.  They can have recourse to the WRC if they have a complaint.  This amendment would require employers to send out their personal financial information to their staff on a regular basis.  This would even include staff who may be employed on an only occasional or part-time basis and every employee would then become a data processor under general data protection regulation, GDPR.  I understand the intention behind the amendment is to ensure that staff are informed if their employer is taking a proportion of the tips.  That is an understandable request or desire and we do not want to let abusive employers off the hook.  However, we think it will be disproportionate and intrusive in this regard and would leave employees in the position where they would become data processors under GDPR.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300080#HHHH00200","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1657744200,"counter":727,"content":"<p>We need say this out loud.

I accept what the T&aacute;naiste said in relation to data control or a data processor.  However, there needs to be some level of transparency so that a worker &ndash; and we know these are low-paid workers &ndash; would have some sort of knowledge as it whether the employer is taking something.  The T&aacute;naiste said that in smaller employments there is usually a good understanding of how much work the employer is doing, and there is.  However, equally, the employer might not be doing half the work, but taking half the tips.  I am not saying all employers would do this, but we know that it happens and we would not be here if it did not.  There is a balance to be struck.  Clearly, people are entitled to some privacy in relation to personal information.  However, there is, equally, the right of the worker to know.  If you are already only getting a share of half because half has gone to the employer, you will not know that from the statement that you get.  There is an unfairness in that.  This set of amendments is just to bring a little bit more transparency, particularly for the workers who, as we all know, are very often vulnerable or low-paid workers who do not have that power at the level of the workplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300080#HHHH00300","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1657744200,"counter":728,"content":"<p>I understand and appreciate the intentions behind the amendments.  However, I cannot accept them for two reasons.  The requirement that the consent of all employees would be required for a change in policy is too onerous.  We are not talking about a majority here; we are talking about unanimity.  I just do not think that is a practical provision when it comes to amendments Nos. 6, 13 and 16, to have a situation whereby the employer and the vast majority of employees want a certain policy and a blocking minority or even one individual could block a change to that policy.  I am sure that was not what was intended by the amendment.  However, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel said that would be the effect.<\/p>  <p>  Again, we need to bear in mind that sometimes the employer is a worker too.  You will often see in a small restaurant or small caf&eacute;, the person who is the employer &ndash; the owner &ndash; is very busy on the shop floor, taking orders, delivering meals and behind the till.  The employer can be a worker as well.  Under amendment No. 15, you would see employees getting financial information about the employer or another worker, and that is private information.  I would have real concerns about that being done.  If it is the case, for example, that the worker-owner, if you like, is taking half or even a quarter of the tips, that would be known because there has to be a tips and gratuities policy, and it would have to be made clear in that policy that a certain worker or someone who was somehow getting a disproportionate share of the tips.  I think if I saw that policy, I would be very suspicious.  Therefore, I think it is covered in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300080#HHHH00400","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657744200,"counter":729,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657744200,"counter":730,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 7:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 6, lines 21 and 22, to delete &ldquo;by an electronic mode of payment&rdquo;

It was reported that The Ivy restaurant was taking in &euro;3,000 in electronic tips that were being taken by the employer, yet the Government is saying the maximum that employers who continue to engage in that illegal practice can face is a fine of &euro;2,500.  It is completely inadequate.  It is a very soft-touch and light-handed approach to employers for what is theft or robbery of workers' money.  It should not be treated as a small matter; it is a big deal.  It is the same thing as going into a person's house and robbing his or her money.  It is theft and it should be treated as such.

I do not think people necessarily set out to do that.  However, in the past decade the WRC has recovered &euro;18 million in what it referred to as \"unpaid wages\" but all present know it is money that was robbed from workers.  We know there are issues in respect of workers getting what they are entitled to in terms of what could be called wages, never mind what is in that grey area of tips.

I agree with that assessment, by the way.  If money is intended for a person but another person takes it, that is larceny.  I would be curious to know whether any complaints have been taken to An Garda or whether there have been any investigations under larceny provisions and what the case law is in that regard.  I do not know if there have been such cases.<\/p>  <p>  What we are dealing with here is employment law.  In the context of this legislation, the amendments would change the penalties for breaches from a fine of up to &euro;2,500 to a fine of up to &euro;5,000.  That would be out of line and inconsistent with penalties included in the Payment of Wages Act 1991, which the Bill amends.  That Act provides for fines of up to &euro;1,000.  The WRC can also impose fixed penalty notices of up to &euro;1,500.  If these amendments were accepted, breaches of the Bill would have the most serious consequence of any offence under the Payment of Wages Act, and that does not seem proportionate.<\/p>  <p>  Amendments Nos. 17, 19 and 22 propose the introduction of prison sentences for breaches of the Act.  By way of example, an employer who fails to give an employee a statement of his or her tips and gratuities and the total tips and gratuities received would be liable to up to 12 months' imprisonment.  To clarify that, even if an employee got all his or her tips - every single euro and cent - if the employer did not for some reason give him or her the paperwork, the employer could go to prison for 12 months.  That seems somewhat draconian.  It certainly would not protect the employees if their employer had to cease trading because he or she was sent to prison having paid every cent of wages and tips but not provided the right sheet of paper. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300081#JJJJ01000","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657744800,"counter":754,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657744800,"counter":755,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 18:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, line 34, to delete &ldquo;class C&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;class A&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300081#JJJJ01200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657744800,"counter":756,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657744800,"counter":757,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 19:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(9) An employer who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a class A fine, a maximum of five years&rsquo; imprisonment or both.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300081#JJJJ01400","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657744800,"counter":758,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657744800,"counter":759,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 20:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 8, to delete lines 1 and 2. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300081#JJJJ01600","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657744800,"counter":760,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657744800,"counter":761,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 21:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 8, to delete lines 3 to 5. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300081#JJJJ01800","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657744800,"counter":762,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657744800,"counter":763,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 22:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 8, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(iii) an employer who contravenes paragraphs (a) or (b) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a class A fine, a maximum of five years&rsquo; imprisonment or both.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300081#JJJJ02000","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657744800,"counter":764,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657744800,"counter":765,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 23:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 8, line 18, to delete &ldquo;class C&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;class A&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300081#JJJJ02200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657744800,"counter":766,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657744800,"counter":767,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 24:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 8, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(3) An employer who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a class A fine, a maximum of five years&rsquo; imprisonment or both.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300081#JJJJ02400","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657744800,"counter":768,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657744800,"counter":769,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 25 to 27, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300081#JJJJ02600","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1657744800,"counter":770,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 25:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 8, line 21, to delete &ldquo;a notice&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;notices&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <p>This is the last substantial grouping of amendments.

I am seeking an update on the site for the new ambulance base for Carlow town and the delays people are experiencing in waiting for ambulances.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the announcement of the new ambulance base.  This went into the capital plan recently, which is welcome.  My understanding is the site is at Kelvin Grove, Carlow town.  I want an update on the project and its timescale.  As the Minister of State knows, ambulance paramedics in Carlow are in a prefab that is unfit for purpose.  It is now 2022 and I think it is unacceptable that ambulance paramedics, who do an excellent job, are in a prefab.  I am looking for an update on that issue.<\/p>  <p>  My second question is about ambulance waiting times.  I have spoken over the years to several ambulance paramedics.  My opinion is that the system is wrong and needs to be looked at.  When people call for an ambulance, for many, it can be the luck of the draw as to where an ambulance is at that particular time.<\/p>  <p>  I received an email from a constituent who stated that he was waiting for an ambulance in Carlow town for over an hour.  He made several calls but no ambulance arrived.  He ended up having to go to his neighbour's house to get a lift to the hospital.  Luckily, this was not a life-and-death situation but he highlighted it to me.  In another case, a young man had been knocked down and was lying in a recovery position.  To be fair, he had been attended to but, again, my understanding is that it was well over an hour before the ambulance arrived.  In the next case, a man contacted the office who had an emergency call-out to his house.  This man is 75 years old.  When the emergency arose at 9 p.m., the doctor rang for an ambulance but the ambulance did not arrive until 12.50 a.m. that night.  The man is a diabetic with a heart condition and has been in hospital with a very serious condition.<\/p>  <p>  I want to know if anything else can be done in such situations.  This is by no means a criticism of any work that is being done by the ambulance paramedics.  Is the system working?  Do we need more staff?  What do we need to do to address this?  The Minister of State knows it is wrong to have a 75-year-old man waiting in his home for an ambulance to call.  It is unacceptable and we need to address it.  Again, I stress it is the system, not the work that the ambulance paramedics are doing.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State is present, he knows I have been raising the issue of the primary care centre for Tullow for the last few years and I am looking for an update on that.  If he does not have it tonight, I ask that he would put that in his correspondence to me when he comes back with an answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300084#MMMM00200","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1657746600,"counter":795,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue, which she has raised on numerous occasions.  Since 2016, the National Ambulance Service, including its south-east region, has undergone significant reform and modernisation involving the prioritisation of investment in new service developments, including increased workforce and fleet, and improved technology.  Since the end of 2016, National Ambulance Service staffing resources nationally have increased from 1,744 as at December 2016 to 2,037 at the end of May this year, an increase of 293 whole-time equivalents, representing over 16.5% growth in staff over that timeframe.  This year, an unprecedented &euro;200 million has been allocated, which includes over &euro;8 million for new service developments.  This funding will be invested in building capacity, as well as increasing staffing within the &ldquo;hear and treat&rdquo; service in the national emergency operations centre, which advises lower acuity patients of appropriate alternatives to hospital transfer.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, Carlow ambulance base is an integral part of the ambulance service and has two emergency ambulances on duty at any one time.  The base is supported by National Ambulance Service resources from surrounding ambulance stations, including Baltinglass, Athy, Kilkenny, Portlaoise and Enniscorthy.  Dynamic deployment of available resources operates on an area and national basis, rather than a county or geographical boundary basis, to ensure optimum resource use as the nearest appropriate resource is mobilised to the location of an incident.<\/p>  <p>The priority of dynamic deployment is patient health and welfare in the context of service delivery, which means resources cannot be confined by county boundaries, barriers or borders.  The national ambulance service operates a comprehensive safety management system across all of its premises throughout the south east and continues to work collaboratively with staff, the HSE capital and estates unit and external providers to ensure any concerns or issues that occur are dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p> I am happy to confirm that the Carlow ambulance base is included in the capital plan for 2022.  The HSE capital and estates unit has been in discussions with the ambulance service regarding the need for a replacement ambulance base for Carlow.  As the Deputy mentioned, the Kelvin Grove site has been identified as a possible suitable site.  A design team is engaged for the preparation of a development control plan, which will indicate whether it is feasible for the proposed ambulance base to be included along with two other facilities planned for the site.  Once the site appraisal is completed, a capital submission will be prepared.<\/p> <p> Given the work entailed and the timeline to move from identification and assessment of a suitable alternative site to the completion of works and building handover, remedial and refurbishment works at the existing station have been carried out to address shortcomings in regard to health and safety requirements.  Further improvement works are planned for later this year.  All projects being progressed must be compliant with the public spending code.  The final decision to proceed with the construction of a project cannot be made until the tender process has been completed and the costings reviewed to ensure the proposal remains affordable and delivers value for money.<\/p> <p> The Deputy mentioned the proposed primary care centre for Tullow.  I do not have any information on that but I will take her views to the Minister and try to get a reply as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300084#MMMM00300","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657746900,"counter":797,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

It is an issue on which good progress has been made but it has been going on since 2015.  I am aware that the Deputies are engaging with the proposals for an ambulance base in Connemara.  I can confirm that the project for a new ambulance base, to be located in the village of Recess, is in the HSE's capital plan for 2022.  I am advised by the HSE that preparation for works at the new facility is at an advanced stage.  In the interim, national ambulance service crews in north Connemara are being deployed from a base in Clifden.  This temporary measure will remain in place until works at the building in Recess are completed and the site becomes operational.<\/p><p>I am aware that response times remain a challenge.  As previously stated in this House, a 2016 national review of ambulance capacity has highlighted that, in many instances, the most effective way to improve emergency response times in rural areas is through community first responder schemes.  Community first responder groups are comprised of trained volunteers who are supported and dispatched by the national ambulance service.  These groups respond to particular medical emergencies, such as cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, chest pain, choking and stroke, while an emergency response vehicle is <i>en route<\/i>to the patient.  A total of 177 community first responder groups are operational across the country, including 12 groups in County Galway.<\/p> <p>I fully appreciate the need to make progress on the new facility in Recess, and I have received reassurances that this project is being progressed.  Currently, the HSE estates unit is engaging with the local authority regarding road access for the proposed base, and it is anticipated that a planning application will be submitted in quarter 3 of 2022.<\/p> <p> This year an unprecedented &euro;200.7 million has been allocated to the NAS, and this includes &euro;8.23 million for new developments.  This funding is being invested in additional front-line capacity as well as increasing staffing within the hear and treat service in the national emergency operations centre, which advises lower-acuity patients of appropriate alternatives to hospital transfer.  Overall, the funding for new service developments will allow for the recruitment of 128 additional whole-time equivalent staff.<\/p> <p> I reiterate that the Government is committed to continuous improvement in the NAS, in response to the increased need we continue to see across the country.  Investment in capacity increases is best illustrated by the 200 student paramedics currently enrolled in the NAS college on various stages of the BSc. (Hons) Paramedic Studies programme, and the 2022 NAS recruitment programme for paramedics, student paramedics and intermediate care operatives which launched earlier this year.  I assure Deputies that the NAS is focused on improving patient care, clinical outcomes and response times in rural areas, including through the ambulance base project in Recess, and that the Government is invested in facilitating these strategic developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300085#NNNN01100","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657747500,"counter":808,"content":"<p>I do not understand how much of this answer relates to the specific questions we asked.

His background of being self-employed is appropriate to answer this query.  This matter stems from a constituent who is almost a neighbour of mine.  He retired at the beginning of 2022.  This query is also in the context of trying to encourage more people to make provision for private pensions and the auto-enrolment system being introduced by the Department.  The matter centres on a specific point.  The constituent in question and others who have approved retirement funds, ARFs, and who receive an annual income from those funds of &euro;5,000 or less are not liable for PRSI on it.  There is an exemption for self-employed PRSI on income under &euro;5,000.<\/p>  <p>  However, this was not brought to the attention of the individual and is not brought to the attention of others in a similar position.  As we move forward, I suspect a great many people may potentially be caught in a similar situation.  When my constituent contacted the Department of Social Protection, he was allowed, as we all know, a four-year refund, which is the maximum the Department and Government agencies allow.  The problem is that he paid his 4% contribution for more than ten years.  As a result, he has suffered the loss of six or seven years of PRSI contributions.  When he contacted his insurance provider, he was directed to the Department.  The Department quite rightly, understandably and efficiently refunded him four years of payments but he was left at a loss for the rest.  There is a clear lack of communication that this anomaly exists, not least a lack of communication with the public who have invested in ARFs.<\/p> <p>It is also unjust that people have been making contributions which they were not required to and were not forewarned about.  I spoke directly with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, about the issue earlier today.  I realise that I may not have phrased the Topical Issue matter accurately when I submitted it this morning, but it does raise the question that there is a cohort of people who made contributions for which they will receive no benefit.  They made PRSI contributions that they were not obliged to make and they will be at a loss because of them.<\/p> <p> It is incumbent on the Department of Social Protection, in the first instance, to communicate this issue to the public when they are deciding to contribute to the approved retirement funds, ARFs, and the insurers to make that information clear to people when they are deciding to make provisions for their retirement.  This anomaly exists and I suspect quite a few people will be surprised when they reach retirement age and discover that they should not have been paying a contribution for which they will receive no benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300086#OOOO00700","speaker":"1510","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657748100,"counter":815,"content":"<p>I am aware the Deputy raised this matter directly with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, at an earlier meeting.  I am taking this Topical Issue matter on her behalf.<\/p>  <p>  Social insurance coverage was extended to self-employed workers in 1988.  Since then, self-employed workers whose income is &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year, are liable to pay a social insurance contribution at the class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;500.  Self-employed contributors are currently covered for a wide range of social insurance benefits, including the contributory State pension; the contributory widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension; the contributory guardian's payment; maternity, adoptive and paternity benefits; the invalidity pension; the partial capacity benefit, if in receipt of the invalidity pension; the self-employed jobseeker's benefit; and the parent's benefit.<\/p>  <p>  The scope to the charge of self-employment social insurance contributions and the underlying nature of self-employment are wider than those that apply to contributions payable by employed contributors.  A person is defined as a self-employed contributor on the basis of income received rather than economic activity.  Unearned income falls within the scope of self-employment for social insurance purposes, both for the purposes of paying self-employment contributions and for establishing possible entitlements.<\/p>  <p>  Drawdowns from the approved retirement fund are chargeable to income tax and are reckonable emoluments for social insurance purposes.  The social insurance class S charge is deducted at source by fund managers for people aged under 66 years, or if the recipient of the distribution is a modified class contributor, the charge is recorded as class K.<\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 provides that an application for the return of contributions shall be made within four years of the last day of the contribution year in respect of which the contributions were paid.  I know the Deputy acknowledged this in his contribution about the case he raised.  This timeframe is in line with the Revenue time limit for the refund of taxes.  As is the case with tax refunds, there is no discretion within the governing legislation to allow contributions to be returned outside this limit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300087#PPPP00200","speaker":"1573"},{"type":"speech","time":1657748100,"counter":816,"content":"<p>I know, as most people do, that Revenue has no wriggle room in terms of refunds beyond four years but, on the other hand, there is always wriggle room to chase up unpaid taxes.  This is understandable but it should work both ways.  I realise that in the context of this Topical Issue debate, we will not be able to change the four-year rule.  I will endeavour to speak with the Minister and the Minister of State afterwards and ask them to ensure that this anomaly is flagged when people are considering contributing to the ARF, and that it will become mandatory for the insurer taking these contributions to notify those who will be in receipt of an annual income from this source of less than &euro;5,000, that a PRSI contribution is not required.<\/p>  <p>  I note from the Minister of State's response that self-employed contributors are entitled to receive a wide range of social insurance benefits.  I know that PRSI contributions fall under all sorts of different categories, but several benefits that are available to other PRSI contributors, such as dental and other benefits, are not available to the self-employed.<\/p>  <p>  I return to the original issue raised.  The person I referred to was not self-employed.  They worked in different pay as you earn, PAYE, jobs but for the purposes of calculations, they effectively became self-employed when they used part of their income for the ARF 12 years ago.

I pay tribute to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists for its excellent work in publishing the Uber leaks.  It revealed a major corporation, valued at $44 billion, setting itself up as a disrupter, a modern company and so on, but in reality pursuing the old, tried and tested methods of major capitalist corporations.<\/p>  <p>  One, it highlighted major exploitation of workers.  These people provide nothing more than an app and made themselves incredibly rich, by driving down terms and conditions across the world.  <\/p>  <p>  Two, Uber used money to buy political influence and was willing to go to any ends to achieve its aims.  It is worth quoting one of Uber's people who said, \"Violence guarantee[s] success.  And these guys must be resisted.\"  He called for a counter protest to be organised in Paris against taxi drivers in order to create violence to drive through Uber's programme.  What did it look like in this country?  It looked like Uber writing the manifesto for Fine Gael.  The election manifesto of 2016 states, \"New platforms are being developed that allow everyone to earn extra income in this sharing economy.\"  It sounds great.  Is it accurate, as John Moran claims and Uber accepts, that this was effectively written by Uber?  Did Fine Gael or Uber write it?  It was an incredible case of corporate capture by the largest political party in Ireland at the time.  I have another question.  Does that continue?  Is lobbying ongoing?  Is there a relationship between lobbying and the statement of the leader of Fine Gael, the T&aacute;naiste, a month ago when he again said that Uber could be brought into Ireland, going against the advice of the National Transport Authority, NTA?<\/p>  <p>  The third point, which we will perhaps go into later, is the fact that much of the lobbying went unregistered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071300087#PPPP00600","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1657748100,"counter":820,"content":"<p>There are two really important factors at play.

The NTA is actively encouraging people into the taxi industry to address a shortage of taxi drivers but, as recently as 17 June, the T&aacute;naiste - the man who would be Taoiseach in the next number of months - is advocating for the introduction of an Uber- or Lyft-style model to liberalise the market.  If you are someone who is considering entering the taxi industry but the T&aacute;naiste is saying that we should consider introducing an Uber-style model, what decision will you make?

I am answering on behalf of the Minister for Transport.<\/p><p>Regarding current media reports on Uber, following a request from the company, officials from the then Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport met Uber representatives in mid-December 2015 to discuss Uber's proposal to undertake a Limerick pilot cab hailing scheme.  The proposal involved trialling a service that, in Uber's view, could somehow sit outside existing small public service vehicle, SPSV, legislation.  At that meeting, the Department advised the company that, under current legislation, any ride hailing service as described would require drivers and cars to hold SPSV licences.  The Department made it clear that, for a pilot of this nature to proceed as proposed, a change would be required to both primary and secondary legislation as well as a significant change to current policy, and that no consideration was being given to such changes.  The key primary and secondary legislative provisions relating to exemptions from SPSV licensing requirements were highlighted to Uber at the meeting and were issued to it in a document afterwards.  There was no further substantive engagement with the company on the issue.<\/p><p>The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, met Uber representatives on 10 June 2022.  At that meeting, Uber stated that it was satisfied with the regulatory structure of the SPSV industry in Ireland, as it was clear to the company how it could legally operate here.<\/p><p>In Ireland, carrying passengers in a car for a payment is regulated under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.  That Act provides for regulating the SPSV sector, which includes taxis, hackneys and limousine services and is commonly referred to broadly as the &quot;taxi industry&quot;.  Under the legislation, the regulation of the SPSV industry is carried out by the NTA.  The Act requires the licensing of both the vehicles and the drivers who are involved in providing services.  The rationale for taxi regulation is to ensure that passengers have a safe vehicle for their journey, with appropriate insurance in place and driven by a driver who has been vetted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, in the case of taxis, with a pre-established and verified charging system.  While there are many other aspects to the overall regulatory system, these are the foundational elements, focusing on passenger safety and protection.<\/p><p>Uber is considered a transport service that offers the carriage of passengers for reward and is subject to the same regulation as all SPSVs in Ireland.  It has been licensed to operate as a dispatch operator in Ireland since 2014.<\/p><p>The Department and the NTA are committed to the existing regulatory arrangements.  The Minister is encouraged to hear that the NTA's driver recruitment campaign is, to date, 25% ahead in the number of applications received in comparison to its 2019 campaign.
