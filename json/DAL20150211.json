The focus remains on maximising the provisions of that agreement in relation not only to pay but also to the long-term impact of reform and productivity measures, such as extra working hours and reduced leave entitlements.  However, it is prudent now for the Government to start preparing for the period after the agreement in the public service, and, in particular, to ensure there is a phased and structured approach to the reversal of the financial emergency measures, which applied billions of euro of cuts to the public service pay and pensions bill.  To that end, I have indicated my desire to enter into a discussion with the public sector unions and associations to develop and agree an approach to that issue.<\/p>  <p>  At a minimum, my preference is to have the first quarter Exchequer returns for this year available to me to put in context the capacity we have for these talks.  Any such discussions on pay or other matters will, of course, take place in the context of the State's fiscal position and the pace of financial recovery for this year and next.  It is important that expectations on all sides in regard to any discussions on the review of pay rates and other reforms are realistic.  Having worked over the last four years to restore the health of the public finances, the Government is determined that any outcome of discussions with unions is consistent with our overall fiscal position.  The current financial stability, which was hard won, must not be jeopardised.  Nor is the Government willing to discuss changes in terms and conditions of employment that would attract a substantial additional cost if a serious impact is made on front-line services. <\/p>  <p>  I am acutely conscious that 2015 will be the seventh consecutive year in which there will have been no pay increases for public servants and, as we know, there have been two or three actual cuts in nominal wages, depending on one's pay grade, which is unprecedented.  During that time, public servants have accepted permanent changes to their terms of employment, including sick and annual leave arrangements, and their working hours, which helped preclude further cuts to front-line public services as numbers fell across the public service and will boost the productivity and efficiency of the service over the long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100003#A00600","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1423647000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for setting out the general position.

We have had general discussions about a broader social dialogue, which we must construct, but we are not going back to a national pay agreement.  What we are talking about is working out a settlement with public sector unions, which is unique insofar as many private sector employees have not had pay cuts.  The biggest impact on the private sector has been the 250,000 jobs that were lost, but many people have done okay and wage increases are still happening in the private sector both last year and this year.  We need to map out a sustainable path for the public sector in a fair and equitable way, particularly looking after those on low pay.  There are other issues, such as the initiative by the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, regarding the low pay commission, which will have an impact on both public and private sectors.

Under the process, Ministers and their Departments had primary responsibility for evaluating their own spending programmes, including programmes delivered by agencies under their aegis.  Each Department put in place its own internal administrative arrangements to ensure delivery of its detailed report within a challenging timeframe.

As a result of this review process, the Government considered the expenditure and policy options in the period before the budget.  Budget decisions were taken by the Government.  As the Deputy is aware, this was the first budget in six years which did not involve reductions in overall spending.  The Government was able to make some targeted increases in priority areas identified through the review process, including social housing and some welfare supports, in particular.

This was significantly above the EU average of 7.3%.  We have maintained that.  We are actually spending more.  Part of the task before us is to drill down to make sure that expenditure is going where it is required.  I have never viewed this as simply an issue of money because it is also a question of what we are getting for the money.

It is a very significant undertaking and involves the valuation of some 146,000 properties.  Completing the first revaluation and getting every local authority onto what would be a more normal five to ten year cycle of revaluations represents a sea change for the valuation system.<br\/><br\/><font color=\"#181818\">  As the Deputy will know, the current position is that all local authorities in Dublin, Waterford and Limerick have been revalued.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#181818\">These 48,000 properties represent 33% of the total.  In addition, 13 public utilities representing the largest ratepayers in the State have also been revalued on a global basis. <\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#181818\"> Significant progress is being made and the programme has established a momentum that will shortly be built upon when the commissioner makes valuation orders for the revaluation of more local authorities.  In parallel, the Valuation Office has continued to carry out revision work and, since 2011, a total of 22,467 revision valuations have also been completed.  However, as the Deputy is aware, I am introducing measures in the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 to accelerate the revaluation programme.  These include provisions for occupier-assisted valuation as well as outsourcing and streamlining the appeals process and wider use of computer-aided techniques.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#181818\"> &quot;Occupier-assisted valuation&quot; is the term being used for the form of self-assessment about which I think the Deputy is talking.  It will be introduced as it better reflects what will happen in practice.  Valuation of commercial property is often a very complex process, resulting in annual rates bills that can be very significant for an individual ratepayer.  This requires the application of a uniform approach and is much more complex than the self-assessment for local property tax, which has been very successful.  Occupier-assisted valuation will be a valuable new addition which will help to accelerate the revaluation programme and bring ratepayers into closer contact with a system that is one of the key determinants of their rates liability.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100005#C01000","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423648800,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I understand what the Minister has said - he is essentially outlining the position.

This expenditure increase is targeted at key areas such as health, social welfare provision and most of all social housing. <br\/><br\/>Our programme of public service reform has also made a vital contribution to ensuring that public services are delivered in a more efficient and effective manner.  The efficiency and productivity measures the Government has introduced have played a fundamental role in mitigating the impact of the necessary expenditure reductions.  We have made very strong progress on public sector reform to reduce costs and improve services, and this will remain a key element of our recovery strategy.<br\/><br\/>Returning stability to the public finances is a necessary prerequisite to creating an environment that encourages economic growth.  The Deputy will be aware that economic growth in Ireland is now the highest in Europe and unemployment at the end of January was at 10.5%, down from its peak of over 15% in 2011.  As a sign of confidence in the Irish market, employment at IDA Ireland-supported firms reached a new record of 175,000 in 2014.<br\/><br\/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><br\/><br\/>With the improved economic and fiscal position, the Government is fully committed to correcting the fiscal deficit and to using our recovery wisely through retaining and augmenting the benefits from public service reform.  As the fiscal situation continues to improve, we will look to build on the progress already made in returning the unemployed to work and ensuring that economic growth is supported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100008#F00600","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1423650000,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his very comprehensive reply.

Total public sector numbers increased by 1,400 last year.  I have explained this in detail at Question Time on a number of occasions.  What we are doing is recycling what I call the \"reform dividend\", that is, money we are saving by means of the implementation of the Haddington Road agreement, into meeting front-line needs.  Deputies warmly welcomed this when I first indicated that we would do it.  I hope to be able to continue to do that in order that it will not be simply a crude numbers issue and that we will identify the areas in which real pressure, which we may wish to address, exists.  In the context of so-called yellow pack recruitment, as has been the case every step of the way since the Government took office, any decisions will be made in consultation with, and it is hoped with the agreement of, the public sector unions involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100010#H00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1423651200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I take it that when the Minister commences discussions with the unions in the spring, it will not simply be a matter of dealing with pay levels and that he is open to negotiating in respect of the set of issues to which I refer.

The main purposes of the Bill are to provide for the authorisation by the Minister of the use of the description \"university\" by high-quality education providers for specified purposes outside the State; to amend the Student Support Act 2011 to ensure that the Minister has the power to prescribe post-leaving certificate courses for the purposes of the student grant scheme; and to amend the Education Act 1998 to provide for a refusal of access to specified information that would enable the compilation of comparative information on relative school performance in terms of their students' academic achievement.<\/p>  <p>  The Universities Act 1997 provides the legal framework for the operation and establishment of universities in Ireland.  As part of that framework, a legal limitation on the use of the title \"university\" lies in section 52 of the Act.  This section provides that, with the exception of the seven universities listed in the Act and any education institution or facility established and described as a university before the end of July 1996, no person can use the word \"university\" to describe an educational institution or facility.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to \"encourage more international students to study here and to create new jobs in the sector\", with the particular aim of doubling the number of students from priority and emerging markets outside the European Union.  In support of this aim, the international education strategy is being implemented to put in place the necessary policies and actions to support the development of internationally oriented, globally competitive higher education institutions within Ireland.  However, global competition for higher education is high.  Increasing access to online information for students and their families, coupled with international marketing and recruitment campaigns, means that a growing number of educational institutions have international recognition worldwide.  International recognition of the quality of both the educational institution and the qualifications on offer are a key issue in attracting students to study here in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Greater efforts are required at national and institutional level to enhance awareness of the national brand and promote understanding of what Irish institutions offer to prospective international students and partners in simple terms that are understood worldwide.<\/p><p>In this context, it has become clear that the limitations prescribed by the Universities Act need to be re-examined. The use of section 52 does not serve to decide an application by an Irish institution that needs to convey the level and quality of its education abroad to an international audience.<\/p> <p> This new legislation is required to put in place an application process for an Irish institution to use the description \"university\" to convey the level and quality of its education.  It is, of course, paramount to Ireland's internationalisation effort that the quality and reputation of our higher education institutions remain fully intact.  We are rightly proud in this country that we are leaders in Europe in terms of the quality and qualifications architecture that has been put in place by the legislation that was brought through the Houses two years ago.  I will protect and enhance that reputation.  The Bill ensures that this opportunity will be open only to the highest-quality providers.  An application will only be permissible for a provider with the statutory authority to make its own awards to doctoral degree level and whose awards are recognised on the National Framework of Qualifications.<\/p> <p> These strict criteria have been included to ensure that a provider authorised to use the title for the specified purposes is offering education at a level comparable to that offered by universities and that is recognised to be such under the framework.  In practice, these criteria mean that a qualifying provider would be subject to external quality assurance by QQI.<\/p> <p> A provider that applies must also have a very strong internationalisation mission as its core focus, and its ability to contribute to Ireland's strategic position on internationalisation must not be constrained by a lack of understanding of its status outside Ireland.  For this reason, an applicant provider must already have 40% of its registered student body in Ireland as non-EU students.<\/p> <p> Supporting the export activities of our leading internationally oriented institutions also contributes to the Government's job creation agenda.  International evidence indicates that high-quality international education supports job creation and retention, and the international education sector is a priority sector under the Action Plan for Jobs.  Employment in Ireland is created and supported through tuition fee income in education institutions and student expenditure in the economy, which boosts domestic demand.  Estimates of the impact of international education on the Irish economy usually range from &euro;800 million to &euro;1 billion.<\/p> <p> Section 53 of the Education Act 1998 currently gives the Minister the necessary powers to prevent the release of assessment and examination data held by bodies under the aegis of the Department of Education and Skills.  Successive Governments have been of the view that access to such data would permit the creation and publication of crude league tables.  Such tables would have the potential to be damaging to students, schools and the system as a whole, particularly as they would not be contextualised.  I support that view.<\/p> <p> While I support the Freedom of Information Act 2014, which significantly extends the range of public bodies that will come under the ambit of freedom of information, it is necessary for section 53 to be amended to ensure that the long-standing protection of examination and assessment data remains in place and that the issue of crude and distorting league tables does not arise.  However, within the spirit of the freedom of information legislation, I am taking a focused approach to amending section 53 of the Education Act 1998.  The proposed amendment provides for the Minister of Education and Skills, in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to regulate access to the examination and assessment data held by specific listed bodies.  Providing for regulation in this way gives flexibility by allowing the list of specific bodies to be amended in the future by way of statutory instrument.  The proposed regulations will prescribe only a limited list of public bodies, such as education and training boards, or ETBs, ETB schools, ETB education and training facilities, the State Examinations Commission, the Education Research Centre and the National Council for Special Education, all of which hold examination and assessment information in the course of carrying out their functions.<\/p> <p> The amendment will also ensure that the prohibition applies only where it is necessary.  Prescribed public bodies provided for in this amendment that currently release or share assessment and examination data with other public bodies for purposes of research will continue to be able to do so subject to ministerial approval or direction.  The existing position, which permits higher education institutions such as universities and institutes of technology to release such information on the schools that their student intake attended, will be maintained.<\/p> <p> I am amending the Student Support Act with this Bill by way of a short technical amendment clarifying the description of post-leaving certificate courses under the current Act.  The provision of grants for students participating in further and higher education is provided for by way of secondary legislation through an annual scheme of grants and a set of<\/p> <p> As it currently stands, an approved institution in the further education sector is one that receives a grant out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, pursuant to a scheme administered by the Minister, for the provision of PLC courses.  Following the transfer of the administration of these courses to SOLAS after its establishment last year, I am proposing to remove, for clarity, the current reference to PLC courses as being \"pursuant to a scheme administered by the Minister\".  This will be addressed by way of this simple technical amendment.<\/p> <p> I will now turn to the Bill itself.  It is set out in 11 sections.  The principal purpose of sections 2 to 5 is to provide for the authorisation of the use of the description \"university\" in limited circumstances outside the State for specified purposes; for review of the authorisation by an t&uacute;dar&aacute;s; for the withdrawal of the authorisation by the Minister on the grounds that it is not being used for the specified purposes or that the provider no longer fulfils the qualifying criteria for application; and for an appeals board to hear appeals relating either to a Minister's decision to refuse to grant an authorisation or a decision to withdraw an authorisation.<\/p> <p> The intent of the legislation as drafted is to strongly restrict eligibility on quality grounds and mission focus for this authorisation.  Eligibility is restricted to providers that are authorised under Irish law to make their own awards, providers that have doctoral degrees recognised through the National Framework of Qualifications, and providers whose student body enrolled in Ireland consists of at least 40% non-EU citizens who are lawfully resident in the State primarily for education and training.  It excludes those with delegated authority to make awards, such as the institutes of technology and potentially private higher education institutions, in the future.<\/p> <p> The use of the title is also restricted in its geographical application and in the purposes for which it can be used.  Use of the title is restricted to outside the State and for the following purposes: to market programmes of education and training provided by the authorised provider, or research services of the authorised provider; and to enter into an arrangement with any person outside the State for the purpose of participating in a collaborative project relating to the provision of programmes of education and training, or research services.<\/p> <p> Section 6 provides for an amendment to the Universities Act 1997 and will amend section 52 to ensure that an authorised provider under this Act is exempted from the prohibition on the use of the title in the Universities Act.<\/p> <p> Section 7 provides for a refusal of access to specified information through an amendment of section 53 of the Education Act 1998, as amended by section 5 of the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2007.  The Education Act 1998 is amended by the substitution of a new section 53, which confers on public bodies, within the meaning of the Freedom of Information Act 2014 prescribed in regulations made by the Minister following consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the necessary powers to refuse access to information that would enable the compilation of information in regard to the comparative performance of schools in respect of the academic achievement of their students or learners.<\/p> <p> Section 8, which amends section 7 of the Student Support Act 2011, will reflect the Department's decision to transfer the administration of the PLC scheme to SOLAS on the basis of its general functions relating to further education and training under section 7(1) of the Further Education and Training Act 2013.  This change will remove the reference in the legislation to PLC courses as \"pursuant to a scheme administered by the Minister\" in section 7 of the Student Support Act, ensuring clarity regarding the basis for prescribing PLC courses for the purpose of the student grant scheme.<\/p> <p> Section 9 provides for the service of documents.  Section 10 provides for the expenses of the Minister in the administration of the Act to be sanctioned and paid.  Section 11 sets out the Short Title, collective citations and commencement provisions.<\/p> <p> This Bill is an important step in promoting Ireland's ambitions for internationalisation and for the protection of the educational interests of our children.  I hope Deputies will agree it is vital.  During its passage through the Seanad, there was a very useful exchange of views with Senators.  I look forward to listening to the views of Deputies today and to further debate as the Bill progresses through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100010#H01275","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423651800,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports, and in government introduced, an international education strategy that endorses and promotes the internationalisation of universities.  We supported this Bill in the Seanad and, in principle, we support its passage here.  However, we want reassurance from the Minister that allowing certain colleges to describe themselves internationally as universities will not undermine the standing of Irish universities.<\/p><p>While this Bill will allow additional third level institutions to market themselves as universities abroad in their attempt to attract higher numbers of international students, the Government must do much more to arrest sliding quality standards in third level institutions that have been brought about by the savage cuts in the sector.<\/p> <p> We acknowledge the importance of the main element of this Bill, allowing additional third level institutions to describe themselves as \"university\" for marketing, branding and research purposes outside the State under the condition that these institutions can already make awards to doctoral degree level in the State and already have at least 40% of their registered students from outside the EU.  The need to allow these institutions to describe themselves as universities outside of the State has arisen from the concerns expressed by some institutions that the word \"college\" has less pulling power than \"university\".  In the United States, for example, a college is assumed to mean a second level institution.  Therefore, the change is to be welcomed as part of an overall strategy in promoting Irish education abroad.<\/p> <p> We welcome the fact that the key beneficiary of this will be the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, which already has a significant number of international students.  The Bill will allow it use the term \"university\" for marketing purposes or for engaging in collective projects related to training and research.  On this basis, we support the Bill in principle.  However, as I stated, we want reassurance from the Minister that allowing certain colleges to describe themselves internationally as universities will not undermine the standing of Irish universities.<\/p> <p> We are fully committed to promoting Ireland as a centre for international education.  However, any efforts and strategies in this regard must be sustainable and, most importantly, they must have the needs of individual learners at their heart.  The interests of students are at the core of our concerns.  We believe that we must continue to offer international students a high-quality education and a unique student experience that is based on strong integration with their Irish peers.  We also believe that the Irish education brand needs to prioritise quality teaching and quality research metrics.  As a small country with relatively limited brand recognition in key markets, Ireland's entire international education offer needs to be based on the quality of its outputs.  The quality of Irish education needs to become Ireland's main strength in these markets and needs to be the key element of any brand marketing pursued in new and existing markets.  An internationalisation strategy that emphasises and prioritises quality will also be of benefit to Irish universities and to Irish students.  It will allow Irish universities to target international students who themselves are of both high quality and high value, thus meeting our collective long-term strategic goals in an optimal and efficient way.<\/p> <p> As Fianna F&aacute;il set out in its international education strategy 2010-2015 during the previous Government, the promotion of Ireland as a destination for international students should not seek to position Ireland as a mass-market player.  The central principle guiding efforts to promote Irish education to international students under that strategy was long-term and sustainable, recognising that our eventual success would be judged not by how many international students we educated but by who we educated and how well we educated them.  The international education strategy recognised that in a world of increasing globalisation and interconnectedness with the emergence of new powerhouse economies and the reorientation of the world economy, Ireland needed to take a strategic approach to developing relationships that will be of national importance in the coming years.  It recognised the need to develop mutually beneficial relationships with countries which are strategically important to Ireland's long-term national interests.<\/p> <p> The ambition we set out in this five-year strategy was for Ireland to become a global leader in the provision of high-quality education to the next generation of leaders, entrepreneurs and decision-makers, who will make a difference in their own countries and who will form vital networks of influence for Ireland.  As was pointed out at the time, we have strong advantages in this area.  Our education system has a long history of international engagement and is globally respected.  Other advantages stem from ours being a small, safe and friendly country, a member of the European Union and with extensive global links through our diaspora.  As an English-speaking country with a unique cultural heritage and universities that are respected, are held in high esteem and have a long lineage, we are well positioned to attract international students.  It was on this basis that we brought forward a partnership-based strategy, looking to build on our inherent advantages to position Ireland as a world leader in the delivery of high-quality international education by providing a unique experience and long-term value to students.<\/p> <p> Since the launch of that strategy, universities have seen significant increases in the number of international students enrolled from the key countries targeted.  The United States is a priority market for the promotion of Irish education under the international education strategy.  The most recent US data, from the Institute of International Education, indicates that Ireland has retained its position as one of the top ten destinations of choice for US study-abroad students, those being students who spent part of their programme studying overseas, showing 9% growth year on year during the period.  Despite strong international competition, 7,640 US study-abroad students chose to do their period of study abroad in Ireland in 2013, compared with 7,007 in 2012 and 6,798 in 2011.  In addition to the study abroad segment, more than 1,000 US students came to Ireland on a full-time higher education programme.  Students have also increased from emerging countries, especially India and China.  Latest available data suggest that there has been a 142% increase in study applications from India since 2012 and a 9% year-on-year increase from China during the same period.<\/p> <p> While the international education strategy since 2009 has been a success, the Government needs to give greater support to third level institutions to help them attract international students.  In particular, the Government must do more than this Bill to boost the international reputations of our third level institutions and provide them with the resources to compete internationally.  There has been a progressive reduction in Exchequer support for universities and institutes of technology.  On the one hand, these cuts have increased the need to diversify resources, something to which the universities are committed, as reflected in the fact that a significant proportion of university funding is now from private sources.  However, reductions in funding and head count, on the other hand, inevitably have a knock-on impact on certain metrics such as student-to-staff ratios and research and publication output.  These declines feed into Ireland's ranking performance and our international competitiveness, and hence their attractiveness to international students.<\/p> <p> While this Bill will allow additional third level institutions to market themselves as universities abroad in their attempt to attract higher numbers of international students, the Government must do much more to arrest sliding quality standards in third level institutions that have been brought about by cuts in the sector.  Exchequer funding of all higher education institutions has been reduced by 32% in the past four years and there has been virtually no State investment in capital infrastructure in Irish universities and colleges over the term of Government.  These funding cuts have taken place while numbers enrolling in the sector have soared.  Despite increasing student fees, the Government has cut back on third level spending over the three years.  Colleges and universities cannot be expected to maintain the same high standards while having substantial funding cuts imposed upon them.  There is a real fear that these cuts damage teaching and research reputations at third level and make these institutions less attractive to students from abroad.  The Government must do more than this Bill to boost the international reputation of our third level institutions and provide them with the resources to compete internationally.<\/p> <p> Cutting the capitation funding to higher education has put universities and colleges under significant pressure.  These cuts are having a detrimental impact on teaching and quality standards and, ultimately, students' education may suffer.  Decisions like this have undoubtedly contributed to Irish universities' decline in international rankings.  For instance, it is extremely worrying to see the country's largest university drop out of the top 200 rankings.  Three years ago, UCD was ranked among the 100 best universities in the world, and this dramatic decline must cause concern to all.<\/p><p>The Minister must ensure that funding levels are maintained and investment in facilities, teaching and research is increased in order to protect third level standards and to prevent any further decline in the rankings.  The scale of the cuts that have been levied on the education sector in the past three and a half years is no longer sustainable, and in terms of standards, is most definitely not affordable.<\/p> <p> With regard to the other elements of the Bill, we welcome the amendment of the Student Support Act 2011, which ensures a basis for the Minister to prescribe PLC courses for the purpose of the student grant scheme.  Again, that is a vital area of education which has suffered significantly in recent years.  We hope the small measure announced in the Bill represents a sea change from the previous Minister's neglect of the PLC sector.  Several issues must be addressed to arrest the slide in quality standards and pressures in the sector.<\/p> <p> In budget 2013 the then Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, implemented a significant attack on the post-leaving certificate, PLC, sector.  He provided for a two-point increase in the pupil-teacher ratio for PLC schools.  He saved &euro;4 million and the PLC sector suffered the loss of 200 whole-time equivalent teaching posts.  Due to budget changes last year, the pupil-teacher ratio in PLC programmes increased sharply, from 18.7 to 19.8.<\/p> <p> The allocation to VECs was cut by &euro;13 million.  Capitation rates in PLC colleges and VTOS programmes were also cut by 2%.  As part of the social welfare budget it was announced that from January 2013 the &euro;300 cost of education allowance payable to back to education allowance participants would be discontinued for new and existing participants.  As a result of the changes, the number of vocational schools offering PLC programmes dropped from 139 to 131.  The decrease in the number of colleges offering PLC programmes is reflected in a drop of 1,521 students taking such programmes in 2013 to 2014, bringing their numbers down to 34,003.  We call on the Minister to do more than what is provided for in this Bill to support the further education sector and to reverse the cuts that have been imposed on the sector in recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100011#J00200","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423653000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>We welcome the opportunity to debate the Bill.  We opposed the Bill in the Seanad.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the reasons for that.  If not, we will discuss them on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill does three things, two of which we support.  We fully support the initiatives being taken by the Government in terms of the Student Support Act and the provision for PLC courses.  The latter is an important step and is something we sought previously.  Other issues relating to student support must be examined, but probably not in the context of the Bill.  Estrangement from parents is an issue that consistently comes up.  Following the introduction of SUSI, when the awarding of student grants was brought into a centralised system, there were significant problems initially in year one, which would always have been the case, but since then much work has been done to streamline the operation.  This year a student took a High Court case and won it, which meant she could eventually access her grant.  The adjacent-rate grant must also be examined, perhaps not in the context of the Bill, but I wished to flag it.<\/p>  <p>  We are also supportive of the amendment to the Education Act 1998 to provide for a refusal to access specified information which would enable the compilation of information for league tables and comparisons of schools with one another.  I accept that we cannot be overly prescriptive.  Parents and students need to access information on the quality of education in any institution, but we cannot have a situation in which information is used just to compile school league tables.  We would be completely opposed to that.<\/p>  <p>  The main purpose of the Bill, which has been outlined in some detail by the Minister and the previous speaker, Deputy Barry Cowen, is to allow certain institutions to brand and market themselves as universities outside the State.  The Minister will introduce strict criteria in that regard, particularly in terms of the rule that 40% of the students of an institution must be from non-EU countries.  To the best of my knowledge, that would prevent most institutions from being able to apply.  Perhaps she could clarify the position in her closing remarks or on Committee Stage, but it is probable that the only institution that could apply is the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI.  It would probably be the only institution that would fulfil the criteria set out in the Bill and meet the requirements of the application process.<\/p>  <p>  If an institution wants to improve its international standing in emerging markets then a name change in itself will not do that.  Other measures would be required.  King&rsquo;s College in London and MIT do not call themselves universities, yet they are renowned throughout the world for the quality and output of education provided.  We should be aware that having the title &ldquo;university&rdquo; is not the be all and end all in terms of improving an institution&rsquo;s international standing.<\/p>  <p>  A committee meeting was held to discuss RCSI and the human rights situation in Bahrain, which has been raised by many civil liberties groups.  It is important that the situation be taken into account.  I accept that it will not come under the terms of the Bill, as we cannot just pick on one particular college which might apply and benefit from the proposed change, but we must be careful, in bringing forward such legislation to allow institutions to brand themselves as universities outside of the State, that it does not have an adverse effect.  If institutions could qualify and apply for a change in status and brand themselves as universities despite questions with regard to their stance on human rights issues, that could have a negative effect on universities within the State.  Governance issues also arise.  If an institution which can only market itself as a university outside of the State wished to become a university within the State, then changes would be required to its governance status.  We must be careful that we are not taking a retrograde step in terms of allowing institutions whose position on human rights issues is the subject of question to brand themselves as universities.<\/p>  <p>  Attracting international students is important, and not only in terms of education, and we fully support the ability of institutions to do so in order to finance themselves.  Colleges must reach out beyond the State to attract more international students.  The Minister outlined the economic benefit of marketing Ireland as a top provider of education.  The matters to which I referred are critically important in terms of how we brand Irish education.  We have concerns with the strict criteria set out.  We accept that a balancing act is required.  A high standard must be set in order for institutions to be allowed to describe themselves as universities, but my understanding is that only one institution will be able to benefit from the amendment that is being introduced.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify the position.  It is an issue we can examine on Committee Stage.  We will table a number of amendments, particularly with regard to the changes to the Student Support Act.  We hope the Minister will look favourably on their introduction, given that the Bill deals with miscellaneous issues.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in voted against it in the Seanad.  I am probably minded to recommend that we vote against it in this House but we will not oppose Second Stage, rather we will await deliberations and submission of amendments on Committee Stage.  Hopefully we can have a detailed discussion on Committee Stage of the particular issues and concerns of ours after which we will make a final decision on whether to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100013#L00200","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423653600,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Deputy Finian McGrath is sharing time but he may have the time to himself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100014#M00200","speaker":"1012"},{"type":"speech","time":1423653600,"counter":131,"content":"<p>My comrades are absent.

This is a substantial number of students but we should consider how this number can be increased.<\/p>  <p>  There is great potential to develop this market further and to increase the number of students.  However, we must take care to be respectful of these students.  They must not be exploited as has happened in recent cases involving so-called international language colleges where they were treated very badly and disgracefully.  Not only did these institutions let down the students and their families but they also let this country down.  It is appropriate to state this fact in the debate.  This Bill is to provide for quality education for international students who come to this country.  The exploitation of students should never be an option.<\/p>  <p>  In order to support the internationalisation of higher education in the State, the Bill makes provision to allow certain education providers to apply to the Minster for Education and Skills for authorisation to be described outside the State as a university for specified purposes.  The Bill also allows the Minister to refuse access to certain specified information, exempting schools run by education and training boards from freedom of information law.<\/p>  <p>  In 2011, the most recent year for which figures are available, almost 4.3 million students were enrolled at institutions outside their country of citizenship.  Europe was the top destination for students studying outside their country of origin.  European institutions hosted 48% of all these students while in comparison, North American institutions hosted 21%.<\/p>  <p>  In order to support internationalisation of higher education in the State, pursuant to section 2 of the Bill, certain education providers can apply to the Minister for Education and Skills for authorisation to be described as a university outside the State for specified purposes.  In her opening contribution the Minister described the main purpose of the Bill as being to provide for the authorisation of the description of \"university\" by a high quality education provider.  This is a positive provision.  Irish universities enjoy great international respect and we should not allow this reputation to be undermined.  Ireland was once known as the island of saints and scholars and it is a reputation we should develop further.  High profile educationalists, academics and researchers have given this country a good name.  The brand names of Trinity College, UCD, UL and other institutions, are well-known internationally.  It is important to emphasise that Ireland is a high quality provider.  We should never allow our reputation to slide.<\/p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Bill proposes an amendment to the Student Support Act 2011, to ensure a basis for the Minister to prescribe post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses for the purposes of the student grant scheme.  The Minister proposes to amend the Education Act 1998, to provide for refusal of access to specified information that would enable the compilation of comparative information on relative school performances in terms of their students' academic achievement.  This deals with the controversial issue of league tables. <\/p>  <p>  As I stated earlier, according to Education in Ireland&rsquo;s International Students in Higher Education 2011-2012, the number of international students registered in Irish higher education institutions was comparatively stable for that period, at around 32,000, an increase of around 2% over the previous year&rsquo;s figures.  The survey also outlines the following information on international students in Ireland during the period 2011 to 2012.  Universities saw strong growth in their student numbers at 8% over the period, but there were declines in the institutes of technology, down 1% and in private colleges, down 22%.  The number of doctoral students increased by 35%, accounting for 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s international students, bringing Ireland&rsquo;s performance in this area above international norms.  Full-time degree student numbers increased by 6%.  International students increased in all STEM fields - science, technology, engineering and maths.  The best performing priority market was Malaysia, which saw 10% growth in student numbers.  We should not forget the importance of mainstream academic learning.<\/p>  <p>  The primary objective of the broader strategy is to enable Ireland to become internationally recognised and ranked as a world leader in the delivery of high quality education by providing students with a unique experience and long-term value.  We give out about ourselves a lot but the vast majority of international students who come to Ireland really enjoy their experience, based on the quality of the third level institutions and also because of the dynamic culture and their host families.  I agree there have been exceptions such as those colleges that shafted poor students and ripped off families.  However, the vast majority of the students get on with their lives and are very positive and constructive in their views.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we maintain the high standards of education.  The Minister and I have strong views on the proposed reform of the junior certificate.  The Minister needs to be very careful with regard to standards and assessment.  Internationalisation will be developed as a long-term and sustainable process, based on high quality and balanced engagement with international partners.  The needs and interests of learners will be at the heart of the internationalisation process.  The enhancement of Ireland&rsquo;s performance will be based on collaborative effort, including the development of a shared national brand.  We send trade missions to all parts of the world in an effort to create jobs and education plays a vital role in providing jobs.  We can brand and sell our quality education internationally.<\/p><p>It could bring in money and resources, create jobs and sell the Irish brand internationally.  The State's policies and actions should be consistent and supportive.  There is huge potential for growth.  We are focused on education and reform of the legislation, but there is also an economic and growth dimension to the topic.  It is very important that we state this in the broader debate.<\/p> <p> I welcome the broad thrust of the Bill and I will support it.  Australia has the highest percentage of international students in its total higher education student population, at approximately 19.8%.  In the Irish education system, 6.5% of all students are international students, which is below the OECD average of 6.9%.  We should aim for 19.8% because there is huge potential to develop the education sector, create jobs and put Irish education on the international map.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100014#M00500","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423654200,"counter":135,"content":"<p>The Bill authorises the Government to describe an education provider as a university for a particular purpose.  I want to ask questions on why the Government is using the merger process to create certain institutes which it will describe as technological universities.  I believe it is to fob off voters in several regions of the country.  This is not a political statement, and I will go into detail as to why I believe this is the case.<\/p>  <p>  More than &euro;400,000 has been spent on the planned merger between Waterford Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology, Carlow.  This was suspended last year when Waterford IT pulled out of the negotiations following the leak of a report commissioned by the college, which was subsequently withdrawn, which stated the merger would hinder rather than help Waterford IT's bid for university status and would delay the process for up to five years.  The lecturing staff in Waterford IT have made clear their views on the merger process and they are in the Labour Court.  Their trade union representatives recently met Michael Kelly, who is overseeing the process, and told him they did not want to be forced into the merger.  They also made the point that the goalposts for university designation have kept changing over the years, depending on what political wind has been blowing.  My information is Mr. Kelly told the TUI and Waterford IT that the institute being allowed to stand alone was not envisaged by the Department of Education and Skills.  Over recent years, I have spoken about this to a number of Ministers with responsibility for education.  There seems to be a fear factor in the Department about coming out honestly and straightforwardly and taking what will come if it does not leave Waterford IT stand alone.  It should tell the people of Waterford what it will do.  Will the Department merge Waterford IT with IT Carlow or will the Minister allow it to stand alone?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100015#N00200","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1423654200,"counter":136,"content":"<p>The merger is in the original terms of reference.

Its catchment area is as big as Galway or Cork.  This has not been stated explicitly by any Minister.  They have not come to Waterford.  There are all types of indications.  The Minister has established another commission and we do not know what will happen.  Will it state Waterford IT should stand alone or merge?  A merger will not be acceptable to the people of Waterford.  They believe that after this length of time and the quality of Waterford IT that it should have stand-alone status.  The Minister needs to confirm whether this is correct.  If she had no intention of taking on board the concerns of the academic body in Waterford IT why did she send Michael Kelly to conduct a process in the first place?  My suspicion, having spoken to some of the lecturers, is the Government was willing to listen but we do not know what has happened since.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, the Oireachtas Committee of Public Accounts was told that negotiations for the Waterford IT merger were at a delicate stage and that it would not be helpful to bring all of the reasons the process broke down into open public discussion and have a broad-ranging debate on it.  As someone who was elected to best represent the interests of the people of Waterford I cannot accept this.  If almost &euro;500,000 of taxpayer's money has been spent on this process, in the interests of transparency those taxpayers have every right to know where it all went wrong.  It is incumbent on the Minister to explain precisely what is going on with the merger.<\/p>  <p>  This does not only apply to Waterford IT.  This week, TUI branch members at Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, stated they are unconvinced of the benefits for all stakeholders of a merger between Cork IT and Institute of Technology, Tralee.  Branch committees of Cork IT and IT Tralee have unanimously declared no confidence in the process.  They are now demanding the Department of Education and Skills and the Minister listen to their concerns or, I am told, they will ballot for non-co-operation including industrial action.<\/p>  <p>  It would appear the entire merger plan is falling apart at the seams even before it has begun, based on the information and what has been said at the Oireachtas Committee of Public Accounts.  I have further serious concerns about the costing of these new technological universities.  The Higher Education Authority, HEA, has admitted to the Committee of Public Accounts that the creation of technological universities will have to be done in an innovative shoestring way, such is the lack of State funding being made available.  This is an extraordinary statement coming from the HEA, that if it is done at all it will be half done.  If something is held together using a shoestring I do not fancy its chances of it staying together.  This says it all about the importance the Government places on the third level sector.<\/p>  <p>  Lecturing staff in Waterford IT told me the merger process will have to be achieved through further efficiency or cuts in services, neither of which can be sustained in the sector in light of the growing number of students entering the education system and the drop in resources.  There is no doubt that rationalisation will certainly result in reduced course provision in both institutes.  A panel of international experts which assessed the proposals has expressed concern at the absence of further traditional supports for the institutes.  Given the current state of the public finances I do not envisage any additional funds.  I am interested to hear the Minister's views on this.<\/p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the technological universities Bill there arises the possibility that the merged entity may be refused technological university designation by the HEA and remain a merged entity indefinitely without gaining any of the envisaged benefits of technological university status.  To my mind, and to the minds of many lecturers and almost all of the people in Waterford, the merger process to create a new so-called university is an exercise in political posturing.  It is messing with the lives of thousands of young people in the regions.  People in Waterford will not be placated with a pat on the back and assurances that the Government has their best interests at heart.<\/p>  <p>  Where would one get anything like this, whereby so much money has been spent and so many reports have been written?

This Bill offers an opportunity to discuss our approach to foreign students in Ireland.  Its primary substantive purpose is to allow the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, although it is a university, to use the name \"university\" abroad when marketing itself.  That notion of universities marketing themselves abroad for foreign students goes to the heart of the problem with our third level system - that it is starved of funding - and our education system generally.  There have been repeated cutbacks and attempts by successive Governments to reintroduce full third level fees, and when the current Government was knocked back by a protest movement and by the Opposition it did it through the back door, by allowing registration fees to be raised to the ridiculous level of &euro;3,000, when only a number of years ago they were a minimal amount.<\/p>  <p>  Funding remains a problem for our third level sector because it has not managed to introduce full fees while at the same time not being funded properly through central taxation.  The answer to that problem has been to go for international students as bit of a cash cow.  The more international students we can get, the more money we can get, and that will provide the things that universities and third level institutions would like to provide.  We must reflect on that.  Is that the way we want to present our education system and is it the way we want to present ourselves to international students?  They are seen as a cash cow.  <\/p>  <p>  When the international students come here they are not given a thousand welcomes.  A few months ago, one could have seen, even at 10 o'clock at night, a significant number of people, primarily students, queueing outside the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB.  At other times of the year the queues start at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. as people are forced to jump through hoops in the absence of an online application system.  That is demonstrative of the way they are treated.  The reality is that they are seen as cash cows.  They come here but then they are not afforded appropriate rights.  Their visas do not give them full residency status.  As I understand it, their time here as students does not count towards their citizenship.  Students who have children here while they are students or soon afterwards are not entitled to citizenship for their children.  They are treated in a certain way that is not very welcoming.<\/p>  <p>  Another case to highlight, which again demonstrates this point, is the situation facing those students whose universities or institutions, particularly language institutions, have closed.  They have been left in an extremely precarious position because their visas were linked to their courses and now that their courses have been stopped they have been left hanging.  I spoke to a range of those students, and I have participated in a range of these protests, and they do not feel welcomed into this country.<\/p>  <p>  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland is part of the National University of Ireland, NUI, and it could market itself in that way.  Surely we should have an approach that is not just about milking international students.  We should have give international students full rights so that they are not forced to queue outside the GNIB, and they should not have to pay the massive fees they are being forced to pay.  They should not be discriminated against relative to Irish or other EU students.  We should fund our education system properly through progressive central taxation, as opposed to simply relying on them and then treating them in that way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100016#O00200","speaker":"1197"},{"type":"speech","time":1423654800,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I understand Deputy Mulherin is sharing time with Deputies Paul Connaughton, Jim Daly and Peter Fitzpatrick.

I support the Minister's endeavours on the issues arising therefrom.<\/p>  <p>  I want to take this opportunity to raise a local education issue.  In an interview on a radio programme - I believe it was last Thursday morning - the Minister described the recent education initiatives that have been pursued by the Department with great success.  In particular, she mentioned the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, initiative and the beneficial influence it has had in terms of school attendance and student dropout rates, which have an effect on social problems into the future.  DEIS, in particular, in helpful in certain area where we know there is social and educational disadvantage.  I take the opportunity to raise this matter as I have tried other routes, including a Topical Issue debate.  It is not so easy being a backbench Government Deputy, despite what is often said here about Members' ability to speak.  The people who get to speak the least in this Chamber are Government backbench Deputies.  The matter I raise is the DEIS status of a school in the barony of Erris, in the west of my county.  Inver national school failed to be approved for DEIS status ten years ago.  That was not because there is not social disadvantage in the area, or the pupils' parents are any better off than the parents of pupils in all the other schools in the Erris area that have been awarded DEIS status, but quite simply because a form was not returned at the time.   The reason it was not returned is a separate issue, but it has been established that the form was not returned and it has also been established who was culpable for that.  It was not the parents, it was not the board of management and it definitely was not the children.   This is rural area with a dispersed population in which there are many small schools, and every one of them has been awarded DEIS status except this school.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100016#O00400","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1423654800,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I apologise for cutting across the Deputy, but I must direct her to speak on the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100016#O00500","speaker":"1012"},{"type":"speech","time":1423654800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>Yes.

I acknowledge the presence of the Minister.  A previous speaker touched on the experiences of foreign students who come to this country.  The parents of those foreign students work hard to ensure they have an opportunity to come here.  Those students want to come here because of the excellent education they receive.  It is widely recognised throughout Europe that our universities, in terms of their lecturers and the standard of education they provide, are second to none.  We can hold our heads up high when it comes to the education that young people receive in our universities.  It is important to make that point, because I would not want anybody to think that people who come here have a negative experience.  From my dealings with students who come here, I have found that they are delighted with the standard of education they receive, with the welcome they get and with all the services provided to them.  As in any area, they might be room for improvement in small ways, but overall they find attending our universities to be a happy and worthwhile educational experience.  Our own young students benefit from the excellent wealth of experience that our lecturers bestow on students.<\/p><p>Our standard is very high and I want that message to go out during this debate.  The Minister flags this at every opportunity because we want to sell ourselves as a centre of excellence when it comes to our universities.<\/p> <p> With regard to the refusal of access to certain information related to the comparative academic performance of learners, when enacted the Freedom of Information Bill 2013 will extend the application of FOI to a range of new public bodies, including education and training boards, their schools and other education centres.  The Bill will also extend the application of FOI to bodies which are not public bodies but are substantially funded by a public body such as, for example, the CAO.<\/p> <p> The Bill will provide for a new version of section 53 of the Education Act 1998 and this will provide bodies prescribed by the Minister with the power to refuse access to information which would enable the compilation of a league table which would be related to the academic performance of students or learners in schools and education centres.  A previous speaker used this opportunity to raise an issue.  When discussing education we have to consider where it starts, which is when children go to their first school.  The proposed changes to the pupil-teacher ratio will have a detrimental effect on our two and three-teacher schools.

We pursued the issue when we heard about it.  She is under the care of a medical team in Crumlin which has also made submissions to the HSE.  The mother has had to give up work and the issue has caused immense strain and anxiety.  I put it to the Taoiseach that parents should never be put in this position, particularly when children have such serious conditions.  Last week, a family travelled from Mayo with their 18 month old son, Ryan, who has Down's syndrome and also has a significant cardiac condition, apnea, and so forth.  They were accompanied by the Our Children's Health campaign.  The Taoiseach wrote to Ryan's mother, Nichola, indicating that he trusted the issue would be resolved to her satisfaction as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  This year, it is intended to roll out free GP care for children aged under six.  That is fine.  Many people cannot comprehend how two young people in this position, in one case the child is over six but in the other the child is 18 months old, can still be denied full medical cards despite all the talk of flexibility and applicability of local inputs.  This is happening while perfectly healthy children aged under six are to receive free GP care towards the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach ensure that what he stated last year will apply and there will be common sense and flexibility applied to very serious cases?  I should not have to raise such cases on Leaders' Questions and I am only doing so because it is the last opportunity I have to achieve some realism and common sense in the two cases I mentioned.  I have been working on the case of the nine year old child for some time now.  Yesterday, officials indicated it would be another year before the discretionary card system would be in place.  I do not think that it correct.  Perhaps it was a reference to the new flexibility or the new medical panel.  Children in these cases cannot wait.  I ask the Taoiseach to intervene.  How can he justify rolling out the programme for children aged under six while at the same time denying a medical card to children who are over six years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100018#Q00100","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1423656000,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Where is the Minister hiding?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100018#Q00200","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1423656000,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I do not want to comment on the details of a particular case.  In some cases, a card was refused on the basis of income.  The Keane report commissioned by the Minister considered whether cards could be granted on the basis of an illness and it indicated that this was not morally, ethically or in any case justified.  The application process goes back to the element of discretion.  An application would be made and the case of a child or children would be considered by discretion.  That process is much more flexible than it used to be.  There has been an increase from approximately 52,000 discretionary cards issued in the middle of last year to over 77,000 at the end of December 2014.  There is a far greater degree of common sense and sensitivity applied here.  There is also the question of checks with local medical and health officials to see if there are local issues or changes in circumstances that apply.<\/p>  <p>  I note the Deputy's comment in respect of the first case he mentioned, where one of the parents has given up work.  That would lead to a change in income circumstances for the family.  Access to facilities and treatment is important in these cases, including issues that might arise for the children involved.  My understanding of the second case is that the child has access to the long-term illness and GP card, as well as the facilities that the child needs.  I understand that whatever is the medical requirement of the child has been approved.  If the child needs orthopaedic shoes, they will also be made available, depending on when the child would be fitted.<\/p>  <p>  I do not have the details of individual cases around the country.  The Minister has made it very clear that we need a degree of common sense and, where discretion has to be considered, it should apply.  If the Deputy has different information, I will certainly make it available to the Minister for Health, who is very anxious about these issues.  Nobody wants a case of a sick child not having access to medical facilities and treatment.  As has been indicated, until one gets to a universal health scheme, there will always be people over the limit for a medical card application.  This leads to the question of discretion for circumstances that arise.<\/p>  <p>  Without detailing the individual circumstances of children or any individual here, I hope the point mentioned by the Deputy about a change of circumstances in the case is checked.  I do not accept that there should be a wait of 12 months before a decision can be made about a discretionary card, as that is clearly not true if we have gone from 52,000 to 77,000 discretionary cards issued in the past six months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100018#Q00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1423656000,"counter":200,"content":"<p>With young Ryan's case, 50 pages of information has been sent to the HSE and the long-term illness card does not cover all the aids and facilities required by the child.

In October, the Taoiseach indicated his hope that the case would be resolved to the satisfaction of Ryan's mother; it has not and 65,000 people have signed a petition in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  I do not wish to mention the name of the little girl, although it is in the public domain.

This morning the number of patients awaiting admission is again at near record levels.

It is clear the Government is not providing adequate resources.<\/p>  <p>  Consider the scenario.  A patient who is ill presents at a hospital and a clinical decision is taken to admit the patient, but Government policy prevents them from receiving proper medical attention and denies them admission.  Instead, they are left for several hours or days on a chair or trolley.  I invite the Taoiseach to make an unannounced visit to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, or indeed to any other hospital, to see the challenges being faced by committed health workers and the indignities that are being inflicted upon patients and their families.  Perhaps he will take the time to visit a ward from which patients have been clinically discharged but who cannot be sent home.  It is not safe to send them home because they are denied the services they require as a result of Government policy.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has decided that this is the price our people must pay for its austerity policies.

I have had first-hand experience of going to wards and emergency departments, although I thank the Deputy for the invitation.  In the case of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, funding was approved for construction of a 12-bed surgical assessment unit and a clinical decision unit which will open next April.  The acute medical assessment unit is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week for direct access for GP referrals.  The hospital is increasingly making use of relationships with other hospitals in the Louth and Meath group to distribute work more appropriately.  A total of 15 transitional care beds were identified this week and five patients have been discharged to date.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital will be the next hospital to benefit from the Irish hospital redesign programme, and advertisements have been placed to recruit a new hospital manager.<\/p>  <p>  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital joined the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland hospital group and will benefit from that networking and reconfiguration in the nearby hospitals, which include Connolly Hospital, Beaumont Hospital, Cavan-Monaghan hospital group and Louth County Hospital, Dundalk.  The hospital has been collaborating recently with the private sector to accelerate the exit of long-term care patients, with 24 beds expected to come on stream by the end of this month.  The hospital has also implemented fully the improvement plan agreed with the Health Information and Quality Authority as part of the special measures since 2012.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health asked for co-operation from front-line staff and medical personnel, and I thank them for that co-operation.  This is an issue that must be managed in a way that will bring about a reduction in the use of trolleys in emergency departments and in the corridors of hospitals, but it is not something that can be fixed overnight.  I am anxious that the Deputy understands that the Government does not have endless resources.  If it was a question of money, the problem would have been fixed years ago.  It is a matter that arises regularly and the issue is to be able to manage it effectively in the interests of the patients.  That will be the priority for the Government.

He said a new module unit is being opened at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which is the case, but last week there was no commitment of staff, especially nursing staff, for that unit.

Strong opinions were expressed regarding the frustration and concerns of parents, teachers and boards of management.  A very dismal picture was painted of boarded-up schools and of many other schools which are in danger of a similar fate in the very near future.  Every one of us from rural Ireland, particularly the Taoiseach, is well aware that these schools are at the heart of communities.  They have been the main focal point of rural Ireland since the instigation of the education boards in 1931.  The situation has been exacerbated, particularly by Government policies, over the past number of years.  There has been a phased increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in two-, three- and four-teacher schools since September 2012.  This has affected schools with fewer than 86 pupils and approximately half of the 3,200 primary schools.<\/p>  <p>  In 2011, a two-teacher school needed 12 pupils to retain its teachers, a three-teacher school needed 49 pupils and a four-teacher school needed 81 pupils.  From this September, a school will need a minimum of 20 pupils to retain two teachers, 56 pupils to employ three teachers and 86 pupils for four teachers.  This is replicated across the country, particularly on the western seaboard and across rural Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Rural depopulation, migration, emigration and the economic decline in our rural areas are significant factors.  It was suggested at the meeting that the introduction of emergency measures be examined.  The figures quoted are impossible for these schools to reach.

It was revealed that 13 babies in the breech position were not diagnosed at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda until their mothers were in the very late stages of labour.  There were 21 undiagnosed breech babies at the hospital over a two-year period and there was one death.  Unfortunately, these serious incidents have dealt a blow to confidence in our maternity services.  I want to get clarification from the Taoiseach in relation to the patient safety licensing Bill, which is listed in the legislative programme.  When can we expect that Bill, which will \"provide for a mandatory system of licensing for public and private healthcare facilities\", to be published?  The programme for Government said that \"a Patient Safety Authority .... will be established\", but I understand that has now been dispensed with.  The Taoiseach might clarify that point.  When can we expect the legislation I mentioned to be brought to the House?<\/p>  <p>  I could not believe what I was listening to when the Taoiseach spoke about the issue of small rural schools after it was raised on Leaders' Questions.  I remind the House that three-teacher, two-teacher and one-teacher schools are in difficulty because the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, deliberately increased the pupil-teacher ratio and the specific thresholds for rural schools as part of the budget three years ago.  He actually targeted them in order that they would find it more difficult to gain or retain a teacher.  The result of that has been a steady decline in three-teacher, four-teacher, two-teacher and one-teacher schools.  Contrary to what the Taoiseach suggested, it is not a grand demographic issue.  The education Bill is due.  It is absolutely incredible that the Taoiseach can say what he said earlier and get away with it.  He almost indicated that he is oblivious to the budgetary policy pursued by his Government over three years.  The effect of this policy on small schools in rural Ireland has been pointed out to him year after year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100021#T02600","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1423657800,"counter":313,"content":"<p>This is a second Leaders' Questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100021#T02700","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"speech","time":1423657800,"counter":314,"content":"<p>When can I expect the education Bill, which will give the Taoiseach an opportunity to do something about that, to be published?

He was critical of those professionals who have failed to \"adhere to the duty of candour\".  This legislation would be very significant given the history of symphysiotomy, the anti-D blood scandal, the victims of Michael Neary and other cases.  When does the Taoiseach envisage that this legislation will be published?  Will it include private hospitals as well as public hospitals?<\/p>  <p>  I have just been looking at the legislative programme.  In the programme for Government, the Labour Party and Fine Gael promised to reform the way the D&aacute;il works, to make it fit for purpose and to legislate more effectively.  There appears to be a logjam in the processing of legislation through the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Taoiseach will recall that I raised the issue of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 with him yesterday.  The aim of this crucially important legislation, which was published in July 2013 but has yet to be discussed on Committee Stage, is to protect citizens with mental disabilities.  I could also have mentioned the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, which was published in October 2011.<\/p><p>It was last seen in July of last year and its Report and Final Stages have not been completed.

It was listed for publication in late 2013.  The then Minister, Deputy Shatter, stated that it would be published in 2014, but we still await it.  The Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) (Amendment) Bill was published in August 2014 and was last seen in November, a month where there seems to be a Bermuda Triangle.  The Bill has yet to pass Committee Stage in the Seanad.  Is this not evidence of the Government failing to manage its legislative programme efficiently?

In December 2013, the European Committee of Social Rights adopted a decision that Ireland was in breach of its international obligations under the European Social Charter, which is a European treaty which guarantees social and economic human rights, following a complaint lodged on 7 June 2012 by the European Confederation of Police against Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The committee concluded by ten votes to one that there was no breach of charter on grounds of the prohibition against the police from establishing trade unions.  The committee concluded unanimously, that there was a violation of the charter on the grounds of the prohibition against Garda representative associations from joining national employees' organisations.  It also concluded unanimously that there is a violation of the charter on grounds of restricted access of Garda representative associations into pay agreement discussions.  The committee narrowly concluded, by six votes to five, that there is a violation of the charter on grounds of the prohibition against the right to strike of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <br\/><br\/>At the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers, the Government committed to undertake a review of the national situation in law and in practice in the light of the decision.  This Bill seeks to introduce the necessary amendments to Irish law to bring it into compliance with the social charter.  There is no change to the prohibition of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from joining trade unions, as the European Committee of Social Rights specifically found that was not required by the social charter.<br\/><br\/>Representative associations of members of the Defence Forces have pledged to have a complaint addressed to the European Committee of Social Rights, similar to that which was successful in respect of Garda representative association, in order to be permitted to join umbrella employees' organisations such as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and to participate fully in collective bargaining.  However, they have stated that they will not be seeking the right to strike.<br\/><br\/>The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has called in various recommendations and resolutions for the right to association for members of the professional staff of the armed forces. <\/p><p>It also called on all member states of the Council of Europe to grant professional members of the armed forces the right to association, similar to that claimed by the Garda representative associations, but with a prohibition in respect of the right to strike.  The Bill does not propose to change the prohibition on the right to strike by members of the Defence Forces.<\/p> <p> Section 2 of the Bill would provide that associations established under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 1924, that is, the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, or the Defence (Amendment) Act 1990, that is, Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, will be exempt from the requirement to obtain a negotiation licence in order to carry on negotiations for the fixing of wages or other conditions of employment.<\/p> <p> Section 3 would amend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to allow Garda representative bodies to join or associate with the national umbrella organisation of employees, such as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  Section 4 would similarly amend the Defence (Amendment) Act 1990 in order to allow Defence Forces' representative bodies to join or associate with the national umbrella organisation of employees such as the ICTU.  Section 5 would amend the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to allow members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to strike.<\/p> <p> Section 6 would provide that actions by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, while on duty, shall not be considered as being assistance to an employer who is a party to a trade dispute for the purposes of frustrating the strike or for the purpose of section 11 of the Industrial Relations Act.  It is important that garda&iacute;, notwithstanding the right to strike that would be extended to them under the Bill, should be able to maintain the peace and carry out their normal duties at locations where industrial disputes are taking place.<\/p> <p> Section 7 deals with a slightly different issue.  In 2013 the then Minister for Justice and Equality stated that there was nothing in the Garda code, the disciplinary regulations or the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 which would prevent garda&iacute; from availing of personal insolvency services.  Nevertheless, Garda representative bodies have expressed concern that there might be a difficulty in this regard.  Schedule 5 of section 82 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which concerns breaches of discipline, includes in the definition of what constitutes corrupt or improper practices \"failing wilfully and without good and sufficient cause to pay any lawful debt in such circumstances as to be liable to affect his or her ability to discharge the duty of a member or as to be liable to compromise other members\".  Under section 7, entering or applying to enter into an insolvency arrangement could not be interpreted to be a breach of Garda discipline.<\/p> <p> I take this opportunity to point out that the Bill would have no financial implications for the Exchequer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100023#V07100","speaker":"977","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423659600,"counter":482,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100024#W00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1423659600,"counter":483,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100024#W00300","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423659600,"counter":484,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1423659600,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I declare the motion for leave to introduce the Bill agreed.

I am conscious of the irony that I am introducing this legislation in the hope that I may one day have an opportunity to lead off the Second Stage debate on a Friday.  Of course, having the House sit on Fridays is one of the many reforms introduced by the Government.  Reform of the D&aacute;il is an evolutionary process.  There are always better ways to do business and, indeed, more things we can do.  I acknowledge the reforms that have been introduced to date and I hope that more will be forthcoming in the future.<br\/><br\/>The Bill deals with how people are elected to the D&aacute;il in the first instance.  The main change it would bring about - a referendum would be required in order to allow the people to decide on the matter - is that we would move from the situation whereby at the next election 158 Members will be elected from 40 constituencies to one where those members would be elected from 157 single-seat constituencies, with the outgoing Chairperson automatically returned.  The key point is that the proportional representation-single transferable vote, PR-STV, system would be retained, with the version that we use in by-elections and Presidential elections coming into play.<br\/><br\/>I have brought forward this Bill for a number of reasons.  The first of these relates to the fact that at present there is a huge amount of duplication in constituencies.  Very often, a number of Deputies will be doing the same job on behalf of particular agencies or people.  This leads to duplication - or even worse - of work within the administrative arms of the public sector and the Civil Service.  A large cost is associated with the latter.  Another reason is that the number of Deputies representing a constituency can lead to too great a focus being placed on local, non-parliamentary and non-legislative issues.  If there were only one legislator per constituency, he or she would have a greater opportunity to focus on his or her parliamentary and legislative duties and to deliver on these for his or her constituents.  If there were only one representative per constituency, he or she would not be obliged to compete with others in respect of non-legislative matters.  I am of the view that what I am proposing would represent a major step forward.  If we have learned anything in recent years it is that those of us elected to these Houses can never afford to take our eyes off the ball in respect of major issues, our parliamentary work and matters of policy.  What is proposed in the Bill would assist in focusing Members' attention on legislative and national issues.<br\/><br\/>In the context of geography, County Kerry will be a single five-seat constituency.  I relish the opportunity of being in a position to represent the entire county.  We are a very sticky breed in Kerry and we value and take huge pride in the green and gold.  Logistically, however, there is a major difficulty for any Deputy seeking to cover a constituency as large as County Kerry.  I know my colleague from County Clare, Deputy McNamara, who also represents a very large constituency, will agree with me in this regard and the Minister of State, who represents the large Wexford constituency, will recognise the point I am making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100024#W01200","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speech","time":1423659600,"counter":493,"content":"<p>We all know the honour of representing our counties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100024#W01300","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1423659600,"counter":494,"content":"<p>It is a massive honour and we are following in huge footsteps.  One of the logistical issues with regard to Kerry relates to the number of peninsulas in the county, which makes travelling even more difficult.  I recently spent an afternoon in Caherdaniel making house calls and was then obliged to travel to Listowel, a drive of almost two hours, to deal with other business before spending a further hour driving home that night.  That was on a regular day.  The Bill would see to it that Kerry would retain its five Deputies but they would instead represent five single-seat constituencies.  The position would be the same with regard to every other county.  That would be a better way of doing business.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also has other merits.  I am aware that the Government has a busy schedule of planned referenda but I am of the view that the Bill is worthy of debate in the House.  I am not proposing the introduction of a first-past-the-post system similar to that which obtains in the UK.  Again, the system used for by-elections and Presidential elections would come into play and minority groups would still have the opportunity to be represented.  A wide variety of representatives were elected to the House as a result of a number of recent by-elections and there is an argument to be made that what is proposed would favour the larger parties.

On the broader issue, currently on the south side of Dublin there are exactly 42 places at second level to cater for the 150 affected children who are currently in primary school.  There is probably not a need for an exact match in terms of numbers because some children at the severe end of the spectrum will never proceed to second level.  On the other hand, there are children in mainstream education at primary level despite the fact that they have autism to some degree.  If they are to proceed to second level, they will need the special supports, at least for part of the day.<\/p>  <p>  We can say for certain there is a very severe shortage of places at second level.  I am sure the Minister knows only too well the anxiety this causes among parents whose children are coming to the end of primary school and who realise there may be no further educational opportunities for them.  Those parents will see other children moving on but not theirs, despite the fact that many children on the spectrum are capable of moving on.  Some are very capable of doing so.<\/p>  <p>  Every year, parents start looking for places.  If they do not get any that are suitable for their children in terms of educational supports, the outcomes are not good, for them or their children.  Over the years, I have supported both individual parents and organisations in seeking additional places.  We were really very pleased on the south side when a school finally agreed to provide additional classes.  There were two special classes set up, which raised a number of places from 30 to 42.  However, a problem arises in that all the places are in the Protestant faith school, which has informed the non-Protestant faith parents that their children are unlikely to be admitted to the classes because it gives preference to children of the Protestant faith.  I fully support the protection of religious ethos for all schools where mainstream pupils are concerned but it seems absolutely unnecessary that there should be any such protection, and unlikely that there would be a threat to the ethos, when providing places to children with a disability.  The children have nowhere else to go.  The 12 additional places are the only new ones on the whole south side of Dublin that have been provided in recent times.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the Minister is proceeding with the education (admission to schools) Bill, which I believe covers this issue.  People are quite happy with how it is to be dealt with but, in the meantime, the majority of children are excluded from the new places.  The underlying problem is the shortage of places overall.  A selection process of some sort is inevitable where there is a gap between supply and demand.  I am putting to the Minister today the overall shortage of classes.  If she refers to that and the religious ethos problem, I will be very grateful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100025#Y00300","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1423660200,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Mitchell for raising this important issue.  I will outline the current position.  The Deputy will be aware that the Government is committed to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post-primary school network.  Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes that may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, delivered by fully qualified professional teachers with the support of special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is responsible, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support students with special educational needs, including autism.  It is also the role of the NCSE to make appropriate arrangements to establish special classes in schools and communities where the need for such classes has been identified.  This is a particular issue.  Special educational needs organisers engage with schools annually in order to plan for and open new special classes each year to ensure there are sufficient special class placements available at primary and post-primary levels to meet demand in a given area.  Special classes within mainstream schools are intended for children who, by virtue of their level of special educational need, cannot reasonably be educated in a mainstream class setting but who can still attend their local school in a special class with a lower pupil-teacher ratio and special needs assistant support.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the requirement for secondary school places for children with autism in south Dublin, the NCSE set up an additional two special needs classes in the area last year, as the Deputy stated.  She made the point that the denomination issue is part of this.  The NCSE is actively engaging with all schools in the area to meet the established demand for 2015 and 2016.  I am not sure if the Deputy knows whether there is unwillingness on the part of schools because it is sometimes an issue.  I have come across it in other parts of the country.  The NCSE will continue to monitor the situation and has the capacity to open such new special classes, where necessary.  I hope that, with co-operation, the issue can be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100025#Y00400","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1423660200,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The reality is that if schools will not co-operate, it is really down to the Government to do something for the children who are not provided for sufficiently.<\/p>  <p>  I do not expect the Minister to give me a promise today but I ask her to bear in mind that there really is under-provision.  We cannot just leave it to chance and the willingness of schools to co-operate.  The schools' role is to educate all children, and they should be obliged to provide classes for the children with autism.  We must be more active in insisting on this.  The special educational needs organisers do so much work but they have limited powers.  I ask the Minister to change the approach to bring some element of compulsion into the process.

The Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, scheme, launched in 2005, is a positive scheme aimed at tackling educational disadvantage.  Its purpose is to address and prioritise the needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities, from pre-school through to second level education, and to provide a standardised system for determining the levels of disadvantage and an integrated school support programme to respond to it.<\/p>  <p>  The action plan for DEIS schools is grounded in the belief that every child and young person deserves an equal chance to access, participate in, and benefit from education, and that each person should have the opportunity to reach her or his full educational potential for personal, social and economic reasons.  Unfortunately, we are not able to deliver fully the opportunity for every disadvantaged child to reach his or her full potential as there is currently no capacity to expand the DEIS programme.<\/p><p>The economic climate of the past few years impacted on the DEIS scheme and caused it to remain relatively static.<\/p> <p> DEIS schools deliver results in terms of improved attendance, retention, progression and examination attainment.  As we saw last week, completion rates in disadvantaged areas rose by 14 points in seven years, to 82%.  In recent weeks, we saw reports detailing improvements in vocabulary, comprehension, algebra and data analysis.  More needs to be done but with DEIS, we have a framework to assist and achieve progress.<\/p> <p> Currently there are 849 schools included in this programme.  Some 657 are primary schools, 336 of which are from urban areas while 321 of which are from rural areas.  There are 192 second-level schools.<\/p> <p> By my count, there are only eight DEIS schools in north County Dublin.  This is an area which has seen rapid population growth in the past ten years and which suffered a great deal in terms of unemployment when the economy crashed.  We in the Labour Party worked hard to protect the DEIS scheme during this difficult period but as we emerge now into economic recovery and growth, we need to ensure the disadvantaged children are not left behind.<\/p> <p> The DEIS scheme is ten years old.  To my knowledge, the initial classifications of schools happened when the scheme began and little or no changes were made in the intervening decade.  Ireland is a different place than it was in 2005 and the economic crash and its effects demands a review of the classification of some existing schools, and of new schools which have come on stream since 2005, to be considered for DEIS.  Now is the time, as the economy is returning to growth, to examine whether extra resources can be delivered to these schools.<\/p> <p> Under this Government, and due to the commitment of Labour Ministers for Education and Skills, first through the former Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, and now through Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, we built new schools, replaced inadequate prefabs and engaged in extensive refurbishment works, even during the worst of the economic crash.  I commend Deputies Jan O'Sullivan and Ruair&iacute; Quinn for this resolute commitment to improving existing schools and building new ones.<\/p> <p> Over the past few years, we established new schools which should qualify to be considered for DEIS supports.  It is important that schools, particularly new schools in emerging towns with a high proportion of new communities, can be considered as DEIS schools and entitled to the supports that DEIS offers.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister to commit to an effort to find extra capacity within the Department to classify new schools and reclassify existing schools in which there is a high level of deprivation, with a view to those schools qualifying for DEIS support.  We cannot lose the progress made through the DEIS scheme over the last decade.  If we are to see progress continuing to be made through the next ten years, we need to invest now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100025#Y00900","speaker":"1013","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423660800,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Brendan Ryan.  Given the current economic climate and the target to reduce public expenditure, prioritising and maintaining resources for children at risk of educational disadvantage is a significant challenge.  As the Deputy stated, even in difficult times, both under my predecessor and in the recent budget, we protected the DEIS budget.  The current focus of my Department is on maintaining existing supports for schools catering for the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage.  This means that there is no capacity for additionality to the DEIS programme.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of DEIS is to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed.  An extensive identification process was conducted by the Educational Research Centre on behalf of the Department in 2005 - as the Deputy stated, a full ten years ago - to select the schools for inclusion in the DEIS programme on the basis of their relative level of disadvantage, with priority being given to the most concentrated levels of disadvantage.  In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey carried out in May 2005, from which a response rate of more than 97% was achieved.  In the case of second-level schools, the Department supplied the Educational Research Centre with centrally-held data from the post-primary pupils and State Examinations Commission databases.<\/p>  <p>  The DEIS programme is the subject of ongoing evaluation by the Educational Research Centre and the inspectorate of my Department.  The focus of this research is to ensure the successful implementation of DEIS and that the best possible approaches to measuring progress and outcomes at both local and national level are being used.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Brendan Ryan stated, the research to date demonstrates encouraging results.  Literacy and numeracy rates in primary schools are improving steadily, second level attainment levels are also improving and attendance, participation and retention levels are increasing.  Most importantly, learning from interventions in school planning, teacher education and parental engagement which have been developed in the DEIS programme is now being used in the wider school system to improve teaching and learning outcomes in all schools.  However, there remains a gap between the overall achievements of children in DEIS schools and the national average which means that supports for schools catering for the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage must be maintained.<\/p>  <p>  An overall report on the learning from DEIS is currently being prepared by the Economic and Social Research Institute.  This report will incorporate information on the various inputs, processes and educational outcomes contained in the findings from the DEIS research and evaluations conducted by the Educational Research Centre and the Department's inspectorate to date.  It will also review other Irish and international related research on educational disadvantage.  The report will assess the main findings of the evaluations and provide advice to inform future policy direction on educational disadvantage, including DEIS.  This report is currently being finalised and I expect to receive it shortly.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, for the present, my focus and that of my Department is on taking the learning from DEIS and applying it to future policy making.  This will ensure that future policy direction to tackle educational disadvantage will be evidence-based and grounded in the solid body of experience provided by the DEIS programme.<\/p>  <p>  I expect the report to which I referred in the next few weeks.  As the Deputy stated, we have not really been able to expand.  Despite the fact that the programme is in existence for ten years, there has not been expansion.  This will give us an opportunity to look at the success of DEIS and whether there should be other areas in DEIS.  There is quite a lot of evidence, including the retention figures issued last week, on the success of DEIS, but it is time to re-evaluate it and to ensure that we do anything that needs to be done to change it for the better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100026#Z00200","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1423660800,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot underestimate the role a school plays in improving social cohesion within a community.  New communities, areas of economic deprivation and emerging towns need this strength in their local schools.  I am glad to hear that we are expecting a report from ESRI in the near future and on foot of that report, I hope to see some action in this area.<\/p>  <p>  Society does not remain static and Government policy instruments, such as the DEIS scheme, need to evolve with the dynamic nature of society.  I cannot emphasise enough the need for the Government to act at this early phase in our recovery to strengthen disadvantaged schools and help individual pupils.  Intelligence, ability and potential do not know income brackets, geography or privilege.  Given the right supports, we can continue to assist more children to reach the limits of their potential through school by providing the relevant supports.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned the initial assessments were made in 2005.  At that stage, variables involved for primary schools were the percentage unemployment, the percentage of lone parenthood, the percentage of Travellers, the percentage of large families, that is, five or more children, the percentage of eligibility for free books and the percentage in local authority accommodation.  The latter figure for the percentage in local authority accommodation might now also include the percentage on rent supplement because that has changed dramatically in the past ten years.  A consideration today might be given to the percentage of non-English speaking pupils or parents in communities, particularly in the north and west Dublin areas, which is a big problem.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister stated that her priority is to maintain existing supports as there is no added capacity at this time and to focus on the most concentrated areas, but I believe there are new schools which, if there were an evaluation based on those criteria, would meet the criteria and should be included in DEIS.  Hopefully, the report to which she refers might lead to a wider look at this and determine whether there are gaps that need to be addressed - I believe there are.  Now is the time to take a fresh look at it and I look forward to seeing progress on this matter in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100026#Z00300","speaker":"1013"},{"type":"speech","time":1423660800,"counter":514,"content":"<p>This report will certainly give us an opportunity to look at the whole programme, including whether there are areas left out.<br\/><br\/>The allocation from my budget for 2014 was &euro;96.5 million.

It is fair to say there are considerable challenges ahead if the proposed merger is to take place.<\/p>  <p>  The TUI has expressed some concerns about the proposed benefits of a merger.  It has laid the blame clearly at the door of the Department of Education and Skills.  There is a requirement for the merger to take place before any designation of technological university status is given.  The TUI has said a number of issues arise relating to the policy approach and the criteria.  I will ask the Minister in more detail in the supplementary question about some of the criteria, which to be frank, are very restrictive in terms of the number of staff that must hold a PhD qualification, the number of staff who must hold a level 9 qualification and the fact that Cork IT and Tralee IT will not meet the criteria.  With any proposed merger I expect there will be a reduction in teaching staff numbers and in course provision.  They are issues on which concern has been expressed by the TUI.  There is much concern about the proposed merger and whether it is viable any longer.

Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien outlined that the TUI has lodged a complaint.  Academic staff in both of the colleges have made it clear that they have no confidence in the process at any level, which is a worrying state of affairs.  Neither are they convinced by the report published last year by a panel of international experts.  Furthermore, they are not impressed by the Government's financial commitment.  They are underwhelmed by the lack of engagement and consultation.  In contacts I and my colleagues have had with the TUI and others and from reading media reports, it is evident that there is widespread concern.  There is also concern that change will result in a reduction in the number of courses being provided in both institutes.  That is an important issue as a wide variety of courses are on offer at present.  We have always championed the availability of the proper courses.<br\/><br\/>The Government has a poor record of engaging with staff when advancing reforms in the education sector.  The debacle over the junior cycle provides ample evidence of that.  The prospect of industrial action looms once again.  The staff are concerned that any merged entity may be refused technological university designation by the Higher Education Authority and remain as a merged entity indefinitely without gaining any of the envisaged benefits of technological university status.  Does the Minister accept the contention that &quot;the process adopted to date has ignored the expertise and experience of TUI lecturers and has failed to examine, in sufficient detail, the risks to which both institutes will be exposed as a consequence of a merger&quot;?  Will she ensure that any attempt to expedite this merger will be halted until such time as the participants have confidence in the process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100027#AA00300","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speech","time":1423661400,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I thank both Deputies.  The objectives of the technological sector reform are to raise standards, to deliver better quality outcomes for students and for other stakeholders in the region and to enhance the performance of institutes of technology.  This should be the case whether they are seeking technological university status or remaining as stand-alone institutes.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the development of regional clusters in higher education we have also prioritised the development of more effective collaborations between all of the institutions in a cluster.  Two priorities that have been set for each cluster are better student pathways between the institutions and co-ordinated academic planning to reduce duplication and improve quality of programmes.  That work is ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the technological university designation process, as the Deputies will be aware, detailed plans were submitted to the HEA early last year by two consortia of institutes of technology as part of the process towards designation as a technological university.  Cork and Tralee institutes of technology put forward proposals for a merger in Munster leading to an application for a technological university for the region.  Dublin, Blanchardstown and Tallaght institutes of technology also propose to form a strong new institution for the city and county of Dublin.  Both consortia have been assessed by an international expert panel appointed by the HEA.  The panel has found that they are on a clear trajectory to meet the very robust performance and quality criteria that have been set down for merging institutes that wish to apply for the new technological university status.  I stress the word &ldquo;wish&rdquo; because other regions did not apply whereas the institutes of technology in question decided to apply.<\/p>  <p>  That concludes stage 3 of the four-stage process towards designation as a technological university for the two consortia.  I know that the two consortia have been carefully considering the reports of the expert panel.  Following merger, stage 4 consists of an application to the HEA to become a technological university.  The HEA will consider whether the high performance bar has been reached following another independent international expert assessment.  The HEA will then make a recommendation to me on whether technological university status should be awarded.<\/p>  <p>  Both consortia have more work to do to complete their mergers, and to reach the criteria which have been set out by Government.  In the initial stage of the process, institutions were asked to state how the transition from their current status to final designation would be financed.  Both consortia acknowledge the costs involved in the merger and designation process, but they have also committed to meeting those costs from within their own budgets.  For example, in Munster, while there is an upfront cost in meeting the criteria and implementing the project, the institutes have also shown that they expect to recoup the upfront costs in subsequent years.  In the longer term, they anticipate that it will allow them to develop surpluses which will be available for investment in infrastructure in future years.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, we are aware of the benefits that will arise for the institutions, students and the higher education system more generally from the reforms.  As a result, the HEA has provided funding in 2014 to provide some support to institutions involved in mergers.  That has included some additional funding to the Munster TU consortium, the Dublin TU consortium and for the amalgamation of teacher education colleges at DCU.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of consultation, good communication between the leadership of any institute of technology entering into a merger and the staff and students of the higher education institution is extremely important in order that a shared vision and understanding of the new institution can be developed.  That message has been conveyed by the HEA and by my Department from the outset.  It is a message I have conveyed personally to those involved.<\/p>  <p>  At national level, my predecessor published the general scheme of a technological universities Bill in January 2014.  The scheme completed pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection.  The engagement by a range of stakeholders in the pre-legislative scrutiny of the scheme was very welcome.  A number of changes to the published general scheme will be made during the drafting process on foot of the recommendations of the joint committee.  There has been engagement with stakeholders on this aspect of higher education reform and I would obviously welcome further engagement as the reform programme continues to roll out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100027#AA00400","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1423661400,"counter":519,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her reply.

We now face a situation where the very people who are being asked to deliver technological university status have no confidence in the process.  They envisage a situation whereby a merged entity could be created but that it might fail to meet the strict criteria.

I wish to pay tribute to the manager and front-line staff in Clonmel hospital and in the other Tipperary hospitals, St. Patrick's, St. Theresa's, St. Brigid's, Cluain Arainn and Tipperary, for their work.  They are dealing under pressure with quite ill patients who are on trolleys in corridors.  It is not acceptable in this day and age and the situation is getting worse instead of better.  I had a call yesterday from a 98 year old who was on a trolley in Clonmel - or South Tipperary General Hospital, as they like to call it, but I know it as St. Joseph's in Clonmel.  There were 19 patients on trolleys yesterday.  South Tipperary General Hospital is an old hospital, albeit a very functioning and good hospital.  However, it does not have the capacity, nor even the space in the corridors, to allow for any kind of treatment or examination of patients, because the physical width of the corridors is too narrow.  The hospital had to employ a security man last week to move the accompanying families out of the corridor.  These people were trying to stay with their family members to cover them and be with them while they were waiting to be seen.  It is a disgraceful situation by any standards.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome some people who are in the Gallery.  I welcome the Dunne family who received an award from Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, Michael D. Higgins, for their 30 years of care work.  I welcome Councillor Richie Molloy, who is manager of the carers.  Only for all the work they do there would be many more people in hospital.  <\/p>  <p>  I remind the Minister of State that the reality is awful.  The fair deal scheme is log-jammed with a 15-week delay.  This is where that awful term \"bed blockers\" is used.  It is an awful name.  People who do not want to be in hospital and they have decided to go to a nursing home cannot get onto the fair deal scheme.  This is costing the health service &euro;4 million a week.  Those people could stay in a nursing home for &euro;1,000 a week while it costs &euro;1,000 a day for a bed in a hospital.  There is no logic and no joined-up thinking.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the HIQA report on patient safety which found in 2011 that of the total number of patients who attended the accident and emergency department in Tallaght hospital, 14% of those left without being treated.  This is happening in every hospital and it is getting worse.  People cannot bear it any longer because it is dangerous and unacceptable.  If they have a family to look after them they leave and go to the GP.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to what others have said, including Dr. Aidan Gleeson, head of the emergency department in Beaumont Hospital which is currently under siege from serious overcrowding.  He said today that patients left on trolleys suffer increased risk of harm or death.  He is an eminent doctor in Beaumont.  Patients with heart attacks are being diagnosed late while patients with pneumonia and sepsis may not be getting the resuscitation and antibiotics quickly enough because they cannot get a doctor to examine them.  Dr. Gleeson said that this is the reality in hospitals.  Those are not my words.  One would find better in the Third World.  Who is going to take charge of this situation?  It is outrageous.  <\/p>  <p>  There has been a national crisis in accident and emergency departments for years.  I do not blame the Minister of State or the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.  However, it must be dealt with and not by this so-called task force.  As the Taoiseach told me last week, it is an expert panel.  It is a case of all chiefs and no Indians.  What we need is a manager like Grace Rothwell and other managers and front-line staff to be on that panel, not individual vested interests representing the consultants or the INMO - I agree they must be represented but at different forums.  We need to take this out and look at it properly and to have a functioning and dedicated team of people who know what they are doing and above all, who will have the support of HSE senior management, so that they can deal with the crisis in accident and emergency departments.  This task force is not fit for purpose because all the top guns are on it.  They are pushing paper around, making decisions, looking for promotion, minding their own jobs and not looking after the health of the public who deserve it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100028#BB00700","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1423662000,"counter":527,"content":"<p>I am taking this topical issue on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  I welcome the people in the Gallery who are in receipt of the acknowledgement of the help and care they have delivered to people in need of it down through the years.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputies for raising this issue today.  I wish to emphasise that the Government regards trolley waits as unacceptable and it acknowledges the difficulties which overcrowding in accident and emergency causes for patients, their families and the staff who are doing their utmost to provide safe, quality care in very challenging circumstances.  As of this morning, the 8 a.m. update from hospitals indicated 400 patients on trolleys.  While 400 people waiting for a hospital bed is not in any way acceptable, it must be acknowledged that through the hard work of hospitals working together, supported by other HSE services, HSE management and the Department, we have significantly reduced the numbers which were experienced on 6 January of this year.<\/p><p>All hospitals have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care.  Triage is operated to prioritise patients so those with most acute needs are seen and treated as soon as possible.  Senior clinicians are a key part of this system, and working with hospital management to minimise potential risk and ensure the safest possible care is a responsibility they deal with as part of their duties every day in hospitals.<\/p> <p> Measures to manage emergency department surges involve the full health system including primary, community and continuing care services to ensure that all available capacity and options are utilised and brought to bear on the situation.  Some of the measures taken by hospitals to reduce overcrowding include the opening of additional overflow areas, the curtailing of non-emergency surgery, the provision of additional diagnostics and focus on discharge planning, which I believe is key.<\/p> <p> The House is aware the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, convened the emergency department task force to find long-term solutions to overcrowding by providing additional focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by the current trolley waits.  It is made up of relevant stakeholders, such as senior doctors, lead hospital consultants, GPs, HSE national directors, union representatives and senior officials from the Department of Health and the HSE.  A representative of the nursing home sector should also be on the task force and I have written to the Minister in this respect.<\/p> <p> At the task force meeting on 2 February it considered a draft action plan specifically to address emergency department issues, with a view to a significant reduction in trolley waits over the course of 2015.  We are determined that the action plan is completed as soon as possible, taking the views of the task force into account, and then operationalised without delay.  The task force is due to meet again on 9 March.  I reassure the Deputy that we are working hard to find workable solutions to the management of emergency care, with optimum patient care and patient safety at all times remaining a Government priority.  The Deputy and I know this is not an issue which arose recently.  It has been with us for years.  We are determined to find a solution to it.  Everyone else in the world has done so and it is not beyond us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100028#BB00800","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423662600,"counter":529,"content":"<p>I am disappointed the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is not here but I accept the Minister of State.  I contend the service is not safe and it is not a quality service; this has been stated by consultants and not by me.  The Minister of State said front-line staff endeavour to provide a safe and quality service, which they do, but they cannot do so without the tools or the means.  If there is a fire we call the fire brigade, which is why I stated the task force is not fit for purpose and should be disbanded and the job given to people who know how to sort out the problem and who deal with it on a daily basis, not senior HSE officials who were all missing at Christmas when HSE officialdom was closed for almost 11 days.  The trolleys backed up again because nobody received a letter.<\/p>  <p>  What about the patients who are waiting in ambulances who cannot be taken from the ambulances and put onto trolleys because the hospital in Clonmel and other hospitals do not have a physical trolley in the building?  The Government is looking in the wrong places.  St. Michael's unit in South Tipperary General Hospital was forced to close and money was thrown at other services to pick up the slack for a while.  It was the case that people who presented voluntarily for psychiatric care at South Tipperary General Hospital were taken by a private company to Kilkenny, but this service was withdrawn by e-mail last Friday week.  It is a scandal.  Now these patients must sit or stand and wait until 9 o'clock the following morning, on a chair if they can get one.  This is exacerbating the situation in the accident and emergency department at the hospital.  This is the result of a direct action by the Department, which gave us a service for a year and then took it away.  When St. Michael's unit closed a service was provided for patients who present voluntarily, who do not feel well and know they do not feel well and need treatment, but it was taken away by an e-mail to the hospital manager last Friday week.  It is scandalous and disgraceful.  The actions being taken by one office is damaging and putting more pressure on accident and emergency departments.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State does not know what is going on in the HSE and the sooner it is disbanded, as was promised by the previous Government and this Government, the better.

Dr. Muldoon was selected following a comprehensive independent recruitment and selection process which was conducted at my request by the Public Appointments Service.  The Government, at its meeting of 3 February 2015, approved the nomination of Dr. Niall Muldoon for appointment by the President as Ombudsman for Children in accordance with the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.<br\/><br\/>The relevant legislative provisions with regard to appointment to the Office of Ombudsman for Children are as described in section 4 of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002, which provides in section 4(2), &quot;The appointment of a person to be the Ombudsman for Children shall be made by the President upon resolution passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and by Seanad &Eacute;ireann recommending the appointment of the person.&quot;  This is the reason the motion is before the House today.<br\/><br\/>Section 4(4) of the Act states that a person appointed to be the Ombudsman for Children shall hold the Office of Ombudsman for Children for a term of six years and may be re-appointed once only to that office for a second term.  The first Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, was appointed on 18 December 2003 for a six-year term of office and was reappointed with effect from 18 December 2009 for a further six-year term.  There was unanimous support in both Houses for these appointments.<br\/><br\/>I acknowledge Ms Logan, and record my appreciation for the work she has done as the first Ombudsman for Children, and her achievements over ten years in building the office and working tirelessly for the rights and welfare of children.  I wish her every success in her new career.<\/p><p>The Ombudsman for Children's office was established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 to promote and safeguard the rights and welfare of children.  The Ombudsman for Children is independent of the Government and is accountable to the Oireachtas.  The office is in place to provide an additional protection for children and, in this context, it is crucial that the Ombudsman for Children has the ability to advocate independently for children.  The key functions of the role are to promote and safeguard the rights and welfare of children, to examine and investigate complaints about services provided to children, to provide advice regarding children's rights and to conduct research on relevant issues.<br\/><br\/>The remit of the Ombudsman for Children has been significantly expanded and largely aligned with the remit of the Ombudsman with effect from May 2013 as a result of the changes enacted in the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012.  The responsibility for the Ombudsman for Children's office transferred to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs from the Minister for Health with effect from 3 June 2011.  The role of the Minister is limited primarily to governance matters, particularly staffing and finance, given the Ombudsman for Children's statutory independence.<br\/><br\/>The process which resulted in Dr. Muldoon's selection began in August 2014 with meetings between officials in my Department and colleagues in the Public Appointments Service.  In September 2014, I announced that the Public Appointments Service would engage in an independent process to find a suitable replacement to fill this important role.  The PAS is recognised as a centre of excellence for public service recruitment and selection across a range of posts from entry level to professional, technical and senior executive positions.  The recruitment process was conducted in accordance with the codes of practice of the Commission for Public Service Appointments, and the PAS ensured that the process adhered to the principles of fairness, quality and recruitment on merit.<br\/><br\/>The PAS advertised the position on the 31 October 2014 on its website <i>publicjobs.ie<\/i>.  The job was promoted through international channels in order to give the widest scope for potential applicants in comparable jurisdictions.  Applications for the post were received from a wide range of candidates, both inside and outside the State, with a diverse range of backgrounds.  I was pleased and encouraged at the interest in this important role.  Ninety-seven eligible applicants were considered by a selection board for shortlisting. Twelve candidates were shortlisted for preliminary interview on 16 and 17 December.  Five of these candidates were then selected for a final interview and assessment, which took place on 28 January 2015.  Dr. Niall Muldoon was the successful candidate to emerge from this rigorous process.<br\/><br\/>A unique element of this recruitment process was the involvement of children at all stages.  There were two consultation workshops with children and young people on 20 and 21 October 2014 to provide input into the final personal specification and the advertisement for the post.  I had the pleasure of attending both of these consultations, the first with a younger group aged eight to 12 years and the second with an older group aged 13 to 17 years.  At these consultations, a panel of children was selected to become involved in a roleplay assessment as part of the final selection process.  The final assessment included a roleplay session for each candidate with 11 children based on topics developed by the children themselves.  The final interview included a presentation.  Two children were involved with the interview board in assessing the presentation, but the children were not involved in assessing the other competencies that were examined by the adult members of the final interview board.  It is safe to say that the voice of children was heard loudly during this process.<br\/><br\/>Dr. Muldoon is currently director of investigations at the Ombudsman for Children's office.  He has been in this role for two and a half years and oversees the handling of almost 1,600 complaints per year made by, or on behalf of, children and young people about public bodies such as the HSE, schools and voluntary hospitals.  He ensures that a culture of independence, impartiality and, most importantly, child-centredness underpins the work at all times.  Prior to joining the Ombudsman for Children's office, Dr. Muldoon spent five years as national clinical director of CARI, Children at Risk in Ireland, a children's charity, based in Dublin, Limerick and Cork, providing therapy and support to children and families affected by sexual abuse.  He is a registered clinical and counselling psychologist who has worked in the area of child protection for almost 20 years.  He spent ten years working in the Granada Institute providing therapy, risk assessments and support to adults who had sexually offended against children and those who had been abused as children.  He was regularly called upon to provide expert testimony in the courts.  He also has extensive experience of lecturing up to doctoral level in both TCD and UCD.  <br\/><br\/>Clearly, his experience shows that he has the range of professional and academic experience that makes him suitable for the position.  The rigorous assessment and selection process conducted by the PAS concluded that he was the best candidate for the job.  I would like to take this opportunity to wish him every success in this important and vital role.  <br\/><br\/>I am happy to recommend the adoption of this resolution to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100029#CC01700","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":547,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the appointment of Dr. Niall Muldoon as the new Ombudsman for Children.  He brings a wealth of experience and insight to the role from his work in the area of child protection for almost 20 years.  His extensive knowledge and expertise makes him an ideal candidate to safeguard the rights and welfare of children.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of Ombudsman for Children, which has just marked its tenth anniversary this year, has become an intrinsic part of Ireland's social and public affairs in ensuring that the voices of children are heard.  We would like to pay tribute to Dr. Muldoon on his work with the office to date and wish him well in his new role.  We hope he will build on the great work that has been carried out during the ten years since the office was established.<\/p>  <p>  I also take this opportunity to thank the outgoing ombudsman, Ms Emily Logan, who has provided the State and its citizens with an invaluable service since the establishment of the office.  She has been at the forefront in establishing the office as a fearless defender of the rights of the vulnerable and the voice of children in our society.  I wish her every success in her new role as chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  Her independence and vision will be an enormous asset to the new human rights body.<\/p>  <p>  The ombudsman's office was set up in the context of a national children's strategy launched in 2000, which at the time was internationally welcomed as a model of good practice for the provision of supports and services for children.  That strategy marked a transformation in acknowledging the rights and the voice of children and in ensuring their concerns are central in political and administrative decisions.  As set out at the time, its three main goals were to provide for an Ireland where children are respected as young citizens with a valued contribution to make and a voice of their own, where all children are cherished and supported by family and the wider society, and where they enjoy a fulfilling childhood and realise their potential.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland, like other countries, established the ombudsman in the context of its international obligations as a signatory of United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  However, there are not many countries that have domesticated the convention in the way Ireland has done, and for this both Ms Logan and Dr. Muldoon should be applauded.<\/p>  <p>  The policy challenge is to realise the implications of the national children's strategy and our obligations under the UN convention, as well as the recent constitutional amendment, in practice.  The role of an ombudsman is crucial in this regard: highlighting inequalities, advising the Government on how rights can be strengthened and, most importantly, handling complaints from people who believe that the rights of a child have not been met by State bodies.  <\/p>  <p>  The office has had a tremendously positive influence on Irish political and administrative systems and has been to the front in promoting cultural change in the way we think about public services, putting children to the fore in all decisions.  It has acted as an empowering resource for children and families when dealing with authorities.  Over the past ten years public knowledge of the office complaints procedure has grown and, with it, the number of complaints lodged and investigated.  From 100 complaints in its first year, there have since been 10,000 complaints in the past ten years.<\/p>  <p>  While the ombudsman has had an active and transformational effect on public services, the reality is that the Government is not doing enough to act on some of the ombudsman's recommendations and, more generally, to implement the Children First agenda.<\/p><p>The Government has proved all too good in the past at spouting rhetoric on cherishing the children of the nation equally, but the child protection services are not adequately resourced.  As a result, dedicated front-line workers face major challenges in ensuring the most vulnerable in our society are protected.<\/p> <p> There are still some immediate child protection issues that the Government has yet to address.  The Children First Bill, published last year, and which was promised in 2011, does not go far enough in ensuring that people are forced to speak up when children are vulnerable to abuse.  While the Children First Bill is supposed to end a culture of turning a blind eye to child abuse and other child protection issues, the Bill as proposed lacks teeth. <\/p> <p> For instance, concerns have been raised, including by me, that the new Bill does not include any sanctions for those who refuse to report child protection issues.  While professionals working with children will now be legally obliged to report concerns, there will be no consequences or penalties if they do not.  Furthermore, no additional resources are being provided to implement the measures provided in this Bill.  The introduction of mandatory reporting of allegations of child abuse must be backed up with adequate resources to handle all cases of suspected abuse.  There will not be a properly functioning child protection structure in this State if our system cannot handle each and every allegation that is reported to the authorities.<\/p> <p> The volume of concerns about children at risk reported to social services has increased by some 98% over the past seven years, from 21,000 to 41,600.  However, budgets and staffing levels are nowhere near what is required to deal with these increased demands.  The reality is that services are under severe pressure.  Front-line social services are struggling to cope with heavy caseloads and scarce resources.  Many cases are not getting the kind of rapid response they require.  According to the latest figures, for example, there were around 9,000 reports of suspected abuse, neglect or welfare concerns, of which 3,500, having been classified as high-priority cases, are still awaiting the allocation of a social worker.<\/p> <p> The previous Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, expressed concern that safe social work was not possible in parts of the country in the face of continued resource shortages in the sector.  While we can welcome the appointment of the ombudsman today, the Minister needs to urgently address the shortage of social workers in the system.  The matter, which was highlighted by the previous ombudsman, still has not been addressed.  There are almost 200 vacancies for social work posts, and an average of one social worker per week left his or her job between 2010 and 2014.  We were promised a new start and higher standards with the establishment of the Child and Family Agency last year, yet despite the fanfare, problems with staffing have not been resolved.<\/p> <p> Children referred to Tusla are some of the most vulnerable in our society, but because of deficiencies in the system these children cannot currently be guaranteed an individual care plan.  According to Tusla's figures, almost 500 children in care still do not have an assigned social worker, and even if they are allocated a social worker, overburdened staff cannot visit these children on a regular basis.  These are children in need of consistency and stability in their lives.  However, the delays in the system mean that children who are not deemed to be at immediate risk often do not get to see a social worker for six months.  This means that by the time these vulnerable children are in their teens or have developed a problem, they are not familiar with their social worker and have not built up a relationship of trust through regular meetings.  What is equally worrying is the high number of social workers leaving their jobs over the past four years.  Not only does this leave a gap in the system, it makes it almost impossible for these children to build up a relationship with individual social workers due to high staff turnover.  I make these points because, while the role of the ombudsman is to investigate where the State is failing, if we as a society and State do not address this, and if the Government does not put in place the necessary resources, that is simply not good enough.<\/p> <p> I want to finish on a positive note by again congratulating Dr. Muldoon.  The work of an ombudsman can often involve a healthy tension with the Departments it investigates, and that is inevitable.  However, I am glad there is a healthy respect for the office among the bodies it investigates and, more especially, that the public seem to be interested and engaged in its work.  I am certain that Dr. Muldoon is the right person to guide the office in the right direction and maintain its independence and the public's esteem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100030#DD00200","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423663800,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I would like to congratulate Dr. Niall Muldoon, on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, on his nomination as the new Ombudsman for Children.  Given the large number of applications for the post, which numbered 97, it is a huge achievement and an endorsement of his obvious capabilities.  His commitment to child protection, having worked in the area for nearly 20 years and having operated as director of investigations at the Office of the Ombudsman for Children in his most recent post, is abundantly clear.  The work of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is crucial in providing a voice to children within this State and ensuring their protection.<br\/><br\/>In the past ten years the office has dealt with 10,000 complaints from children and families.  It has engaged with numerous public bodies and service providers and has achieved numerous positive outcomes from investigations.  It has commented on and influenced significant pieces of legislation relating to children and has delivered a human rights education programme to thousands of children and postgraduate students.  In 2013, the reporting period for its recent annual report, 1,677 complaints were dealt with by the office, an increase of 16% since 2012.  The vast majority of complainants were parents contacting the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s office on behalf of their children.  Complaints about education and family support and care and protection, at 43% and 26%, respectively, were the two main categories.<br\/><br\/>The Ombudsman for Children has a statutory obligation to raise awareness of children&rsquo;s rights among the public, including with children directly.  It runs dedicated human rights education programmes aimed at schools and targeted postgraduate institutions.  During 2013, almost 1,500 children and young people from schools in 17 counties visited the Ombudsman for Children, and 150 students from eight third-level institutions participated in the programme.  <br\/><br\/>I would also like to pay homage to the previous Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, who took up the role of chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in October last year.  Work carried out under her tenure has been seismic in terms of the progressive steps taken to create the change that is needed to adapt to the changes in Irish society and, as she has said, &quot;to make real progress in the way children and families are treated by the State.&quot;<br\/><br\/>In addition to its role in investigating complaints, the Ombudsman for Children has authority under section 7 of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 to advise on the probable effect of legislation on children.  In 2013 the Ombudsman for Children gave advice to Government Ministers on substantial pieces of legislation, including advice on the general scheme of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, thescheme of the Gender Recognition Bill 2013 and the Courts Bill 2013.<br\/><br\/>In her first annual report to the Oireachtas, Ms Logan raised concerns about the exclusion from the ombudsman's remit of the administration of laws relating to asylum, immigration, naturalisation and citizenship, including children in direct provision.  This exclusion was the subject of significant debate during the passage of the Ombudsman for Children Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> The provision of services for children in care has also formed a significant part of the office&rsquo;s work.  Children in the care of the State and how they are looked after by the HSE has been a regular source of complaints to the office.  As outlined by the office, it is clear that many problems identified are manifestations of recurring and systemic difficulties.  Due to the establishment of the new Child and Family Agency, the office submitted to the Oireachtas a meta-analysis of a number of investigations in the area of children in care.  The aim of the report was to highlight recurring and systemic issues.  It is hoped that the findings of this report and the recommendations it contains will contribute positively to the ongoing reform of Ireland&rsquo;s child and family support services.  I fully commend and support this work.<\/p> <p> The work of the Ombudsman for Children and the office at large cannot be emphasised enough.  I wish Dr. Muldoon well on the many challenges ahead and very much look forward to working with him in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100031#EE00200","speaker":"981","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423664400,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I do not know Dr. Niall Muldoon but I suspect his qualifications are considerable, as he saw off competition from excellent advocates of children's rights such as Senator Jillian van Turnhout and others.  I can only trust that his capability is considerable and I wish him well in his post.<\/p>  <p>  Our examination of the appointment of a new ombudsman gives us the chance to look at the role of the office.  We can consider this as a new juncture, look at what has been good about the office and what areas we might be able to strengthen.  It has been quite a considerable success in many ways and we know the aims of the children's ombudsman are threefold.  It examines and investigates complaints related to services, and the ombudsman has done a good job in this regard.  It is notable that most of the complaints it has dealt with have come in under the headings of health and education, and in my experience it has played an incredibly positive note.  The only warning sign is that the overwhelming bulk of complaints - 97% - come from adults rather than children, so we must pay more attention to the area.  We must consider how to empower children to speak up for themselves more often.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to service provision in general, the ombudsman has been an incredibly positive contributor.  When we speak abstractly about children's rights, we cannot divorce the issue from the economic context in which our children are growing up, record levels of child poverty and growing rates of homelessness.  There were 741 children sleeping in hostels in Dublin in November last year, which indicates that we must do more than talking about the rights of children.  We must address their economic needs, and this issue is integrated with broader policies that contradict the neoliberal agenda being imposed by this Government.<\/p>  <p>  The ombudsman has done very good work within the areas of advice for children's rights and research.  There was the example of how the Roma children were dealt with and the racial profiling of Traveller children by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When Deputy Wallace and I tried to raise these issues in the House, we were referred to as being a \"disgrace\" by the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.  Nevertheless, it became obvious that racial profiling exists, so this is an area in which we must strengthen the ombudsman's hand.  The office has a role to play, as there have been some very worrying trends.  A child care reporting project revealed that one in every four child care cases ending in the courts involves parents where at least one parent was a member of an ethnic minority.  African families are 20 times more likely to have a care order placed against their children.  We know the policy is that it is best for children to be raised with their parents, and when they must be removed, it should be linked to a reunification plan.  We must be cognisant that there can sometimes be cultural differences that are not understood and which must be factored in.<\/p>  <p>  The first ten years of the ombudsman project have been largely beneficial but we must do more.  I will put to the Minister a number of concrete measures in this respect.  We need the children's ombudsman to be represented on the new Garda authority.  It is a necessity and the ombudsman has spoken for this role.  If the new Garda authority is to be meaningful and genuinely accountable, there is a role for the ombudsman on it.  We need to have stronger actions against public bodies that breach children's rights, and there is not enough of a deterrent currently.  We must examine mechanisms to do this.  The issue of children languishing - incarcerated, in effect - in direct provision must be addressed and there must be a lifting of the children's ombudsman's ability to investigate children's rights in direct provision scenarios.  We all know the efforts to do so have been thwarted by the Department of Justice and Equality, which is not good enough.  If we are talking about cherishing all children of the nation equally, it must start with our most vulnerable.  I am in favour of extending the powers of the ombudsman.  The office has done a good job and it can be empowered to do an even better job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100032#FF00200","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1423664400,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak to the appointment of the new Ombudsman for Children, and I wish Dr. Niall Muldoon the best of luck, as it is a very important position.

I wish her well in her new position dealing with human rights issues.<\/p>  <p>  These are important issues and the country must ensure the human rights of children are protected.  We must deal with the matter in a strong and constructive fashion.  The role of the Ombudsman for Children is to promote and safeguard the rights and welfare of children and young people up to 18 years old and investigate complaints made by children and young people, or adults on their behalf.  This happens with schools, hospitals, Departments and certain public bodies.  The ombudsman also has a mandate to accept and investigate complaints about how the State provides services or makes decisions about children.  The office has dealt with approximately 8,500 complaints from the public to date.<\/p>  <p>  Today, there are more than 8,000 cases of child abuse, neglect and welfare concerns involving children at risk which are waiting to be allocated a social worker.  This makes a mockery of the children's rights referendum and it amounts to blatant neglect.  In the media today we saw that the plan to reform special needs funding for children with disabilities has been put off again.  I brought legislation before the House which was accepted by the Government, the Down's Syndrome (Equality of Access) Bill.  We were hoping such measures could be implemented for children in September but the plans have been parked and the final decision has been deferred.  They will not be in place in September.  We gave the Government the opportunity for a good build-up to aim for the September target, but the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, indicated today that it will not happen.  This is unacceptable and from a children's rights perspective, it amounts to neglect.<\/p>  <p>  We must focus on children in poverty in this society.  The rate of children in poverty has increased from 7.7% in 2012 to 8.2%.  This is a national scandal.  There are also 1.4 million people - 31% of the population - who cannot afford basic items.  There are 135,000 children in poverty, so we must address that issue.  A total of 25% of the population cannot afford to heat their homes, and we all know how cold it has been in recent weeks.  Most of these people are unemployed or have a disability.  Ireland ranks 37th out of 41 OECD countries with respect to child poverty.<\/p><p> The other issue I mentioned is wealth and access to special education.  The report of the Department of Education and Skills states that children in wealthy areas receive more special education teaching than children in other areas.  In the Dublin 4 area on the south side, for example, there is a higher number of resource teachers than is the case in parts of my constituency, Dublin 17.  The reason is that the more affluent parents can have private assessments carried out for between &euro;400 and &euro;600.  Once the assessment is carried out, they can get the resources for their children.  Good luck to them if they have a child with disability, but it does not mean one should exclude the children in Dublin 17.  It is unacceptable.  All children should have equal access to education services, irrespective of their parents' wealth or resources.<\/p> <p> The role of the Ombudsman for Children is to promote the rights and welfare of children.  We must fight strongly for that.  It must also investigate complaints about services and provide advice regarding children's rights as well as conduct research on relevant issues.  Dr. Niall Muldoon has an excellent track record and curriculum vitae, CV.  I wish him well in his new position and I hope he will push the agenda that children in the State are treated with respect, equality and, above all, are given a chance to develop to the best of their ability so they can have a future in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100032#FF00300","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423665000,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions to the debate, although I note with some regret the tone of Deputy Troy's, who took the opportunity to have a political fling at the Government.

Dr. Muldoon comes to the post with a wealth of experience.  He is currently the director of investigations at the Ombudsman for Children's Office and has held that role for two and a half years.  He is a registered clinical and counselling psychologist and was formerly the national clinical director of CARI, Children at Risk in Ireland, a children's charity based in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.

I am satisfied that in Dr. Muldoon we have a well qualified, experienced and suitable nominee for appointment as the next Ombudsman for Children.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Public Appointments Service for its rigour in managing the selection process, which included input from children, in a fair and open manner at all stages.  I particularly thank the children and young people who attended the two consultation workshops for their participation, and their families for their support.  I was delighted to attend both consultation workshops with the children and young people and it was a pleasure to listen to their views.  Over the course of the two days they gave us interesting opinions on what they believed were the key requirements in the person to become the new Ombudsman for Children.<\/p>  <p>  I am greatly encouraged by the significant interest in the post of Ombudsman for Children, which is an integral part of an enhanced architecture in the State devoted to improving the lives of our children and young people.

It has three basic strands, one of which is the internationalisation of education.  This is a massive industry in Ireland and is estimated to be worth approximately &euro;1 billion to the economy.  The Bill will allow certain institutions to use the title \"university\" in their efforts to attract more students from abroad.  There are plans to increase by 50% the number of students coming from abroad to study in Ireland.  The existing number is 24,000 to 26,000.  That is a welcome step and I am happy to support it.<\/p>  <p>  Second, the Minister will have powers to prescribe post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses for the purpose of grant aiding those courses.  That is a welcome development.<\/p>  <p>  The third objective of the Bill is to amend the freedom of information legislation to exempt education and training board, ETB, schools from certain freedom of information regulations to prevent league tables of schools.  Ordinarily, this would be contrary to my beliefs and I would be unable to support it.  I understand that the reason for wishing to exempt them is to prohibit league schools and crude interpretation of data being presented by the media and so forth.<\/p>  <p>  However, I must outline my further concerns at this stage.  While the first strand relates to a growing sector at third level, which we all wish to support and see develop, and while I support the limiting of freedom of information in this instance, I feel very strongly about the need to open up our education system to more transparency as opposed to closing it down.  I am interested in school boards of management, particularly primary school boards of management.  The Minister and the House are well aware of my views in this regard.  As a parent I am not entitled to get the minutes of the board of management meeting or to know what happens there.  There is no transparency.<\/p>  <p>  During the previous debate the House welcomed the nomination of Dr. Niall Muldoon, and I add my congratulations to Dr. Muldoon.  I have dealt with him about this issue of boards of management, their lack of accountability and the frustration parents feel when they try to get answers from their school's board of management.  It is interesting to note that the Ombudsman for Children's Office has received approximately 9,000 complaints since its inception, and 4,000 of them related to schools.  That is a huge percentage of the grievances notified by people.  We must look closely at the need and demand for accountability for the decisions and actions of boards of management and the impacts these decisions and actions have on the lives of school-going children and, indeed, the frustrations they are building up in their parents.  Of the 4,000 complaints relating to school boards of management received by the Ombudsman for Children's Office, only a tiny percentage reached full resolution.  That is an issue I discussed with Dr. Niall Muldoon in his previous capacity and I look forward to discussing it with him again in his new, elevated post.  I again congratulate him on that.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to make a final point.  We are discussing exempting ETB schools from freedom of information regulations.  While I am happy to support it in this instance and understand the rationale for it, I would have serious and grave reservations about any attempt to allow schools to keep information from people and passionately believe in the need to increase the information they provide.  I take this opportunity to repeat my plea to the Minister to seriously consider establishing the position of an ombudsman for education.  I ask the Minister to note that and respond to it in due course.  I intend to progress it further with the Minister and the Department through our work in the education committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100033#GG00600","speaker":"994"},{"type":"speech","time":1423665000,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  An increasingly globalised world economy and outlook must be reflected in our education institutions and I welcome the objectives of this Bill in terms of paving the way for more international students to study in Ireland.<\/p><p>More Irish students should have an opportunity to study abroad and we should encourage more international students to come to Ireland to study at our third-level institutions.  Preventing the creation of league tables is also worthwhile.  The focus of such tables is much too narrow and does not reflect the real role of educators, which is to stimulate, challenge and open students to a world of possibilities, rather than simply focus on exam results or the proportion of students from a particular school attending university.  Increasingly, our third-level education campuses are reflecting the globalised nature of our world and far too often in Ireland our focus is within the parameters of this State rather than on Ireland's place in a globalised world.<\/p> <p> Currently, about 32,000 international students study in Ireland, thanks in part to intensive campaigns run by our universities all across the world.  However, this figure could be greatly expanded in coming years.  When one thinks that 4.3 million students are studying outside their country of birth, almost half of whom are studying in Europe, the figure of 32,000 looks meagre.  Ireland is attractive to many international students because their studies are conducted through English.  I have some concerns in relation to increasing the number of international students.  These concerns relate to the integration and support of these students.  Many students who come to Ireland from the US are on an intensive study programme which sees their weekends filled with trips to other European cities.  This often creates a barrier in terms of them getting to know their fellow students.  Likewise, students from countries such as China often have little contact with Irish students, to the detriment of both parties.<\/p> <p> Sending a student abroad to study represents a very significant outlay for parents, whatever country they reside in.  This in turn often places huge pressure on students to achieve and excel.  We owe greater levels of support to these students and their parents during their time in Ireland, be that through mentoring, educational supports, counselling or chaplaincy services.  I would like to see more emphasis on ensuring that international students who study in Ireland get a real appreciation of Irish life and culture and are more integrated into the student body at whatever institution they are studying.<\/p> <p> Given the intention of increasing the number of international students coming to Ireland, I am not in favour of increasing fees for international students.  This is a recommendation of the recent review of higher education.  Instead of focusing on the revenue, we should be focusing on the experience of these students and examining how it compares to other countries.  Many of these international students will go on to become leaders in various fields.  We should be ensuring that their time in Ireland is enjoyable, educational and helps them develop as a person.  In the long term, this will bear better fruit for Ireland than simply endeavouring to squeeze more money from their hard-pressed parents from whatever country they originate.<\/p> <p> International students spend &euro;1 billion in the Irish economy.  Some 70% of this relates to international students and the remainder to English language students.  We should focus on growing the number of international students through enhancing their experience in Ireland and building bridges with faculties and universities across the globe.  One fifth of these international students are PhD students, which is above international norms, and greater emphasis should be placed on supporting these students and building relationships with them.  Many of them will in turn go on to become university staff and decision makers as their careers progress.  Alternatively, they will become developers of next-generation technologies or pharmaceutical advances.  Ireland will have much to learn from their research.<\/p> <p> China provides the largest cohort of international students at postgraduate level.  We need to look in a more coherent way at marketing Ireland to Chinese students and their parents.  Often the arrival of Chinese students results from intensive work by a particular institute of technology or university.  While this is commendable, perhaps more can be done at a national level to prepare the groundwork in terms of making Ireland an attractive venue for Chinese students.<\/p> <p> Particular emphasis must be placed on building relationships with universities in the United States.  Ireland is one of the top ten destinations for US students studying broad.  Given the strong historical links between the two countries, this is something that can be expanded upon.<\/p> <p> Ireland has much to offer international students and much to learn from them.  We should learn more about how the experience of studying in Ireland compares to other destinations for international students and aim to enhance their experience.  Rather than making it a more expensive experience, we should be making it a more enriching experience.  It is through enhanced experience and better learning outcomes for students that the number of international students studying in Ireland will continue to grow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100033#GG00700","speaker":"1041","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423665600,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I welcome the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 which addresses three specific areas.  It permits the Minister for Education and Skills to authorise some educational institutions to describe themselves as universities outside of the State.  It amends the Education Act 1998 so the Minister can refuse access to specific information which could be used to create league tables of schools.  These would be tables based on narrow criteria and which would not take into account the overall approach of a school.  It amends legislation so as to ensure the student grant scheme applies to post-leaving certificate courses.<br\/><br\/>On the first point, which concerns international students and the use of the term &quot;university&quot; by some third-level institutions, the programme for Government has committed to harnessing the benefits of an increased uptake in third-level courses by international students.  As part of the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs, the Department of Education and Skills conducted a review of our international education strategy.  Following on from that, a number of measures have been taken including the introduction of a new brand, Education in Ireland, managed by Enterprise Ireland, the establishment of a new Government of Ireland scholarship and the introduction of an international education marketing fund to attract greater numbers of students to Ireland.<br\/><br\/>This strategic approach is vital.  It has characteristics of the successful approach of the IDA in terms of job creation and attracting investment.  The IDA has pursued policies focused on hubs, centres of excellence and innovation.  Today's figures show the success of these policies.  In Galway for example, last year the IDA supported 63 companies with over 13,862 jobs.  These figures are the highest in seven years and now eclipse the performance prior to the recession.<br\/><br\/>The legislation is broadly welcome in that it will encourage third-level institutions to compete further on the global stage.  Greater numbers of international students lead to greater links across the world for our third-level institutions and greater opportunities for Irish companies in terms of innovation and trade.<br\/><br\/>However, I have a number of concerns.  The legislation is very specific.  It will<b><\/b>not<b><\/b>apply to institutes of technology which are delegated permission from the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority to award qualifications.  I am sure the Minister and the officials at the Department have specific reasons as to why this is the case.  However, I feel it represents a missed opportunity.  Institutes of technology are also faced with intensified competition on an international basis, which has encouraged a number of institutes to work together.  For example, GMIT, Letterkenny IT and IT Sligo have formed a strategic partnership, the Connacht-Ulster Alliance, with the aim of achieving the criteria required for designation as a technological university.  The Government should work with the institutes in their efforts to compete.  I hope the legislation will not undermine the efforts of the institutes of technology to develop and grow and ultimately provide greater choice for Irish students and students from abroad.<br\/><br\/>I am also concerned about the sudden closure in recent months of several English language schools or colleges.  Internationalisation of further or higher education brings benefits to not only the students but also communities, industries and the wider society.  However, conversely negative experiences can be detrimental to our international reputation.  While I do not wish to apportion blame, when a school or college closes suddenly, leaving students out-of-pocket and in some cases stranded, it reflects poorly on the country and our reputation, as we all know.  The Government needs to examine and review the operation of private institutions, particularly if, and it is a slim chance given the conditions laid out in the legislation, the term &quot;university&quot; can be acquired for use outside the State. <br\/><br\/>Another feature of this Bill concerns post-leaving certificate courses.  Section 8 of the Bill is important in that it will amend section 7(1)(d) of the Student Support Act 2011 and provide a basis for the Minister to make a post-leaving certificate course eligible for support under the grant scheme.<br\/><br\/>Attending university, with its highly academic approach, does not make the best use of every individual's skill potential.  Other approaches which emphasise skills and technical crafts are more suited to some school-leavers.  It is worth noting that in other countries there is greater balance in terms of academic focus and skills focus.  The creation of SOLAS by the Government is a welcome reform and one which I hope will increase access and enhance outcomes.  It is therefore welcome that this Bill ensures that courses provided or regulated by SOLAS will be eligible for student grant purposes.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the initiatives in the Bill and hope the concerns I have raised are taken on board or further explored. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100034#HH00200","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1423665600,"counter":562,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill.  In our programme for Government, we clearly set out with an ambition: \"To encourage more international students to study here and to create new jobs in the sector\".  In addition, we aimed to double the number of students from areas outside the European Union and in particular from emerging markets.  International students are a very important part of our education community.  Not only do they provide much needed funds, they also bring with them their own culture to the college or university they attend.  Nowhere is this more evident than in Dundalk Institute of Technology, which is home to over 5,000 students and lecturers.  It has students from all over the world, including China and the United States.  It is great to see many nationalities studying together in Dundalk Institute of Technology.  It is a great asset to County Louth and, in particular, Dundalk.<\/p><p>We in County Louth have been very successful in attracting direct foreign investment, so much so that one in every ten jobs created by IDA-backed companies now comes to the county.  Last week, I had the great pleasure of announcing that SalesSense is creating over 100 new jobs in Dundalk.  When I spoke to Ger Teahan of SalesSense, I was most struck to hear that one of the company's main considerations when deciding on the location of the new jobs was the availability of a skilled and educated workforce in the Dundalk area.  It was noted that the presence of Dundalk Institute of Technology was a major factor in this regard.<\/p> <p> In Ireland, we know better than anyone that education is the foundation of any skill-based economy.  We must protect and support our education system.  The Bill before the House is important for the future development of that system.  Among other things, it proposes to make provision for certain education providers to apply for authorisation to be described as a university outside the State for specified purposes, thereby supporting the policy of internationalisation of higher education in Ireland.  It also proposes an amendment that would allow the Minister to refuse access to certain information.  The purpose of this amendment, which will exempt schools run by education and training boards from freedom of information law, is to stop the publication or creation of school league tables.  Like the Minister, I am totally opposed to the publication of such tables as they do not represent a true picture of how schools work with their students.  For a large number of students, getting a C in ordinary level maths requires the same hard work and dedication as a student getting an A in higher level maths.  If we use league tables for schools, the work and commitment of a student getting a C in ordinary level maths will not be reflected properly when compared to a student getting an A in higher level maths.<\/p> <p> This morning, I had a look at OECD figures that set out the percentage of international students in third level education in various countries.  Australia, where 20% of all students come from abroad, was at the top of the list.  Ireland was 12th on the list, with just over 6% of all students coming from another country.  This is an area in which I feel we can greatly improve.  As I said earlier, Dundalk has seen the many advantages of large numbers of students from other countries attending Dundalk Institute of Technology.  I believe the Bill before the House will consolidate and strengthen Ireland's position as a world-class provider of third level education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100034#HH00300","speaker":"1068","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423666200,"counter":564,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which relates to a huge amount of issues.  When I raised certain matters regarding the institutes of technology in Cork and Tralee on Topical Issues earlier this afternoon, it was the first engagement I had across the floor of the House with the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, since she was appointed to this position.  I wish her well.  We served together on the Joint Committee on Education and Science in a previous D&aacute;il.  I know she has a great grasp of education issues.  I wish her well in her role as Minister for Education and Skills.<\/p>  <p>  The matter about which I spoke earlier on Topical Issues, which is one of many education matters I could highlight, is relevant to this Bill as well.  Staff members and education partners need to be on the same page in all educational settings, including preschools, primary schools, post-primary schools and third level colleges, when changes are being discussed.  While I do not want to repeat the points I made on Topical Issues, I reiterate that there is a need to engage with staff members before any changes are contemplated.  The unions are very strong on this.  As I said earlier, the Minister should use whatever powers are available to her to ensure they are brought on board.  As we proceed with new initiatives that relate to a whole raft of educational issues, we must ensure all the partners and participants in education - the children, the students, the parents and the staff members - are engaged in the process<\/p>  <p>  We have had a very good education service in this country over the years.  I appreciate that many people would criticise certain aspects of it.  I suppose we have put in store an awful lot in relation to our education services.  In the 1950s, a Minister opened 129 vocational education schools in one term as Minister for Education.  I think any Minister would like to repeat that.  This shows the stock that was put in.  At a later stage, the introduction of free education by the Minister's forerunner from Limerick, Donogh O'Malley, allowed a huge number of people from my generation to blossom and prosper.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to deal with a number of issues in the educational sector.  A previous speaker mentioned the voluntary work that is being done at board of management level.  When issues develop in some cases, boards of management seem to be isolated from the Department of Education and Skills and are seen as atomic units on their own.  We need to look at how we can provide greater support in such cases, which are few and far between.  I appreciate that the Department provides training and advice, but when conflict arises I think it should be quicker to directly empower the boards of management of all levels that are doing massive work and should not be left on their own.<\/p>  <p>  My own locality in Kanturk recently enjoyed a great honour when two students from a local school, Col&aacute;iste Treasa, won the young scientist competition.  The project for which the students in question, Ian O'Sullivan and Eimear Murphy, won the competition was entitled \"Alcohol consumption: Does the apple fall far from the tree?\".  A huge volume of work went into this innovative and thought-provoking project, the success of which led to various celebrations in Kanturk and Castlemagner recently and has caused many people to think.  Eimear and Ian have received expressions of interest about the project and what was entailed in it from right across the spectrum.  There is a huge volume of interest in it.  The title of winner of the young scientist exhibition, which has been in existence for 51 years, is very coveted at this stage.  People who have won it have gone on to excel in various fields.  It was great to see it coming to Duhallow, to Kanturk and to north Cork.  I congratulate the winners and the principal and staff members at their school, Col&aacute;iste Treasa in Kanturk.  I do not doubt that Eimear and Ian, as well as their teachers and parents, put in a huge pile of effort right over the Christmas period to make sure that project was ready.  I know the Minister was there on the night when the presentation was made.  I suppose they are the good sides of it and the major sides of it.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to discuss the fundamental issue of how the junior certificate is to be marked.  I think we need to uphold the integrity of the junior certificate.  Given that the primary and group certificates were abolished in times past, do the proposed changes to the junior certificate mean that we intend to dilute the system all the way and keep people in school forever?  I think the Minister needs to take a hands-on approach to this issue.  There is a need for meaningful discussion in this regard.  While exam reforms can be organised within the sector, the integrity of the junior certificate exam itself must not be in question because it is vitally important as we go forward.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of career guidance is causing major concern.  I recently organised a career guidance seminar in Kanturk, County Cork.  I brought in experts from the universities, the career guidance sector and the training boards who willingly gave massive advice to parents, children and pupils.  We need to make sure a proper career guidance service is provided within the school system.  The decision to look at career guidance when cutbacks were being made was a retrograde step.  The work of guidance counsellors now entails a massive amount of other stuff.  Secondary school students, in particular, need more guidance.  There is more pressure on them with cyberbullying and everything else.<\/p><p>The Joint Committee on Transport and Communications conducted a report on the matter some time ago.  There are no real safeguards against cyberbullying.  It is a new issue coming to the fore.  Career guidance in second level schools is probably one of the most important services that a school can make available to children and the Minister should reconsider the issue.  If there is to be real reform of the system, career guidance services need to be enhanced.  Well-off people will be able to pay for private career guidance whereas the children who are suffering and the parents who are under financial pressure, be it due to high mortgages or low or no incomes, cannot access that service.  Figures have been quoted in this regard.  Some people in the private sector are doing a considerable amount of work and providing important advice, but we must ensure that the ordinary student going through the system can also get that advice from the State.<\/p> <p> Historically, we have always challenged the education system.  It used to be for the elite in boarding schools and parents who had money.  There was an affluence to education.  Vocational education schools were established in the 1950s, followed by free education, breaking the old system quickly.  These changes allowed people from all backgrounds to be educated, but any current analysis might highlight an issue with children attending third level.<\/p> <p> Between 15% and 20% of people are not engaging with the education sector, be they parents or children.  They work in deprived areas of cities and of towns and villages in rural areas and may have had difficult family backgrounds.  The Minister meets such people at constituency level, as does every Deputy.  We try to advise and encourage them, but we must consider what the next level of education should be.<\/p> <p> The Bill's awarding of international status to universities is to be commended, as it allows us to market our expertise.  We have excelled in all fields.  Many of the best companies in the world are headed up by Irish people, but what is the next level of education?  What should we as a nation be doing?  There is a bracket of people who are not engaging in education.  Is it that they place no worth or belief in the system?  Is it because they do not have the confidence to engage?  Is it because the system has become so streamlined that, if one is outside the box or presents a challenge, one will not engage?  As a society, we should consider this matter, because it is the real challenge facing the sector.<\/p> <p> Of course there are issues with special needs and disabilities, but a significant amount of work has been done on that front in the past 15 or 20 years.  For example, special needs assistants have been put into classrooms and there has been mainstreaming.  When the Minister was on the education committee with me, we did a great deal of work on mainstreaming.  The UK and other European countries tried it with a view to determining how far it could be taken.  In Ireland, many autism units have been built on to primary schools, for example, the unit attached to St. Joseph's Foundation and located at Liscarroll national school in north Cork.  However, more work needs to be done.  Every family with a child with special needs wants the best possible service for that child.  We should consider how to provide that holistically.  I work as closely as I can with St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville, County Cork.  Of all the projects I have seen, it does an incredible job on a voluntary basis, but funding is an issue.  I will revert to this point.<\/p> <p> SNAs are handled by the Department of Education and Skills and the escorts from bus services are handled by the Department of Health, HSE south or, if the children attending schools in Cork are from the Limerick area, HSE mid-west.  Often, people must go through a raft of bureaucracy.  There is no one system.  Parents are exasperated trying to get the best possible service for their children because of the multiplicity of agencies.  The process needs to be streamlined significantly.  In the majority of cases, the outcomes of these services can be excellent, but occupational therapies and so on need to be more streamlined.<\/p> <p> Funding under sections 38 and 39 presents a major issue for St. Joseph's Foundation.  In other bodies' cases, the entire deficit is paid by the HSE.  In the voluntary sector, good people set up bodies.  Dr. Martin O'Donnell, father to Deputy O'Donnell of Limerick, set up the foundation.  He was a visionary to do so.  Mr. Eamon McCarthy, Mr. Conor Counihan, its chief executive, and all of its staff have done excellent work.  However, because it was set up as a voluntary body and has a different line of funding, it must carry its own deficit.  This matter should be examined.<\/p> <p> I welcome the Bill, but I would like the Minister to consider my Topical Issue matter regarding the staff of both institutes.  We have a proud education service and have done well on that front.  It has empowered many people, be it in the 1950s, 1960s or later.  We have built significantly on that progress.  If one is academic, one can achieve greatly, although there are issues with low-income families being unable to access third level education.  In some areas, as many as 20% of people do not engage with the education system at all, attending school for only two or three days per week or missing weeks for a raft of family reasons, but the State is only using sticking plasters and helping individual families.  This is a major issue.<\/p> <p> It is also time that we found a sensible solution to the question of the junior certificate.  We cannot dilute the great achievements of the leaving and junior certificates.<\/p> <p> As to the matter of career guidance, cyberbullying and mental health in schools are issues.  People who do not have money or resources must be afforded proper guidance.<\/p> <p> I am delighted that an amalgamated school in Kanturk, County Cork, has reached the planning permission stage.  The process has been under way for many years.  I pay particular tribute to Canon Jackie Corkery, who has done amazing work decently, honestly and across the political spectrum in the past six or seven years to bring the project to fruition.  Everyone has worked with him and I hope that there will be no further delays.  He dealt with the project fairly, openly and above reproach and I salute him for how he brought it together after the deluge of volatility that occurred before him.<\/p> <p> I commend the Bill and wish the Minister well in her role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100035#JJ00200","speaker":"987","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423667400,"counter":566,"content":"<p>As there is nobody present from the Technical Group, I will move back to the Government speakers.

This sector is generally referred to as the further education sector, and many of the old technical schools are now known as colleges of further education.<\/p>  <p>  The old vocational education sector in Ireland had its roots in 19th century mainland Europe.  Countries like Germany realised that if the new economies born of the industrial revolution were to thrive, flourish and prosper, specific education and training programmes would be required for younger people.  Technical schools then evolved and developed.  They were schools with one foot in the classroom and one on the factory floor.  The vocational system straddled that hinge between education and work, successfully preparing people to leave one environment and operate in another.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, some of the earliest examples of these new technical schools were at Bolton Street and Kevin Street in Dublin.  These colleges are now centrepieces of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The principle of education and training with practical applications was a strong belief and feature of the curriculum and syllabus of these colleges.<\/p>  <p>  In Dublin city, there are currently as many as 22 old technical schools that now operate as colleges of further education.  They are very successful.  I will refer to one in my district, of which I have been a board member for a long time, which is the Ballyfermot College of Further Education.  It sought to involve local youngsters in getting access to the film industry.  That college has literally rewritten the script for a whole new genre of film making.  The home of animation is now in Ballyfermot College.  At the Oscars, its work was well recognised with awards to Tom Moore.<\/p>  <p>  Interestingly, up to 20 of these colleges of further education - the old technical schools - are located in working class areas.  They are in places like Ballyfermot, Finglas, Cabra, Crumlin and Inchicore.  Students are flocking to these institutions which provide some of the most exciting aspects of education in Dublin today.  I say this having worked in the education sector as a teacher for some 30 or 40 years.<\/p>  <p>  Young working class males are engaging with such colleges at a great rate.  These colleges are full of lively young people who create a buzz, and people want a piece of that action.  They see it every day on the streets around the colleges and so they want to be a part of it.  The colleges are adapting programmes to engage with young people.  These youngsters would not normally have attended college and they do not have the financial means to support their desire to engage in education.  Nonetheless, they are flocking to such colleges, so they require all the support they can get.<\/p>  <p>  That is why I am delighted to see that a small but important subsection of this Bill promotes the idea of a grant system being extended and modified so that students in working class communities may avail of it.  These are people who have almost been excluded from further education, not officially but by other means.  All around this city, however, from Finglas, Coolock, Ballyfermot, Inchicore and Crumlin, participation rates in colleges of further education have risen dramatically.  That is down to two things: financial support and the relevance of courses.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is well aware of what is going on in the education sector and she is supportive of the colleges to which I have referred.  I would like her to visit institutions such as Ballyfermot College of Further Education to see all the innovations in film animation which are very exciting.  That extraordinary success story has gone from Ballyfermot to Hollywood on five occasions in the past 15 years.<\/p>  <p>  Students from all over the world are queuing up to get in there, including Switzerland, Spain and many other European countries.  That is because of the prestige the college has established as the place to be if one wants to work in that particular genre of film making.<\/p>  <p>  I generally support the Bill and commend the Minister's work on reforming the junior certificate.  She is a hard working Minister who will long be remembered after her days in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100037#LL00200","speaker":"1031"},{"type":"speech","time":1423667400,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on this Bill.  I acknowledge the presence of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who is from my own county.  It is generally accepted that she is doing a very good job in the Department and I wish her well in that role.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill refers to the internationalisation of education and focuses primarily on third-level in that respect.  As I have told the Minister and her predecessor, however, I think the Government should be looking at internationalisation at a much earlier stage.  This is particularly so, given the high level of interest that has been shown in Ireland by parents of young students who seek an opportunity to spend time in Irish secondary schools.  Apart from the cultural impact it currently has on the school community, there is also an obvious economic benefit to be derived from students coming from abroad, either within the EU or outside it, to attend our second-level schools for short, fixed periods.  It provides a major economic benefit for families across the country.<\/p>  <p>  When I started in college after doing the leaving certificate, we lived in digs which was an economic benefit for the families we stayed with.  Albeit unintentionally, it was a major advantage to the women who looked after such third-level students.  The woman of the house who looked after me did so very well and I turned out all right, the Acting Chairperson might admit.<\/p>  <p>  There is an opportunity to examine that concept for overseas second-level students.  It is of benefit for such students who will be exposed to English as well as being immersed in our culture.  There is also a benefit to the wider school community in hosting students from different cultures, backgrounds and religions.  The more we expose our young people to cultural diversity, the better off we will be for it.  It will also avoid difficulties in the future.  In addition, there is an economic benefit.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the Department of Education and Skills will examine developing a strategy with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Department of Justice and Equality, because there are visa issues facing students from non-EU countries, particularly from those states with which we do not have visa arrangements.  There are major opportunities - we speak English and are an inoffensive country.  We have not colonised anybody or tramped across the world causing problems.  We are liked internationally and we should use that to our advantage. <\/p>  <p>  The briefing document circulated by the Department of Education and Skills stated that Enterprise Ireland is a cornerstone of what the Minister is trying to achieve.  This is not only about educational benefits, but also about an obvious economic benefit to this aspect of the Bill, as well as the wider use of education as something that can be exported.  Every schoolchild or college student coming into Ireland is essentially an export and should be regarded as such.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is promoting us in emerging states and reference has been made to the BRIC countries.<\/p><p>I am of the view that there is also potential in Hong Kong, in India among the emerging middle classes there, and in certain African countries.  At present, there are moves to try to build capacity and develop a generation of individuals who will be able to lead those countries into the future.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a role to play in respect of this matter.  Irish Aid has established a capacity-building expertise over many years in respect of those who will serve in future governments in countries we are trying to assist.  There may be a possibility that Irish Aid could bring students from programme countries to universities and colleges in this country.  Those individuals could then be upskilled and exposed to what we do that works.  Obviously, it is also important to expose them to things that do not work from both a governance and a governmental point of view.<\/p> <p> The Higher Education Authority is the primary source of funding for the colleges to which the Bill refers.  Representatives from the authority and from one of the colleges in question, namely, the National College of Art and Design, came before the Committee of Public Accounts recently and I was absolutely gobsmacked by what was revealed.  At the meeting, it emerged that the college was not capable of producing a set of accounts for a period of five years and that the Higher Education Authority continued to pump money into it in any event.  Whether the authority knew that the college's accounts had not been signed off is not relevant.  The important point relates to the Higher Education Authority's ability to deal with a budget in excess of &euro;1.2 billion allocated to it by the Department and voted on by us via the Estimates process which it is supposed to disburse among the colleges for which it has responsibility.  I was left with many unanswered questions regarding whether those who work for the authority possess the proper competencies and skill sets to allow them to properly manage the spending of its &euro;1.2 billion budget.  While the National College of Art and Design was the focus of the Committee of Public Accounts attention at the meeting in question, I have no doubt that there are serious deficiencies with regard to how the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education and Skills liaises with constituent colleges that receive funding from the Department indirectly.<\/p> <p> This is a major matter of concern and the Committee of Public Accounts is going to revisit it.  The members of the committee were left with many unanswered questions regarding the number of colleges which have issues similar to those relating to the National College of Art and Design.  I informed those present at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts that if they were operating in the real world of business, their directors would have been struck off, the company would have been wound up and those involved could very well be facing the wrath of the law in the context of their ability to carry out their functions.  However, there appears to be some sort of insulation which applies to institutions which derive their funding from the public purse.  Small and medium business owners and, indeed, ordinary people are of the view that this is not acceptable.  The Secretary General of the Minister's Department had a great deal to say on this matter when he was before the Committee of Public Accounts and I hope that there will be some follow through in respect of it.<\/p> <p> Deputy Conaghan made a very important point with regard to further education.  I accept that this is a legacy issue which the Minister has inherited but perhaps she might be able to take some action in respect of it as the economy recovers.  I refer to the fact that there is no capital funding available for old technical schools which became colleges of further education.  The Minister is aware of those at Abbeyfeale and Shanagolden, which are located near where she resides and which are doing excellent work.  However, these institutions do not have access to capital funding.  It is only with the goodwill of the local education and training board that they are able to carry out minor works.  If we value these colleges in the same way that we value primary and second level schools, and the Higher Education Authority is well capable of looking after the university sector, then we need to recognise the fact that they are falling between two stools when it comes to capital works and physical infrastructure.<\/p> <p> Regardless of whether one is attending university, primary school or preschool or whether one is four or 40 years of age, physical infrastructure is hugely important because it forms part of the environment in which teaching and learning takes place.  I recently tabled a parliamentary question on whole-school evaluations and the number of schools about which inspectors had written reports detailing inadequacies.  I was dumbfounded by the reply I received which indicated that there are only three such schools.  I can think of three such schools within a five-mile radius of my home.  Will the Minister to consider the position in this regard, particularly as more money becomes available?  The physical environment in which teaching and learning take place is extremely important, particularly for children or young people with learning difficulties who require stimuli, of one which can be the colour the walls are painted, who need space and who have requirements when it comes to their proximity to other children.  All of that matters.  If one is obliged to move, as I did on one occasion, eight children to allow a ninth to go to the toilet, it can cause a huge amount of upheaval.  It is somewhat disingenuous that inspectors carrying out whole-school evaluations are expected to take a blinkered approach and focus only on what teachers and children are doing and ignore the physical environment in which they are operating.<\/p> <p> What teachers and children are doing does not really tell the whole story with regard to what is happening in a school.  I reiterate that this is a problem which the Minister inherited.  In the days of plenty, when the main party in opposition was in government, action was not taken.  I am not expecting action to be taken overnight now.  However, we should put in place a plan to allow us to address this issue.  The school building programme captures part of this matter.  If, however, whole-school evaluations were properly structured, it would strengthen the Minister's hand with her colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in the context of leveraging more money for the work in this area that is absolutely vital.<\/p> <p> I recently met representatives from my local education and training board in respect of a school in Croom.  I know the Minister has a particular interest in this matter.  Following on from what Deputy Moynihan said with regard to Kanturk, it is extremely important that the school project in Croom proceeds.  The proposed new school will probably be one of the largest, if not the largest, in the mid-west because it will cater for more than 1,000 pupils.  The conditions in which the pupils are currently obliged to learn are appalling.  The Minister has committed funding in respect of this project and her Department is fully behind it.  The sooner the planning process is completed and the work commences, the better it will be for everyone involved.<\/p> <p> This is a good Bill and I am of the view that there may be an opportunity to broaden its provisions in order that they might apply to second level students at some point.  I wish the Minister well in her role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100037#LL00300","speaker":"1058","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423668000,"counter":570,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Penrose.

In any event, I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014.  I compliment the Minister on bringing forward this legislation.  She has done a great deal of innovative work in her six months as Minister for Education and Skills and I have no doubt that she will continue to do so.  Notwithstanding the stringent and straitened financial circumstances in which they have been obliged to operate, the Minister and her predecessor have done some tremendous work.  The previous Minister did fantastic work in the context of the school building programme but the media has not focused on that fact.  As part of that programme, large sums of money have been spent on providing new, additional or replacement school buildings throughout the country.  I acknowledge the fact that my constituency of Longford-Westmeath has benefited from the programme.  Many of those in the media seem to gloss over what has been done in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The rationale behind the Bill is to make it possible for education providers to apply to obtain the requisite authorisation for them to describe themselves as universities outside the State for specific purposes.  The provisions of the Bill will apply only to education providers that are already authorised to make awards to at least doctoral degree level in the State and those awards must be recognised within the national framework of qualifications.  In other words, they must be providing education at a level equivalent to that offered by our universities.  In addition, a qualifying provider will be subject to external quality assurance by Quality and Qualifications Ireland.  In effect, such providers cannot describe themselves as universities outside the State save for the purposes specified in the Bill.  That is fundamental to the application of the legislation and it is important in the context of other matters that have arisen in recent months.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has the power to refuse to grant authorisation, and the reasons for this are set down in section 2.  Provision is made for an appeal against any such decision, and the Minister can apply to the High Court for an injunction to restrain an education provider from describing itself as a university for any purpose while not so authorised or where authorisation was granted initially but where it was subsequently withdrawn.  A comprehensive appeals mechanism is set out in section 5, and the procedural aspects that will apply are clearly delineated therein.  I welcome this because one of the difficulties that often arises is that the details of appeals mechanisms are not properly set out in legislation.  I am of the view that the independence of the appeals process is both paramount and sacrosanct.<\/p>  <p>  One can understand that the thrust of the Bill is to facilitate the internationalisation of our education system.  The professionalism, competence and integrity of those who work within the system are attributes which are renowned throughout the world.

These countries have large populations which are eager to secure the opportunities offered in the educational fields which obtain in this country.<\/p><p>This must be addressed quickly.  It will result in significant opportunities and enormous benefits for the Irish economy if we focus on it.  We are certainly opening up a new horizon.  The Minister is affording the third level institutions a tremendous opportunity by way of this Bill, and I am sure they will grasp it with both hands.<\/p> <p> Institutions that are not universities at present but that award degrees clearly wish to compete with counterparts in other countries to attract students from abroad.  Of course, we are all well aware of and recognise the importance of these opportunities within a properly regulated environment.  My colleague Deputy O'Donovan referred to issues that we have all been deeply concerned about in recent months.  I acknowledge that the Minister has to review the legislation in the context of a recent court case, and I hope that is being attended to with great alacrity in the Department, because we do not want to see students being left without funds.  The governance of the institutions has to be brought into focus.  The last thing one wants to see is a television programme showing students left bereft of the moneys they have put in and without any education at all.  It is very important to address this, and that is why it is important to provide the regulatory framework.<\/p> <p> We have a reputation for educating fantastic teachers for the most part.  Our initial teacher education courses have recently been extended and reconfigured to four years for a concurrent degree and two years for a professional master's degree in education for graduates with a level 8 degree.  Moreover, the new teacher education programmes have recently been subject to a rigorous review and accreditation process with the Teaching Council, which is the statutory regulation and standards body for the teaching profession in Ireland.  It is very good that there has been a review.<\/p> <p> Consider the case of countries that need to build up their economies rapidly, as Ireland did as a young state.  We need to and will continue to build our economy.  Teachers need to have professional attributes in order to educate vast populations of children and other young people.  Professionalism, competence and integrity are fundamental.  These qualities are what our teaching profession has been credited with over many years.  In many cases, it would cost developing countries less to send their students to countries such as Ireland than to build the number of third level institutions they need, particularly when they are trying to build their economies.  Of course, they will always undertake that task and set about dealing with it so as to build up their own educational infrastructure.  Nevertheless, there will be an opportunity over the next decade or so to ensure we are at the forefront in making the necessary provisions available to them.<\/p> <p> This policy, which enables scholarships to be provided, is consistent with the UN goal for the next ten years to eliminate much of world poverty through education.  Education is the best way out of poverty.  This is recognised at UN and global levels.  Ireland has played a significant role in the world in spreading the love of learning.  The policy of enabling Ireland to promote its ability as an educator is well aligned with our resources and strengths.<\/p> <p> Educational outcomes in Ireland are among the best in the world.  I acknowledge that, notwithstanding that one often hears them being decried.  Our education system bears up to comparison with any in the world.  We have a very high secondary school completion rate and few early school leavers.  Targeted interventions are reducing the number of early school leavers, and I hope this will continue.  It is important that we continue to intervene to ensure that those who wish to drop out of education do not do so.  In this regard, consider the change made by the Minister for Social Protection whereby young people get approximately &euro;160 if they go back to school.  I know some people who live beside me at home who have availed of this.  It is great to see them back in school.  They are delighted to be back in the education system again.  That is a very positive development.  Again, it is not widely acknowledged but, nevertheless, it is an important intervention.<\/p> <p> Our outcomes in reading, mathematics and science are significantly above the international average and continue to improve.  This is an area in which we were falling down a bit.  Now we are back on the road to recovery.  Well done to everybody concerned.  The former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, focused on this area particularly.<\/p> <p> Some 49% of those between 25 and 34 in Ireland have attained tertiary education, which percentage is significantly above the OECD average of 39% and the EU average of 37%.  Fifty-one percent of those between 30 and 34 have attained tertiary education, by comparison with an OECD average of 40% and an EU average of 38%.  We are placed third in the OECD and first in the EU in terms of participation and achievement rates.<\/p> <p> Other countries look at our small island and ask why the Irish are such good teachers and learners.  Let us not forget that this is part of our history and heritage.  We were known as the island of saints and scholars.  During the golden age of Irish learning, our missionaries, nuns, brothers and priests dedicated their lives to bringing education around the world.  I remember a former brother teaching a recent world champion in the 800-meter run.  In promoting Ireland as a nation of high-quality teachers we are, in effect, returning to our rich heritage. High teaching standards and high-quality teaching are the key to world-class educational outcomes.  There is vast potential for our small nation, which has a high standard in education worldwide, to be the icon of the world and to share its knowledge of teaching and learning with other young countries and benefit mutually from this partnership.  The potential of modern media and ICT for distance and blended learning makes this more possible now than ever before.<\/p> <p> With regard to science, technology, engineering and mathematics, the STEM subjects, substantial investment in teaching resources in our third level institutions enables us to compete for students worldwide in disciplines that are set to be the growth areas for employment in the future.  This is another area of opportunity.<\/p> <p> I congratulate Professor Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; Cath&aacute;in on his very forward-thinking board and staff at Athlone Institute of Technology.  I am sure the Minister knows him.  He has been in the vanguard of this thinking and development for many years and has built up substantial and important contacts across Asia, including in China and Japan.  I am sure that everywhere the Minister goes abroad, the professor is almost there before her.  He certainly has accompanied her.  One need only look at the sports arena in Athlone to recognise what he has done.  It can host European and world competitions.  For everybody concerned, that is good.  The Department of Education and Skills has played a role also.<\/p> <p> The aforementioned initiatives have opened up significant avenues of advancement and opportunity.  I am aware that in October 2014 the Minister concluded a successful trade mission to China in the company of senior staff from Enterprise Ireland and at least 12 of the higher education institutions.  I understand a high-level joint working group with representatives of the Department of Education and Skills and the Chinese ministry for education will meet this year in Dublin, and I understand that various memorandums of understanding between the institutions were signed.  Significant progress has been made, and we must acknowledge it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, went to India in November on a three-day trade mission aimed at attracting Indian students to study in Ireland and to enhance collaborative projects between Ireland and the Indian higher education institutes.  Fifteen of our higher education institutions, including all seven Irish universities, were involved.<\/p> <p> Today I understand the Minister signed up on behalf of the Irish Government as the first lead partner for the major US study abroad initiative.  We are ranked in the top 20 worldwide in terms of our higher education system, and we are all aware that significant financial challenges confront the sector, but we have worked extremely hard and diligently to achieve our status in respect of educational standards and achievements.  I note the Minister approved the participation of Education in Ireland in Generation Study Abroad, an initiative of the Institute of International Education which aims to double the number of US students studying abroad by 2020.  I am pleased to note that Education in Ireland, which is a division of Enterprise Ireland, represents all the universities and institutes of technology in addition to a number of private higher education institutes in this country.  The aim of Education in Ireland is to promote international study opportunities in Ireland&rsquo;s higher education institutions.  We are developing future global relationships as part of a major focus, and this will certainly elevate our profile and attractiveness as a place to come as part of exchange opportunities for students.<\/p> <p> I note that there is a proposed amendment to the student grant scheme that permits the scheme to apply definitively to PLCs and makes PLC courses eligible for grant aid under the higher education scheme.  This is a very progressive step.  Courses overseen by SOLAS, as the appropriate regulating authority, will now be able to secure grants.  That is important.<\/p> <p> Our links with the institutes of technology are important in terms of Irish companies and trade.  I would love to have an institute of technology in Mullingar because there is a large appropriate area in Marlinstown industrial park.  Notwithstanding the fact that it is only 20 miles from Athlone, the link is important.<\/p> <p> As I stated at the outset, tremendous progress has been made by the Minister and her predecessor on the provision of new schools, notwithstanding the circumstances that obtain.  A new school in Sonna is just about to be finished and a project in Curraghmore is about to start.  We should note other examples in Coosan and Killucan, where I believe the Minister is visiting in a few weeks, and also Col&aacute;iste Cionn Torc secondary school and Loreto Convent in Mullingar.  A host of schools are receiving replacement or additional classrooms, additional SNAs and resource teachers, and new primary teachers.<\/p><p>I hope that at the next budget the Minister might be able to start focusing on the pupil-teacher ratio.  That is extremely important in the context of giving opportunity to young people.  As they say in Gaelic, as translated, if one starts them young, they develop and go well.  If one starts at the education, first one must have a comfortable environment.  Those prefabs were grand.  They were only an interim solution, but they become a long-term solution and then they become dilapidated and decrepit.  It is difficult to go into them.  One needs a warm enticing environment, even to participate.  Likewise, one does not need an overcrowded class.  I accept the pupil-teacher ratio is a budgetary issue but it would be important that the Minister would get an opportunity of tackling that.<\/p> <p> As the chief proponent of the abolition of tuition fees in 1995, I played a big role in it.  I certainly was central to it and was probably key in persuading the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Dick Spring, and the then Minister for Education, Ms Niamh Bhreathnach, to abolish them.  I am proud to have done so, notwithstanding that I myself did not need them to be abolished because I was very much under the income limit.  What used to annoy me was that if an employee in Eircom or the ESB or a local authority worker did a bit of overtime, he or she lost everything.  Commentators criticised the abolition of tuition fees stating some from the well-off areas were benefiting as well, but one would get ground down in bureaucracy and paperwork in trying to cut those out.  That is why universality made it easier.  Commentators are giving out that the registration fees have gone up and are now &euro;3,000, but they are less than 30% of the cost of tuition.  In England, one borrows the &pound;10,000 and at the end of the course one has &pound;40,000 or &pound;50,000 to pay back.  I stand over what was done here.  The &euro;3,000 can be hard got but at the end of the day, it is an awful lot less than &euro;10,000 or &euro;12,000.  That is why the higher education sector and the universities are giving out hell.  The State, over recent years, has not been able to give them enough funding to make up for the fees they are not receiving.<\/p> <p> One should acknowledge that the abolition of fees is still important and we should be grateful for that decision.  The level of participation has increased, although perhaps not as sharply as we would like.  There is room for improvement.  Nevertheless, that was an important decision and I stand over it.  We should ensure that there are not any further increases in registration fees or anything else so as to allow the maximum number to get an opportunity to go to third level because that is now where it is at.  Whereas 15 years ago one would get by on second level education, one now needs tertiary education, such as a primary degree, throughout the system when it comes to filling vacancies.  I hope the Minister is not faced with any more increases in terms of registration fees in the forthcoming budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100038#MM00500","speaker":"1063","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423669200,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I thank the large number of Deputies who participated in the debate.  I thank the Opposition parties for their indication that they will support the Bill.  Amendments will be put forward, as indicated by Sinn F&eacute;in.  I welcome the general support for the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The title, the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014, meant a wide range of issues were raised that are probably outside the scope of the Bill but, as always with a debate on education, there are issues about which Deputies have a lot of knowledge and passion, and these all are important issues.  Deputy Penrose, in being the final speaker, widened the debate considerably, even talking about eradicating world poverty and the role of education in addressing inequality, not only in Ireland but in other parts of the world.<\/p>  <p>  I will address some of the issues raised.  A number of Deputies raised the importance of maintaining high standards.  This is very much part of the central issue in the Bill, namely, the criteria provided in it for using the term \"university\".  As Deputies have said, the criteria are robust.  It is a high standard that has to be reached.  Deputy O'Brien raised an issue that I want to clarify in that regard.  The provisions of the Bill only allow use of the term \"university\" outside of the State.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of having an international education strategy was raised by Deputy Cowen.  I want to clarify that the current strategy is from 2010 to 2015 and we will be working on a new strategy to cover the period 2016 to 2020 during second half of this year.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Deputies also raised the issue of sustainable of funding.  The last speaker, Deputy Penrose, strongly advocated for the retention of free fees for higher education in Ireland.  We all fought hard for that, and Deputy Penrose had a central role in that regard.  The previous Minister, Deputy Quinn, appointed an expert group in July 2014 to examine the future funding policy for higher education, and Mr. Peter Cassells is its chairperson.  Mr. Cassells will report to me by the end of the year.  We will be looking at the area of the sustainability of funding at higher education level.<\/p>  <p>  On further education, the issue of ensuring that students in post-leaving certificate courses can qualify for student grants is an important element.  Deputy Conaghan referred to that, as did other Deputies.  We are putting this specific measure in the Bill to ensure that, under the establishment of SOLAS, PLC students will be able to qualify.  I agree with what has been said about the importance of PLC colleges and the contribution they make.  Deputy Conaghan referred to Ballyfermot and its former students' success at the Oscars.  Deputy Moynihan referred to the success of Irish students and the winners this year of the young scientist exhibition.  On the world stage, Irish students who succeed in the young scientist exhibition do particularly well.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with a number of Deputies who referred to the importance of ensuring that students who come to Ireland from abroad have a good and positive experience.  Deputy Penrose referred to the court case that has slowed down the measures the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and I are introducing to ensure there is high-quality provision, particularly in the English language programmes.  We had originally intended to have those provisions in earlier but when the court case was taken, we had to delay the implementation.  Notwithstanding the decision of the High Court, the need for reform remains as strong as ever and it is important to demonstrate that the Government will not be diverted from its objective of ensuring that we protect students from being brought to Ireland for purposes other than education and that we protect the reputation of Ireland as a place where students can come to learn.  A revised draft strategy has been drawn up in terms of a response to the judgment together with a series of measures that will deliver on the reform agenda.  We intend that the revised arrangements, when finalised, will be brought to Government for approval.  The intention is that we will implement the original proposals to ensure that only the highest quality is acceptable and, therefore, that our reputation abroad is protected.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Deputies referred to internationalisation of higher education generally.  Deputy Finian McGrath gave us interesting figures.  He stated there was a big increase in the number of PhD students coming to Ireland as international students and he also referred to the STEM subjects, to which other Deputies referred as well.  We have, for example, a programme, called science without frontiers, which brings a lot of students in the STEM area to Ireland, and they go all round the country. They do not only go to the universities.  They go to the institutes of technology as well.<\/p>  <p>  I was going to mention briefly the issue of the technological universities, the south-east issue and the Cork IT-Tralee IT merger.<\/p><p>We dealt with the institutes of technology in Cork and Tralee in the course of the Topical Issues debate earlier.  Deputy Halligan raised the issue of Waterford Institute of Technology.  Deputies will be aware that I appointed Michael Kelly to lead the process of consultation with regional stakeholders, Government bodies, staff and students in both Waterford and Carlow.  I reiterate that consultation is important because Deputy Michael Moynihan and others referred to the importance of consulting staff and everyone involved.  There is an expert panel and clear pathways.  There is transparency, and that has been the case from the start, in terms of what is required to reach the various steps on the road to becoming a technological university.  Good communication is essential to the process.  The importance of engaging with the various stakeholders is a message that has been conveyed by the HEA and the Department.<\/p> <p> I will refer briefly to a few other areas raised by Deputies.  We will return to the specifics on Committee Stage.  Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien raised issues about Student Universal Support Ireland.  He intends to table amendments in that regard and we will get an opportunity then to discuss matters more fully.  I have dealt with the issues raised by Deputy Finian McGrath and Deputy John Halligan.  Deputy Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan raised issues relating to second level education.  We wish to encourage students at that level.  Many of the issues raised relate to partnership.  When I was in China, for example, memoranda of understanding were signed between institutions in Ireland and institutions in China.  The same happened when the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, went to India.  In some cases Irish students travel to those countries and arrangements are made whereby they spend a certain amount of time in both countries.  It is very much a case of partnership.  When I was in Shanghai, a number of post-primary school principals were present and there was a twinning between a school in Cork and one in Shanghai.  A lot is happening at that level as well.<\/p> <p> A number of other Deputies referred to regions, including Deputy Penrose, who referred to Athlone Institute of Technology.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne spoke about the north west and Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick spoke about the north east.  While the main focus has been on the areas where technological university status is being sought, it is important to stress the role of institutes of technology and other higher education institutions in the regions.  Ballyfermot College of Further Education is another example of that, albeit at post-leaving certificate level.<\/p> <p> We will tease out some of the specifics on the issues raised when we get to Committee Stage.  Overall, we have had a good broad debate on a number of educational issues.  I thank all of the Deputies for their support.  Each of the three measures in the Bill is important in its own area.  The measures will improve the situation in terms of international education with the opportunity to use the term &ldquo;university&rdquo;, in terms of clarifying access to grants for PLC students and, a measure that has received almost full support, namely, the fact that the information that is made available under freedom of information does not facilitate league tables.  There is a general view that, overall, while some people might want it, the use of league tables has a detrimental effect overall in terms of the provision of education, in particular in terms of ensuring equality of access and that we do not in any way undermine the education system.  I thank Members and commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100040#OO00200","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423669800,"counter":578,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 [Seanad]: Referral to Select Committee","time":1423669800,"counter":579,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100041#PP00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1423669800,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Sub-committee on Education and Skills pursuant to Standing Orders 82A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and (6)(<i>a<\/i>) and 126(1) of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100041#PP00400","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423669800,"counter":581,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage","time":1423670100,"counter":582,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100042#QQ00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1423670100,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Second Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100042#QQ00200","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423670100,"counter":584,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015: Second Stage","time":1423670100,"counter":585,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100042#QQ00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1423670100,"counter":586,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>  Climate change is rightly gaining increasing recognition as one of the greatest challenges to face humankind.  Its effects respect no national boundaries.  The consequences are felt globally and can only be addressed on an international scale.  Ireland has been and remains a highly active participant in the processes at both EU and UN level.  This creates its own challenges for Ireland, not least with respect to tackling the need to radically reshape our economy over the next generation and beyond.  For that reason, Ireland, as part of the European Union, has been playing its part under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, in addressing greenhouse gas emissions for which it is responsible.  In this regard, the EU's so-called effort sharing decision of 2009 sets down national mitigation targets for the period 2013 to 2020, inclusive.  These national targets mirror, by design, what is required under the UNFCCC in the second Kyoto commitment period.<\/p>  <p>  Setting mitigation targets is one thing but achieving them is a very different thing, as all Members are aware.  This is all the more important as both the EU agenda and the international agenda is to reduce incrementally greenhouse gas emissions so that developed economies become substantively decarbonised by the year 2050.  In other words, Ireland cannot simply concern itself with the short to medium term but must look decades ahead to where and how to decarbonise on a national scale.  Decarbonising the economy will unquestionably create challenges but it will also bring about significant opportunities that many in the Irish business community are already embracing.<\/p>  <p>  To this end, in April 2014, the Government approved a national climate policy position setting out a long-term vision of low-carbon transition based on an aggregate reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of at least 80%, compared to 1990 levels, by 2050, across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors; in parallel, an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.<\/p>  <p>  This long-term vision is an ambitious one, demanding real and meaningful change in how we as a society live, work and travel.  Achieving both our immediate mitigation targets up to 2020 and those that will be set on an incremental basis up to 2030, 2040 and 2050 will not be an easy task.  It will require a whole-of-government response and hence the need to have a robust institutional framework in place.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015 provides for this.  I wish to be clear that this Bill is not designed to set out specific policy measures.  We need a dynamic approach to the policy measures that is prepared to react to technological developments across various sectors.  We need all sectors to contribute in the context of decarbonisation whether that be as technology takers or indeed as providing innovation of their own.  This Bill is designed to ensure that the State demands a relentless focus from each sector but without setting limits on what can be achieved.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is about instituting an open, accountable, transparent process that requires the whole of government to engage in a specific and planned mitigation process; to lay plans before this House; to justify in a public forum the actions or inaction of those contributing to the process; and to motivate all sectors of the State to further the decarbonisation agenda.  In other words, the Bill is designed to provide the institutional arrangements required to enable the reshaping of the economy towards low-carbon development over the next 40 years and beyond.  I note that some of those who criticised the Bill did not make this much progress during their time in Government.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to highlight to the House that when this Bill is enacted, Ireland, the country we all serve, will be one of only a handful of member states within the EU with specific national climate change legislation on their statute books.  Therein lies the ambition and commitment to drive forward with national plans which encompass low-emission strategies and climate-resilient economic growth.  In this regard, the Bill is among the most significant this Government will introduce during its term.<\/p>  <p>  It has been suggested that we should enshrine in the Bill a long-term mitigation target for 2050, akin to the long-term vision outlined in the national climate policy position.  Although I appreciate that it might be tempting to co-opt this vision for use in legislation, I believe that this would be the wrong course of action.  In the first instance, that long-term vision, if it were inscribed in legislation, might interfere with the EU's target-setting process.  Second, we could run the risk of setting a numerical mitigation target in legislation which may render the State subject to legal action thereafter.  We operate within a legislative European framework and we are subject to effort-sharing decisions in terms of how mitigation targets are set and agreed.  Were we to institute our own targets that were less demanding than those set at EU level, then the latter would take precedence and our legislative targets would be rendered redundant.  Alternatively, were our mitigation targets more demanding than those determined at EU level, we would run the risk of putting Ireland at a competitive disadvantage compared to our EU partners which would not be a desirable outcome.<\/p>  <p>  Setting our own targets, even on a long-term basis, would not only interfere with the European process, but it cause the State to be subject to legal action.  I ask if we would want the State to be focused on legal proceedings or whether our resources would be more usefully employed in assessing new technologies, new efficient energy production mechanisms, sustainable planning and transport policy, or information technology aimed at decarbonising production processes.  I think it would be the latter option.  The European targets in place for 2020 which are legally binding will prove extremely challenging to achieve and will represent the primary focus of our efforts in developing our first national mitigation plan.  Adding further targets to this scenario will only complicate the process further and divert focus from where it is needed.  In my view, targets can only be realised by putting in place appropriate and proportionate mitigation policy measures across the sectors with the most significant emissions.  There is no shortcut.  That is why the Bill focuses so much on institutional arrangements for ensuring that such sectoral mitigation measures can be developed, approved and most important, implemented.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no internationally agreed definition of a low-carbon economy, with many terms used in different circumstances, such as the green economy, green-collar jobs, the environmental economy and eco-industry.  I could add many more to that list.<\/p><p>While I fully subscribe to the principal of low carbon, not least because it reduces energy costs, I see a significant risk in trying to define it in Irish legislation, particularly where there would be potential to restrict the breadth of activities that could conceivably contribute to lowering carbon dioxide emissions.  As mentioned earlier, with fast-moving innovations and new markets emerging for goods and services, any definition of what is regarded as low carbon could well be outdated very quickly, so it is not appropriate to lock into primary legislation such a dynamic definition.  This in no way limits our commitment to delivering a<i><\/i>low-carbon economy in time.  On the contrary, keeping a definition of &quot;low carbon&quot; outside of legislation should expand our scope over time in terms of achieving delivery.<br\/><br\/>There has been much commentary on the timeframes in the Bill, namely that the national mitigation plan must be prepared and submitted to the Government for approval by me as Minister within 24 months of the passing of the Act.  In the first instance, I stress that this timeframe represents a maximum - which has not been much observed - and that every effort will be made to have the national mitigation plan in place earlier.  However, we also need to take heed of where consultation is appropriate and, as covered by section 2 of the Bill, where the State needs to show commitment to existing obligations under EU law, such as those relating to the strategic environmental directive and the habitats directive.  Failure to adhere to these European legislative requirements would not only leave the plans open to legal challenge but would also reduce the effectiveness of the plans themselves in terms of how the respective assessment processes can potentially contribute in a positive manner to the overall development of the plans.  I would like to think we could all be in agreement in terms of allowing due process in these matters and giving appropriate consideration to relevant matters when and where required.  It is imperative that we allow sufficient contingency in respect of having the time available to do the right thing, as opposed to the rushed thing.<br\/><br\/>I also welcome the debate on the expert advisory council and its role as provided for in the Bill.  As the Members present are aware, the expert advisory council shall consist of a chairperson and between eight and ten ordinary members, four of whom shall be <i>ex officio <\/i>members, namely, the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Teagasc and the Economic and Social Research Institute.  Within this structure, it is important to note that the majority of the members who will sit on this council are independent of Government Departments and agencies, which will provide the necessary balance to underpin the independent nature of the advice to be provided in furthering the transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by the year 2050.<br\/><br\/>I believe the composition of the expert advisory council will strike the right balance, which is needed, between academic rigour and practical implementation, by providing a service which helps us navigate a course towards our mitigation targets, which are ambitious, and rightly so, yet achievable.  Let me be very clear on this: I regard the independence of the experts on the group as being key to the overall process.  We will achieve the best results by combining the efforts of these key experts with the State's environmentally focused agencies, which are already in and of themselves highly committed to the principles of a low-carbon economy.<br\/><br\/>In terms of climate justice, it is important that we recognise our collective historical responsibility in relation to climate change and, in particular, that we recognise and address the fact that those least responsible for climate change often experience its greatest impacts.  Few, if any, of us would doubt the validity of the concept, but we must also ask ourselves how best we should go about supporting those in developing countries when it comes to climate change.  In my view, climate justice is a matter that should be dealt with by policy as opposed to trying to define it in legislation.<br\/><br\/>The single most important contribution any developed country can make to climate justice is to honour its greenhouse gas mitigation commitments.  This is what the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill is all about - putting in place an institutional framework to ensure that robust mitigation policy measures are developed in a timely fashion.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, as I have previously mentioned, it is important to note that despite extraordinarily difficult fiscal circumstances, Ireland has maintained significant support, including public finance, for climate action on adaptation in developing countries, and is committed, through ongoing discussions at senior official level, to finding sustainable ways to continue this support where need is greatest.<br\/><br\/>The Bill sets out the national objective of transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy in the period up to and including the year 2050.  In doing so, it gives a solid statutory foundation to the institutional arrangements necessary to enable the State to pursue and achieve that national transition objective.  In this regard, the Bill addresses both the mitigation and adaptation responses to climate change.  That is, it deals with reducing national greenhouse gas emissions as well as adapting to the inevitable effects of climate change in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Because both mitigation and adaptation require new policy measures across the whole of Government, the Bill provides that relevant Ministers of the Government will be required to contribute, on a sectoral basis, to the national mitigation plans and the sectoral adaptation plans which fall out of the national adaptation framework.  This is an important institutional requirement, as climate change encompasses such a wide range of areas, including agriculture, transport, energy, the built environment, forestry and flood defence.<br\/><br\/>The Bill before us today contains 16 sections.  To use the time allocated to me in an effective manner, I will focus on the key provisions.  Section 3 provides for the preparation and submission to the Government by me as Minister of a national mitigation plan and a national adaptation framework for the purpose of pursuing and achieving the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by the end of 2050, in what is known in the Bill as the &quot;national transition objective&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Section 4, one of the most important sections of the Bill, provides for the preparation and approval of iterative five-year national mitigation plans which shall specify the policy measures to achieve the national transition objective and, in particular, the greenhouse gas mitigation policy measures to be adopted by selected Ministers of the Government.  The first such national mitigation plan must be prepared and submitted to the Government for approval by me as Minister within 24 months of the passing of the Act.  Prior to the making of a national mitigation plan, a public consultation exercise must be undertaken and we must have regard to any submissions made pursuant to such an exercise.  A national mitigation plan must be laid before the D&aacute;il after it has been approved by the Government.<br\/><br\/>Section 5 provides for the making and submission to the Government of iterative national adaptation frameworks, which shall specify the national strategy for the application of adaptation measures in various sectors and by local authorities in order to reduce the vulnerability of the State to the negative effects of climate change and to avail of any positive effects that may occur.  The first such framework must be prepared and submitted to the Government by me as Minister within a maximum of 24 months of the passing of the Act.  As with the national mitigation plans, prior to the making of a national adaptation framework, a public consultation exercise must be undertaken.  The national adaptation framework must also be laid before the D&aacute;il after it has been approved by the Government.<br\/><br\/>Section 6 concerns itself with sectoral adaptation plans.  Arising from a national adaptation framework, which specifies the national strategy for the application of adaptation measures in various sectors, relevant Ministers of the Government shall be required by the Government to prepare and submit to the Government within a specified period a sectoral adaptation plan.  Each such plan shall specify the adaptation policy measures to enable adaptation to the effects of climate change to be achieved by that sector and to enable the achievement of the national transition objective.<br\/><br\/>Section 7 is concerned with matters that must be taken into account, including consultation, for the purpose of making a national adaptation framework and sectoral adaptation plans, including the promotion of sustainable development and not imposing an unreasonable burden on the Exchequer.  Relevant scientific and technical advice must also be considered, while consultation with the national expert advisory council on climate change on the performance of its functions is also covered.<br\/><br\/>Section 8 mandates the establishment of a national expert advisory council on climate change to provide independent advice to Ministers and the Government in respect of climate change matters, while section 9 outlines how the members of the council will be appointed, including the range of qualifications, expertise and experience necessary for the proper and effective performance of the functions of the expert advisory council.  It is essential that the most appropriate range of skills be brought to the table to address the key areas concerned, whether from an environmental, a social or an economic perspective.  The chairperson and ordinary members of the expert advisory council, other than, of course, the <i>ex officio <\/i>members, shall be appointed by the Government on my nomination.  As stated earlier, the independence of the expert group is a key priority for me.<br\/><br\/>In terms of practical arrangements, the Environmental Protection Agency is charged with providing the expert advisory council with appropriate secretarial and administrative services, as well as permitting it to use its premises for the purpose of the performance of its functions.  At a time of straightened fiscal circumstances, this will greatly reduce the operating costs of the expert advisory council.<\/p><p> Section 11 sets down, in general terms, the functions of the expert advisory council.  These functions include advising and making recommendations to Ministers and the Government in respect of a national mitigation plan, a national adaptation framework, sectoral adaptation plans and any policy relating to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation to the effects of climate change in the State.  For the purposes of performing its functions, the expert advisory council may gather such information and meet and consult with such persons as it alone considers appropriate.  In addition to its general advice-giving functions, section 12 sets down that the expert advisory council shall conduct an annual review of progress in achieving greenhouse gas emissions reductions and in furthering the national transition objective.  Pursuant to such an annual review, the council is then required to prepare an annual report and publish it directly not more than 30 days after submitting it to myself as Minister.<\/p> <p> Section 13 provides that, in addition to an annual report, the expert advisory council may conduct a periodic review of mitigation and adaptation measures in the State and publish directly the corresponding periodic review report not less than 60 and not more than 90 days after submitting it to myself as Minister.  <\/p> <p> As a meaningful and comprehensive exercise in transparency and accountability, section 14 mandates that an annual transition statement shall be presented to the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100042#QQ00500","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423671300,"counter":589,"content":"<p>Can I get the agreement of the Members that the Minister may have more time to conclude?

My vision of Ireland is for a competitive, socially focused economy built on sustainability.  This Bill will put in place the framework from a climate change perspective to ensure that Ireland is well placed to deliver on that vision.  Furthermore, it is important to note that, via the establishment of an annual transition statement to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, relevant Ministers will be made accountable for the mitigation and adaptation policy measures for which they are responsible, and their implementation.  This is an important reporting mechanism to ensure that our necessary mitigation and adaptation measures remain on course.<\/p>  <p>  Before I conclude, I would like to take this opportunity to again acknowledge the substantial work done by the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht on the outline heads of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill and to note with particular appreciation the work of every member of the joint committee, which was chaired by my colleague Deputy Michael McCarthy.  The input from the committee, by way of the joint committee's report, was another important milestone in shaping the debate on this legislation, and it helped inform, in a genuine and meaningful fashion, the further development of the heads of the Bill.  It is obvious that the report was given genuine and detailed consideration, with several of the joint committee's proposals being accepted in full and unequivocally.  I am satisfied that it has promoted a better and more inclusive Bill than would otherwise be the case.  I genuinely thank the committee for its work on that.<\/p>  <p>  The cause of, and the case for action in response to, climate change is now unanswerable.  We must deal with it.  Despite this, no specific climate change legislation has yet been enacted in this country.  This Government made a commitment to bring in such legislation during its term in office and we are now fulfilling that commitment.  Previous Administrations made similar commitments but they were not honoured.  This is a substantial and comprehensive Bill that will change the way in which we deal with the very real issue of climate change.  I ask the House to support its implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100044#SS00300","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1423671300,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I understand Deputy Cowen has 20 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100044#SS00400","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1423671300,"counter":592,"content":"<p>Yes, give or take.  The Minister just said that the Government made a commitment to bring in legislation to address climate change - to introduce the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill.  We would have hoped that any such proposals and anything contained within such a Bill would address the issues in their entirety and get it completely right - that it would not get it half right by addressing only some of the issues, but would live up to the expectation and the commitment that was given.  I must disagree with the Minister when he said that this Government is living up to its expectations and commitments.  It is not even living up to what is set out in his party's Bill of 2009 in this area.<\/p>  <p>  We will oppose this Bill if there are not substantial amendments to it - amendments that will be proposed by myself and others in the course of its passage through the House.  Unless the Minister makes serious amendments to the Bill, I cannot see the House in its entirety supporting it.  This long-delayed Bill marks a serious retreat from the 2010 legislation published by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government.  Instead of clear targets, it has vague aspirations.  Climate change is a serious threat to this island nation across a broad remit of areas from agriculture to infrastructure, including the threat of massive coastal erosion.  The Bill does not confront the scale of that threat.  It is time the Government got serious about climate change and started to take action to protect Ireland's long-term interests and global responsibilities.  I am mindful of a comment that was made to me when I met various bodies and an amalgam of activists seeking to lobby us and make us fully aware of everything pertaining to climate change in order that the House and its Members would be able to make an informed decision upon the culmination of the process.  It was a short meeting which I had only yesterday.  The comment was that members of the generation following mine are in no doubt of what needs to be done and what must be done, and are fully aware of the impact of climate change, but this generation of which we are a part - this generation of parliamentarians in the Oireachtas - may be the last one that has a chance to do anything about it.  That is why this debate will have to mean something.  That is why Second Stage of this Bill will have to be taken seriously.  That is why I ask that the Minister take on board some of the recommendations that are emanating from this group and seriously consider the amendments that will be proposed during the passage of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I will turn to the key points contained in the Bill.  It continues to lack real teeth and has no clear targets.  The input from the exhaustive hearings of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Community and Local Government and its subsequent consensus recommendations have effectively been ignored by the Government, contrary to what the Minister has said.  The Bill is a regressive move that steps back from the ambitious framework of targets up to 2050 contained in previous legislation such as the 2010 Bill, the all-party 2010 Bill and the Labour Party Bill.  It delays action on climate change for a further two years, as the Government is kicking the can down the road on this issue.  The Minister is following hard on his predecessor's footsteps in his failure to include a strategic target for 2050, and that exposes the failure to rise to the pressing challenge of climate change.  To remove responsibility for the targets and instead leave it to the EU is an abrogation of duty.  For the Labour Party, it is another broken promise, as it has failed to legislate for the goals that it included in its legislation in 2009 and instead has settled for a flawed, emasculated piece of legislation.  Environmental groups have roundly criticised the heads of the Bill for the lack of vision contained therein.  It in no way sets out a meaningful strategic framework to address climate change.  It does not, for example, include the Government's own definition of low carbon, it does not guarantee the independence of the climate advisory council and it does not make provision for the principle of climate justice.<\/p>  <p>  I will turn to the main points of the Bill.<\/p><p>The failure to include specific 2050 targets will give rise to sectoral interests potentially hijacking the process and depriving the Bill of its long-term impact in shaping policy formation.  In other words, as a result, the Bill is effectively toothless.  <\/p> <p> An expert advisory council is a welcome idea, but it must be given real resources and clear powers if it is to have any real impact on climate change policy.  The council proposed in this Bill lacks any real independence.  The Oireachtas must debate the advice and reports of the council and, unlike in the current Bill, the Government must consult the body when developing a carbon strategy.  As I have said on two or three occasions, the Government has delayed the adoption of a national mitigation plan with sectoral policy measures by at least two years. <\/p> <p> Ireland's last emissions reduction plan expired at the end of 2012, just before our challenging 2020 EU targets came into force.  The Government then promised a new plan by early 2014.  In April 2014, the then Minister Phil Hogan's draft Bill mandated there be an action plan within 12 months of the climate law coming into force.  Now, the Minister's Bill gives the Government two years from enactment to come up with actual measures to reduce emissions.  That is a cop-out.  <\/p> <p> The annual transition report is a welcome measure that should be fully debated in the Oireachtas as part of holding the Government to account over its climate change strategy.  A rigorous accountability system needs to be put in place to ensure that public bodies are drivers of reform on climate change and play a leading role in innovating and implementing the Government's strategy.  Specific public body climate change reports should be developed.  This has to be driven at local government level also.<\/p> <p> The principle of climate justice has been entirely ignored by this Bill.  The Government has voiced support for the principle of climate justice at the UN and even co-hosted a conference on the issue with Mary Robinson as part of Ireland's EU Presidency.  Can that now be perceived by one and all as simply lip-service?<\/p> <p> As regards our position, we are committed to an ambitious environmental programme which includes tackling climate change.  We published the Climate Change Response Bill 2010 on 23 December 2010, which passed First Stage in the Seanad before the D&aacute;il was dissolved despite the fact that the Minister seems to indicate that no effort whatsoever was made by the previous Government before its abrupt and unfortunate end.  The Bill set out Fianna F&aacute;il's commitment to legislating for a process that allows us to plan for greenhouse emissions reduction and adaptation to climate change, as the Bill makes clear.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes this must be done in a way that safeguards economic development and competitiveness.  Ireland should be consistent with EU targets and we have consistently supported the international process under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. <\/p> <p> A major change in our approach to climate change policy is a new national priority on carbon transition.  While they are important indicators of progress, we must also have a longer term and wider vision for creating a prosperous, sustainable country.  The Climate Change Bill should enable us to pursue a smart economy which is highly productive, competitive and resource-efficient, while environmentally sustainable.  We support the broad thrust of the findings and recommendations of the NESC report.  The five guiding principles for climate action should underpin Ireland's strategy to become a carbon-neutral society.  These are economic prosperity, recovery and social development; incremental and permanent decarbonisation; responsibility, integrity and leadership; reform of public institutions and governance; and social engagement.  <\/p> <p> As the Minister knows, every country has to play its part.  The Minister has delayed on this issue and has now produced a toothless Bill which can do little to deal with the central issues involved.  I again ask him to take more cognisance of the exhaustive input from the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the recommendations which emanated from it and what was contained in its report.  Having failed to do so in the production of this Bill, I again ask the Minister to take on board many of the recommendations and amendments which will be tabled as it passes through the House.  Perhaps then, as I said, there may be more wide-ranging support for a Bill which will have teeth, can effect change and we can stand over as having played our part in addressing the unfortunate dilemma and the unfortunate crossroads at which we find ourselves.  As I said, a generation is coming fast on our heels which is well aware of the necessity of those in positions of power to effect change.<\/p> <p> We might be the last ones who can play a role in living up to their expectations. Climate change is having an effect the world over, not just here, which is something we regularly see and will see more of every year.  It is having a detrimental effect on society and the environment.  I ask the Minister to take on board the suggestions which will be made during this debate and, more importantly, to take seriously the amendments which will be proposed by the Opposition.  It would be a great legacy for the Minister, who craves a legacy, to be able to say at the end of the debate that there was universal support across the House from all Members in his efforts to effect real climate action and produce a low carbon development Bill which would have widespread support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100044#SS00500","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423671900,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Colreavy, with 25 minutes and five minutes respectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100045#TT00200","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1423671900,"counter":595,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Over the past couple of years I have asked this Minister and the previous one when we would see the Bill.  It is good that we now have it.  The issue of climate change is the biggest challenge facing our generation and we have a responsibility to those coming behind us, our children, grandchildren and the developed world, to take action.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, Ireland's five-year action plan on climate change expired in 2012 and we are now in the year of our Lord 2015.  The legislation is weak, flakey and very much Fine Gael and Phil Hogan's Bill.  It is a disappointment.  It is not impractical to suggest that this State will address the fact that Ireland has one of the highest levels of greenhouse gas emissions per person in the European Union.  According to the EPA, the State will not meet its EU 2020 target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20%.  <\/p>  <p>  There is no definition of low carbon economy in the Bill.  I heard the Minister's point, but that should not stop us having a definition of what we want as a community and society.  It is disappointing that is not in the Bill, which is vague in terms of sectoral allocations and targets.  We are dealing with five year as opposed to seven year plans, which was in the original proposal.  I welcome the change the Government has made, but the five year plans need to be debated and adopted by the D&aacute;il.  It is not just the Government which has to implement these measures; this is a matter for society.  All political parties and citizens have to be on board with this project.  <\/p>  <p>  The expert advisory panel needs to be independent of Government.  What the Government has proposed does not constitute a completely independent panel.  The Minister said we can deal with climate justice in policy.  We need to compel this and future Governments to deal with the issue in the Bill.  The legislation falls short of what is required.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is not adequate in terms of following on from the action plan on climate change which ended in 2012.  It had specific targets based on the Kyoto Protocol.  There is no excuse, particularly in light of the fact that the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, with which I and other Members are involved, had all-party support when setting out its proposals in a report in 2013.<\/p><p>I hope that when the Bill goes to Committee Stage we can work on it in the same spirit in which we worked on the report.  The previous Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, former Deputy Phil Hogan, gave the impression that the report would be considered favourably.  Of course, there was the usual public consultation, which led to over 600 submissions, most of which recommended the setting of definite targets to be legislated for.  This was ignored.<\/p> <p> It is worthwhile comparing the committee report with the Bill in order to highlight the deficiencies.  The main fault is that it does not include set targets.  The report indicated that Ireland's existing annual emission limits, as agreed in March 2013 under the European Union effort sharing decision or any further modification of these, should be written into the Bill as a target for the 2013 to 2020 period.  I brought a Bill to the D&aacute;il and during discussions on that and other issues, I mentioned the need to avoid carbon cliffs.  We have a carbon cliff in front of us now, and it would be worse if we had not had a recession.  We are gradually ramping up emissions and, based on economic growth and other factors, we will not meet the targets, so we will have to deal with that carbon cliff.<\/p> <p> The report from the committee also recommended that the annual emission limits for the ten-year period from 2020 and up to 2050 should be the same as those agreed by member states under the European Union's Roadmap 2050, with this embodied within the legislation.  There has been some debate about the likely implications that the climate change strategy will have on the agricultural sector, and rightly so.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, has referred to the need to take account of the particular importance of the food sector.  The committee report recognises the strategic national importance of the agricultural sector and must also recognise that climate change has an adverse effect on the community and on farming incomes.<\/p> <p> The Teagasc report on the 2012 fodder crisis outlined additional feed costs of &euro;390 million, with output losses at &euro;64 million, meaning the crisis cost the agricultural sector more than &euro;450 million.  Some people have the mistaken belief that we can ignore climate change and we do not have to deal with it, although there may be an impact on agriculture.  The Teagasc report confirms that.  While trying to maintain output, we must ensure we can take measures to mitigate against the consequences.  A future of fodder crises and flooded corn fields is not right either.  All sections of society must buy into this process.  In light of the committee's report, it should be noted that other sectors are possibly best placed to make the radical reductions in emissions from current levels, although agriculture must play its part in the overall strategy to reduce the country's emissions.  The report therefore recommended that future agricultural emissions up to 2050 should be made on the basis of zero emissions growth relative to 2013 levels.  Unfortunately, the Bill avoids such commitments.<\/p> <p> The committee report refers to the concept of climate justice.  We must recognise that there is not a level playing field.  Tr&oacute;caire and others have stressed the inequalities that exist on a global scale and the fact that people in developing countries suffer greatly from the impact of dramatic climate change.  A women from the Philippines was here yesterday.  It is a country made up of islands and we have seen television images of what those people have suffered as a result of climate change.  One could not be left unmoved by what is happening to people in the Pacific Ocean, particularly those who live on small islands.  We have an obligation to those people, as we are producing far more greenhouse gases per head of population than they are.  Over recent decades we have seen the consequences of drought and disaster caused by extreme events in the Philippines and other countries.  The impact of such events is greatly exacerbated by the fact that these underdeveloped countries do not have the infrastructure to cope with such disasters.  Poorer-quality housing and physical infrastructure means that the consequences of hurricanes and typhoons, for example, are far greater than they are in developed countries.  The emergency and relief services are not as well able to cope with those consequences and the impact on local people.<\/p> <p> There are contradictions with regard to the climate change issue in developing countries.  Some feel that the onus of addressing climate change and implementing measures to reduce emissions should fall mainly on developed economies.  Countries such as China and India have claimed that the industrialised West has enjoyed the fruits of fossil-fuel-based development and is now attempting to impose restrictions on developing countries that are trying to catch up.  There is some merit in that argument, and recognition has been given to this with respect to the different targets for different global regions in international agreements.  However, we all share the same Earth and it is impossible to ring-fence any part of the planet, or a country, where continued high emission levels could be allowed.  I hope that not only will this continue to form the basis of international agreements but that we will also make more rapid progress towards replacing fossil fuels with renewable resources.<\/p> <p> Developing countries have bought into that agenda, not only for environmental reasons but also, in many cases, to reduce their economic dependence on fossil fuels.  This country is overly dependent on imported fossil fuels and it is disappointing that we have not been more proactive in forming a strategy to deal with climate change.  The Bill fails to do this.  It also fails to form a more cohesive energy strategy.  Instead of seriously examining the advantages we have in terms of renewable energy, we seem to be content to allow the agenda be driven by external economic interests.  That was certainly the case with the now almost abandoned proposals to cover the midlands with wind farms in order to export electricity to Britain.  Instead, we should be planning for a radical reduction in fossil fuels, and we should be at the forefront in generating energy from other sources.  Wind could play a part in this.<\/p> <p> One of the weaknesses in the Bill is that local authorities and development are not included, which is odd.  The local authority of a county such as Laois should be given a significant role with regard to a mitigation plan.  Within those mitigation plans, there should be a large role for local governance.  Laois is a good example because of the proposed haphazard wind farm developments.  The most recent casualty is Cullenagh mountain, which is now to be designated as a site for giant turbines, and the implications have not been thought through properly.  We all want to develop the green economy and alternative sources of energy, but this Government seems to have put all its eggs in the wind farm basket.  We have seen the effects in Counties Laois and Offaly.  The potential of other sources, such as biomass, has not been given the same priority, despite the fact there is much potential in the midlands to grow willow.  Forestry waste and other products are also available.<\/p> <p> There is also an abundance of hydroelectric power.<\/p><p>I know hydropower will never produce the amount of electricity that is required to meet our current usage, but no single source will do that.  Many sources will be required.  Rivers such as the Barrow, Nore, Erkina and White Horse have mill sites on them.  What investigation or study has been carried out on those sites from Portarlington to the south of the county and from Castletown across to the edge of Carlow town, the county boundary of Laois and Carlow, to establish the potential for producing some of our energy from hydropower?  Indeed, are we doing enough with regard to geothermal energy?  We are talking about solving the problems of the world here and we are trying to live up to our national obligations, but this must be done locally as well.  We must take another look at the proposals and how we have gone about meeting our alternative energy needs.  Instead of what we have been doing, we should be planning for a radical reduction in the use of imported fossil fuels and, in particular, we should be at the forefront of developing energy, particularly electricity, from other sources.<\/p> <p> As part of addressing the global nature of the impact of climate change, the environment committee recommended that climate change legislation should provide for the establishment of a national green climate fund, separate from the environment fund.  This would be used to support climate mitigation and adaptation in developing countries and would constitute Ireland's contribution to an international green climate fund established under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  It would receive funding from carbon taxes, emissions trading profits and other environmental taxes.  It would not receive funds from the existing overseas aid budget.  Unfortunately, it is another of the report's recommendations that was ignored in drafting the Bill.  Seven of the ten recommendations were ignored.<\/p> <p> The most serious defect in this Bill is that while the report recommended that legislation should contain mitigation plans to address the emissions, the Bill only provides for the drawing up of such plans.  That is not the role of legislation.  Legislation is about setting the statutory parameters for State action rather than acting as another discussion document or paper or to establish a discussion forum, as this Bill appears to do.  The time for discussion is over.  We have had a national strategy and we have had debates.  A substantial body of work about what is needed has been drawn up and agreed across party lines through the environment committee.  Instead we have a Bill that appears to be ticking boxes, perhaps to appear as if we are dealing with this issue.  In fact, we are only creating new and vague substitutes for planning and implementing the measures that are required to address a global problem in our national context.<\/p> <p> The vagueness applies to the entire Bill.  Normally when a Bill dealing with such a serious issue is brought before the House, it is possible to identify specific sections and proposals that can be debated in respect of their implications.  If people disagree with them, they can suggest and table amendments.  In this legislation, however, there is very little substance.  For example, section 4 refers to the Minister submitting a national low-carbon transition mitigation plan to the Government.  The purpose of the plan is described as setting out measures that are needed to achieve \"the national transition objectives\".  Why does the Bill not cut through all of that?  We have waited a long time for the legislation, so why in all that time was it not possible to draft a Bill that would embody the objectives and targets, without having to go through this additional delay?  According to section 4, the first plan does not have to be presented to the Government until 2017.  We have already lost three years because we have freewheeled for the past three years.  Assuming the Bill is enacted, the plan will go through a period of assessment and amendment before being approved by the Government of the day.<\/p> <p> Section 5 refers to a further national climate change adaptation framework to be presented by the Minister of the day, again within the same time period.  Presumably, the adaptation plan will form the parameters of the sectoral adaptation plans which will be submitted from each Department that has relevance to the areas concerned with reducing emissions.  Prior to framing and presenting such plans there will be consultation with people within each of the sectors, followed by public consultation.  After all of that, the Government may amend or modify the sectoral plans before proceeding.<\/p> <p> I do not wish to be cynical but we appear to be facing a long, drawn-out process, with no definite targets set and flaky timeframes and parameters for what will emerge.  It is not necessary to reinvent the wheel here.  We know what must be done from our work in the committee, the committee's reports, the presentations made to the committee, what has happened at EU and the wider international levels and from public opinion.  It is not a mystery.  The targets are in place and they should be part of the legislation.  What we have been presented with instead is an expanded heads of a Bill which puts everything on the very long finger and commits this State to do little.  There will possibly be penguins washed up in Dollymount before we have this process completed.<\/p> <p> The Minister has followed his predecessor's attitude to climate change and that is represented in the Bill before us.  The big disappointment for Sinn F&eacute;in is the fact that there is no definition of a low-carbon economy and that the Bill is vague on sectoral allocations and targets.  We welcome that there will be five year plans, but these must be debated and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  As I said earlier, we must get everybody on board on this issue.  This is not only a matter for the Government.  It must bring the Opposition and society with it on this issue, as well as industry, agriculture, construction, transport and local authorities.  The Minister is responsible for local authorities, and there will be no success without the local authorities being central to the implementation of any plans to create a low carbon society.  It cannot be done without them.  They must be given that role.  Their role has been rolled back in recent years and they have lost several areas of responsibility.  It is time to involve them centrally in this issue.<\/p> <p> The expert advisory council must be fully independent of the Government.  I also appeal to the Minister to consider the issue of climate justice.  We put money into boxes at times for the Third World and we give donations to Tr&oacute;caire - I almost said the troika - or Concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100045#TT00400","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423673100,"counter":599,"content":"<p>We give them to the troika too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100047#VV00200","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1423673100,"counter":600,"content":"<p>We have given enough donations to that.

It must be amended and changed.  I welcome the three key areas the Minister changed, on the advice of the committee, from what was in the original heads of the Bill that came from the previous Minister.

It means &quot;First, do no harm&quot;.<\/p><p>It could be applied to climate change as well as to health.  When examining this Bill, we must recognise its potential for achieving the ambitions for a future world with much reduced carbon emissions.  The key question is whether future generations on this island and throughout the world will be able to say that we, in this generation, have done all that we can to ensure we pass on a safe, clean, fruitful island and planet.  The alternative is too bleak to permit.<\/p> <p> Most of my submission is presented in terms of my brief, namely, communications, energy and natural resources, although not so much communications.  Retrofitting of homes is an obvious means of not only reducing our dependence on energy sources but also tackling fuel poverty.  Sinn F&eacute;in, in our 2014 pre-budget submission, put forward a proposal to establish a green bank in order that the State, along with the pensions industry, would invest in the retrofitting of homes.  This would see a marked increase in the number of retrofitted homes.  It would also generate stable returns, which would be higher than Government bonds, for the pensions industry and would support real and sustainable job creation throughout the country.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in is fully committed to the development of renewable energy in Ireland.  The State is heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels to meet its energy demands.  The Government has acted and is acting to develop a progressive renewable energy policy which not only complies with EU targets but which also ensures the State's energy security far into the future.  However, there is a flaw in the strategy.  The current model being pursued by the Government relies primarily on wind energy to meet targets.  This is somewhat short-sighted.  Wind on its own is not a secure form of energy.  It should be developed as part of a wider renewable strategy which includes alternative sources, such as wave, tidal, hydro and biomass energy generation.  Recently, WestWave, a wave energy project, was awarded funding by the European Commission.  This project is led by the ESB, a semi-State company.  This is a step, but only a step, in the right direction in terms of developing tidal and wave energy.<\/p> <p> A 2011 report by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland forecast that an all-Ireland ocean energy sector could be worth about &euro;9 billion and could generate approximately 525 TWh annually.  Annual electricity usage is 26 TWh.  This is the scale of what is possible in wave energy.  Would the people of this land prefer ocean energy or would they prefer to see beautiful landscape destroyed and water possibly poisoned by hydraulic fracturing?  I think the answer is clear.<\/p> <p> Biomass and anaerobic digestion boiler technologies are improving all the time.  We should consider and evaluate whether the Moneypoint coal-fired power station is an option to help meet our 2020 targets.  Every policy and decision made by Government on energy has to be proofed against our targets to reduce carbon emissions, while ensuring that people are treated fairly.  On a worldwide level, we cannot have people whose livelihoods are dependent on the rainforest penalised for doing the right thing.  There have to be countermeasures.  Similarly, our farmers and our country should not be penalised for what we do best, namely, producing the best food in the world.  This has to be taken into account.  However, our carbon reduction targets should be explicitly stated in time stages to enable us and the world to calculate whether we are moving in the right direction.  Sometimes we can get legislation wrong, but the consequences in those cases are not too severe or they can be undone.  However, if we get this wrong - the legislation or the enforcement - there will be no second chance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100047#VV00400","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423673700,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I regret that I was not in the House when the Minister opened the debate.  There was a Whips' meeting and I have not yet mastered bi-location.  I would like to be energetically and enthusiastically supporting this legislation.  Unfortunately, I cannot because it is woefully inadequate.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past ten years, we have seen eight different pieces of legislation on this topic.  I introduced legislation in 2012, which was debated in this House.  Legislation has been introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Green Party, the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  This pretty much spans the entire political spectrum.  It has taken ten years of Bills, reports, hearings, consultations, drafts and pre-legislative scrutiny to get to where we are now.  At all times, the overwhelming evidence presented was that whatever law emerged, it needed to be strong to change behaviour and bring the people with us.<\/p>  <p>  It is not all bad news.  We need to have balance.  A couple of weeks ago, when we had the debate on the committee report, it was said that we were almost leading the way in Europe.  However, the UK, Scotland, France, Denmark, Sweden and Finland have one thing in common.  They have adopted legislation which is much stronger than that with which we are presented.  They also have targets set in domestic law.  Unfortunately and critically, this legislation does not contain these targets.  For legislation which has the support of politicians across the spectrum, it is amazing that narrow sectoral concerns seem to have had more impact in the framing of this legislation.  I hope this can be changed on Committee Stage.  It is an indictment of Parliament that, over the past ten years, we have failed to respond to one of the biggest challenges of our times.  As has been stated already, it is not just for the benefit of this generation.  This is most definitely for the benefit of future generations.  The planet will survive, but we need to address the issue of the number of people on the planet and the conditions in which they will survive.<\/p>  <p>  The Oireachtas environment committee, of which I am a member, took a pragmatic view when compiling our report.  The debate was very good and the people who were invited to contribute to the process represented all viewpoints.  The report was very measured.  I would have liked it to go further.  However, many of us were happy to go with the middle ground because we felt there was a decent chance some of the suggestions and recommendations would make it into law.  Unfortunately, some of the more serious ones have not.  For example, we dropped outright targets in favour of a definition of the kind of low-carbon economy we wanted.  We framed this as one with near-zero emissions in transport, energy and buildings and carbon neutrality in agriculture.  Amazingly, this compromise did not make it into the legislation before the House.  This is hugely disappointing.<\/p>  <p>  On the independence of the expert advisory council, the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, constantly spoke of the need for a model similar to that of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  We thought this was a very good idea.  The Minister of State was constantly harping on about it, but this is not evident in the framing of the independence, or the possible lack of any independence, of the expert advisory council.  It is vitally important that the body which monitors our efforts under this Bill will have the power to hold the Government to account.<\/p><p>If Departments do not fear consequences, I do not think it will be central to the framing of legislation and policy options into the future.  It is critically important that independence is elevated when it comes to the Committee Stage debate on this legislation.  I hope the Minister will take that on board.<\/p> <p> The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that even if the most extreme mitigating measures were adopted today, we would still fail to achieve our current 2020 emissions reduction targets.  The 2030 EU framework target, around which this Bill is based, seeks a reduction on the 1990 emissions of 40%, or twice the 2020 target.  Given that we will not have the sectoral plans included in this until 2017, we will not know what the outcome of those plans will be until 2022 or 2023.  If we are off target, we will have just seven years to get back on target.  It is going to become an impossibility for people a short time into the future.  That is a major problem.<\/p> <p> I have received replies to parliamentary questions, for example from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, in relation to the sectoral plans.  To be perfectly honest, it does not look like the kind of investment that is going into transport is even being considered in advance of the sectoral plans being put in place.  In the case of the built environment, there is a real opportunity to provide for retrofitting, perhaps through the European Investment Fund.  Rather than having a carbon fund here, we have another means of collecting taxes.  If we are to bring people along and change their attitudes, there must be a relationship between the carbon fund and what people see for that fund.  It has to be seen as an opportunity, rather than as something to be imposed on top of people.<\/p> <p> Of course the agriculture sector is probably our most challenging sector.  While there is no doubt that we produce very good food, certain things that could be done at this stage, rather than waiting until the sectoral plan is produced, would be mitigating.  I think that is going to be one of the biggest failures of this approach.  It is a question of how it is done.  As has been said, our national ambition is stated through the sectoral plans.  There is a lack of national ambition by virtue of the fact that we are going to wait until 2022 or 2023 before we even see where the difficulties are going to arise.  We need to get to 40% by 2030, but we are not even going to get to 20%.  It can already be predicted that this will be an impossible task into the future.  Just as many of us look back and ask why more people did not shout \"stop\" in advance of the economic crash, when the bubble caused by the building boom could have been predicted, it can be predicted that if we do not take certain decisions now, people will look back and ask why we did not do so.  They will ask why we did not put the nuts and bolts in place to deliver on a solution in a timely way, especially when we had signed up to a clear obligation to do so.<\/p> <p> This legislation misses the target by a very significant distance.  For example, it does not have independence in terms of the expert advisory council.  The sectoral plans are pushed out into the future.  We had recommended that a timeframe of no more than 12 months should be provided for, but this Bill provides for a 24-month timeframe.  The lack of a definition is a huge difficulty.  We will have a serious problem in doing something about something that does not have a definition or an adequate definition.<\/p> <p> I hope the Minister will be able to accept a significant number of amendments on Committee Stage.  We had a very good pre-legislative stage.  If that is going to mean something, we have to see it coming through in the Bill itself.  As I have said, the position that was reached was very much in the middle ground, rather than the extreme end where an attempt would have been made to create a dialectic between the Department and the committee.  An effort was made to try to be responsible about what could be delivered.  The real disappointment is that the middle ground position that was arrived at has not been taken on board.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments at the end of this debate.  I hope he will give us some sort of indication of what is likely to be taken on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100048#WW00200","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423674300,"counter":605,"content":"<p>People are constantly setting out what needs to be done to combat climate change, which is happening fast and will have a huge impact on countries in the Third World and the so-called First World.  We know it is a life-and-death issue for many people throughout the world.  As the Minister said, it is a worldwide issue that does not know boundaries.  We always have people standing up to say \"yes, we are going to commit to this\".  This country's Minister of the day attended the Lima conference and made the argument that Ireland was going to commit itself to climate change objectives.  In that context, the Bill that has come before the D&aacute;il in recent days beggars belief.  Where is the pressure coming from?  Is it coming from sectoral interests?  Are they saying it is all very fine to talk about climate change but we should commit ourselves in words rather than in deeds?  Are groups coming in from behind the scenes to put pressure on governments to reduce their obligations to international climate change efforts?  I do not think it is good enough to say these targets will be based on other targets that are to be set.  We have to set our own targets.  It is crucial for us to do so.  Other countries have set clear targets already.<\/p>  <p>  I attended a briefing that was held by Stop Climate Chaos yesterday.  I suggest the Minister would have attended it last year before he was put in the position he is in now, or even before he was elected.  The organisers of the briefing, who have been very involved in some of the most serious examination of climate change for the future, are saying clearly that this Bill is very disappointing.  A fourth class group of ten year olds from Griffeen Valley Educate Together national school who attended yesterday's event asked why no targets have been set in this legislation.  They could not understand why no targets have been set.  When people of that age are asking such questions, it shows they have significant concerns about their future.  The Minister has an obligation to provide a specific reason.  I do not think the explanation he provided in his introductory remarks was good enough.  We should set targets for our greenhouse emissions.<\/p>  <p>  A great deal of energy has been expended on trying to secure a basis for a cohesive all-party approach to this Bill.  While the Minister might have more experience in this regard, it seems to me that this Bill has had one of the longest periods of gestation in the D&aacute;il since the action plan finished in 2012.  A serious approach to this legislation seemed to be taken from then on in.  There were long and arduous discussions at the joint committee.  Everybody tried to play a part in bringing forward an acceptable Bill that would be robust in dealing with serious climate change issues.  Deputy Murphy might be able to tell me how long the members of the committee were stuck in there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100049#XX00200","speaker":"1193"},{"type":"speech","time":1423674300,"counter":606,"content":"<p>Two weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100049#XX00300","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1423674300,"counter":607,"content":"<p>They spent hours and hours in there.  I was not there, but I saw some of it.  I would hardly recognise this Bill as having being influenced by that committee debate.  It is a terrible shame.  The failure of the Bill to set a numeric target for future emissions reductions is a fundamental flaw because it means there is little concrete direction for the coming years.<\/p><p>Recently, Finland, Denmark and France set targets.  Under law, Denmark's is 40% by 2020, double the Europe 2020 target.  France's energy transition Bill seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 and 75% by 2050.  They may not meet their targets, but at least they are working towards them through their sectoral areas, for example, transport, and retrofitting.<\/p> <p> The independence of the climate change advisory council is one of the most disappointing for all of the groups involved in Stop Climate Chaos.  The necessary independence does not exist.  The Minister should revert on the next Stage with amendments to address this point.<\/p> <p> Climate justice is a major issue.  People believed that the Government could link in with it and provide inclusion.<\/p> <p> The Bill is disappointing.  The Minister's introduction did not encourage me to believe that he would take these concerns on board or introduce the necessary amendments that were highlighted during the pre-scrutiny stage by Members of all groups.  The mood among them was that they were actually creating something workable, but the Minister will not follow suit.  That will be a shame and he will have to deal with it in his own way over the coming decades in which Ireland has not played the key role it should have by setting targets now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100049#XX00400","speaker":"1193","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423674900,"counter":609,"content":"<p>If we want to play our part in the global effort to mitigate the onward march of climate change, one of the primary and most essential steps we can take is to embrace the no new fossil frontiers principle and push for it to be enshrined in international law.  This would mean lobbying for a Europe-wide ban on fracking, a ban on offshore drilling in the fragile Arctic region and the Amazon rain forest and a global moratorium on carbon-intensive tar sands extraction as well as lobbying public institutes like colleges, faith organisations and governments to sell whatever financial holdings they have in fossil fuel companies.  This movement is based on the idea, to quote Ms Naomi Klein, that &quot;anyone with a basic grasp of arithmetic can look at how much carbon the fossil fuel companies have in their reserves, subtract how much carbon scientists tell us we can emit and still keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, and conclude that the fossil fuel companies have every intention of pushing the planet beyond the boiling point&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The truth of the matter is that fossil fuel companies and the governments that facilitate them are a greater threat to global security and stability than any of the so-called terrorist groups that the Government regularly condemns in this House.  The fossil fuel business model and its cronies should be put on trial.  Given the international consensus around the realities of the issue of global warming, it has become morally unacceptable to be financing fossil fuel extraction.  However, that is exactly what we are doing with the Corrib project.  Under current licensing terms, the State retains a 0% royalty share in any oil or gas found in the Shell Corrib project.  According to a 2007 study commissioned by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Ireland offers one of the lowest government takes in the world.<br\/><br\/>Yesterday in the AV room, while the Government was preparing to reassert its support for the violation of women's human rights, a woman from the Philippines named Ms Lidy Nacpil spoke about the effects that climate change was having on her country, not tomorrow, but today.  She described how just one of the now normal mega-typhoons in 2013 took the lives of 10,000 people and destroyed the homes of 2 million others.  She pointed out that, while the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, had agreed on the safety limit of a 2&deg; increase in the global temperature by 2050, for her people even 2&deg; was not acceptable.  In fact, what needs to be done is to keep the temperature rise as low as possible, as matters will worsen for the Philippines.<br\/><br\/>Here we are, in a country with one of the highest levels of carbon emissions <i>per capita<\/i>in the world, handing over our fossil fuel reserves to one of the world's largest polluters as a gift at Corrib while branding as criminals those who object to the wilful destruction of the planet.  Here we are discussing a climate Bill that does not promise any plan until 2017 and no progress report until 2023, fails to set an emission reduction target for 2050, does not commit to a definition of &quot;low-carbon economy&quot;, refuses to make the expert advisory council fully independent and fails to recognise the importance of the principle of climate justice.<br\/><br\/>In Ireland, we emit more greenhouse gases than the poorest 400 million people living on the planet put together.  As noted by Stop Climate Chaos, Ireland is emitting 17 tonnes of greenhouse gases per person per year.  This makes us the second worst polluter in the EU, where the average is 11 tonnes.  We need to recognise that we are not innocent, that we have benefited at the expense of others and that it is time to do our part to redress the balance.<br\/><br\/>Much like tobacco companies profit from the wilful damaging of people's health, shortening the length and quality of people's lives and, in millions of cases, assisting in their early deaths, fossil fuel companies profit from the destruction of our atmosphere and planet, the contamination of the air we breathe and the water that supports life on Earth and the undermining of the chances of decent survival for billions of people.  The organs of justice around the world have forced the tobacco giants to pay billions in damages to those whose lives they have violated.  In a just and progressive world, we would start to see similar cases brought against the fossil fuel industry and the governments that facilitated their extractivism, which is doing much to diminish the quality of life on Earth and the chances for the meaningful survival of our species.<br\/><br\/>The reality is a far cry from this scenario.  The Government is colluding in one of the most drastic transfers of power in world history.  The secretive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, which the Government and the mainstream media refuse to discuss in anything resembling a critical manner, contains a series of investor rights that will allow businesses to bypass national court systems and sue governments in private arbitration panels, including over health and environmental protection measures passed by the D&aacute;il that they claim undermine corporate profits.<br\/><br\/>To return to Ms Klein on this subject, she points out that current trade and investment rules provide legal grounds for foreign corporations to fight virtually any attempt by governments to restrict the exploitation of fossil fuels, particularly where a carbon deposit has attracted investment, extraction has begun and the aim of the investment is explicitly to export the oil, gas and coal for sale on the world market.  When people are informed of the reality of the trade rules that allow capitalism to function in its current form, they usually express disbelief, but the truth is out.  The interests of corporations are more important than the well being of the entire population of the planet.<br\/><br\/>The Government with its neoliberal agenda does not challenge this doctrine.  In a written answer to me last November, the Minster for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, stated his belief that the investor-state dispute mechanism included in the TTIP was a valid one.  Is it really valid that, under the agreement, a fossil fuel giant could sue the Government for its decision to ban fracking in the west?  Such cases are being filed more frequently than ever.  Ms Klein reports that, as of 2013, a full 60 out of 169 pending cases at the World Bank's dispute settlement tribunal had to do with the oil and gas or mining sectors compared with a mere seven extraction cases throughout the entire 1980s and 1990s.  Ms Lori Wallach, the director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, says that, of the more than $3 billion in compensation already awarded to corporations under US trade agreements and bilateral investment treaties, more than 85% pertains to challenges against natural resource, energy and environmental policies.<br\/><br\/>Through the TTIP, corporations are being given the right to become the authors of the legislation that is supposed to curb and monitor their destructive behaviour.<\/p><p>The last buffer that protects civil society from the pure, unfettered greed of the profit motive, which drives the corporate-led exploitation of the planet and its people, is being breached.  This Government has repeatedly demonstrated that it is a willing facilitator of this movement.<\/p> <p> Everything is connected and all the legislation that passes through this House should reflect that truth.  We need to see the climate change situation for what it really is - a chance to remake the country and the world for the better and to do our bit in the global fight to make the world habitable for the global populations of today and tomorrow.<\/p> <p> Last week, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, said that we have no austerity problems in Ireland.  Are we to take it then that the funding is available for infrastructural projects that are needed to mitigate climate change?<\/p> <p> I, too, look forward to Committee Stage of this Bill when we hope to argue for many of the recommendations of the Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht which are being sidelined in such an unfathomable manner by the Bill as it currently stands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100050#YY00200","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423675500,"counter":611,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Fergus O'Dowd who is sharing time with Deputy Alan Farrell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100051#ZZ00200","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speech","time":1423675500,"counter":612,"content":"<p>This is an important debate on timely legislation.  It is only right and proper that we should have a full discussion on all the issues involved.  I note the comments by Opposition Members that the Oireachtas committee's report, as well as the views of outside groups, on this Bill should be fully and properly debated.  However, a question lies at the heart of the Opposition's point of view, and particularly that of the previous speaker.  If we do away with all fossil fuels, what will we put in their place?  We must have some form of energy.<br\/><br\/>Wind energy was proposed for this country and the idea was that, as it comes from the most disparate and distant parts, we would have to build a new energy network to carry that energy to our towns and cities.  Following that proposal, there was uproar throughout the country even though wind energy is not created from fossil fuels.  Thousands of people attended public meetings to protest at the infrastructure that was required.<br\/><br\/>The question therefore is what choices we have to make as a society.  There must be a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>because if we are not using fossil fuels, we will have to use other forms of energy.  If we are bringing that alternative energy from distant parts, while creating lots of jobs on the way and meeting the needs of communities that would not otherwise have the infrastructure, what choices do we have to make?  If we want alternative energy we must have an acceptable alternative infrastructure in some shape or form.  I am not talking about the height of pylons or other technical issues; I am talking about the principle.  If we want to fight climate change, we must accept a compromise on where and how we live.  Those compromises include accepting wind power, alternative energy structures and agreeing as a society that that is the way forward, if that is where we want to go.<br\/><br\/>One of the key necessities is to change our thinking on transport because how we travel is a big issue.  Our transport sector is a major polluter in terms of fossil fuels, but we are already changing the way we think about it.  The ESB, in particular, is active in putting energy points throughout the country for electric cars, but who is buying such vehicles?  Not many people have them.  If we want to use alternative forms of energy and transport, we should use that infrastructure which is being placed throughout the country.<br\/><br\/>There are incentives for using electric cars, but we need to increase such incentives to make it much more attractive for people to use them, especially in urban areas.  We need to change the way we think in that respect.  We should walk or cycle to work if we can, as well as using public transport.  We need to change the way we live in many respects.<br\/><br\/>I do not agree with previous speakers who said that Ireland is doing nothing and that nothing has changed.  A lot has changed, including planning and construction regulations.  The SEAI promotes the warmer homes scheme, which is essentially a way of getting people to reduce their energy bills and other costs, thus making it more attractive to use alternative energy.<br\/><br\/>We still face great challenges in trying to change public behaviour.  I have met concerned groups, and will meet them again as the Bill progresses through the Oireachtas.  Many people are committed to reducing pollution from the use of fossil fuels.  The involvement of young people and families demonstrates an energy and enthusiasm in this regard.  We need to carry the message because everybody must step up to the mark on this issue.<br\/><br\/>Some years ago, when Dublin City Council reduced the speed limit for cars travelling through the city centre to the equivalent of about 20 mph, there was uproar throughout the city.  It was said that we were interfering with the privilege of motorists to travel through streets they did not need to travel through, particular if the proper transport infrastructure is in place.  There was uproar over that proposal, which I supported, and I received a lot of calls from people who opposed the plan.  It is difficult to stand up to pressure groups when one supports environmental change, lower speed limits and pedestrianisation.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the recent decision by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to spend about &euro;2 million on installing proper signage for reducing speed limits in urban areas.  In addition, we have seen major developments with cycle paths.  Every Deputy in the House wants a new cycle lane in his or her constituency.  It is what people want and that is the direction to take.  It is incorrect to state that local authorities are not centrally involved.  Those planning authorities construct houses and control much of our environment.  However, I would like to see them becoming more involved because there is a lot more to be done.<br\/><br\/>Research, science and technology will change as time goes on.  In his speech, the Minister said that if our targets are less than those fixed by Europe, we will be subject to their regulation and will have missed the boat.  If they are higher, however, then our economy will not be competitive.  We will have to tease out that fundamental point on Committee Stage.<br\/><br\/>I also wish to comment on the criticisms of the expert advisory council.  There is no reason the Environmental Protection Agency should not be involved in that council.  I cannot think of a more fundamental upholder of environmental legislation than the EPA, or one that is more impermeable to political influence.  I welcome having that agency at the heart of our expert advisory council.  It would be silly not have the EPA involved because it defines our legislation and is ethical in every single respect.<br\/><br\/>The SEAI also carries the flag for change, including more sustainable ways of living.  It does not make sense to omit the Economic and Social Research Institute from the expert advisory council.  The ESRI is not part of the political establishment and is not subject to ministerial or Government diktats.  I would welcome the ESRI's involvement in the council.  In addition, there are between eight and ten ordinary members of this advisory council, so the majority of its members will not be part of the State apparatus.  They will be independent and separate from the political system.  On Committee Stage we could perhaps look at other nominees for that council.  We could consult some of the interested groups on who they consider should or should not be on the council.  The advisory council will be independent, informed and practical, which is the way this country has to go.<\/p><p> Research and science will change how things happen in the future.  However, one matter we are all monitoring daily is our energy costs.  People have large energy bills to pay in the aftermath of the cold winter and what they require for the future is certainty with regard to, and if possible reductions in, prices.  They also want sustainable energy, which in my view represents the way forward.  The Bill before the House will be of assistance in improving our access to better and more sustainable energy.  I commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100051#ZZ00300","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423676100,"counter":614,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill.  I welcome that, when enacted, it will be the first item of climate legislation ever to be put in place in Ireland, which is a very positive development.  Notwithstanding the comments made by some during the debate thus far, the Bill is but a first step and that must be acknowledged.<\/p>  <p>  It goes without saying that we have a responsibility to take action now, especially to protect and preserve the environment for future generations.  It is certainly positive that the Bill provides a statutory basis for the national objective of pursuing the transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by the year 2050.  In recent weeks and months I have been contacted by many constituents in respect of their concerns with this Bill.  A number of them posed some fair and reasonable questions and I intend to raise these during my contribution.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the State will be committed to meeting both its EU and international climate change commitments under the provisions contained within the Bill.  While we are currently subject to legally binding mitigation targets up to 2020 - I understand negotiations are ongoing in respect of targets up until 2030 - the question must be asked as to why no explicit mitigation targets are contained in the Bill.  The Department's position appears to be that setting targets within the Bill could at some stage interfere with the legally binding targets set by EU legislation.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate why he believes this to be the case.<\/p>  <p>  The national climate policy position was approved by the Government in April of last year.  The Department's position is that the Bill will provide statutory underpinning for that position but this will not really negate the need for explicit targets to be set by this Bill given that the policy position is just that, a policy position, and is not legislation.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the positive aims upon which it is based.  These aims include an aggregate reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of at least 80% by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors and, in parallel, an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.  Given that this is the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill, I am obliged to ask whether it would not be reasonable to include a definition within its provisions of what constitutes \"low carbon\"?  The inclusion of such a definition could provide extra clarity and contextualisation to the provisions and aims of this legislation.  A further concern, which has just been outlined by the previous speaker and which has been brought to my attention on numerous occasions, relates to why the Bill does not explicitly state that the expert advisory council will be fully independent.  Will the Minister indicate why this is the case?  Surely it would be beneficial to enshrine the independence of the expert advisory council in the legislation and state, beyond any doubt, that it will be wholly independent of Government in carrying out its duties.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the whole-of-government approach set down in the Bill and outlined by the Minister.  This approach is an essential component of any strategy to reduce emissions.  Placing a requirement on the Ministers, under whose remit the largest emitting sectors fall, to prepare mitigation policy measures for inclusion within the successive national mitigation plans will ensure that tackling climate change is not a battle being fought by a single Minister or Department.  This will allow for a co-ordinated approach to be implemented across numerous policy areas and will provide Ireland with a greater chance of success in terms of ensuring that we meet our goals in reducing emission levels.<\/p>  <p>  The provisions in this Bill require the Minister to make a national mitigation plan at least once every five years and to submit this to Government for approval.  This plan will specify the measures to be adopted by relevant Ministers especially to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.  Providing for the development of successive plans is important as we simply cannot adequately foresee how many of the large emitting sectors will develop in future.  To adopt anything other than a dynamic approach, which allows for adjustments, would be irresponsible.  I am pleased that a national adaptation framework will also be developed by the Minister and submitted to Government for approval.  This framework will be renewable at least once every five years and it is important in terms of laying out the national strategy to reduce the susceptibility of the State to the adverse impacts which climate change would have at both local and national level.<\/p>  <p>  A national and transition mitigation plan is required to be developed by the Minister \"no later than 24 months after the passing of this Act\".  In light of the importance of taking action to tackle climate change, should the development of this plan not take place in a more appropriate timeframe?  I raise this issue because there are EU targets which we are obliged to meet by 2020 but under this provision, the national mitigation plan may not actually be in place until 2017.  I do not believe this provides the State with sufficient time in which to take action.  I would be grateful if the Minister could expand on the rationale for not explicitly mentioning and incorporating the principle of climate justice within this Bill.  I concur with those Opposition Members who raised this matter.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that it has taken a great deal of time to get the Bill to the floor of the House.  In that context, I commend the Minister and his Department on the work they have done in respect of it.  If the Bill is enacted, the State will finally have its first item of specific climate change legislation in place.  That will make Ireland one of the few EU member states to have such legislation.  While I am supportive of the Bill, I would appreciate it if the Minister could provide further clarity on the concerns which many people have brought to my attention and which I have sought to raise here.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to comment further on the whole-of-government approach.  Each Minister and his or her Department will be responsible for the delivery of this approach.  While I welcome the steps that have been taken within the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in recent years, not just during the lifetime of this D&aacute;il but also during the lifetime of the preceding one, I am concerned about public transport and its sustainability.  The population of the northside of Dublin is approximately 600,000 but the area is only served by one real mass transit system, namely, the northern commuter line, which includes the DART.  We have been waiting for proposals to be brought forward in respect of metro north, which is envisioned as serving the airport and the areas beyond it.  The Dublin west area, which is part of Fingal, is host to both the fastest-growing community in Ireland and the fastest-growing part of a community in Europe, but it is not served by a mass transit system.  Rather, it is served by bus routes.  The services on some of these routes are intermittent and the routes themselves are affected by bottlenecks.<\/p>  <p>  While steps have been taken to mitigate the position, the fact remains that approximately 600,000 people in this city only have two ways to travel to and from work, namely, by public transport - the bus - or by private car.  We have failed miserably in the context of providing park-and-ride facilities throughout the country.  When they are provided, we charge exorbitant prices for them and this drives people back onto the roads into their cars.  If I can travel by car to Dublin city centre from Balbriggan in 45 or 50 minutes at peak times and if it takes 50 minutes to do so by train - taking into account the delays that can affect the northern commuter line, it could be longer - where is the incentive to use public transport?  This matter must be addressed and not just in the context of the Bill before us.  The Government and those which succeed it must ensure that public transport providers meet the emissions targets set for them in the policies that will be rolled out in the future.  I met representatives from Dublin Bus a few months ago and they indicated that while the company's fuel bill has increased by 80% in the past ten years or so, its level of consumption has decreased as a result of the use of more environmentally friendly vehicles.  This represents a job well done.  The same cannot be said of our rail service providers, however, although I accept that there are new engines within the fleet which obviously use less fuel.<\/p><p>However, as the network gets larger and demand increases, their consumption will clearly increase.<\/p> <p> I have referred to two areas concerning public transport, but I could talk about road haulage and the need for Ireland, as a partner in the European Union, to try to push for lower emissions in the road haulage industry.  That industry is obviously of key importance in this country since it is an island.<\/p> <p> I wish to discuss the issue of car culture.  Right across this House, we are lauding car sales figures.  We believe the increase is great because it is obviously good for the economy as there are more VAT receipts.  People with money in their pockets are able to spend it and are not afraid of doing so, yet every time a car is sold there is an impact on our carbon dioxide emissions.  It is difficult for the Government, therefore, to respond adequately in climate change legislation and to the targets set at EU level.  There are a number of factors we must consider.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to the rest of the debate, particularly Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100052#AAA00200","speaker":"1014","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423676700,"counter":616,"content":"<p>This Bill is really quite pathetically weak in dealing with the most serious of crises, the climate crisis, and all the dangers it poses nationally and globally.  It is largely an exercise in lip service that is fairly typical of how the Government deals with many serious matters.  There is much high-flown rhetoric and aspiration and many promises but, on burrowing into the detail, one realises there is very little in the way of specifics.  This is fairly typical of how the Government seems to have been doing its business over recent years.  With a matter as serious as climate change, paying lip service is just not good enough.  It is grossly irresponsible if we are to secure the future of this country, its citizens and the wider environment and if we are to meet our responsibilities regarding others around the world.<br\/><br\/>As has been stated, Ireland has one of the highest <i>per capita<\/i>emissions rates in Europe.  It is ranked fourth highest.  The potential cost to Ireland of runaway climate change is more severe than for most countries in Europe.  The Joint Research Centre's recent report on climate impacts in Europe details the enormous costs already incurred in Ireland owing to events such as flooding.  Some &euro;750 million has been paid out by insurers since 2000.  This indicates, based on the current trajectory, that the costs, which are really quite astronomical right across Europe, are set to increase massively.  The cost of addressing sea flooding in Britain and Ireland is predicted to increase from &euro;996 million to &euro;3 billion over the next few years.  Already, the direct economic cost of the damage from flooding across Europe is &euro;5 billion.  It is expected to be &euro;11 billion in future years.  The report states Ireland and Britain will be the worst affected, obviously because they are islands on the west of Europe and have particular climatic conditions.<br\/><br\/>We are likely to reap the whirlwind.  We have already seen this with the cost of flood damage to the State and its impact on agriculture.  We are likely to reap a far more damaging and literal whirlwind in the coming years if we do not do something about climate change or at least play our part in doing something about it and reducing carbon emissions in a serious way.  This Bill does not achieve this.  As other speakers have implied, when one examines the impact of climate change in other parts of the world, one notes the quite terrifying consequences for health and the forced migration, enormous costs and deaths.  The World Health Organization suggests 250,000 extra people will die around the world by 2030 as a result of conditions related to climate change, such as heat exposure, diarrhoea, malaria and childhood nutrition.  These are already some of the biggest killers among some of the poorest people in the world.  Consider the enormous cost of the adaptation of coastal zones in places such as the Philippines, where it is expected to be &euro;5 billion per year by 2020, as a result of the impact of climate change.<br\/><br\/>Ireland, as an island nation in Europe, is set to start to suffer.  We will incur costs and experience damage to the extent I have described unless we do something very seriously to address climate change.  Against this background and given the mortal threat that climate change poses to Ireland, its citizens, the world and the future generations to whom we have a responsibility, this Bill is absolutely pathetic and an exercise in lip service.  The reasons for saying this have been well set out in the documents produced by a range of environmental organisations already alluded to in this debate.  The reasons include the failure to include targets and a definition of a low-carbon economy, the failure to ensure the climate advisory council is fully independent of State-owned stakeholder interests, the fact that the Bill does not provide for climate justice and allude to our responsibility to those in poor parts of the world, and the fact that the timeframe for the national mitigation plans has been pushed out to two years although the heads of the Bill initially stated 12 months and although environmental organisations say that, given the urgency, it should be six months, not two years.  The Bill is just kicking the can down the road, to use that awful phrase.  It is an indication of not taking the matter seriously.<br\/><br\/>The national mitigation plan the Government is proposing does not have to set out figures on national emissions, nor does it include a reference to soil carbon management.  With regard to the process for adopting the plans, although the Government has made much reference to the need for cross-party, cross-Oireachtas consensus and wider buy-in to this process, the plans can actually be adopted by the Government without being brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas to be debated and decided upon.  The environmental organisations talk about the need for a provision requiring the Taoiseach, as the senior member of the climate change sub-committee, to come to the House to make statements annually on the progress we are making on reducing carbon emissions.  Even that level of accountability and specificity in terms of marking our progress is not included.<br\/><br\/>Deputy O'Dowd said it is all very well to make these criticisms but that we must outline the alternatives.  We agree.  We have to have sustainable energy production but the problem is the way the Government is approaching it.  To cut a long story short, the corporatised, industrialised capitalist approach to developing energy is the problem.  If we are to deal with this issue and begin to understand the threat it poses to the world, there must be joined-up thinking and a break from a model of dealing with this that is all about corporate profit and a big industrialised approach.  This is why the Government has got into so much trouble over wind turbines in the midlands.<\/p><p>It became far less about developing, or even any interest in, sustainable energy than about the private interests, some of which had connections with political parties in this House, making a fortune out of wind energy with no consideration for the local community and no real serious examination of the environmental benefit of these schemes which must be seriously questioned.<\/p> <p> As for the alternatives, one suggestion I would make to the Minister is that at every level we must go more local.  We need energy co-operatives in every town and village.  That will not solve all of the problems but will go a long way.  If the Minister wants buy-in, he should get local communities involved and release their energy and the resources that are around them, and let them develop energy co-operatives at local level that will look at a sustainable mix of energy sources which can be generated at a local level.  These sources would be a mix of small-scale wind, small-scale hydroelectric, district heating systems and biomass using public lands.  Of course, this would include the serious pursuit of retrofit and insulation and providing real incentive schemes to get that sort of thing done.  We are not doing that because, essentially, our approach is all about handing it over to the private sector.<\/p> <p> In my last seconds, I want to say, \"Trees, trees, trees, trees, trees.\"  It is unbelievable that the State forestry company is precluded by EU rules from meeting our afforestation targets, which are now merely a joke.  We need to plant trees.  Ireland is favourably suited to do so.  We must plant trees because at every level they will help meet our targets, create jobs and help produce sustainable energy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100053#BBB00200","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423677300,"counter":618,"content":"<p>The Venezuelan political scientist, Professor Edgardo Lander, wrote of the current climate crisis, stating:<blockquote>The total failure of climate negotiation serves to highlight the extent to which we now live in a post-democratic society.  The interest of financial capital and the oil industry are much more important than the democratic will of people around the world.  In the global neoliberal society profit is more important than life.<\/blockquote>That profound statement will be utterly vindicated in the context of this Bill unless the current shoddy form in which it is being brought the House is dramatically stood on its head.<br\/><br\/>As many Deputies already highlighted, there are five glaring deficiencies in the proposed Bill and there is a bigger problem in terms of the way in which we look at climate change.  First, as the other Deputies have said, it does not set a simple emission target for 2050.  How can one measure progress if one does not know what one is starting out with?  We have no definition of a low-carbon economy.  Whatever you are having yourself is more or less the approach the Government is adopting.<br\/><br\/>Other Deputies referred to the fact the Bill does not allow the expert advisory council to be fully independent.  We have had enough political interference, potentially, in so many aspects of the State.  We certainly do not need it in this regard, or that such a body would be at the whim of the majority political grouping of the day, particularly when we are dealing with a situation where the interests of the powerful are generally diametrically opposed to the interests of the rest of humanity.  This is one of the problems when we look at this.  It is not a case of balancing interests or a rising tide lifts all boats.  The root of the climate change problem is that the interests of the wealthy are opposed to the interests of the majority and unless one factors that in in dealing with climate change, it will not be done appropriately.<br\/><br\/>The other Deputies dealt well with the points about climate justice being entirely absent from the Bill.  It is a scandalous situation for a country such as Ireland, that prided itself on its benevolence around the world and its neutrality, that it is one of the worse polluters <i>per capita<\/i>in the world and has benefited from the gross exploitation of others.  Those who are suffering the most are the least to blame for this situation and we must acknowledge that we are responsible for our role in some of the poorest countries in the world which, as we speak, are fighting for their existence.<br\/><br\/>As other Deputies have said, one of the most cowardly aspects of this Bill is that it passes the matter on to the next Government, which is, to be honest, becoming a real ploy of this Government.  They will tackle nothing.  Everything is for the responsibility of the next Government, which will lead many to ask what is the point in having them here in the first place because the deadline for the next climate plan is 2017.  Already this plan is years too late.  We will not, even now, have a plan.  It is putting us in the position of being internationally humiliated, but international humiliation is par for the course as well when the Government is quite content to parade this country as one which is happy to ignore human rights law and violate human rights despite all the best advice.  I suppose we would be naive if we expected anything more in an approach on climate change.<br\/><br\/>We must radically stand policies on their head.  We must start by saying that we must achieve targets, by 2020, 2030 and 2050, to which we have a direct and legally-binding obligation, apart from a moral one.  We must stand on its head the way we operate.<br\/><br\/>The problem with the approach we have taken was summed up by the points made by Deputy O'Dowd, that it is all our fault, for instance, that I will drive home in my car, and I will not cycle out to Swords or will not get the bus, is my fault.  It is a bus route that has been decimated under this Government and it would take me an hour and a half to get home.  It is not practical for those living in this city to manage on a system that has been fatally underinvested in.  One cannot run a city on private cars but that is what many have been driven to because of the consistent lack of subvention for public transport and the lack of delivery of a decent rail infrastructure to the airport and beyond, to one of the fastest growing areas in Europe.  Suggesting getting on one's bike does not work in the context of some of the policies that this Government has put forward.  It is sickening that Deputy O'Dowd has no problem in entertaining Shell, one of the biggest polluters on the planet, and yet wants us all driving around in electric cars, and in entertaining fracking and then blaming ordinary people for the crisis.  It is just not good enough.  This is one of the reasons we are in this situation.<br\/><br\/>We need a complete overhaul of how we do everything, and that starts with planning and the interconnection between Departments.  We state on paper that we will have sustainable communities but instead we build them in a format that leaves residents with no alternative but to get into a car.  Over decades we perpetuate policies where billions of euro have been put into road transport.  Even now, tens of millions of euro are given to National Toll Roads to pay for that set up when there is underinvestment in public transport the likes of which no other European economy has done.  It means looking at the planning system and building schools and local facilities near where people live.  There is no point in building housing estates in the middle of nowhere with no public transport and then blaming parents for having to get into a car to bring their children to school.  All of these matters must be integrated.  We need to look at a land management strategy that discourages sprawl and encourages low-energy forms of agriculture etc.<br\/><br\/>Ms Naomi Klein summed it up well when she wrote, we &quot;need to be fair, so that the people already struggling to cover the basics are not being asked to make additional sacrifices to offset the excessive consumption of the rich.&quot;  That is at the heart of this.  We talk about the important concept that the polluter pays but, in Ireland, that has been bastardised to mean attacking ordinary people and ignoring that it is the wealthy in society who are the biggest polluters.  According to the Princeton Environmental Institute, the top 500 million richest people on earth are responsible for over half of the world's carbon emissions.  That is where we must start, if we are to have a meaningful debate.  Progressive taxation, which taxes the millionaires and billionaires, has climate justice at its heart.  We do not have enough time to debate the points.<br\/><br\/>The development of renewable energy, particularly in the area of wave power, in the context of Ireland will not be done by the private sector.  On this issue, the State must take the helm and lead.  We have, maybe, ten companies trying to develop prototypes, and they all are too small.<\/p><p>It is not a viable operation for them.

We need to examine how society is organised.  Addressing climate change is in people's interest.  It is the clumsy handling of it that has alienated people.  We need to devolve it locally but we also need to see that climate action is a massive job creator.  A project is being promoted in South Africa under the banner of 1 million climate jobs.  A massive job creation programme has been called for in areas such as renewable energy, public transport, ecosystem restoration and small-scale sustainable farming.  Those issues can put the interests of workers and the poor at the head of a movement to combat climate change.  It is a win-win situation for everybody except those at the top of society - the 1% who dominate, in their own interests, at the expense of us all.  Unless the Government and its peers across Europe and America tackle the issue, and tackle inequality, then one cannot tackle climate change.  It will be impossible to do so.  While warning about the glaring inefficiencies in this country, we need to stand on its head the way we approach climate issues and how society is organised rather than blame ordinary people for a crisis which is demonstrably not of their making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100055#DDD00500","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1423677900,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Eoghan Murphy, whom I understand is sharing time with Deputies Paul Connaughton and James Bannon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100055#DDD00600","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speech","time":1423677900,"counter":625,"content":"<p>That is correct.

There are many issues on which we could speak in the context of the Bill.  I still feel we have not had a proper debate on energy security in this country.  Neither have we had a proper debate on fracking or nuclear energy.  It is an appropriate time for us to embark on such debates and to look to the future in terms of where we are going with those important issues.<\/p>  <p>  In so far as the Bill is concerned, I will stick to the points in the legislation for this debate.  To say the Bill only has vague aspirations, as members of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party claim, is complete nonsense.  They did not prioritise the legislation when they were in government and so it was not adopted and they failed.  One could ask whether that coalition could have done better.  It is a historical fact that they did worse.  The Green Party&rsquo;s central piece of legislation, its reason for being in government, was introduced when the Green Party had already announced it was leaving Government and when it knew its legislation could not get through the Seanad because Fianna F&aacute;il did not support it.  The Bill arrived too late and had no chance of being adopted.  It was dead on arrival.  When I hear the Green Party and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party giving out about the legislation we have now I think it is rank hypocrisy.  It really angers me, as someone who has cared about environmental issues since I was first elected to Dublin City Council.  When I was young I was a member of Greenpeace.  I had the pencil case when I was in school.  It is something a lot of us care about and if we are going to have a debate on the environment and the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill let us have a constructive one and let us not try politically to point score over things Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party could not do when they were in power.  Their claim that they could have done more is absolute nonsense.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is making a start with the Bill.  It is taking a good initiative and that is a good thing but it is only a start.  The important thing is to get something in place and then to build upon it.  We must get the first piece of legislation in place so that we can aspire to the many other things people want to see.  We have all met with very passionate and dedicated campaigners for climate justice and climate action.  Many of us share their aspirations for what the legislation should contain, but we must recognise that we are starting in a good place.  The establishment of the advisory council is a good thing.  It will be able to produce its own reports.  Previous legislation would not have allowed for that if it had been enacted.  That is a positive step.  We will have an action plan every five years, which is another positive.  There will be an obligation on Ministers to report to the House every year on how they are making progress in their areas.  That is a positive foundation for where we want to begin this conversation, but we must recognise as well that the legislation before us is not perfect.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to building on the legislation once it is adopted, we can do a lot of work between now and the enactment of the Bill to make sure that it has as strong a foundation as possible for the coming years.  I hope the Minister will approach the legislation in the proper spirit as we approach Committee Stage because if we look back to the report of the Oireachtas committee we see that most of what it recommended was not reflected in the legislation.  One does not have to agree with everything a committee says, but if one does not listen to it, that begs the question of why we have such committees and why they do the work they do.  It is important as we amend the Bill on Committee Stage that we try to find a better balance between what the Oireachtas committee recommended and what the Government wants, because that is the whole purpose of the system we have.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of targets being built into the legislation beyond 2020 definitely needs to be better explained.  If we do not build in targets up to 2050 and if it is standard practice in other European countries to do so then we need to know why we are not doing it here.  There needs to be a really robust explanation.  If there is a legitimate reason in terms of agriculture or sustainable food production, let us hear it and let us have the debate, but let us not be closed to the possibility until we have had a thorough debate on the Bill as it moves through the House.<\/p>  <p>  There is no definition of low carbon in the Bill, which is incredible when one thinks about it.  We have a definition of low carbon and the Bill is about low carbon so the Bill should contain a definition.  That is something simple that we could agree to include as we come to Committee Stage.  There is also no concept of climate justice in the Bill, which is remarkable, as one cannot talk about the subject without talking about climate justice.  It is an important concept but it is a difficult thing to achieve.  However, we will not get anywhere near achieving it if we are not even talking about it in primary legislation such as this.  We need to work on that issue as well on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  We must ensure the expert advisory council is properly independent.  If there are ways we can do that by adopting language relevant to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council then let us do that.  It is also recognised that in setting up the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council we have created something imperfect there as well because although it has independence it can be ignored and is ignored.  We do not want to risk the new expert advisory council becoming irrelevant.  It needs to have some strong reporting mechanism into the Oireachtas so we can deliberate on its reports independently from the Government in an appropriate and short timeline so that before decisions are made we can discuss what the expert advisory council is talking about and so the Government can make decisions based on its advice and not, as we have had so many times in respect to important decisions, getting the best advice after decisions are made.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact the Bill is before the House but it does need to be improved.  There is a lot of work to do but if we get rid of the politics and the hypocrisy and come with constructive solutions and engagement we will get a very strong foundation and recognise that it is just the beginning as we move forward to 2020 and then on to 2050.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100055#DDD00900","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speech","time":1423677900,"counter":628,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Deputy Eoghan Murphy covered many of the areas I wish to cover and I agree with much of what he said.<\/p>  <p>  One of the biggest issues concerning climate change is that Governments by their very nature think in five-year cycles.  What we are asking in this context is that we should look to 2050 which seems a long way off.  However, if there is a serious problem and there is only so much one can do in a certain timescale then one must start to work immediately.  It is very important that the debate continues for a long period.  If we ever have a spell of bad weather in this country such as a storm or severe flooding, for the 24 hours after it we discuss whether it is due to climate change.  One is almost guaranteed to have Professor Sweeney on a local radio station discussing how the weather event is linked to climate change, and then the debate stops and the news agenda and the media move on and climate change is no longer a current topic.<\/p>  <p>  The film, \"The Day After Tomorrow\", sets out the nuclear option if we do not face up to the problem of climate change but when people saw the film they said that would never happen, that is was so far fetched it would not be a problem for us.  However, climate change is an issue and we must address it seriously.  The Bill is a welcome start from the Government but there are issues and concerns, as outlined by Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  The advisory council must be seen to be independent and it must be able to set out what it considers is going well and what is not going so well.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council speaks with the authority of people who are expert in their area.  They have seen the country in recession and that it is now coming out of recession.  We take the advice seriously, although we have not accepted much of it.  In the context of climate change it is important that we take on board exactly what the experts say we are getting wrong and how we can fix it.<\/p>  <p>  With the timelines as set out currently we will get a plan but it will be too long in the making.  Another issue we must address is the view that this country is so small that it does not really matter what we do in the wider world.  The United States of America and China make deals with each other and the belief is that if they are doing something then it will solve matters for the rest of us.<\/p><p>That is hardly a positive way to view this problem.  We have to do our bit.  I agree with the need for climate justice.  As a developed country we must do more for those countries in much more dire situations.  <\/p> <p> We need to consider the model to be adopted in the future.  I refer to the midlands where peat is burned.  Peat will eventually become extinct as a resource because it is finite rather than renewable.  The willow crop was grown for a number of years under the direction of the Government.  Farmers were told to grow this crop, that there would be a guaranteed market for it because it would be sold into the chain and they would earn a premium profit.  Farmers were very sceptical because they did not want to tie up their lands in growing this crop for a number of years.  They were assured this was an energy product and it was the way forward.  However, that support then began to be pulled back.  The farming community which embraced the idea of growing this energy crop now found that the supports were not available.  The supply of peat for energy use will run out.  This willow crop had been regarded as the substitute for the future but the incentives to grow it were taken away.  We all want to live in a world where we take seriously issues such as climate change and where we can make a significant difference.  Any policy for change requires a plan.  I have provided one example of where we started off on the right road and pulled back after a number of years.  Those farmers who took the leap of faith to grow this crop are now being punished for no fault of their own.  This is an example of a lack of joined-up thinking on how to solve the problem in the long run.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will need to consider helping farmers to grow this energy crop as this will help to preserve the peat supplies.<\/p> <p> I welcome this Bill but it is only a beginning.  We need to set out clear targets.  The year 2050 might seem a long time away and I doubt if any of us will be here in 2050.  I hope I will not be here even if that were possible.  We want to ensure we will live in a much more sustainable world than we do at the moment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100055#DDD01000","speaker":"1041","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423678500,"counter":630,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  It was interesting to hear my colleague on the other side of the House, Deputy Boyd Barrett, talking about energy co-operatives.  That form of co-operation exists within every parish in the country, in particular in rural areas.  People are involved in tidy town committees and development committees, for example.  They are doing great work such as tree planting in their respective parishes and townlands.  This must be acknowledged.

All one needs to do is to look at the CAP funding package introduced by this Government last year which includes a fund of &euro;12.5 billion for farming.  Farmers have been encouraged with attractive grants to grow and plant trees.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout my political career, both as a county councillor and as a Member of this House, I have always had a special interest in climate change and the issues surrounding it.  As a member of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, I have spent some time researching the arguments for and against this legislation.  Yesterday I met with constituents of mine who were part of the Stop Climate Chaos campaign.  They raised some valid points about this legislation.  No matter what side of the climate change debate one chooses, whether one considers it is causing global warming or global cooling, the message is clear that action must be taken.  Whether climate change is a man-made crisis or part of recurring patterns, we see the worrying results such as unparalleled weather in this country and across Europe.  Climate change will be one of the biggest challenges we face in the 21st century and as a result we must ensure we have in place appropriate legislation and structures to combat it.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill has been developed following extensive public consultation with a number of stakeholders and interest groups, including members of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  In a nutshell, this legislation provides a basis for the national objective of transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by the year 2050.  In a clear and concise manner, this Bill sets out the route in which the transition towards a low carbon economy will be achieved.  The main vehicle for this transition will be through a national mitigation plan, which will lower Ireland's level of greenhouse-gas emissions.  A national adaptation framework will provide for responses to changes caused by climate change.  Most important, both of these plans will be renewed every five years as it will allow us to tailor the plans to any unforeseen circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the positive aspects of this Bill.  If and when this Bill passes through both Houses, it will be the first climate change legislation ever enacted in Ireland and it will be an historic piece of legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke in the debate on climate change in the House in December 2009.  I called on the former Minister, a Green Party Minister at that, to bring forward comprehensive climate change legislation.  However, it has taken five long years for legislation to finally reach the floor of this House and while that is not as fast as I had originally hoped, it is a welcome move all the same.<\/p>  <p>  Members of the Opposition have expressed concern about the lack of specific targets in this legislation.  However, I agree with the Minister's point on this matter.  Ireland has already signed up to very strict international obligations and legally binding greenhouse-gas mitigation targets.  Discussions are ongoing for 2030 targets and I have no doubt this target-setting process will continue into 2040 and 2050.  The EU has set out a long-term plan of low-carbon transition in its national climate policy position.  Therefore, I see no logical reason we must set in legislation further mitigation targets for Ireland.  A very good point was raised recently which would reinforce my argument.  Had we had set targets previously we would have needed to change them to accommodate the abolition of milk quotas.<\/p>  <p>  This climate Bill is an important matter for all of us and it should be closely examined by all Members of the House.  It is very important that a small country like ours leads the way in combatting climate change through legislation.  If this legislation is passed through the House, Ireland will find itself in the company of a small group of EU member states which have specific climate change legislation and I will be very pleased when that is achieved.  <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I fully agree with the sentiments and the goals of this legislation as it is the right thing for our environment and our country.  I would have liked to have seen it enacted sooner but, as is always the case, it is better late than never.  I commend the Minister on his work to date on this legislation.  I commend all the bodies which took part in the various discussions in advance of the drafting of this legislation.  Some very sensible proposals were put forward.  There is nothing permanent except change.  If any flaws are discovered in the legislation I hope we can address them during the next stages.  I compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100056#EEE00400","speaker":"1062"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423678500,"counter":633,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Select Committee","time":1423678500,"counter":634,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100056#EEE00550"},{"type":"speech","time":1423678500,"counter":635,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, has completed its consideration of the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Bill 2014 without amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100056#EEE00600","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Child Care: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1423679100,"counter":636,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100057#FFF00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423679100,"counter":637,"content":"<p>The following motion was moved by Deputy Robert Troy on Tuesday, 10 February 2015:That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:notes that:\r\n\r\n&mdash;

Investment in child care is beneficial not only for the children involved, but for everybody, and yet Irish parents are absolutely crippled under the burden of the enormous cost of trying to access it, which is in many instances greater than a second mortgage.  It is a reflection of the fact the social wage in Ireland is completely out of sync with the rest of Europe.<\/p>  <p>  The reason the situation is so bad is we have outsourced and privatised early education.  I am not blaming the private sector for this.  In fact, I am well aware that many struggling cr&egrave;che owners who want to do the very best for the children in their care are actually penalised by the current scenario.  It is not sustainable for them to earn a living.  Our society and successive Governments have undervalued the work of those employed in child care and cr&egrave;che workers.  Those employers who try to pay over the odds and above the minimum wage and meet the standards are penalised and it is made more difficult for them to do their job.<\/p>  <p>  We have to be much more imaginative in how we deal with these issues.  I am in favour of the Government taking over many of these businesses, compensating those involved and continuing to employ them.  In the same way as we deal with schools which have principals and ordinary teachers, we could have cr&egrave;che managers and their workers taken over directly, under the control of the State.  If we do not invest in early childhood education, children today will not achieve their potential and our society will be weaker.  It is an absolute disgrace that those who are trying to do their best in this sector have been abandoned by the Government and it is about time it listened to their concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100057#FFF00400","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1423679100,"counter":640,"content":"<p>As in so many areas, the Government is disastrously letting down children and parents.  The cost of child care is a disaster, as is the failure of the State to invest adequately in providing affordable child care.  The average cost of child care is &euro;162 a week, but the cost can be as high as &euro;1,000 or &euro;2,000 a month.  This means someone with average earnings of approximately &euro;30,000 a year and two children would pay every cent earned after tax towards the cost of child care.  It is completely unsustainable and unmanageable.<\/p>  <p>  All of this has been made considerably worse by the impact of the Government's cuts and austerity, particularly the vicious cuts experienced by one-parent families.  From the Government that talks so much about labour activation, the effect of the cut in the income disregard, which essentially was child care money for lone parents, has meant that employment levels among lone parents have gone from 60% in 2012, when that budget was passed, to 36%.<\/p>  <p>  We now have the incredible situation where 32% of families in the country are in deprivation, but this rises to 63% for lone parents.  This month, the situation for lone parents will be made even worse, and even more of them will be driven out of the work place due to the unaffordability of child care, because 58,000 one-parent families are receiving letters stating another &euro;86 will be cut.

It is significant that only 42% of single mothers in Ireland are in the workplace, because the others cannot afford to work.  A very good friend of mine, Haxhi, and his partner, Eugenie, have to move to Germany because she wants to study and he has to work.  They can get their child minded there for nothing.  It makes such a difference when good child care is available.<\/p>  <p> I know it is not cheap and it would cost the State a lot to do it right and put a really good system in place, but a serious priority for the Government should be to start to make inroads into providing this absolutely vital service.

Child care is based on a model of private delivery, which is fundamentally wrong.  The fact that we depend on private child care causes all of the problems many private child care companies have, such as low pay and huge pressure on management trying to deliver important societal care.<\/p>  <p>  This week, \"Claire Byrne Live\" was very interesting as a comparison was made between public services in Ireland and France, in particular the huge question of child care and how it is delivered.  In Ireland, child care for two children costs between &euro;1,000 and &euro;1,400 a month.  In France, full-time education starts at age three and it is totally free.  In France, free education means free education and one does not pay for anything.  Such comparisons usually raise the question as to whether people here are willing to pay more tax for better services.  The programme gave an example of a two-earner household with an income of &euro;70,000 year in France and in Ireland.  The Irish couple paid more in income tax, universal social charge, PRSI and VAT.  The percentage of GDP comprising corporation profit tax was approximately the same.  How can the French Government deliver spending of 57% of GDP as against less than 40% in Ireland?  The answer is PRSI contributions.  Ireland has the lowest rate in the EU and it is only 25% of the rate paid by French employers.  If the EU average PRSI was implemented in Ireland, it would raise at least &euro;13 billion.  What we could do with &euro;13 billion in our services would be absolutely fantastic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100057#FFF00700","speaker":"1193"},{"type":"speech","time":1423679100,"counter":643,"content":"<p>In 2005, I was elected to the D&aacute;il in a by-election in Kildare, and a by-election was held in Meath on the same day.

The response was that &euro;1,000 was provided in the following budget per child, and this was subsequently changed to a preschool place which has already delivered returns, including societal returns.<\/p>  <p>  Those with huge mortgages are required to have a double income if they are to keep afloat, and very many of them would argue their child care costs are equivalent to another mortgage.  When one looks at it from the point of view of people parenting alone, there are real challenges.  They face a real poverty trap in taking up paid employment and working towards building a career.  It does not make economic sense when one looks at it over a lifespan.

As a voluntary board member of Legan Community Childcare in my home parish of Legan, I see first-hand the importance of child care services that are provided in rural Ireland, particularly in Longford-Westmeath.  Only last week there was a two-page supplement in the Westmeath Examiner outlining the wonderful services they provide.  It was two pages of a happy story with pictures of smiling children and so on.  It was great to see that but one would not have seen that ten years ago.<\/p>  <p>  Many families leave preschool children with relatives.  However, for those parents who do not have that support system behind them, it is vital that substantial child care funding is provided.  I am pleased that &euro;260 million is invested annually by the Government to support the provision of early childhood care and education.  The Government is committed to increasing access to subsidised child care and after-school places by extending eligibility and rebalancing parental contributions for families making their way into employment in this recovering economy.  It is also important to note that this Government is the first in the history of the State to have a dedicated Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. <\/p>  <p>  I commend the hard-working staff within child care services throughout the country.

I would be surprised if similar aspirations were not expressed by Fine Gael in opposition and also by Opposition parties when Fianna F&aacute;il was in power at the height of the economic boom.  Yet with all the surplus that was available then, Fianna F&aacute;il made very little progress in implementing these objectives.  In fact, the opposite was the case because of the mishandling of the economy.  This allowed very little scope for this Government to implement these objectives.  Despite this, some progress has been made and this Government spends more than &euro;0.25 billion a year on improving child care facilities.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, along with every Deputy, is very conscious of the high costs of child care.  We currently spend 0.2% of GDP on child care when the European average is 0.7% of GDP.  For some young couples it is as costly as their mortgage and this can even prevent one partner from returning to work.  The evidence shows that in most cases this happens to be the woman.  While young girls are achieving huge results in third level education this is being lost in the economy and, as a result, the economy is suffering.  There is a social argument for making child care more affordable.  The more people at work, the most taxation is available for spending and investing in infrastructure and personnel resources.  More importantly, there are huge long-term advantages for the economy and society generally.<\/p>  <p>  We know that many of the difficulties children and young people face can be traced back to their early years.  We also know that, without question, the returns to investment in child care are maximised when investment is directed towards the early years.  Last year the Government produced a policy document called Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the national policy framework for children and young people 2014-20.  This is a specific commitment to continue to increase investment in high quality early years care and education for all children with a special emphasis on low income families.  Everyone accepts that there is a long way to go and huge investment is needed.  This must be achieved by a combination of public and private investment.<\/p>  <p>  Building the equality of provision is critically important in realising better outcomes for children.  This will include higher capitation rates to providers who employ staff with higher qualifications.  As the Minister will be aware, a valuation Bill will be introduced in the House on Thursday.  The Minister of State, Deputy Harris, introduced an amendment to that Bill in the Seanad, which will mean that rates will no longer be payable by child care facilities that are run on a not for profit basis.  I mention two examples in my constituency, one in Boherbue and one in Banteer, which are an ideal example of such facilities.  Children are dropped off at 7 a.m.  The facilities are fantastic and are run by the community.  One of the facilities is next door to the national school.  It needs more investment because 278 people use that facility.  It needs capital investment to expand it as the demand for it is very high and the facility is very good.  I would like to see more of those developments around the country.  Such facilities are a very welcome development.<\/p>  <p>  The motion before the House calls on the Government to provide tax breaks for working families, to provide a second full free preschool year, and to introduce an agreed standard payscale for child care workers which would include statutory holiday pay.  All these objectives are clearly laid out in the Government's policy document Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.

It is for these reasons that child care providers shoulder an enormous responsibility, but do we value the role of child care providers enough?

It does not reflect the hard work and large responsibility that is placed on the child care sector.  Often people are paid the minimum wage or a little above it at the rate of approximately &euro;11 per hour.  A minimum FETAC qualification has been introduced which will come in to place from next September.  I welcome the emphasis on standards and quality.  However, with the low pay and emphasis on further qualification, we may be discouraging some people from entering the sector.  We need to restore confidence in those students and prove that it is a sustainable and rewarding sector to enter.<\/p>  <p>  Let us not forget that we have undergone unprecedented difficulties in our country.  There are almost 260,000 households with a child under the age of five.  That is high compared with other EU countries.  This year the Government will also invest almost &euro;260 million in a range of child care services as well as in the provision of children's allowance which is paid monthly.  The free preschool year introduced in 2010 was a welcome and innovative step.  Almost 68,000 children avail of it.  This and other schemes introduced by the Government are testament to our quality child care agenda but we need to do more.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider extending and introducing a second free preschool year.  This would offer a welcome reprieve to parents.<\/p>  <p>  Child care provision is a nationwide problem.  It is the single biggest cost facing families.  It costs on average &euro;16,000 per year in Dublin for two children to be minded.  Many pay more for child care than they do on a mortgage and parents are under pressure.  We all know that child care costs in Ireland are among the highest in Europe.<\/p><p>It is time to stop accepting this as the <i>status quo<\/i>and find solutions to the problem.<br\/><br\/>I would also like to emphasise the difficulties that children with disabilities face in accessing the free preschool year.  Extra resources are not always provided and prevent children with disabilities from availing of the year.  It is something that needs to be addressed.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the establishment of the cross-departmental group, but it must not be another talking shop.  It needs to develop real solutions and suggestions.  There are missed opportunities in areas of after-school care.<br\/><br\/>When I was principal of a primary school with more than 600 pupils, we introduced an after-school club which provided on-site child care with qualified child care workers.  The programme has gone from strength to strength in the school.  The children are supervised in a fun and safe environment and the hassle of transferring children from school to an off-site after-school child care facility has been eliminated.  This could be done in each of our primary schools throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100058#GGG00700","speaker":"1004","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423680300,"counter":652,"content":"<p>I also welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Everybody agrees that children are the future of our country.  With all that we know now about educational development and giving them the best start, it is known that the younger we start to provide educational stimulation and a certain type of care and encouragement to children, the more they can realise their potential in the future and at other stages of education as they progress into primary, secondary and third level education and be well-rounded citizens.<br\/><br\/>As many people have said, until recent years child care was very <i>ad hoc<\/i>and hit and miss.  One of the new portfolios introduced by the Government was that of Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, in recognition of the importance of the very young children in our society.  I acknowledge the &euro;260 million which is spent each year to support early childhood care and education through the various programmes in place.  It differs very much from what we see in primary and secondary schools, in other areas of education and in the care of our children in that much of it has been delivered by those working in the private sector.  Very often they, with assistance from the State, spend money on buildings, ensure they comply with regulations and work with the HSE to make sure that standards are being constantly adhered to.  There are also community providers.  It is a very dynamic area.  Private service providers in my county want to ensure the very best standards, quality, care and education are offered to the children with whom they deal and are keen to work with the authorities on regulations and standards.  This should always be encouraged, as such providers have significant financial and work related stakes in this area.<br\/><br\/>As has been alluded to, however, there are difficulties.  Some cases have been brought to my attention recently where couples or individuals have to think twice before they have a child.  If people are working and have a second child, the cost of child care can be prohibitive in terms of allowing women, for the most part, to return to work.  This issue enters into the decision-making process of whether people have children, which is quite a serious thing to say.  There are now all sorts of families in existence which have children who grow up and flourish, but the nuclear family is declining in number in our society.<br\/><br\/>Points have been made about the level of investment in child care and its cost.  We spend 0.2% of GDP on it, compared with the European average of 0.7%, and this shows us that we need to do more, invest more and ensure that standards are uniform, not just in one area but throughout the country.  If that is done, we can all rest assured that standards are being universally applied and children are being looked after in the right way.<br\/><br\/>There needs to be support for parents and we need to realise these are very pressing times.  We do not want to see children being put at a disadvantage or losing out on opportunities and parents not being able to return to work because of this issue.  I welcome the measure announced in the previous budget whereby people could retain some of the dependent child aspect of their social welfare payments if they returned to work.  More of these supports are required, and that is the reality that will bite in terms of what we want to see happen with child care in the future.<br\/><br\/>I understand that the average wage of people working in the child care sector, some of whom are very highly educated and have spent a lot of time studying education, is &euro;11 per hour.  It would seem that although we want standards to be maintained, we need to realise we need to pay for that.<br\/><br\/>I am very hopeful that the matter will be addressed because the commitment is in place.  There are many child care support programmes and supports in communities.  I welcome in particular the cross-departmental group, which is examining how we will invest in child care services and what the sector will look like.  The fact that it is cross-departmental and under the watch of the Minister means that everybody has a stake in it.  The care of children transcends any one Department.<br\/><br\/>What is most crucial is that those we expect to do the job, namely, child care service providers, are an intrinsic part of how we decide to proceed.  They have in mind the best outcomes for the children they look after and have some fantastic ideas.  I would encourage the communication and consultation which is taking place to continue.  I want us to move towards having the kind of child care service we need in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100059#HHH00200","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1423680300,"counter":653,"content":"<p>Like many others, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I used child care for our children.  Having facilities as good as they are today allowed us to work.  Had they not been available, our careers would have been in trouble.<\/p>  <p>  Many people are sending children to school too early.  Preschool is very important.  Child care does not mean just childminding.  The people who work in the sector are early educators and will intervene at an early stage if there are issues in terms of speech or other matters.  Sometimes they spot issues at an early stage, before others do, and they can then be dealt with successfully.<\/p>  <p>  I discussed this issue with many people in our area.  One woman told me she has been working in the sector for 30 years and has a very good school.  She has level 6 Montessori qualifications and FETAC level 6.  However, she does not qualify for the higher capitation grant.  This is unfair because someone who has been in business in the sector for 30 years, who loves the work and has a high level of qualifications should have qualified for the higher capitation grant under a so-called grandfather clause.  The rules are unfair to the people who have carried the industry to its current point and made it as successful as it is.<\/p>  <p>  On the inspection of premises, I have received feedback that inspections are varied.  It seems that one inspector shows preference for some items over another and when there is a change in inspectors, there is a change in emphasis.  We need to have greater standardisation in inspections in order that people are moving on a common path and are not subject to the whims of someone's opinion.  I would also like to broaden the type of people who can conduct inspections.  From what I understand, it is mainly public health nurses who are involved.<\/p><p>Perhaps we should open it more broadly to others with degrees or qualifications in the area.  We must recognise people in the child care professions as professionals.  They do great jobs and it is unfair of people just to see it as child care.  We have a fabulous education system right from the start.  As I mentioned, these people allow us to continue our careers.<\/p> <p> For many people, child care is something that is required for a very short period but it is quite a financial burden.  I encourage the Minister to consider a second free preschool year, which could be very valuable.  It would send out all the right signals.  We should remember that we must encourage people to have families because a birth rate that is suitable for the country will ensure that the elderly population can be catered for in time.  We need a strong population and many countries are failing to have a large enough population to provide the resources required for elderly people in the years to come.  There are children who are graduates of these facilities and I wish them well.<\/p> <p> I commend the current Minister and his predecessor on the work done in this new Department.  They have really put a strong stamp on it.  This Government is serious about children.  I wish the Minister well in his continued work in the role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100059#HHH00300","speaker":"980","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423680900,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the motion.  Much of what I want to say has been said before.  There have been many calls for a second preschool year and there is no doubt that the first free preschool year has been a fantastic success.  We also need to question what parents would get from a second preschool year.  I have spoken to a number of parents and although they would welcome it, as it helps with the financial burden, sometimes we make the mistake in this country of thinking a child's life starts when he or she goes to school at the age of five; so much of what goes on in their lives has already gone past them at that stage.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Barry has already mentioned that if there is a learning or intellectual disability, it can sometimes be picked up at a very early age.  If a child needs an occupational therapist or any other support, the request could be made to the Department of Health.  We sometimes lack some joined-up thinking in getting Departments to communicate.  We have some very well qualified people doing these jobs in child care, but they are paid quite poorly, despite having degrees and qualifications.  I am not sure where the priority is placed with respect to child care.<\/p>  <p>  I know that &euro;260 million is spent across a range of areas, and one area that should be examined is child benefit.  I am still not completely sure why we pay child benefit to people who simply do not need it.  Why can it not be means-tested?  The money can be taken from those who can afford child care, although I will not set an income level, as that would get me into trouble.  Perhaps a system could be devised where more money could be taken from those who can well afford child care and put through the system.  I am not sure why this cannot be done, as it would lead to a much fairer system.<\/p>  <p>  We must examine how the process comes together.  A child who is one or two years old will not be put in this kind of child care facility.  There are more places working with local national schools and child care facilities so that children can be taken at 8 a.m. or 9 a.m. and collected at 6 p.m.  It is becoming the norm.  In rural areas this can be difficult, as there might not be a big population.  It is important to spread these services right across the country.<\/p>  <p>  There is a lack of men involved with child care.  I was contacted by one individual who attended a number of conferences dealing with child care.  He was the only man who turned up and people seemed to think he had alternative motives for being there, although he just wanted to take up a career in child care.  Surely the area should be open to both men and women so that we can create a more balanced society.  Even when this man applies for jobs, he does not feel he is getting appropriate credit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100060#JJJ00200","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speech","time":1423680900,"counter":656,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute to this debate on child care.  Participation in high-quality childhood care and education results in better outcomes for children.  Access to affordable high-quality care for younger and school-going children is essential for development and future opportunities in education and training and, afterwards, in occupations.  Research in 2013 indicated that 77% of preschool children are cared for by parents or relatives and 12% by childminders, with 19% cared for in cr&egrave;ches, Montessori schools etc.  Society has changed dramatically in recent decades, and most young parents do not have the choice of staying in the home to rear their families, as financial demands cannot be met unless both parents are working.  There is no choice in these cases.<\/p>  <p>  There is &euro;175 million in funding for the ECCE scheme, which benefits 68,000 children each year.  This provides a free year of early childhood care and education for children of preschool age.  In general, children are eligible for the scheme if they are between three years and two months and fours years and seven months on 1 September for each year that they start.  The State pays a capitation fee to participating playschools and day-care services.  In return, they provide a preschool service free of charge to all children within the qualifying age range for a set number of hours over a set period.  In general, children only qualify for ECCE for one school year, but a child assessed as having a disability may be able to spread the free preschool time over two years.  The intention behind ECCE is to intervene before primary school in order to develop a child's education, self-esteem and communication skills.  The introduction of a second preschool year would be of benefit and, as others have stated, the Minister should consider its introduction.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that accessibility to affordable and high-quality child care can play a critical role in achieving a number of the Government's priorities, including the improvement of educational outcomes for children, reducing poverty and increasing parents' participation in the labour market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100060#JJJ00300","speaker":"1056"},{"type":"speech","time":1423680900,"counter":657,"content":"<p>This debate is long overdue, as we are coming from behind in this area, with our neighbours and those further afield having child care systems that exceed ours.  For a variety of reasons, we are playing catch-up.  A report entitled Childcare: Business or Profession? was introduced by the Minister at the end of last year.  The research was done by an umbrella group called Start Strong, which is a very good name in the context of a debate on early education and care for children.  The report argues that if we focus on the elements of early education and care, with children at the centre, we can make some progress.  That is why the debate is very important.  The report refers to the models we use and argues that the only expertise we have comes from the example of other jurisdictions with care facilities for children which are of a good standard.  It is the model that we should aspire to, and there is nothing wrong with that goal.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we acknowledge the great commitment of child care workers.

Indeed, it has been pointed out that child care costs are higher than mortgage repayments.  If a person or family must juggle both a mortgage and child care costs, it is a very hard task.  I have seen research which shows that an average family with two children spends 40% of their wages on child care costs.  That is a large amount of money, but successive Governments have ignored the issue and not dealt with it.  I hope the current Minister will.  Families are now caught in the trap of one parent having to return to work and one parent having to stay at home because of huge child care fees, as it often makes more financial sense not to pay those fees.<\/p>  <p>  I support what has been proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il to support parents who return to work, including a child care subsidy for families who are above the family income supplement threshold.  That threshold is quite low.  I have encountered families where the carer's benefit was paid to mothers where there might be a child with a disability in the family.  This has been paid continuously over two years or perhaps over a longer number of years if there is a break in the carer's payment.  For example, it might be required only during the children's holiday period.  It would be helpful if there was a discussion with employers about improving that scenario.  With some creativity and ingenuity on the part of employers and workers, there could be a better scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I was interested in the report of the expert advisory group on the early years strategy, which was published in September 2013.  It identified ten themes.  These would make a significant contribution to the development of a holistic early years strategy.  The report highlights that Ireland spends 0.4% of GDP on early childhood care and education services compared to the OECD average of 0.7% of GDP.  The group proposed that Ireland should achieve the international benchmark of 1% of GDP.<\/p>  <p>  I was also interested in a reply Deputy Sean Fleming received today from the Minister regarding the costing of proposals for child care, paid paternity leave and compensation for small businesses for increases in the minimum wage.  These areas have been examined by various Ministers.  It was interesting to see that the Minister said the matter is being examined.  It is a question of bringing Ministers and Departments together.  He said the matter has not been resolved but that the issues are being considered by the various Ministers in the context of their departmental missions and goals.  Obviously, that is an area where we must get full information to assess exactly what costs are involved in all of these schemes.<\/p>  <p>  The expert advisory group report also discussed the main child care initiative in the State, the free preschool year in early childhood care and education.  This was provided to 68,000 children at a cost of &euro;175 million in 2014.  The Revised Estimates for 2015 indicate the funding will be reduced to &euro;172.5 million.  We must examine the funding in that area.  Capitation rates for children availing of early childhood care was reduced in budget 2012 from &euro;64.50 to &euro;62.50 per child.  Again, this area must be examined.<\/p>  <p>  My final point relates to the Indecon report on child care in Donegal.  It has an analysis of the cost of child care and reports that the average weekly expenditure on paid child care for one preschool child rose from &euro;118 per week in 2007 to &euro;133 per week in 2013, while the average weekly expenditure on paid child care for one primary school child rose from &euro;72 per week to &euro;81 per week over the same period.  It is certainly an expensive operation.  We must ensure that all the supports we can provide are provided for hard working families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100061#KKK00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1423681500,"counter":660,"content":"<p>I appreciate the opportunity to make a brief contribution on this most important motion tabled by Deputy Troy.  Child care is extremely important for our children's livelihood.  The current situation is forcing some people to consider leaving the workforce to look after their children and ease their financial burden.  All citizens of this State should be able to work and provide for their family.<\/p>  <p>  There are approximately 4,300 child care centres in Ireland and the number of staff employed in the child care sector is approximately 23,000, which is a substantial figure.  There are 405,000 households in Ireland with children under ten years of age, of which 266,000 households have children under five years of age.  The birth rate in Ireland is the highest in the EU and the projections suggest growth in the number of children under five years of age in the period to 2016.  The number of children of less than five years of age will increase between 2011 and 2016 by approximately 4%.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of child care in Ireland is a significant burden on families.  As Deputy Kitt mentioned, an Indecon survey carried out for Donegal County Childcare Committee in November 2013 estimated the annual cost of full-time child care for two children at &euro;16,500 per year.  The cost of child care in this country is the second most costly in the OECD in net terms as a percentage of wages and for lone parents the average cost of child care is estimated to be approximately 45% of average wages.<\/p>  <p>  This must be looked at again.  Parents need more support from the Government.  As at census 2011, there were 25,426 households with children in Louth.  Child care is one of the most expensive costs of living.  People are suffering and they need help immediately.  A National Consumer Agency child care price survey in 2011 found that the average cost of full-time care for a toddler was &euro;181 per week, ranging from &euro;145 to &euro;220 per week across services nationally.  This represents an average of over &euro;9,000 per year.  How families who are paying all of these bills expect to live, when child care costs are crippling people's budgets, is beyond me.  Child care costs can exceed mortgage repayments as the largest monthly bill for families with young children.  This increased strain means thousands of working parents, particularly mothers, face the stark choice of quitting work because of the high cost of child care or continuing their careers while losing money.<\/p>  <p>  Incremental upward investment in early childhood care and education is essential if there is to be any real change in the quality of early childhood education within Ireland's early childhood services.  Real change is needed immediately.  The Government must be proactive, not just reactive.  While the free preschool year was a positive step forward, quality across early childhood services remains variable.  Measures to improve quality have been largely focused on the free preschool year and on increasing regulation, with almost no support for the development of quality services for children under three years of age.<\/p><p>We therefore believe that an increased investment from the current 0.4% of GDP to 0.7%, on an incremental basis within the lifetime of the next programme for Government, will be required to make progress and increase quality standards in early childhood care and education.  Parents need to earn up to &euro;30,000 a year just to fund the cost of child care for two children.  A survey by the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>shows that it costs up to &euro;1,150 per month for a cr&egrave;che place for a baby.  For a baby and a toddler, the cost can rise to as high as more than &euro;2,000 per month.  Early childhood is the most important time for public investment in human capital.  Children's early years should be protected from the austerity cuts.  Public support for child care services should be linked to work-life balance policies and the timing of parental leave to ensure a continuation of support without gaps.  The quality of child care is critical to the promotion of child development.<br\/><br\/>I am pleased to have had the opportunity to make a brief contribution in support of this motion on something which is vitally important for the country, both now and in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100061#KKK00300","speaker":"945","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423682100,"counter":662,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Robert Troy for putting forward this motion, which is positive and focused on solutions.  Given that children are undoubtedly our most precious asset, debating their welfare, protection and development should be a priority in this House.  I therefore very much welcome this debate.<\/p>  <p>  As other speakers have stated, the reality for many families is that both parents must go out to work and the cost of child care is therefore unavoidable.  The child care sector is not homogenous.  People use a variety of informal arrangements.  These include arrangements with grandparents, friends and childminders.  There is also the regulated sector.  People are using a combination of these options.<\/p>  <p>  The area requires urgent attention.  The introduction of the free preschool year in 2010 has been transformative.  It means that the resources are guaranteed to be going to the child.  This is a much better way of spending the annual net benefit of approximately &euro;2,500 per annum rather than, for example, by increasing child benefit by that amount.  It ensures that before going to school, every child undergoes a standardised curriculum for one year.  This is one of the key benefits.  For that year, every child is treated equally.  We must listen to the sector on the issues surrounding the free preschool year and the capitation rate as we seek to move towards expanding the year to, it is hoped, a second full year.  Expanding this hugely successful scheme into a second full year must be our objective.<\/p>  <p>  The right place to start is with children who have special needs.  Currently these children are often denied the opportunity of availing of the free preschool year.  The reality faced by their parents is that many children with special needs are not able to attend a mainstream preschool class.  Alternatives are available, such as a home tuition grant.  There may also be a place available in a dedicated preschool for children with special needs.  However, when people avail of home tuition, the home tutor may accompany the child with special needs to a mainstream preschool place but the parents must pay for the place.  The parents will only get the support once from the State in the form of home tuition.  This is a very real issue for parents with children with special needs and it should be attended to urgently.<\/p>  <p>  As highlighted by Deputy Troy, the community child care subvention programme is vitally important.  Access to this subvention programme is very uneven and patchy.  I have come across cases where mothers, in particular, in low-income households were hoping to go back to work but were unable to do so because of the cost of child care and the lack of a place in a preschool where a subvention was available.  This issue must be addressed.  A person's address should not determine whether he or she has access to a subsidised child care place.  It should be determined by a person's income and his or her ability to pay.  This is where we need to move to in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Staff working in the sector do an extremely difficult job.  I am sure they work harder than any Deputy in this House.  They are doing important work for all of us as parents.  When one considers the role they play in protecting and minding our children, their pay is paltry.  The responsibility they face day to day is immense and they should be awarded appropriately.  This issue needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Maloney touched on the possible unfairness of going down the road of a tax credit.  There must be a multi-pronged approach to the issue of child care costs.  We must help people on low incomes who are seeking to get back into the workforce by providing subsidised child care.  We must also consider the person, the mother in particular, who has a good job and an income of &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 but who faces child care costs of &euro;1,000 per month.  This is &euro;12,000 per year.  If on the higher rate of tax, she will have to earn double this amount.  She will need to earn &euro;24,000 per year to pay for child care.  The supports we introduce and the way we reform the system cannot exclude this large swathe of people in middle-income Ireland.  These people invariably have the largest mortgages as well.  These people cannot be excluded from the supports being made available.  I do not see a better way to support them in terms of the child care costs they face than through the tax system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100062#LLL00200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1423682100,"counter":663,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Troy on placing this important motion before the House.

We must look at the societal impact it has and the reasons families are on a consistent treadmill of paying bills and meeting mortgage repayments.  Two people in the family are being forced to work.

This is the kernel of all the problems.  People are slaves to bricks and mortar.  They are committed to a mortgage for 25 years.  A huge portion of their income is going towards putting a roof over their heads.  To fund the mortgage, two people must work.  They then find themselves in a child care trap.  They have to afford both child care and a mortgage.  As a society, we need to have an open debate and examine how we address the issue of people being akin to slaves to a system which does not benefit parents, children or broader society or us collectively as a nation.  We must address this key area.<\/p>  <p>  Professor Honohan of the Central Bank came forward with proposals with regard to putting the brakes on the inflationary pressures in the housing market.  Anything which brings this about is welcome.  However, there are also downsides to what was proposed, for instance, for first-time buyers trying to get on the property ladder.  However, the broader issue is that everyone pursues inflationary policies of expensive houses.  We have to look at this issue.  We are a population of 4.3 million.  We are not a densely populated country.  There is lots of space available.  We must try to adjust our housing policy to ensure that people have more of their disposable income to invest in their children, education and time with each other.  As time goes on, this will benefit society.  The idea that children have to be dragged out of bed at 6 o'clock in the morning and herded into the back of a car to be dropped off at child care in darkness with rain hopping off their heads, not to be seen by their parents again until 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock in the evening, cannot be good for parents, children or society.<\/p><p>Deputy Troy has come up with various proposals, relating for example to a second free preschool year, tax credits and supports for the community child care subvention schemes, to try to address this issue.  All of this results from another obvious problem.  The key problem that is forcing parents into the perpetual treadmill-racing they have to do is that it costs too much to buy a house in this country.  They have to pay a mortgage on their house and another mortgage to put their children into child care.  This must be addressed so that parents can choose between continuing to develop themselves in the professional environment of the workplace and staying at home.  That needs to be an affordable option as well.  I honestly believe what we are doing to the children of this country at present will almost be a scar on our society in the years ahead.  It is simply wrong in many ways.  We need to rebalance and refocus in this regard.<\/p> <p> As there are 23,000 people working in child care, which is the subject of this motion, it can be said to be an industry in itself.  Much of it is regulated.  Obviously, child care is provided to a large proportion of children in the unregulated sector.  I refer, for example, to children who are dropped down to a neighbour in return for a bit of cash at the end of the week.  We all know that these things happen in society because people have to make the choices that are in their own best interests.  I think the introduction of a second free preschool year would be a major step towards alleviating the financial and other pressures that are faced by families.  As Deputy Michael McGrath said, the provision of a child care place is a direct support for the child and a step towards the formal education process.  There should be a more seamless transition from preschool to the formal educational setting of school itself.  While this obviously depends on resources, it should be a priority.  We cannot put this issue on the long finger or kick the can down the road in this regard.  Today's children are the young adults of tomorrow.  That is the continuum through life.  The impact of early childhood supports is clear for everybody to see in the statistics and empirical evidence from surveys and studies of human behaviour.  I have already referred to two cohorts of people.  Many people are funding huge mortgages because they had no choice.  They were coming of an age when they had to buy a house and that was basically it.  It was not as if they wanted a swanky verandah and a jacuzzi.  They just needed a house, but it was a very expensive house.  They had no choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100062#LLL00300","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423682700,"counter":665,"content":"<p>I agree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100063#MMM00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1423682700,"counter":666,"content":"<p>As the Minister of State lives in the commuter belt, he should know about the pressures that families are clearly under.  We have to address another cohort of people as well.  I refer to people in the lower income brackets who are in a trap.  We are talking about giving people choices that allow them to develop professionally.  The difficulty for women, in particular, who want to go back into the workplace is that the prohibitive cost of child care is preventing them from doing so.  We need to streamline the community child care subvention scheme and ensure it is nationally available so that people can go back into the workplace.  Opportunities will increase as the economy picks up and there is a demand for people to come into employment.  That is a key area for people who are on low pay and are continuing to face the trap to which I refer.  Our efforts have to be directed and targeted at such people.  The two cohorts I have mentioned need to be addressed for differing reasons.  I have spoken about people with huge mortgages, who need to get on the treadmill at 6 a.m. every day, dropping kids at cr&egrave;ches all over the place across the countryside, in order to fund those mortgages.  I have also referred to those who need support to get out of the trap that is preventing them from going from welfare to work and for whom the cost of child care is prohibitive.<\/p>  <p>  We have to prioritise this issue.  I know there is always huge pressure on budgets, finances and Government expenditure in general.  This would not just be an investment for today - it would be an investment for tomorrow and for the generations ahead.  I have mentioned the evidence-based research which shows that early interventions and supports are good for individuals, for families and collectively for the country as a whole.  Regardless of whether this motion is agreed or rejected, at least it has brought some solution-based ideas to the floor of the D&aacute;il for discussion.  We cannot allow this issue to slide off the agenda.  When we talk about the economy, growth and employment, we must also take account of societal issues and the impact of policies on the development of individuals and collectively.  That debate is being lost at present because there is a consistent focus on the latest OECD figures and Exchequer returns etc.  We need to keep a focus on where we prioritise our resources.  Certainly, the extension of the free preschool year and the community child care subvention scheme is critical in the context of child care.  They relate to two areas where people are trapped.  People on low incomes are unable to move from welfare to work.  People are funding exorbitant mortgages through no fault of their own because they simply want to put a roof over their head.  I commend the motion.  I hope the Minister looks on what we have proposed in a favourable way.  I hope our proposals will be taken into account in the context of framing future budgets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100063#MMM00300","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1423682700,"counter":667,"content":"<p>This is an opportune time to have a detailed debate on the further development of the child care sector.  I commend our party spokesperson, Deputy Troy, on the very considered, comprehensive and positive Private Members' motion that is before us.  The motion encompasses all aspects of child care.  It emphasises the importance and value of the sector, the commitment of the child care providers and their staff, the willingness of the vast majority of employees to participate in upskilling - continuous education, in effect - and the welcome development over the past 16 to 17 years, in particular, of modern facilities in urban and rural areas throughout the country.  The motion refers to the welcome mix of community, public and private provision in 4,300 centres across the State and rightly and accurately reflects the serious concerns of many families about the high level of child care costs.<\/p>  <p>  I am familiar with this sector, particularly in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  I am aware of the concerns of people in the private and community sectors.  Fortunately, there is a good mix in the model of provision in my constituency.  Good leadership has been shown in many communities throughout the country to source public funding to develop child care facilities.  This development is complementary to the development of facilities by private providers.  There was very little child care provision in my own county right up to the early 2000s.  Indeed, the number of child care facilities that existed in the county until greater investment was made from the late 1990s onwards could be very quickly counted.  In many communities where there was no private provision, good community activists, predominantly women, worked very hard to ensure they were in a position to draw down good State funding to develop the most modern facilities.  I am sure Deputies on all sides of the House had an opportunity to work with many of those groups.  I was very glad to have such an opportunity.  Excellent work was done in many areas.  In my constituency, I had the privilege of working with groups which sourced funding under the community sector provision in many areas, including Bailieborough, Cootehill, Ballyjamesduff and Belturbet in County Cavan and Scotstown, Latton and Carrickmacross in County Monaghan.  I recently visited the child care centre in Tullacmongan resource centre in Cavan town.<\/p><p>I met its board of management, its day-to-day management and its staff.  I have been familiar with the project since its inception.  Many of the people I met that evening had been there from the start when they set about sourcing a site and public funding to develop the facility.  They show the same enthusiasm today for ensuring that the best possible care is provided to the children attending the centre.<\/p> <p> The centre is in the heart of a large local authority estate in Cavan town.  It is run excellently, has committed staff and provides a range of child care services, including full day care and afterschool provision.  The project was spearheaded by a former local councillor, Ms Patricia Walsh, a committed and diligent worker in the community.  Along with many others, predominantly women, she has given great leadership by ensuring an excellent service.  Having attended county child care awards events, I have seen many of the staff obtaining further FETAC certifications each year.  Surely those who gain extra skills deserve proper remuneration for their work.  They participate on courses on what is practically an ongoing basis.  They have shown commitment, hard work and diligence.<\/p> <p> We need further investment in early childhood care and education, ECCE.  Our party spokesperson and other colleagues outlined the substantial burden that has been placed on many families.  They need extra financial support, as does the sector.  Many private and community facilities will find it difficult to remain viable if additional financial support is not provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100063#MMM00400","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423683300,"counter":669,"content":"<p>I am sorry, Deputy, but we are over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100064#NNN00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1423683300,"counter":670,"content":"<p>The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly, has welcomed the opportunity to address the concerns raised by Deputies and to outline in detail the many positive developments in the provision of preschool care and education.

As a number of colleagues have mentioned, it is also important for those stuck with high mortgages.  Indeed, they are very high where I live in County Meath, Navan and the towns in the Dublin region.  However, it is not the case that people are slaves to bricks and mortars.  I was surprised by Deputy Kelleher's comment.  Rather, they are stuck with high mortgages because a previous Government failed them.

Every Deputy agrees that this is not nearly enough and everyone would like to see more, but the money is just not there.  Maintaining the current level has been difficult in light of the budgetary pressures that have prevailed in each of the past four years, but it has been.  We know why the budgets are under pressure - other Governments did not do their jobs properly.<\/p>  <p>  To address the needs of parents returning to the workforce, a number of labour activation measures have been introduced by the Minister, Deputy Reilly's Department in collaboration with the Minister for Social Protection.  These are key measures at this time, given the substantial rebound in the economy and improved employment opportunities.  The afterschool programme, for example, means that parents of school-going children taking up employment are able to avail of affordable care for that crucial period after school ends and before the working day concludes.  It is also fair to say that, without the Government's firm commitment in supporting the child care sector, many child care services would not have been sustainable and many jobs would have been lost across the sector in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of affordability is a still a major worry for many parents.  There are calls, including from the Association of Childhood Professionals, for an increase in State investment.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, favours further investment when resources become available.  It is not a case of letting the issue slide.  In fact, the Minister has emphasised that future investment in child care must be evidence-based and strategically co-ordinated.  It is for this reason that he has established an interdepartmental group to develop a whole-of-Government approach to future child care investment.  It is to report in a number of months and will include representation from my Department, which works closely with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on issues relating to early years.<\/p>  <p>  The commitment to improving the quality of ECCE for all children has been a key focus of the Departments of Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs for a number of years through successive Governments.  We will continue that commitment.  The quality and curriculum frameworks for children aged nought to six years of age, S&iacute;olta agus Aistear, were developed under the remit of my Department and are regarded internationally as high-quality frameworks to underpin working with children.  A comprehensive preschool quality agenda that aims to improve quality standards in preschool services is being progressed and number of key areas have been identified as requiring urgent reform.<\/p>  <p>  The recent decision to introduce education-focused inspections to examine the quality of educational provision in early childhood settings that provide the free preschool year is a positive development.  The opportunity for child care to engage with inspectors who have expertise in the area of early childhood education will contribute significantly to improving the quality of the learning experience for young children.  Everyone has referred to the quality.  It is essential.  This development will complement the decision to appoint 30 graduates in ECCE, who will work directly with services to improve quality in the provision of quality child care services.  Every Deputy agrees that it is a question of how best to improve quality.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Troy has received many compliments on the solutions the motion has suggested.  They are worthy and many of us like them, but Fianna F&aacute;il is proposing significant increases in spending because the proposals require money.  Indeed, Fianna F&aacute;il's proposals go far beyond what it was prepared to spend while in government.  As is always the case, it does not mention from where the money will come.  I examined Fianna F&aacute;il's pre-budget submission.  The party's call to increase investment to the OECD average would cost approximately &euro;450 million extra each year.  A second free preschool year would cost approximately &euro;175 million.  The proposals on the community child care subvention scheme would cost a further &euro;150 million.  If we include the tax relief for which Fianna F&aacute;il is also calling and which evidence shows does not reduce costs to parents or increase pay to staff, we will not be far short of &euro;1 billion in extra spending.  This would have been difficult in the midst of the Celtic tiger and Fianna F&aacute;il convinced us that there was an endless pot of cash to spend.  Of course, that was just an illusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100064#NNN00500","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1423683300,"counter":673,"content":"<p>Fine Gael was promising more than us at the previous elections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100064#NNN00600","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1423683300,"counter":674,"content":"<p>What about the road tax?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100064#NNN00700","speaker":"1188"},{"type":"speech","time":1423683300,"counter":675,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il did not know how to manage the finances when it was in power and has certainly not learned its lesson.

As the Minister of State pointed out, the motion proposes solutions and a clear direction to take if we are to address the issues with child care provision, including its cost.<\/p>  <p>  An in-depth study was commissioned by Donegal County Childcare Committee Limited, DCCC, and conducted by Indecon.  According to that research, the economic benefit of every &euro;1 spent by the Government on introducing and supporting child care is &euro;1.17.  Although initial funding would need to be provided, the knock-on effects in the economy would be worthwhile.<\/p>  <p>  The cost to a family of having two children in child care is estimated to be approximately &euro;16,500.  Be it a one or two-parent family, this presents a barrier to continuing in the workforce for one parent.  That &euro;16,500 after tax is above many people's total income.  It is no wonder that costs have led to many parents choosing who will give up work and stay at home against his or her wishes.  For single-parent families, working is not even an option in the majority of cases.<\/p><p>The suggestions put forward by Deputy Troy on the need for tax credits to assist in reducing that cost are the way forward.  <\/p> <p> As regards current preschool services that are available, including child care places, it is important to note the impact made as a result of the introduction of a free preschool year by the previous Government.  That has made a real difference not only in assisting families with child care, but also in progressing child development and starting a child's education early.  Primary schoolteachers say it has made a real difference to pupils when they enter the primary school system.  That emphasises the point that further investment in preschool services makes a lot of sense.  Research evidence proves that the earlier one provides education to children, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, the higher the impact on them.  It leads to a reduction in later interventions in those children's lives.  It therefore makes a lot of sense not just to provide further assistance to families through child care, but also to invest in quality preschool services.  That will ensure that children will get a better start earlier than has been the case in the past.<\/p> <p> We should put in place a programme to upskill those working in the early childhood education sector.  It is a nascent sector which has developed quickly over the past three to four years.  To a large extent, qualifications among the workforce are at the lower level, so a lot of investment in education needs to be made in developing that situation.  There is a curriculum in Aistear and a quality programme in S&iacute;olta into which the Department should put more resources.  A key element is to assist child care providers by providing a further education and training programme to those working in the sector.  That would bear fruit with real development and progress being made in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100064#NNN01400","speaker":"999","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423683900,"counter":683,"content":"<p>I thank Members from across the House for contributing to the debate on this critically important issue.  I apologise for missing some of the debate last night, but I had an opportunity to look over the contributions in the Official Report today.  I am glad that Fianna F&aacute;il used its Private Members' time to ensure, for only the second time in the lifetime of this Government, a substantial debate on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that the Private Members' motion calls for a lot.  I would not expect any government, nor would it be possible for it to do so, to implement all the policies at once.  The 0.7% of GDP includes the cost of the second preschool year and extending the community child care supplement.  I am not asking for those things in addition because they are included.  Having said that, however, it is a lot of money.<\/p>  <p>  This motion outlines our aspirations for the child care sector, which could be dealt with incrementally.  It is disappointing to listen to some Government Deputies - not all of them because some were positive - condemning us for seeking to prioritise additional investment in this area.  In the absence of the publication of the early years strategy, something this Government promised in 2012, we do not know how the Government wishes to see this crucial area being developed in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  I was amazed that last night, after four years in office, the Minister said it is crucial to develop a coherent whole-of-government approach to investment in child care services.  I thought one of the advantages of having a senior Minister with this responsibility at the Cabinet table was to ensure that there would always would be a whole-of-government approach.  We know this approach is not working, however, because the CSO figures published some weeks ago said that the number of children living in consistent poverty had risen from 10% in 2012 to 12% in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100065#OOO00200","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1423683900,"counter":684,"content":"<p>Shocking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100065#OOO00300","speaker":"1188"},{"type":"speech","time":1423683900,"counter":685,"content":"<p>They are children who are going to bed cold and hungry.  We also know that the number of people living in deprivation has increased from 13.7% in 2008 to 30.5% in 2014.  That is clear evidence that this Government's policies are not working and that it does not have a joined-up approach.<br\/><br\/>Last year, the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, launched a report recommending that maternity benefit be extended to one year.  The following week, however, the Cabinet chose to tax maternity benefit, so where is the joined-up thinking?  Where better for a child to spend the first year of their life than at home?  We should consider introducing maternity benefit incrementally up to 12 months.<br\/><br\/>We witnessed another lack of a co-ordinated approach when the Government launched a vicious attack on lone parents.  When announcing the changes, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, said they would not proceed without a full Scandinavian model that was bankable.  Instead, we got an after-school scheme.  I am surprised the Minister had the audacity to mention that in his speech last night.  That scheme talked about creating 6,000 places, but after 18 months in operation the take-up is less than 5%.  It has been an abysmal scheme which does not work.<br\/><br\/>Changes to the lone parent's allowance went ahead none the less.  Those who have been hit hardest are those who choose to work.  Meanwhile, the allowance for lone parents who cannot obtain work and for whom social welfare is their only source of income stays the same.  People who have the incentive and drive to go to work are hardest hit, and I do not think that is fair.<br\/><br\/>The Minister said it is a well-known fact that the cost of child care is like a second mortgage.  He said that is why the Government is taking it so seriously.  In his amendment to the motion, however, the Minister did not produce one proposal to address child care affordability.  After four years in office, the Government has decided to establish an interdepartmental group to look at affordability.  That group will not report back for at least six months, which is four or five months before a general election.  Then the Government will say that although it has done nothing in this area for the past five years, if re-elected, it will look at doing something in the area in the next five years.  Nobody will believe the promise of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, in that regard.<br\/><br\/>In last night's debate, the Minister seemed to dismiss the notion of tax credits for families without stating his preferred option.  Only four weeks ago, the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>had a front page spread on how the Government was introducing tax credits.  The newspaper did not pick that story off the ground.  In my opinion, that information was leaked to it by the Department.  Where is the plan now, however, and what will the Government do for middle-income earners?  They are the people who get up at 6.30 every morning, or earlier, and leave their children in day care for 12 hours.  They return at the end of the week jaded and no better off financially.  What is this Government going to do for those people?<br\/><br\/>Another cohort of people comprises the most marginalised in society.  The community child care supplement scheme, which is there to help them, is restricted.  It is only available in one third of our service providers.  What about children from less well-off families where there is no community setting?  There are no proposals to deal with them.<br\/><br\/>Some Government policies in recent years have contributed to the cost of running child care services.  A memo was sent from a service provider in County Longford advertising an increase in fees.<\/p><p>The first reason given for this increase was that up until 2011 commercial rates did not apply, but the cr&egrave;che is now subject to a substantial annual rates bill.  The second reason was the introduction of commercial water rates last year.  The third was that the introduction of the free preschool year under the ECCE scheme had resulted in a reduction in capitation in the past two years.  The fourth was that the increase in employers' PRSI had given rise to a substantial bill in 2014.  Every one of the increases to which I refer was a direct consequence of Government policy.<\/p> <p> No mention has been made of the eight-point plan.  The Minister completely failed to speak of it.  I am not surprised, because not one of the eight points contained in that plan has been implemented in full.  This is despite the fact that two years have passed since the plan was first announced.  We are still awaiting publication of the new regulations and despite the enactment - with cross-party support - of the relevant legislation in January 2014, the new registration process still has not been put in place.<\/p> <p> The 24,000 people who work in the area of child care provide an invaluable service.  These are individuals to whom we entrust the care and education of our children.  Last night the Minister acknowledged the considerable contribution of child care providers and their staff to the provision of high-quality services.  I am sure they welcome that acknowledgement.  Later, however, the Minister abdicated his responsibility when he stated \"pay levels and conditions of employment are ultimately matters for the management of these services.\"  He forgets that the main contract for these services rests with the State.  If we want a high-quality service, then we must ensure that adequate funding is provided.  It is necessary to have high-quality staff in order to ensure a high-quality service.  At the very minimum, the Government must confirm that the pay of those who work in the area of child care will be considered by the commission on low pay.  If we want a graduate-led workforce, then we must ensure its members are properly paid.<\/p> <p> My final point relates to special needs education.  The Minister's statement to the effect that \"the Health Service Executive, where possible, provides additional supports to children with special needs to enable them to avail of preschool services\" was simply awful.  It must be remembered that he is a former Minister for Health.  What about equal opportunities for all?  Children with special educational needs are being placed at a clear disadvantage and the Government has failed to acknowledge that fact.  This matter is bounced around among the Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs and Education and Skills.  No one Department is taking proper responsibility for those with special educational needs.  The position in this regard must change.  There is empirical evidence which confirms that investment in the early years ensures the best return not only for children but also for their families and for society in general.<\/p> <p> I again commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100065#OOO00400","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1423684500,"counter":687,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 79; N\u00edl, 46.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Emmet Stagg and Paul Kehoe; N\u00edl, Deputies Billy Kelleher and Robert Troy.<\/p><p>Amendment declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100066#PPP00200","aye":["1062","980","1016","946","1079","989","1030","1042","975","1092","988","1031","972","1041","1093","1006","994","1091","968","1075","1007","1011","1103","957","1078","1014","1085","1009","1068","951","1051","1076","995","1106","949","973","1033","1012","1088","1021","1110","1053","990","982","1023","1180","1194","1000","1082","977","1038","1026","1004","1070","1034","1067","1056","1045","1018","1060","1058","1069","1073","971","1081","966","947","952","1074","1013","1025","979","1048","961","978","1010","1095","950","1024"],"nay":["1066","1003","1190","1071","1193","1083","1037","1192","959","976","1022","1047","1198","1100","1050","1108","1094","960","1049","954","1188","983","945","1040","962","998","999","1008","1017","1090","993","965","981","987","1052","969","1044","1054","1028","984","1001","1178","970","1102","1065","956"]},{"type":"vote","time":1423684500,"counter":688,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the motion, as amended, be agreed to.\"<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 78; N\u00edl, 46.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Emmet Stagg and Paul Kehoe; N\u00edl, Deputies Billy Kelleher and Robert Troy.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100066#PPP00250","aye":["1062","980","1016","946","1079","1030","1042","975","1092","988","1031","972","1041","1093","1006","994","1091","968","1075","1007","1011","1103","957","1078","1014","1085","1009","1068","951","1051","1076","995","1106","949","973","1033","1012","1088","1021","1110","1053","990","982","1023","1180","1194","1000","1082","977","1038","1026","1004","1070","1034","1067","1056","1045","1018","1060","1058","1069","1073","971","1081","966","947","952","1074","1013","1025","979","1048","961","978","1010","1095","950","1024"],"nay":["1066","1003","1190","1071","1193","1083","1037","1192","959","976","1022","1047","1198","1100","1050","1108","1094","960","1049","954","1188","983","945","1040","962","998","999","1008","1017","1090","993","965","981","987","1052","969","1044","1054","1028","984","1001","1178","970","1102","1065","956"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423684500,"counter":689,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 9.25 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday, 12 February 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
