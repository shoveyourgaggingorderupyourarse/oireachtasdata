Masks, preferably of medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.  We are actively encouraging members to attend remotely if possible.  I ask for their full co-operation in this.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin I wish to explain some limitations to the parliamentary privilege and the practices of the Houses with regard to references that witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant both to the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  If, however, they are giving evidence remotely, from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are aware of the note on privilege.

I am joined by my colleagues Dr. Niall Farrell and Dr. Kieran McQuinn.  We are grateful for the opportunity to appear before the committee today to provide our views on inflation.<\/p> <p>  The post-pandemic circumstances that we are currently facing are just as unprecedented as the pandemic itself.  Understanding the inflationary pressures currently being experienced across most western economies requires us first to recount the deflationary pressures of last year.  These base effects combined with the uneven responses of global supply and demand, along with the pressures in international energy markets, are the main drivers of the inflation currently being experienced.<\/p> <p>  At the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and its accompanying public health restrictions, a significant portion of the economy came to a halt as households remained indoors and paused normal activities.  This disruption led to a sharp contraction in the demand for goods and services typically consumed by households and, consequently, prices declined in 2020 and early 2021.  These declines are key to understanding the magnitude of inflation now.  After a period of deflation, even a modest increase in prices due to increased demand can result in significant rates of inflation.<\/p> <p>  It is worth plotting the annual change in the consumer price index, CPI, of all products, as well as the CPI excluding energy products since 2017.  It is useful to see the effects energy products have had on the CPI throughout 2021.  Since March, the CPI excluding energy products has remained significantly lower than the overall CPI.  In October, the CPI excluding energy products stood at 3.4% compared with 5.1% for the overall CPI.<\/p> <p>  Prior to 2021, two issues which immediately stand out from the graph are the relatively low and stable rate of inflation over the period 2017 to 2020, at a time when the Irish economy was growing strongly, and the sharp deflation which took place during 2020.  The underlying strength and resilience of Ireland&rsquo;s domestic economy throughout the Covid-19 pandemic has made it uniquely vulnerable to inflationary pressures.  Ireland alone across the EU registered positive GDP growth in 2020, while the more indicative measure of Irish economic activity of modified domestic demand is set to grow at a faster pace than output growth across most other European countries.  The strength of the underlying economy means demand is growing more rapidly in Ireland, resulting in greater inflationary pressures.<\/p> <p>  Meanwhile, the rebound in demand is coinciding with a sluggishness in international supply.  For example, shipping firms, expecting a slowdown in trade during lockdown periods, idled the global fleet by more than 10%.  When households, especially in America, began to spend their pent-up savings and government-provided pandemic payments, shipping firms and manufacturers were ill-prepared to meet the global surge in demand.  Instead, producers have found themselves unable to keep up with orders, container ports have faced significant backlogs, and shipping rates have rocketed.  These strains on supply chains are another pandemic-induced pressure point on price inflation.<\/p> <p>  While these issues are being felt globally, one area in which inflationary pressures are particularly pronounced in Ireland is the property market.  After transport costs, housing and fuel costs were the second largest increase in the CPI according to the latest CSO data.  Much like other goods and services, the housing market has experienced robust demand along with a slowdown in supply during the pandemic.  Housing demand was largely unaffected during Covid-19 due to the provision of significant Government welfare assistance.  Indeed, the perceived increase observed in the savings rate of Irish households may have actually contributed to an increase in housing demand.  Consequently, house price inflation in August of this year is just under 11% per annum.  It should also be said that rental inflation is experiencing increases.  With more and more people expected to return to urban areas as workplaces reopen, it is likely that rental pressures will continue to grow over the next six to nine months.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, issues concerning the supply side of the housing market stem from pre-Covid vulnerabilities in the Irish economy as well as the effects of the pandemic.  Housing supply, already falling short of demand before 2020, suffered additional slowdowns as the public health measures contributed to a physical delay in housing construction.  The slowed pace of construction is further hampered by a marked increase in the costs of construction inputs due to supply chain disruptions.  These factors are constraining housing supply at a time when a significant imbalance already existed between supply and demand in the Irish market.<\/p> <p>  I now turn to energy.  European commodity prices have experienced unprecedented growth in recent months.  While oil prices have risen, primarily due to production lagging growth in demand, rising gas prices have been the primary driver.  Gas prices in October 2021 were 400% more expensive than April 2021, leading to European wholesale electricity prices rising by an average of 200%.<\/p><p>This growth has been driven by rapid increase in demand due to economic recovery, which has been met with constraints on supply.  A number of factors have contributed to European supply constraints.  International investments in oil and natural gas have declined in recent years as a result of two commodity price collapses, while policies to scale up clean energy sources and technologies to fill the gap have been lagging.  In addition, supply has been further constrained by maintenance work which was shifted from 2020 to 2021.  Large-scale storage facilities usually provide a buffer during tight market conditions.  However, a cold winter in 2020-21, and planned closure of certain storage facilities, resulted in depleted European stocks leading into autumn and winter 2021.<\/p><p> Finally, international competition for gas imports has further compounded fuel price growth in Europe.  International trends are likely to lead to sharp upward pressure on energy prices in Ireland.  For gas and electricity, current information suggests this will persist during winter 2021-22, and that prices may fall in spring 2022.  Oil prices will be primarily determined by the production decisions of international producers.<\/p><p> Budget 2022 can take measures directed at maintaining household standards of living.  On the taxation side, tax credits and bands were increased by more than forecast inflation.  While the standard rate band has been raised in some recent budgets, this marks the first increase in the personal and PAYE tax credits since 2008, and means that the after-income tax purchasing power of those earning enough to pay income tax will rise slightly in real terms, as long as the inflation outturn is similar to forecast levels.  Unlike income tax credits and bands, most of the corresponding thresholds for PRSI and the universal social charge, USC, were held fixed in nominal terms, amounting to an effective PRSI and increase for many taxpayers.  Although most excise duties were frozen in cash terms, amounting to an effective cut, given rising prices, tobacco products tax was increased.  There was also a well-flagged increase to the carbon tax.  A carbon tax is the most efficient way of incentivising carbon abatement, with the larger literature finding that such taxes would reduce emissions in Ireland, with few wider economic costs.  However, there is also widespread recognition that carbon taxes can have distributional consequences because lower income households spend a disproportionate share of their incomes on carbon-intensive goods, in particular, heat and fuel.  As a result, a carbon tax can have a regressive impact in the absence of an accompanying package of compensation measures.  One should, therefore, consider the impact of the carbon tax increase on households' income in conjunction with other changes to the tax and welfare system.<\/p><p> On the welfare side, budget 2022 saw increases to most social welfare payments.  There were significant, above-forecast inflation increases to the fuel allowance and the additional payments made to those living alone or with dependent children in receipt of social welfare payments.  Recipients of these benefits are more likely to be at risk of poverty and to spend a high share of their income on fuel than social welfare recipients living with other adults, making the measures well targeted to mitigate the adverse impacts of the carbon tax increase on vulnerable, low-income households.<\/p><p> There were smaller increase in the main social welfare payments for working age couples without children.  There was also a substantial increase in funding for the providers of registered childcare, accounting for around half of all childcare in Ireland, who commit to freezing their prices.  Changes to the national childcare scheme, NCS, which subsidises registered childcare, were also announced.  The universal subsidy, which currently pays 50 cent per hour for children under three, will be extended to cover children up to the age of 15, and the hours covered by the NCS for children in school or preschool will be increased.<\/p><p> In its post-budget analysis, the ESRI compared the direct and indirect tax and welfare measures announced in budget 2022 to a price-adjusted set of policies, which would have kept household purchasing power constant in real terms.  Figure 2 illustrates the impact of budget 2022 across the distribution of household income, adjusted for family size, with the population divided into ten equally sized groups or deciles, ordered from lowest to highest income, left to right.  The effect of direct tax and welfare measures, indirect tax measures and changes to the NCS are shown separately, with the total effect represented by the solid blue line.  The overall effect of budget 2022, compared to price-adjusted policies, is that, on average, disposable income is virtually unchanged.  There are small and average gains in the lower two deciles and upper four deciles, which are counteracted by small income losses in the middle four deciles.  Although increases to the carbon tax and tobacco duty disproportionately affect lower-income households, these also gain from above-inflation increases to core social welfare payments and supplements for those living alone or with dependents.  These increases are sufficiently large to offset the impact of increases to indirect taxes for the lowest-income fifth of households and will leave poverty slightly lower than had all welfare payments and tax bands kept pace with inflation.  While the above-inflation indexation of income tax bands and credits will also compensate higher-income households for the increases in indirect taxation, most USC and PRSI bands were not changed.  The effect of that is to reduce the after-tax purchasing power of lower earners who do not earn enough to pay income tax, though some of those will gain from an increase to the minimum wage.<\/p><p> From a policy perspective, it is important to recognise that the current and forecast inflationary pressures are essentially of a temporary or transitory manner.  The surge in demand will abate as consumers unwind savings and slowly regress to their pre-pandemic savings ratio.  Firms will continue to improvise and navigate through the supply chain disruptions until global trade returns to normal levels.  While monitoring authorities and forecasters generally may underestimate these inflationary pressures, this does not mean that the same authorities should react in a somewhat hasty manner by prematurely increasing policy interest rates.  That, as noticed by Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan, could result in monitoring authorities threatening the nascent economic recovery which is apparent across countries.<\/p><p> If inflation in 2022 is in line with forecasts, the direct and indirect tax and welfare measures announced in budget 2022 will compensate most households for rising prices.  If inflation exceeds forecasts, the increases to some targeted welfare measures, such as the fuel allowance, living alone allowance and qualified child increases, may not be enough to insulate low-income households from rising prices.  The European Commission has published a toolbox discussing measures of support for consumers in the face of a temporary rise in energy prices.  Suggested interventions include the temporary deferral of bill payments, adjustments to VAT and levies and short-term adjustments to social payments to aid the vulnerable.  In an Irish context, short-term adjustments to social transfers and facilitating the deferral of bill payments are likely to be the most effective policy options, as taxes and levies comprise a lesser proportion of total electricity expenditure in Ireland relative to many EU countries and many social payments are already targeted towards vulnerable households.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111700002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karina Doorley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Doorley.

The carbon tax is a visible measure and people will see it coming through on a tank of diesel.  How much of an impact do our guests think that will have on the overall picture of inflation?  Dr. Doorley also pointed to external influences.  Energy and gas, in particular, have been identified as drivers of inflation.  Which will have the bigger influence and what extent of influence will the carbon tax and international prices have?<\/p> <p>  The ESRI examined the possibility of those prices levelling off, possibly by spring 2022.

Our post-budget analysis included the carbon tax.  We looked at the effect of direct and indirect tax measures on household incomes.  That included the increase by the carbon tax.  Even accounting for the increase to the carbon tax next year, households are on average no worse off as a result of tax and welfare measures in budget 2022.  That is because the carbon tax disproportionately affects low-income households because their fuel bill is a larger share of their overall consumption but there were well targeted increases to some social welfare payments that manages to compensate those households for the extra expenditure that they will incur as a result of the carbon tax.  Taking the impact inflation on top of the carbon tax increase, if it does not exceed the forecasts which are around 2% or 3% next year, then low-income households should be reasonably well insulated from the impact of inflation and from the carbon tax increase.  In other parts of the income distribution, depending on how much inflation exceeds forecasts, some households may be left worse off.  However, for the lowest income households, the direct tax and welfare measures announced in budget 2022 should compensate them from carbon tax increases and forecast inflation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111700002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karina Doorley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>On carbon tax, the vast majority of the increases in prices are internationally driven.

On whether this will last forever, the current projection is that the price being paid on international markets for delivery of gas in spring tends to fall back to what one would expect outside the current increases in fuels.  Given what we know now, we would expect the prices the resolve around then.

Those are the four ways that we look at it in overall terms.  The base effect issue will resolve itself over the next period.  Most people seem to think that supply chain issues will be resolved in the next six to nine months as economies come back on stream and normal economic activity begins to convene across most countries.  Dr. Farrell spoke of easing of pressures around energy costs.  The vast majority of the pressures there at present should begin to resolve themselves quite considerably over the next six to nine months.  The housing issue is where you could see a lingering effect beyond that.  Ireland is not the only country experiencing this phenomenon.  Housing costs are increasing across Europe and even in North America.  Those relate to a lot of factors, some of which are connected, such as the build-up of savings during the pandemic.  However, between house prices and rents you will see upward pressure over the next six to nine months and even beyond that.  We would be reasonably confident that the other pressures will begin to abate.  Initially, policymakers were quite confident in asserting that they felt it was a temporary transitory issue and giving dates for when they saw the inflationary pressures ease.  I think there is a little less confidence now and people are coming around to the view that the pressures will last a little longer than initially thought and that the inflation rates will be a little higher.  However, I think the basic core drivers of inflation are issues which should be resolved in the next six to nine months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111700002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Briefly, what about the bounce back?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111700002#C00600","speaker":"1455"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>It has been an issue for Ireland, one could argue going back to when we joined the euro area.

I know we say that there are international reasons for the fuel costs going up but fuel costs drive up every other cost.  There is a ricochet effect.  How will that be dealt with?  With carbon tax, it is costing some people more now because they do not have access to public transport.  They have no alternative methods of travelling to the car.  There does not seem to be any just transition for that.

The purpose of the carbon tax is to increase the price of carbon in certain fuels, diesel and petrol in order to invoke this behavioural response.  What we are seeing currently is a bit different from that.  Obviously, we have supply-side pressures driving fuel price growth.  With the two of these together, it is unfortunate there is a carbon price increase and then these other supply-side effects at the same time.  However, the European Commission has come out with a sort of toolbox to help with what it perceives to be transitory changes to fuel prices at the moment.  The steps policymakers can take to help with the current pressures involve allowing bill deferments, perhaps increasing some social welfare payments temporarily and other measures like that.  The Commission does not advocate rolling back on carbon taxes because that is a long-term policy with well-stated objectives.

Those households were not fully compensated for the increase in the carbon tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111700002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karina Doorley"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111700002#D00700","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I will take the two points the Deputy raised about the fiscal rules and the ongoing discussion about what is likely to happen to them.  Most people believe that if reverted to the exact rules in place before the pandemic, many countries could be in difficulty over the next couple of years.  This idea of aiming for a 60% debt-to-GDP ratio when many countries have been increasing their debt would pose significant issues for countries such as Italy and others which have been increasing their spending.  In an Irish context, the strength of our recovery is such that we believe we will have double-digit GDP growth this year and very strong growth again next year.  We can talk about how valid the debt-to-GDP ratio is in an Irish context.  However, if we take it as the measure, and it is the measure used with the fiscal rules, the economy will probably be in a better position by the end of even this year than it was just before the pandemic.  Even though we increased our debt and borrowing, the economy actually grew by such an amount and is likely to grow by such an amount that we are in a better position than we were going into the pandemic.  I think that will be a surprise to many people but that is the nature of the strength of the recovery.  As I said, we could have a separate discussion on how accurate GDP is in this context but compared with most other countries in Europe, Ireland will be in a relatively good position going forward, from that perspective.  Again, the strength and pace of our recovery are the key issue there.<\/p> <p>  On interest rates, the Deputy raised a very interesting question.  Obviously, the interest rate is the key monetary policy tool used to curb inflation.  It is what the ECB would typically use if it were trying to actively reduce the rate of inflation.  The danger is that if interest rates were raised at this point, many countries are only beginning to recover and come back on track with respect to normal economic activity.  European authorities, especially the ECB and the European Commission, probably learned from the mistakes of the financial crisis where the large institutions, whether it was the ECB or the Commission, did not really help the initial phase of recovery countries were experiencing after the financial crisis.  There was too much of a focus on curbing expenditure and countries getting their fiscal policies back in shape.  Those lessons have been learned.  The major authorities are trying to accommodate the recovery as much as possible and that has been reflected in much of the commentary, even from the ECB in recent times.  It notes the higher inflation, believes it will work itself out over the next six to nine months and will not start raising interests any time soon because of the dangers that could pose to the recovery across the euro area.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of overheating.  It is a valid point in the sense that we would have been talking about the potential for the Irish economy to overheat just before the pandemic.  Obviously, the pandemic has had its impact.  As we come out of the pandemic and the economy grows very strongly, that will raise certain issues for us as well.  The ESRI has, for instance, called for greater capital investment in areas such as housing.  Climate change is another area.  That is important and necessary going forward but it means that when increasing expenditure, particularly on capital, in the context of an economy that is growing very strongly, it will require showing discipline on the current expenditure side to ensure the economy does not overheat.  That will become a key fiscal and broader macro challenge for the authorities over the next period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111700002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome our guests and thank them for giving of their valuable time.  We appreciate very much their considered opinions on all these matters.  I have great concerns, as I am sure all those in the ESRI do, regarding where exactly we are going from an economic point of view in the context of small to medium-sized businesses and the effect of the ever-increasing cost of the basics and the knock-on effects that will have on those businesses.  By basics, I mean energy and fuel costs, which relate to everything.  As I continuously say, from the moment you get up in the morning, whether it is brushing your teeth or anything that follows, everything that you need comes on wheels.  It does not fall out of the sky.<\/p> <p>  The majority of things in this country are imported in containers.  I am acutely aware of the cost of containers.  Not so long ago, you could get a container for between &euro;1,800, and &euro;3,500, whereas now you can pay &euro;8,000, &euro;9,000 or &euro;10,000 for the same container.  That is a startling fact.  What is more, when you go looking for that container, there is a wait and a buy-in time that was not there before, which affects supply, of the basic necessities we get in or anything else.<\/p> <p>  I run a small shop and I see simple changes happening.  It is not just in my shop, it is in every shop.  To take a random example, you cannot at certain times get either grapefruit or grapefruit juice of any type or description in any shop in the country.  That can go on for a week, ten days or two weeks, and then all of a sudden they will come in again.  That is just one item out of what might be 10,000 items in a large shop or 2,500 items in an ordinary, small shop.  We are going through these phases of not having items.  Some of them we can do without and, to be blunt about it, there is a fear of us, but there are other staples we need from the building supplies point of view.  We all know about the price of steel and timber and other basics.<\/p> <p>  I have to say this all the time because it is not as though I am somebody who has his head stuck in the sand.  I am not a person who looks around me and says I am a climate change denier, that this is all a load of rubbish or that I do not agree with that.  I am not for one moment saying that, and I hate it when people try to paint me as a character who says that because I do not.  It is the exact opposite.  What I am arguing against is the way in which we are driving this.  For instance, we talk about it as a given that we have to tax carbon-related fossil fuels because we have to discourage people.  I have never in my life voted for an increase in the price of tobacco at budget time because I do not think the right way to stop people smoking is by heavily taxing someone who feels he or she has to smoke, or who smokes for different reasons such as psychiatric problems.  I do not agree with the idea of taxing and taxing certain items.<\/p> <p>  The Government has got it so wrong on certain issues.  We are bringing in 4,000 tonnes of peat at the time - it is a well-known fact - but the carbon footprint of that is coming in from Latvia because we shut Bord na M&oacute;na.  Our peat is staying in the ground but we are bringing in peat from Latvia.  We are bringing in briquettes by the thousands of tonnes from Germany - they are selling very well - while we are closing our own Bord na M&oacute;na peat briquette factory.  The Government does not have a monopoly on getting it right.<\/p> <p>  Some might say I am pointing out the things that are wrong and ask me what should be done.  There are actions the Government could take.  For example, it could waive the increase in VAT from the carbon tax to alleviate fuel poverty.  Similarly, because insulation products are so expensive, it could remove the VAT take on them.  It is rubbish for the Government and the people who support it to say grants are available.  I challenge them to apply for the grants and see how they get on.  If they are an older person looking for the full, 100% grant, I challenge them to see how they get on.  I deal with this every day.  They will be faced with a wait of up to two years.  Imagine if anybody at this meeting was told that he or she had to wait two years for assistance for anything.  It might not be the end of the world to us but I ask members to think of one thing.  They are all diligent and thoughtful people.  I challenge them to let on they are almost 80 years old and want to insulate their home.  Some bright spark will come along and say, \"Oh yes, you can have this grant, but you know you must wait two years for it.\"  Two years is a fairly long time when you are an older, perhaps vulnerable and cold person.  Two years is a lifetime.  The Government is ignoring that fact and blowing about how it is putting so much into grants.  It should do something immediate that will reduce the cost of the insulation product immediately.  It should do away with much of the tax take on it.<\/p> <p>  Those types of measures are sensible moves we could make straight away that would give credibility to what the Government is trying to do.  People are only now starting to realise because it is hitting home when they see the increases in the cost of energy and how difficult it will be for them to heat their homes.  People are told to change from using fossil fuels to, say, an air-to-water system, but does anybody know how much such a system costs?  I do, and I know what it should cost.  It should cost between &euro;2,500 and &euro;4,500 for the equipment, but &euro;18,000, &euro;20,000, &euro;22,000 and &euro;24,000 is being charged for an average house.  Why?  That is wrong.  It should not cost so much.<\/p> <p>  Nevertheless, the Government is not examining that or doing anything about it.  It just tells us this is what we should do.  How can people afford to do it?  They are told to change from using a petrol or diesel car to an electric car.  What is the Government doing about giving us the provision such that we will have all this electricity?  It is doing nothing.  Our energy supply nationally is going into the red in a way it never did before in that we are bordering on facing power cuts.  We will not have power cuts this winter, please God, but we will have them next year.  That will concentrate people's minds.  People who are very involved in the provision of energy in this country, who have been at this for a lifetime, have told me it is inevitable that there will be outages.  They will be planned and organised outages, but we will have them next winter if we survive this one, yet the Government is not making any provisions.<\/p> <p>  I am talking about this in the context of our guests' presentation because I believe it has everything to do with it.  When we talk about how we plan our finances, we do not know where we are going unless we know where we are coming from and what we are doing right now.  I am afraid the Government is unsure about what it is doing.  It is clamouring and trying to position us on the world stage.  Last week, the Taoiseach went over and gave away a couple of hundred million euro as if it had been lying around on the ground to be kicked around the place.  We are not thinking this through.  I acknowledge that our guests cannot comment on this but, with the way the Government is hanging, between Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party, they are all holding on to one another and everyone is afraid to kick to touch on anything.  All the people supporting them are tied in to this thing together.  It is a case of them keeping peddling this as hard as they can to keep it afloat.  At the end of the day, we are charged with representing voters, the people, whether they are vulnerable people, young couples or older people, and we are supposed to take care of their welfare.  I refer to their financial matters, their health, their education and all the other aspects of their life.  We are supposed to take care of that but we are not doing so.  The Government is doing nothing to curb inflation and everything to increase it.<\/p><p>They are doing everything to increase inflation because they are hitting all the basics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111700002#E00100","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>The Deputy is a little over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111700002#F00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I am very sorry.

Something that we have noted even during the pandemic is the varied impact that the pandemic has had on the economy.  In general terms, we make the point that the economy has come through the pandemic well and is set to grow strongly next year and the year after.  That masks substantial differences beneath the surface.  Some sectors of the economy have been completely unaffected.  Some have benefited, considering some of the exports last year.  Other sectors of the economy have been practically wiped out and have experienced significant difficulties, including the hospitality and tourism sectors.  There has been a different effect on different sectors of the economy.  This also applies from a regional perspective.  Some parts of the country have fared reasonably well and others have been badly affected.  There are significant differences in how the pandemic has affected the country and as we hopefully come out of the pandemic, there will be significant differences regarding areas of the economy that will be impacted and other areas that may fare more robustly.<\/p> <p>  The supply chain is a relevant issue.  Interesting work has been done internationally to look at the effect of the supply chain issue on inflation.  The Bank for International Settlements looked at the effect of inflation in the eurozone and the USA.  It is clear that the supply chain and difficulties associated with it are a significant factor which influences inflation rates in both the eurozone and the USA.  Most people would expect that, but it is interesting to see it borne out by the figures and analysis.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned building supplies and steel.  We have often talked about the housing issue in the institute.  Housing is one of the main areas that has been adversely impacted by the pandemic because the demand has remained strong, and was almost bolstered by the increase in savings witnessed over the last year or so.  As those savings begin to come back into the economy, much seems to be going into the housing market.  The supply side of the market was especially adversely impacted through the restrictions and the building sites being shut down for a period, and through the increase in costs in key areas, including steel and labour.  That will have effects that last for a time.  As I said in response to an earlier question, the one area where I expect lingering inflationary costs for the economy in the medium term is the housing market, because of the specific nature of the difficulties for the economy at present.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Doorley might want to talk about the carbon tax again.  I am not an environmental economist.  My colleagues in the institute make the point about carbon taxes that to impact behaviour, it appears, insofar as there is ever unanimity in economic literature, increasing and levying carbon taxes is an important conclusion from much of the analysis and results, domestically and internationally.  That is a fairly unanimous conclusion.  It is a cornerstone of the Government's approach to meeting our emissions targets.  I do not know if Dr. Doorley or Dr. Farrell want to add to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111700002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>As Dr. McQuinn said, the literature suggests that carbon taxes are the most efficient way to reduce carbon emissions with the lowest cost to society's welfare.  An interesting international analysis was to look at the effect of a subsidy on its own compared with a carbon tax.  When there is a subsidy to make renewable energy cheaper, that is fine, but then everybody switches to renewable energy and the price of the unused carbon-emitting technology goes down again and people switch back.  In order to make the change stick, carbon emitting things have to be made more expensive.  One thing arising from the previous comment is that the middle-income cohort can be constrained or negatively affected.  There are available redistribution options to target whoever is expected.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned supply constraints with regard to retrofitting.  We need to have a lot of retrofitting and housing.  Asking whether we will have the necessary capacity in the construction sector is a valid comment.<\/p> <p>  Regarding EirGrid and supply constraints in the electricity market, one thing to take into account is that tighter constraints are projected in the future.  There is perhaps an increased risk of something happening but it does not necessarily mean that something will happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111700002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank the ESRI.  I apologise for not being here at the beginning.  We are discussing many of the same issues with regard to the Finance Bill as we speak.  Quite a few of us are double jobbing this evening.  I read the witnesses' paper.<\/p> <p>  I wanted to ask about the carbon tax and the commitment that people seem to have to it.  Perhaps there is a failure to distinguish between different types of carbon taxes.  I am in favour of carbon taxes on people who are profiting from polluting the environment with carbon dioxide.  I do not accept that it changes behaviour if financial penalties are imposed on people for using fossil fuels where they have no choice.  There has to be a distinction.  If the witnesses suggested taxing the profits of the aviation sector and companies such as Ryanair, or Larry Goodman and the big beef processors, I would say to load it on.  If the tax is going to be applied to the small farmer or the family living in social housing, it is a different matter.  For example, if the council will not insulate a family's home for the next decade and they have to increase the heat.  People who are well-paid do not have to because their homes are well-insulated or they can afford to make up the difference between grants and the cost of retrofitting, while a family in private rented accommodation or social housing would not be allowed to do it even if they could get the money.  Those people will not change their behaviour because they cannot.  They are prohibited at every level from changing their behaviour and they are being punished in a situation where they are doing nothing wrong.  That is the misapplication of carbon taxes.  We have to speak out strongly about it.<\/p> <p>  If we do not challenge that type of carbon tax, there is a danger that we will make the least well off, the most vulnerable and the people who are least guilty of carbon pollution, hostile to the climate action agenda.  There is no doubt in any study, globally, domestically, or anywhere else, that the rich emit far more carbon than the poor.  This will punish the least guilty.<\/p><p>They will be made hostile to it and pushed into the hands of climate sceptics.  I therefore appeal to the economists in the ESRI to distinguish between carbon taxes that punish people who are not in a position to change their behaviour because of price signals and those who essentially make money from polluting, carbon-heavy industry.<\/p><p> The witnesses say some of the inflationary pressures we see at the moment are specific to Covid, with people saving money and then starting to spend it again because things reopen, if I understand correctly, and are specific to slowdowns in particular sectors in which demand fell off during Covid.  Are there any lessons to be learnt about our vulnerability to these kinds of inflationary pressures from Covid?  To me, the lesson that has to be learnt from it, particularly when looking at energy but also in any other area, is that the more you plan and the less you depend on the swings and roundabouts of markets responding in particular ways to particular situations, the more you are able to cope with these kinds of situations.  I ask the witnesses for their opinion on that.  You are more vulnerable to these swings or moments of inflationary surge if there are areas which are completely dependent on private market actors to determine supply at critical moments, particularly when that supply is of things that are critical to the sustaining of the economy.<\/p><p> I have one last question.  I want to give the witnesses time to come back in.  Dr. McQuinn said we need to ramp up capital investment in a whole range of areas - and I agree with him - such as housing, retrofit, public transport, forestry, to mention another thing that has come up a lot this week, and many other areas.  I would add third level education because if we do not have the skilled, trained workforce to do a lot of the things we need done, apprenticeships and so on, that will create bottlenecks and inflation.  Dr. McQuinn says, however, that if we are to do that, we have to be careful about current spending.  Could he identify where we should cut back on current spending?  I worry about that.  It sounds a little like austerity.  Should we not at least point to the other possibility rather than cut back?  Often even the distinction between current and capital is lost on me a little in certain areas.  With increased investment in education, where does capital and current begin and end?  I am not quite sure.  We need more teachers and more school buildings.  Maybe the witnesses could comment on that.  It seems to me that there is an alternative, which is to look at the distribution of income and wealth in our society and tax policies that will give us more revenue by redistributing wealth and profits, which we have seen grow very significantly over the Covid period but which tend to be concentrated among small groups at the top of business and the top of our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111700002#F00700","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I will come in on the last couple of points the Deputy made about the inflationary pressures specific to Covid.  Then I will comment on vulnerabilities to swings and roundabouts and international markets.  Dr. Farrell might jump in on the energy side, and I will deal with the capital expenditure issue.  Then, in the absence of our environmental colleagues, maybe we will all talk a little about the carbon tax issues the Deputy raised.<\/p> <p>  Earlier I made the point that the way I look at this is that there are four different factors influencing the inflationary pressures we are experiencing now.  Some of them are specific to Covid, some may be less so and some involve existing issues we have in the economy being exacerbated by Covid.  Energy costs are clearly an international phenomenon.  The supply chain issues are very much an international post-Covid situation.  As for the base effects, prices were very low last year and there was deflation in some sectors.  Clearly, any increase in prices this year will result in fairly large swings in inflation.  Again, that is Covid-related.<\/p> <p>  Housing issues are a classic example of Covid compounding difficulties that were already in the market in terms of the imbalance between supply and demand.  If anything, Covid seems to have provided almost a stimulus to the demand side of the housing market in the form of the increase in savings we have seen.  There seems to be preliminary evidence to suggest that some of those savings will come back into the property market rather than into other areas of consumer expenditure.  That will stimulate to a certain extent the demand side of the market.  The supply side of the market was particularly impacted by Covid between the lockdowns and then the sharp increase in costs in certain sectors of the supply side of the market.<\/p> <p>  That is our overall viewpoint.  As I said, some of these issues are more Covid-specific, some are international and some involve the interaction between Covid and existing vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the domestic economy.<\/p> <p>  Does Dr. Farrell wish to talk about energy?

A lot of our energy, in terms of electricity generation and heating, is sourced from gas.  Exposure to international gas prices is a function of what the price is and how much gas is used.  At the moment we use quite an amount.  To reduce that exposure, accelerating renewables and the environmental transition is perhaps the greatest long-term solution.  Regardless of any way to shield people from these prices, if we are still dependent on gas, we will still face this issue.  The renewables transition is perhaps the long-term solution in reducing our exposure to fluctuations in gas prices.  When it comes to households and carbon taxes, Dr. Doorley is probably more familiar with this, but I suggest thinking about it in terms of a combination of policies - not only with regard to carbon tax but also with regard to compensation in the form of changes to the welfare system that may help the vulnerable households the Deputy discussed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Farrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>On the point about capital expenditure, the broad point is that we agree and we have put forward the case for significant investment in areas such as housing.  It is clear now that the carbon and environment area will require a significant increase in expenditure as well.  In investment terms we see big increases, or certainly sizeable increases, in capital expenditure coming over the next few years.  The issue from a macro point of view is that the economy is set to grow quite strongly.  Our expectation is that it will grow very strongly this year, next year and probably for a year or so afterwards.  The danger in that context is that we see a significant increase in capital expenditure, or expenditure generally, at a time when the economy is performing very strongly.  That can lead to overheating pressures.  I take Deputy Boyd Barrett's point that at times there is a blurred distinction between capital and current.  We are certainly not calling for any reduction in current expenditure.  What we are talking about is being disciplined about the rate of increases in current expenditure we see going forward.  As to which areas we would look at - and this may chime a little with what the Deputy says - I do not think there is much scope for any significant reductions in, for example, taxation such as personal income tax.  Greater taxation may even be called for as a way of taking the heat out of the economy.  That is the point about current expenditure.  If we see significant increases in current expenditure on top of significant increases in capital expenditure, the danger, in the context of a very strongly growing economy, is that there will be an overheating problem.  As I said, sometimes our economic cycle is not quite the same as the European one.  That has implications for monetary policy and the kinds of actions of the European authorities to control inflation.  It may well be that our inflation will be out of whack with what is going on in Europe.<\/p><p>That is a kind of by-product of our membership of the euro area.  That is the broader point.<\/p><p> On the carbon tax, I do not know if Dr. Doorley would like to jump in.  Again, going back to the earlier point, we do not have our environmental colleagues with us.  If they were here, I am sure they would echo the point we made in respect of Deputy Michael Healy-Rae&rsquo;s questions.  The evidence seems to suggest that carbon taxes are an important way of changing behaviour.  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point about the distributional issues.  Clearly, if people do not have an alternative, then that is that is a major issue.  The research seems to point fairly conclusively to the fact that if you want to change behaviour in this area, carbon taxes are the way in which to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111700002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I apologise to the Chair for arriving in such haste and for having to dine on the way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111700002#H00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":41,"content":"<p>That is okay, Deputy, we understand the constraints of the Finance Bill at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111700002#H00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I must have affected Deputy Boyd Barrett because he seems to have wandered off the script.

I was trying to do two things at the same time.<\/p> <p>  There are two things that come to mind.  I had agreed all day almost with Deputy Boyd Barrett.  I worry about my ideological trends when that happens.  However, he wandered off anyway so I am glad to say I am back on track again now.  The Deputy is suggesting one thing that I strongly disagree with, namely, dividing society.  In the battle that is ahead, we cannot afford to divide society between rich and poor and urban and rural.  We have to include everybody.  Climate change affects everybody.  If we all stay together, we will succeed.<\/p> <p>  On carbon tax, it is hard to say to people that it is in their own interests and that they should swallow their medicine and it will be okay.  Carbon tax is not an end in itself.  It is a means to an end, and we have to realise that.  However, we need to have alternatives in the intervening period.  We have just spoken about that.  We cannot afford to say to people that this is it for the good of society and for the good of humanity.  We need to be able to show them graphically that we are on their side on this and that we are aware of the difficulties that this creates for some people.  The Government is trying to do that.  It is trying to address those issues through the medium of social welfare and other measures.  That is being done.  Whether it will be done sufficiently to meet the needs of the people remains to be seen.  I referred to this at another committee just a short while ago.  There is a necessity to have a plan B, should there be a sharp deterioration in weather conditions, for example, this coming winter or in the spring.  We should have some way of showing the people how we can get to where we need to go, for example, in the context of keeping them in some degree of comfort and ensuring that they have the ability to heat their homes and so forth.  At the same time, we should not create a further burden in the context of emissions.  That can be done.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if this matter has been debated, but I suspect it has.  Everybody believes that the farming community is totally responsible.  That is not true.  People believe that climate change only affects the farming community and that if they make the sacrifices, everything would be all over.  That is not true either.  This affects all of our society, urban and rural.  When distribution issues arise - they have already begun to do so - it will fall to us to find some other way of bringing everybody on board.  Incidentally, the jobs in the agrifood sector are not all rural based.  Many of those jobs are urban based.  If, for instance, we were to lose the jobs at the scale that has been suggested, we would have a serious breach to our economy that we could not afford.<\/p> <p>  What we need to do now in order to ameliorate the problem is no far as we can is sequestration.  We can do that straight away.  We can start next week, next month or next year, or we can avoid it all together, do nothing and say \"It&rsquo;s not going to happen.  I do not agree with it.  It is a conspiracy.\" and all that kind of stuff.  If we follow that course, then in five or ten years we will have achieved nothing.  We need to concentrate now on sequestration in respect of forestry, the means by which we heat our homes, the way we drive our cars and so on.  We must also consider the degree to which modern science can come to our aid as well.  For instance, the use of hydrogen has not been pursued to any great extent.  Insofar as I am aware, an internal combustion engine can be fairly readily converted to run on hydrogen.  That is not big task at all.  It just requires the will among the scientists and the engine manufactures globally.  That matter needs to be examined.<\/p> <p>  I apologise to the Chair for going off on a rant.  I want to highlight the fact that we will achieve what we are seeking to do if we proceed together.  We should examine all the aspects regarding how we can deal with the sequestration; how we can change over to electric or hydrogen cars; and how we can change over to hydrogen trucks and hydrogen transport.  We cannot get on without transport.  We have to transport.  We cannot do it all on rail.  If we were to do that, we would end up having more rail infrastructure than roads.  That would not serve any useful purpose.  We need to proceed in the right fashion and keep in mind the need to ensure the maximum return on our every move.  Let us not forget this: we are lucky to have been able to come Covid-19.  Covid-19 has been very expensive.  The disease is not unique to Ireland.  The manner in which Covid-19 was dealt with in countries across the globe has been no different.  Everything has been tried but, so far, a magic bullet has not been found.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the original issue, I am of the view that we are on the right track.  We need to make sure that it happens.  I made the point in the past that if we had started 15 years ago to manufacture the alternatives, we would not have a problem now.  That is the issue.  We would not have a problem now.  If we continue to blame each other for what is happening - whether it is rich blaming the poor or those in urban areas blaming their rural counterparts - we will not achieve anything.  We will arrive at stalemate.  Stalemate is easy to produce and difficult to sequester, no pun intended.  We should follow the instructions.  We should also do that in the context of Covid-19 as well of course.<\/p> <p>  I want to finish with this point.  I mentioned it at another committee.  In the 1970s, in my constituency we built many houses without chimneys because we were told at that time that the climate was getting warmer and that we would not need as much heat in the future.  That was one of the reasons that no chimneys were put into houses.  The Government of the day had to give a grant, I think it amounted to &pound;750 or &pound;1,000, to householders to put chimneys into their houses on foot of an increase in fuel prices rising across the globe.  Everybody affected had to avail of the grant because, otherwise, they would have had no heat.  Needs must, as we say.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chair for allowing me in at this stage.  I am sorry that my contribution happened to take the form of a rant.  However, I look forward to the odd rant now and again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111700002#H00400","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>You are entitled to that Deputy Durkan.

When we think about the impact of carbon tax on rich households versus poor households, the recommendation is that in order to achieve behavioural change, carbon tax must be applied across the board.  However, there are obvious distributional impacts.  Poorer households spend more of their income on fuel and, as a result, they are disproportionately affected by carbon tax increases.<\/p><p>Poor households are also less able to switch.  They do not have the disposable income available to buy an electric car, retrofit their houses or even delay consumption if there is a temporary increase in fuel prices.  The idea is to compensate the households who cannot switch and make sure they are at least no worse off.  That was done in last year's budget and this year's budget at least for the poorest households but maybe not so much for the middle income households.  This year, there has been a slight reduction in the disposable income for middle income households compared with a price index budget, which does not quite compensate them for the carbon tax increase and something similar happened in last year's budget.  There are ways to compensate middle income households.  They might not receive social welfare but indexing the universal social charge, USC, or PRSI rates can go a long way to alleviating some pressures on those households due to an increase in carbon tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111700002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karina Doorley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":46,"content":"<p>There is ongoing research in Ireland on bringing in hydrogen but it is very much at pre-commercial stage.

The big question for macroeconomists in the aftermath of the pandemic has been, in terms of the strength of the likely recovery and bounce-back in economies, what will happen to the savings levels that people have accumulated.  There is no doubt that savings levels did increase significantly during the pandemic for a number of reasons.  At this stage it is hard to say definitively because we do not have the actual data.  We are still forecasting and it is a very unprecedented situation that we have this kind of increase in savings to the extent that we have had.  Preliminary evidence at an international level seems to suggest that people are looking at the housing market as an area to increase their expenditure levels and, possibly, to divest some of their savings into.  We would see that as being something that is likely to occur in the domestic market for a number of obvious reasons.  We have talked about the imbalance between supply and demand and the market.  This was an issue before Covid and Covid has clearly had an impact on the supply side of the housing market.  There is a danger going forward.  I mean that people will now feel that there is a bigger imbalance but people are also aware of that.  I will not say that there will be frenzied behaviour but the expectations that people have in this regard are important.  I mean if people think there is going to be a shortage of housing then people will start to try to buy housing today because they are afraid that in six months or 12 months time that housing will be even more expensive.  That is where one could see a considerable amount of these savings going into the housing market.<\/p> <p>  In terms of what to do about that, like everything to do with the housing market, the ultimate solution to the problem is to increase supply.  The bottom line is that we need to significantly increase the supply of housing over the coming years as a way of dealing with the problems; in particular we must provide more social and affordable housing.  We have extensively talked about the big problem that is the high cost of housing here when compared with other jurisdictions. <\/p> <p>  Capital expenditure is the flipside of the increased expenditure on housing.  Again, the points that I made to Deputy Boyd Barrett are relevant.  The Government has committed to increased capital expenditure on housing.  I think there will be increased capital expenditure to do with the environmental challenge and also possibly in other areas such as Sl&aacute;intecare and the like.  One needs to maintain discipline on the current expenditure side because, without doubt, the economy will grow quite strongly over the coming years.  The employment rate has fallen quicker than any of us would have imagined so one will get to a stage where the unemployment rate could become very low again, which would indicate there is very little slack in the economy, and the danger of overheating could come into play.  It is important the Government is relatively disciplined when it comes to current expenditure.  That means taxation cuts would be very hard to justify in that context and it would need to maintain a certain discipline in terms of areas around public sector pay.  Those are the kinds of challenges that we face from a macro point of view.  If we are going to increase capital expenditure then we must ensure we do not overheat the economy.     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111700002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":49,"content":"<p>On energy prices, the EU published a toolbox that presented the components of energy prices across Europe.

I stress that the magnitude of those effects are small.  They range from -0.2% of disposable income to 0.2% of disposable income.  What I say next should be taken in light of the fact that there is error in any sort of statistical procedure like that.  They are not terribly different from one another but the pattern is clear.  Those in the middle income deciles lose out compared with those in lower and higher income deciles.  The reason for that is twofold.  The lower income households benefited from above inflation increases to certain payments such as the fuel allowance, the living alone allowance and increases for qualified children.  Households in the upper half of income distribution are benefiting from tax cuts.  The standard rate band was increased by more than forecast inflation while tax credits were also increased by more than forecast inflation.  The typical household in the middle income deciles is probably earning too much to be receiving much or anything in social welfare but it might not be earning enough to benefit from an increase in the standard rate band.  These households are not in the top tax rate so they do not benefit from a change to the standard rate band.  Sometimes they receive the working family payment, which was increased by less than inflation in the budget so that is a real income loss for those families.  Child benefit was also frozen in cash terms.  Many of those middle income families have children so that amounts to a real income loss for them as well.  The last major contributor is the fact that USC and PRSI payments were mostly frozen in nominal terms.  That means there was a real increase in the USC and PRSI burden for most households.  If they were located in the middle four deciles, those households were not benefiting from tax cuts that would have counteracted that burden.  That is what is behind that pattern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111700002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karina Doorley"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I have two follow-up questions on that issue.

After the budget, we made the point that the budget was framed around maintaining the standard of living for households in the face of rising prices.  One way to do that is to index tax bands and credits but PRSI and USC also fall into that category.  If they are not indexed, it amounts to a real increase in USC and PRSI payments for many households.

I made the point earlier that since we joined the euro area, we sometimes have a disconnect between how our economy is performing and how the euro area as a whole is performing.

The ECB is afraid that if it were to raise rates, it would choke off the recovery and have a negative impact on it generally.

Government must be conscious of what happens in terms of inflation over the course of 2022 and look ahead to 2023 to make sure that purchasing power is maintained as far as possible while still allowing policy makers scope to target particular groups that they feel need additional policy instruments, for whatever reason.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021111700002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karina Doorley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Just to add to that, in terms of energy, European exposure to fluctuations in gas prices is being discussed at an international level.

To be clear, we are talking about affordablity.  I was talking about affordable housing all day yesterday.  I am sure the Minister will have seen the report in this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>that a major Australian pension fund is investing in these types of vehicles.  As a matter of interest, I checked the CSO database this morning.  It notes in respect of pension coverage among renters that just 8.6% of renters in the State have a voluntary pension, with a medium value of &euro;24,000.  It seems our high rents are subsidising Australian pensioners.  We are helping to build a better Australia but creating a worse Ireland.  That is a deep concern.  As I said yesterday, these amendments are practical and can be taken on board.  The committee must be constructive when we discuss Finance Bills.

I will pick up on some of his comments and his presentation on the tax paid in relation to these funds.  The two Sinn F&eacute;in amendments deal with the need for a report on the taxation of these funds.  The second amendment, No. 36, also relates to their exemption from capital gains tax.  Yesterday, the Minister spoke about a difference of opinion between Sinn F&eacute;in and Fine Gael and the Government on this, and there is no doubt that there is a difference of opinion.  I would definitely not be jetting off to London to tell investors at a roadshow to continue to invest in apartments here that are beyond the reach of ordinary people.  I would have a different set of priorities.  Maybe the Minister will clarify whether he will attend this roadshow given that his colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, has said he is not going.  If not, maybe the Minister will find time to meet the families affected by mica, which was the subject of another amendment we discussed yesterday.  The Minister still refuses to meet these families, despite what we believe to be the Department of Finance's opposition to a 100% redress scheme.<\/p> <p>  On some of the statistics the Minister placed on record yesterday, he indicated these funds paid 17.9% tax in relation to taxable events in the previous year.  That is the crucial point.  If the Government legislates to provide that certain things are not taxable events, it means no tax is paid on such events.  For instance, in the case of the disposal of a multimillion euro apartment block, a company or individual would have to pay capital gains tax at 33% and, therefore, the disposal would be a taxable event.  However, the Minister for Finance has decided that is not a taxable event and so they do not have to pay tax in relation to that.<\/p> <p> In relation to funds, we also know that a taxable event does not include circumstances in which there is a rent roll in one year of in excess of &euro;100 million.  That is also not a taxable event.  For a small company or a landlord with one, two or three properties, that would be a taxable event but for these funds it is not and, therefore, they do not pay any tax on that income.  The only time they pay tax is when dividends are paid to shareholders.  The Minister and members will be well aware that I and my party argued strongly for the need to introduce a dividend withholding tax to ensure these funds paid at least some tax.  Thankfully, that has been legislated for in previous Finance Bills.<\/p><p>However, the reality is that because of double taxation agreements those tax amounts can be written down.  We can see, even with the dividend withholding tax at 20%, that is not what the funds are paying on the disbursement of proceeds.  This goes to the core of this amendment.  It is the fact these funds are able to sell off billions of euro of Irish assets like properties and not pay CGT.<\/p><p> I will give the Minister an example.  In 2019 there was &euro;7 billion worth of property transactions in this State, mainly by these funds.  Despite the fact Covid-19 impacted on sales in 2020 there was more than &euro;3 billion worth of these type of transactions.  We can see it is the large funds which are involved in many of these.  I will give an example.  Kennedy Wilson sold Baggot Plaza for $165 million.  It avoided paying CGT of &euro;26 million as a result of what is in these Finance Bills.  Any other type of company or individual would have to pay the &euro;26 million.  What of Kennedy Wilson?  The Minister would say we will capture that tax when it pays dividends to its shareholders.  However, there is a game companies are at now.  Kennedy Wilson said the proceeds of the deal \"... will be recycled into new opportunities, including European acquisitions and developments as part of Kennedy Wilson&rsquo;s investment management platforms\".  Therefore dividends are not going to be paid out and there will be no taxable event.  What will happen is the asset pool of Kennedy Wilson will continue to increase with no tax being paid.  That is what has been facilitated here by this Minister for Finance over the last number of years.  Ireland is being sold off bit by bit, tax-free, under our noses.  It is worse than that.<\/p><p> It is not just that we are not getting taxes.  We know that because of the tax structure of these funds, they have the firepower to outbid other buyers on the market, be they an individual who wants to purchase a house in Dublin, Cork, Galway or elsewhere, or a housing agency.  One such agency came out publicly over the summer to talk about these funds being able to outbid it to the tune of, I think, &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 per unit price.  This is due simply to the taxation arrangements the Minister for Finance has facilitated time and again.  He has done so to the point where last year, when we were considering the Finance Bill, I argued for a surcharge on these funds in relation to buying up domestic property and the Minister flatly refused to introduce that.  This happened not just last year but in previous years, until he was embarrassed by the public and had to, overnight, rush through legislation that gave an appearance he was doing something but which in reality did not go far enough.  The question is: does the Minister accept that under the finance code he stands over funds are able to dispose of multi-million euro property portfolios without paying CGT and are able to reinvest those gains into their companies through new acquisitions, thus being completely tax-free?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#A00500","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett also wanted to come back in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#B00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I did.  As I said yesterday, notwithstanding the Minister's replies the decision to invite these vulture funds, investment vehicles and property speculators into this country, supposedly to assist the housing sector, will, when the history books are written, turn out to be the most disastrous decision ever taken.  Frankly, it is the biggest heist on the Irish people and has contributed to one of the worst housing crises we have ever faced.<\/p> <p>  The Minister maintains they are necessary because the State cannot do it all.  That was essentially the tenor of his response.  He contends that if we do not have them, we will not have the capital.  I still completely fail to see what benefit they have added.  We are talking about the big investment firms, wealth asset management companies or whatever they like to call themselves.  What they deliver is mostly apartments nobody can afford.  These are developments where the rents or prices are absolutely astronomical and completely beyond the reach of the vast majority of people.  Take Cherrywood for example.  I think &euro;15 million from the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, went into putting in the infrastructure there.  It is one of the biggest residential developments in the State, if not the biggest.  Years on from that we still do not know what affordable housing we are going to get back in Cherrywood.  We are getting nothing from these people.  What we do get, we get at a vast cost, far in excess of anything we would have paid if we had provided this directly on lands, taking Cherrywood as an example, which we actually had in our possession.  These were NAMA lands.  We gave them to the funds.  They built completely overpriced stuff.  They lease a little bit back to us at astronomical cost.  We still do not know how much affordable housing we are going to get and the stuff they are selling or renting on the open market will be completely beyond affordable for the vast majority of people.  Where is the benefit from this?  There is none.  They control the market and charge astronomical rents.<\/p> <p>  I will give another example.  It is one I have been banging on about for four years.  It is a multi-unit complex across the road from me.  It was originally bought out by Apollo Global Management, a wealth asset management company based in the US.  Its first move was to try to increase the rent by 60%.  Its next move was to try to mass-evict everybody in the place when it could not get away with that.  Then it flipped the complex to another vulture fund, a domestic one, which has now succeeded in mass-evicting the tenants.  That fund has left quite a lot of the property empty because it has slowly and through attrition driven out the tenants.  It has sat on those empty properties, of which there are now 13, for more than two years.  Other tenants, all of whom paid their rent and who have lived there for years are all being driven out, facing homelessness and so on.  What is the fund doing?  It is driving up the value of the asset.  Then when it shifts the asset without the tenants - the only way it could finally shift the tenants and mass-evict them was by saying it was on grounds of sale - the value of that complex will have increased.  The new owner will now be able to charge rents far in excess of the rent pressure zone, RPZ, increases.  There will be no tax paid on the capital gain made on that flipping of a property and tax paid on the rental revenue derived from the fund being able to charge absolutely extortionate rent which has, by the way, resulted in people knocking on the door of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and saying they are homeless.  These are good, decent, ordinary working people.  That is what this is facilitating.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said there is no alternative to that.  I can think of one example.  The credit unions have been screaming at the Government for the last six or seven years saying they have &euro;5 billion they would like to use to assist the State in delivering social and affordable housing.  Credit unions are not-for-profit financial institutions, beloved of the people, which are not about making money but have instead social objectives.  They are saying they would like to assist the State in the delivery of social and affordable housing.  They are being completely frustrated in their efforts to do that.  The Government would rather team up with vulture funds because apparently we need them.<\/p> <p>  I have one last point.  I asked the Minister about it yesterday.  We do not even know how much tax is being forgone.  The Minister said they pay this much tax.  That is a meaningless figure to trot out if we do not know how much tax is forgone.  How much money would they have paid in tax if they were subject to CGT and tax on their rental roll?  Until we know the answer to that, we cannot in any way assess the supposed benefit the Minister is imputing to these funds.  He will not convince me under any circumstances but at the very least, surely the finance and budget scrutiny committees of these Houses are entitled to know.  We do this with other tax expenditures.  Certainly this is something the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, of which I am a member, has been pursuing very vigorously.<\/p><p>We believe a light needs to be shone on tax expenditures.  They need to be discussed.  This is a real cost to the Exchequer in the same way as direct public expenditure is a cost, and yet we do not know how much money is being lost from the extension of these tax breaks to these ruthless profit-hungry vulture funds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#B00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I will let the Minister respond and then I will put the question on these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#C00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Next year, the Government will invest &euro;4 billion in the delivery of more homes in our country.  We will invest &euro;2.6 billion directly through the Exchequer and a further &euro;1.5 billion through the Land Development Agency.  The funding we have, in current terms alone, for responding to our housing needs is &euro;1.4 billion.<\/p> <p>  What is that leading to?  This year, it is leading to the building of more than 3,600 more social homes in our country.  It is leading to 8,750 social homes in the pipeline that will be delivered.  In the context of more homes being delivered through the private sector for private ownership and for private rental than were delivered last year, it is a figure that is growing and one that will grow again next years.  The reason those figures are relevant to the debate is they show the strong role the agencies of the Government are playing in responding to the housing needs we know are there, are growing and are the cause of anxiety and frustration for so many.<\/p> <p>  If I created at any point last night the sense that I was tired by Opposition views on this, to respond to Deputy Farrell, that was far from my intention.  I am absolutely up for a debate on this, for this year and the years to come, but I was making the point that the contribution of real estate investment trusts, REITs, to our housing market has to be seen in the context of all the other things the Government is doing to respond to all of the housing needs in society.  Of course, I am aware of the great challenges so many face with affordability and rising prices, but I would make the point it is not only Ireland that is confronting this.  It is not only this jurisdiction and this Government.  In Northern Ireland, for example, the published figures show that, up to quarter 3 of this year, prices rose by 10.7%, year on year.  Prices are now up 13% since the start of the pandemic.  That is happening in Northern Ireland where Deputy Doherty's party is in power, where it has responsibility for housing in the Department for Communities, and it is facing into the same kind of challenges with house price inflation that are developing here and the same pressures with affordability.  That is what is happening with the price of homes - houses and apartments - there.<\/p> <p>  On the performance of REITs and Irish real estate funds, IREFs, and what they bring, I have made significant changes in recent Finance Bills to deal with concerns that existed and I acknowledge the role of Deputy Doherty in dealing with issues relating to their taxation.  It is worth noting that institutional investors here in Ireland own 19,500 properties, according to the Central Statistics Office, which is less than 1% of the total housing stock of our country, and information from the CSO from 2020 shows that first-time buyers purchased more than nine times the total number of properties that were purchased by property funds, real estate firms and REITs.  That is as it should be.  First-time buyers purchase multiples of the houses and apartments that were either forward funded or purchased by these entities.<\/p> <p>  It goes back to a point that I made last night, which is, do we want there to be any role for private savings in other countries in the delivery of more homes here in Ireland?  The contention being made by the Opposition is that it does not.  The argument it is developing overall here is that more supply, more apartments and more homes being built will not help with bringing down prices and will not help with affordability.  The argument being made is that the role of REITs and IREFs in adding to supply in Ireland in some way is contributing to the challenges we have in getting more homes built.  This debate is heading in a direction where, at a time when we need more apartments and more homes of all kinds being built, increasingly the Opposition does not see more supply playing a role in fixing the huge challenges we have with regard to the supply of housing here in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  If I look at the charges that have been made here in this debate up to this point, on the issue of tax, it is the case that the taxable incident happens when income leaves these funds.  It is where tax is calculated.  As that is calculated, it means that IREFs last year paid &euro;71.9 million of tax in Ireland, which is not the same as saying they do not pay any tax at all.  They do.  That is the figure for how much tax they paid last year.  The tax is paid when the income is distributed from these funds.  For example, with regard to REITs, they are legally required to distribute 85% of the proceeds or, if they do not do that, they have to reinvest either all of the proceeds of a sale, not only a gain, or pay down their debt or pay a dividend, which at that point would be subject to dividend withholding tax.<\/p> <p>  On the role of pensions, maybe Deputy Farrell, as the debate goes on, could clarify whether Sinn F&eacute;in is saying it is now against any pension funds, including, I assume, Irish pension funds, playing a role in the delivery of either commercial property or homes here in Ireland.  Maybe the Deputy could clarify that as the debate goes on.<\/p> <p>  On the role of credit unions, I continue to be open to see what role credit unions can play in the delivery of more social housing and public housing here in Ireland.  We did some work on that, in response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, to try to meet some of the needs and issues they described.  It has not, as of yet, led to the delivery of the kind of housing output I was hoping would happen.<\/p> <p>  Overall I continue to believe the primary responsibility for the delivery of social housing here in our country rests with the Government.  We are doing that.  We have 8,700 homes now in the pipeline and we are trying to enable the private sector to build more homes for either outright purchase or rental by those who rely on the private sector to see more homes being built.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#C00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I will now put the question on amendment No. 31.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#C00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Chair-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#C00500","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":95,"content":"<p>We have spent quite a lot of time on this.

The Minister did not inform the committee whether he will travel to London for the roadshow to the investors and whether he has a different opinion than the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, on that.<\/p> <p>  Has the Minister reconsidered meeting with the families of those whose homes are literally crumbling?  The Government has not made a decision.  They want to meet the Minister.  They have appealed for the Minister to meet them online or in person.<\/p> <p>  There is no comparison between the North and the South in relation to house prices.  Consider anybody who is watching this debate, if he or she is living in this city.  The highest house price in the North is in Lisburn.  It is &pound;180,000.  The average house price is approximately &pound;150,000.  For Deputy Donohoe, as Minister for Finance, to try to compare house prices which are out of control here with those in the North is bizarre.  I am sure, as Minister, Deputy Donohoe would also know the limitations a finance minister, regardless of which party he or she is from in the Executive, has.  They do not have the power to increase taxation on funds.  Neither do they have the power to decrease taxation on funds.  Maybe Deputy Donohoe is not aware of that but a call to the Department in the North or a call to the Minister of Finance, Mr. Conor Murphy MLA, would clarify that for him.<\/p><p> The Minister referred to the overall number of homes held by institutional investors.  I do not dispute his figures, but we can use figures to make any argument we want and present them in a way that suits our agendas.  I will give the Minister a different figure.  In 2019, 57% of all new homes purchased in Dublin were private rental sales, that is, build-to-rents.  These were institutional investors.  There is a higher concentration in respect of apartments.  This is a matter of affordability as well as availability.  These apartments are costing prices that are way beyond what ordinary people are able to afford.<\/p><p> The other point that the Minister continues to gloss over relates to a question that has been raised by us and Deputy Boyd Barrett, that is, the role of these funds.  It is an easy and simplistic presentation from the Minister to suggest that these funds are financing the development of homes.  Were that the case, would it not be welcome?  However, the vast majority of private rental sale agreements between funds and developers were forward purchase, not forward funding.  I am sure the Minister knows the difference between forward purchase and forward funding.  Forwarding funding is where the funds enter into a relationship or agreement with the developer to develop and fund a certain development and they own it or have a share in it at the end of the process.  Forward purchase is where the developer secures its own finance from banks or internationally with an agreement that the fund will purchase those apartments or homes at an agreed market price at the end.  That is what is happening in Ireland.  One could argue that, by having this agreement, the homes will eventually be sold and it makes providing finance easier for the banks, but we must be clear - funds are not funding the developments.  They are only agreeing to purchase them.  In a time when there is a limited amount of supply, there is a market for these homes.  It is important that the Minister for Finance makes it clear that funds are not funding these developments and are only agreeing to purchase them at the end.<\/p><p> This has to do with fairness.  We have companies, for example, Cairn and Glenbeigh.  If they dispose of assets, they have to pay capital gains tax because they are not IREFs.  An IREF does not pay any capital gains tax.  IREFs had &euro;7.2 billion of transactions in 2019 and &euro;3 billion last year, and 2021 will probably be a bumper year, given some of the transactions that went through in quarters 1 and 2, but they are not paying any capital gains tax on them.  They are taking in the highest rents in the State, yet they do not pay any tax on their rental income.  This is definitely ideological.  The Minister believes that IREFs play a vital role, but I would argue that they do not.  Even if they are playing a role, surely they should pay a fair amount of tax.  These structures are about tax efficiencies and paying as little tax as possible for rental and commercial properties and should not be tolerated by the Minister for Finance or this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#C01100","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I will make a few brief points in the same spirit as Deputy Doherty.

If I decide to meet those who have been affected by this awful plight, it will not be because of the political points that the Deputy is making at this meeting.  It will not be because of the cheap juxtaposition that he is making between what I may do when I am travelling or not, whichever the case may be.  Those families are facing stress, anxiety and worry.  I hope that, if they are tuning in to see the Deputy make that point, they will allow me to say to them that I will not respond to those kinds of political points where the Deputy is trying to compare my meeting businesses who may be looking to build homes with the plight of those who have homes that are falling down.  If I decide to meet them, and I am aware of the requests, I will do it because I recognise their anguish and anxiety.<\/p> <p>  I have been reluctant to do it to this point for a simple reason.  As Minister for Finance, I am pretty much involved in every Government decision that involves the expenditure of Government money that may confer a responsibility on us in future.  I always have groups that want to meet me that are affected by the decisions I make.  I have to respect that those groups have other Ministers that deal with them first.  If I accept an approach that means I will be meeting all who are directly affected by decisions in which I am involved, it will inevitably mean that the role of other Ministers is undermined.  This is the simple reason.  It is not because I am diminishing or devaluing the experience that they are going through.  It is because I respect the fact that they have engaged considerably with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, I respect the work that he does and I respect the fact that he is the lead Minister in this regard.  I am working with him closely on it.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's point on taxation, I reiterate that, when it comes to the role of IREFs, they paid just over &euro;86 million in tax in our jurisdiction in 2019.  Excuse me - it was &euro;72 million.  It is fair enough to get into a debate on whether that was enough tax and whether they should be paying more, but to indicate that they are not paying any tax at all belies the fact that they have been.  Where the tax is paid is where the income is returned.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Doherty also made a point about the difference between forward purchase and forward funding.  Of course I know the difference, but I contend that, when it comes to forward purchase, the role of pension funds, for example, in giving certainty that an apartment complex is going to go ahead through the purchasing decision it makes enables those homes to be built.<\/p><p>What Sinn F&eacute;in currently alleging and what it alleges day after day in accusations it makes about REITs is that building fewer homes will help in fixing our housing challenge and I reject that entirely.<\/p><p> On the final point the Deputy made on Northern Ireland-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#D01600","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>Will the Minister have a serious debate or read us this nonsense?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#E00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":119,"content":"<p>With regard to the final point the Deputy made on Northern Ireland, I am well aware of the responsibilities and differences between myself and the Minister of Finance, Mr. Murphy MLA.

With the permission of the committee, I will speak a little longer on this than I normally would so the Oireachtas is fully informed of what I am doing and why.<\/p><p>Section 31 introduces a new interest-limitation rules as required by the EU anti-tax avoidance directive, ATAD, by inserting a new part 35D into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Interest-limitation rules form part of the recommendations of the OECD base erosion and profit sharing, BEPS, project, with the ATAD providing the basis for co-ordinating implementation of anti-BEPS measures by EU member states.  Following enactment of this Bill, Ireland will have completed transposition of the directive.<\/p><p>The interest-limitation rule is intended to limit base erosion through the use of excessive interest deductions.  These rules are complex.  Deputies will be aware that my Department held an initial public consultation on these rules and the anti-hybrid rules in November 2018.  This was followed by two feedback statements that were publicly made available by my Department in December 2020 and at the start of this summer, in July.<\/p><p>Ireland has pre-existing rules to prevent excessive interest deductions that operate in a different manner from the ATAD rule.  The current Irish approach can best be summarised as one which limits interest deductions to be available only in specific scenarios largely based on the purpose of the borrowing.  This is combined with targeted anti-avoidance rules which have evolved over time to combat abusive arrangements.  The new ATAD rule will impose a new additional limit which links a taxpayer's allowable net interest deductions directly to its earnings.  It limits the maximum net deduction to 30% for earnings before tax and before deductions for net interest expense, depreciation and amortisation.  When this threshold is breached, interest deductibility is deferred until there is sufficient interest capacity to allow deduction.<\/p><p>The key features of the provision are as follows.  The interest limitation rules apply to all corporation taxpayers but with certain erosions and reliefs as provided for in ATAD where the risk of base erosion and profit sharing is thought to be minimal.  There is a <i>de minimis<\/i>exemption for companies with interest of not more than &euro;3 million in a year.  Stand-alone companies, in other words companies with no associates, group companies or permanent establishments outside Ireland, are outside the scope of the rule.  Interest on borrowings in respect of long-term public infrastructure projects and interest on legacy debt, the terms of which were agreed before 17 June 2016, are also outside the scope.  A group of Irish companies may, where certain conditions are met, be treated as a single taxpayer for the purposes of the restriction.  The rules also take into account the debt provision of a multinational group when assessing whether interest deductions are being taken in Ireland.  Finally, disallowed interest may be carried forward to the succeeding accounting periods where it may qualify for deduction if the company has sufficient interest capacity to deduct interest on its earnings before the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, EBITDA, limit.  Where a company has spare capacity in a year, this may be carried forward for up to five years.  The new interest-limitation legislation applies to accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#F01200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I note that one of exceptions to the interest limitation rule as set out in section 31 is a stand-alone company, that is, a company that has no associated enterprises or permanent establishments.  I would like the Minister to clarify if a company using the orphan structure would meet this exemption criterion?  I am sure he was expecting that question.  One of the things that professional service companies like to talk about is the orphan structure because it is considered a stand-alone company even though, effectively, it will be under the control of another company or companies.  I ask the Minister to clarify if this structure would meet the definition of a stand-alone company.<\/p> <p>  Another exception to the interest limitation rule as set out in section 31 is a long-term public infrastructure project, that is, a project to provide, upgrade, operate or maintain a large-scale asset in the general public interest.

On the question regarding the orphan structure and the stand-alone company, as the committee will be aware, an orphan company is a company that is bankruptcy remote.  This means that in the event of a bankruptcy, the assets of the securitisation company are ring-fenced against the liabilities of that company.  The orphaning of securitisation companies is standard practice in large public capital market transactions.  There are circumstances in which a company may be orphaned and not included in any consolidated financial statements, but may not meet the very strict criteria to qualify as a stand-alone entity.  In those situations, the orphaned company may be considered to be part of a single company worldwide group.  In such a scenario, the company is subject to the interest limitation rule but may be able to avail of group relief, subject to it not having any transactions with associated companies which give rise to interest expense.<\/p> <p>  To summarise, in a situation where an orphan company is considered to be part of a single company worldwide group, it is subject to these rules and the criteria I have just mentioned.  Beyond that, if the stand-alone entity is not part of a worldwide group, it would not be covered by these rules.  The reason is that in the development of the work that led up to this point, the view was formed that stand-alone entities pose significantly less risk, if any, to base erosion and profit sharing, BEPS, through interest deductions as they are generally financed by third party debt from unconnected entities.  For that reason, a stand-alone entity in those circumstances would be exempt from the operation of the interest limitation rule.  In circumstances where the standalone company is outside of a worldwide group and financed by third party debt from an entity that is unconnected to it, it will be exempt from the operation of this rule.<\/p> <p>  On public private partnerships, the answer is likely to be that they will be exempt from this, but it will have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, depending on the funding arrangement for the public private partnership in question.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked a question with regard to legacy debt.

I just want to know why the Minister and his predecessor, Michael Noonan, decided to not implement and transpose the directive, which we were supposed to have in place at the end of 2018.  The Minister and his predecessor argued that our existing rules were just as effective.  If that was the case, we would not have to transpose it until 2024 but that is not the case because, as the Minister rightly acknowledged, in 2019 formal notice was served on Ireland because of our refusal to transpose this agreement into Irish domestic law.<\/p> <p>  It is not the first time we have dragged our heels as a State in regard to these issues but we are now in this position.  It is unfortunate that Europe had to take that action against the State to make the Government and the Minister, who was in charge at the time, change tack and implement this legislation, which is about the profit shifting of large profitable entities that are resident in the State.<\/p> <p>  That being said, I would like to ask on which sectors, in the Minister's view, this will have the greatest impact in terms of increasing their taxation burden through the introduction of these limits.  Does the Minister see any impact, for example, in regard to the aircraft leasing sector, given how this will apply to it and with Dublin being a global centre for that type of activity?  Are there other sectors that the Minister is concerned about?  In the transposition of this directive, given there is scope in regard to how it is transposed, has the Minister taken any decisions that have in mind particular sectors and how they would be impacted?<\/p> <p>  If the Minister can submit to us the detailed note he has on each of the amendments before Report Stage, that would be appreciated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#H00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":147,"content":"<p>It is important to put our efforts on ATAD transposition into context.  There were many other elements of the ATAD that were equally important and that Ireland fully delivered on time, for example, changes with regard to exit tax, control of foreign companies, hybrids and the work we have under way in this Finance Bill with regard to reverse hybrids.  It is the case that while we delivered all of those other expectations on time, there was a particular issue that we had in regard to interest limitation.  The stance I took was driven by my view that the existing rules we had were effective.  The Commission took a different view in this regard.  We were not on our own within the European Union on this particular issue and other countries were also subject to proceedings from the Commission.  While I never want to be in the position where we are subject to that kind of action by the Commission of the European Union, I would still make the point to the committee that it has paused what it is doing in recognition of the action we are now taking in this Finance Bill.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the sectors that could be affected by this, they are ones that tend to have very valuable assets and very high levels of borrowing, and, therefore, the sector likely to be most affected by this here in Ireland will be the aircraft leasing sector because of the value of the aeroplanes leased and the role of borrowing in this regard.  The Deputy asks whether they have looked to engage with us on this.  Through the public statements we published in regard to how we are going to implement this and the public consultation we have had under way on the general implementation of this change and other changes in corporate tax, they have given us their views in regard to it.  As best as we can, we have tried to deal with the different issues they have raised but, overall, this is a fundamental change that we believe is necessary to fulfil the commitments we have both to the OECD and to the EU.  Any public consultation response that we have made or received is published on the Department of Finance website.

a report before the D&aacute;il, on the functioning of section 481 relief for investment in films, particularly in relation to the degree to which it is meeting the requirement to meet &ldquo;quality employment and training&rdquo; and to examine whether film producer companies in receipt of the relief are hiding behind short lived designated activity companies (DAC) to avoid taking responsibility for workers employed on film productions supported by the relief.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>This is an issue we discuss pretty much every year at the Finance Bill.  It relates to section 481 tax relief for investment in films and the question of whether the condition of quality employment and training, which is a condition of the granting of this relief to film producer companies, is actually being met.  The Minister has been helpful in responding to our concerns on this issue over the last number of years.<\/p><p>He has attempted to tighten the conditionality regarding the quality employment and training provisions of the relief, most notably requiring an undertaking in respect of quality employment for the recipients of the relief, on foot of the concerns raised by film workers and by me and others over the years.  However, the problem is that there is very good reason to believe that this has not been enough to deal with the practice of getting around the requirements for quality employment and training by recipients of the section 481 relief.<\/p><p> The Minister will be aware that when this question is raised, whether it is in this committee, in arts committees, in debates in the D&aacute;il or between the different players in the debate about the section 481 relief, the film producers who are the recipients and their representatives in Screen Producers Ireland, in particular, will say that it is a project-to-project thing so one cannot really expect security of employment and income because that is just the nature of the industry.  They say they will do their best to comply with the law and so forth, but that one cannot expect security of employment.  I do not accept the case that just because something is project-to-project, the workers who work in an industry for decades are basically, due to the way the industry works, only as good as not even their last job but only as good as the producer deems them to be at the moment in which they apply for their next job, even though they may have worked in the industry for decades.  That is not fair.  I do not believe it is in line with the working time directive and I certainly do not believe it is in line with the requirement under section 481 to have quality employment and training.  It is not quality employment and training.<\/p><p> A person can be a painter, stage crew or somebody who is below the line, as they are sometimes referred to patronisingly by some elements in the film industry.  The \"below the line\" workforce is the terribly insulting term that is often trotted out in these discussions.  There are the above-the-line people, the flashy people perhaps, and there are the below-the-line people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#H04400","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":189,"content":"<p>How would Deputy Boyd Barrett describe himself?

The Minister understands my point.  It is an insulting notion because they are all equally important in the production of a film - everybody from the painter, costume designer, stagehand and transport drivers to the actors, directors and so forth.<\/p> <p>  It is the case that if one is a painter who paints the stages, a very specialised thing, or somebody who works in props, again a very specialised thing, one might have worked in the industry for up to four decades and for the same group of producers.  It is a group, and I have spoken to the Minister's officials about this.  It is not necessarily the same producer every time, but in Ireland there is a relatively small group of producer companies.  They are the overwhelming beneficiaries of section 481, and everybody knows who they are.  There are smaller producer companies that may be set up on a much smaller scale, but everybody knows the big producer companies and everybody knows they are the largest recipients, year in and year out.  They also have representatives and friends on Screen Ireland, which is the official State body and which is, in my opinion, just looking after their interests.  I believe there is a conflict of interest in many cases in the way in which Screen Ireland, which is also dishing out grants, has such a close relationship to one particular group in the film industry, the film producers.  That is an issue that must be addressed.  It is not particularly in the Minister's remit, but part of the problem here is that there are a number of different Departments dealing with this, including the Department of Finance, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.<\/p> <p>  My point is that somebody can have worked for three or four decades for the same group of producers, but when a film is being done by a producer the person has worked with previously and when the person asks to work on it the producer can just say: \"No, we do not like you.  You spoke up about conditions on the job and you spoke publicly in a way that was critical of us, so you are not getting a job here\".  There is nothing in the law to prevent that from happening.  They seem to be able to get away with it.  I am somewhat nonplussed as to how they are doing this, given that the Minister has made genuine efforts and I acknowledge them.  When the worker who is a victim of that goes to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, or the Labour Court, a representative of the film producer is standing across from him or her.  The worker has worked with that film producer on a section 481 production.  The film producer knows it, the worker knows it and they have often done it time and again, yet the film producer can say that the worker was never his or her employee.  Often the producer will send a representative to say it because he or she does not even turn up.  Recently at one of these hearings the producer sent in somebody from IBEC, which is quite extraordinary.  I do not understand how IBEC is able to represent somebody in such a situation.  That is what is happening.<\/p> <p>  Why is that?  It is because the worker is an employee of the designated activity company, DAC.  The film producer company gets section 481.  The film producer sets up the DAC for the specific film project, but when the worker asserts his or her rights and says those rights are being breached in terms of a collective agreement - the WRC found in favour of the workers recently for breach of a collective agreement - or in terms of unfair dismissal because the worker had previously worked for the film producer and the worker is dismissed, the film producer who is getting the relief, and I remind the Minister that it is conditional on quality employment and training, says he is not the employer, even though he self-evidently is the employer because the DAC he set up is the employer.  The DAC no longer exists and, therefore, the producer has no responsibility to the worker.  That is fundamentally wrong.<\/p> <p>  I also believe that if the EU Commission, and it is getting to that level, was aware that the scale of the relief that is being distributed through section 481 was being abused in this way, it would ask serious questions about state aid.  Do not get me wrong, the State's aid to the arts is absolutely necessary and justified.  I always have to reiterate that I want more money to go into film, arts, culture and so forth, and I have actively campaigned for that, but I want it to be conditional on decent employment conditions for the people who work in the sector.  The specific state aid that is allowed in the area of arts, culture and film requires an effort to build up companies of scale and a permanent pool of skills.  As I discussed with one of the Minister's officials yesterday, it cannot be the case, and nobody is asking for it, that a particular film producer company employs the workers for 52 weeks of the year on a permanent basis.  Let us dispense with that red herring in case it is thrown out.  Nobody is asking for that.<\/p><p>Everybody knows that is not possible.  Personally, I think it is possible at some point in the future but I will leave that for another day.  There used to be film studios that did that kind of thing and, arguably, film was better then, but I will leave that aside.  Even without that argument, that production can be a bit more episodic does not absolve the film producer companies that get this money again and again, particularly at the moment when there is a lot of film production happening and there is no real shortage of work.  The film producer can say they work in a precarious industry, from film to film, and claim that, therefore, they have no obligation to the worker.  They can say that if the worker ever tries to assert any obligations on the producer's part to the worker, they will simply deny they have any employment relationship with him or her.<\/p><p> That is still not being addressed and it means people are wide open to and have been victims of straight-up blacklisting.  If they rock the boat, they can become victims of blacklisting.  People from the acting fraternity have even appeared before Oireachtas committees and said they are afraid.  Let us think about Harvey Weinstein and all that stuff.  He was doing this for years.  If you did not do what he wanted you to do, sometimes awful things, he had the power to put you out of the industry and say you will never work again.  That can happen above the line - it does happen there - and it can also happen to the below-the-line people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#J00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I tabled amendment No. 73.  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett's comments.  As long as we have been members of the committee, he has raised these issues.  Our amendment seeks the production of a report on film relief in the context of the pay, conditions and training of employees within the sector and options to enhance the scheme with respect to employee pay, conditions and training.<\/p> <p>  Earlier we drew comparisons, or perhaps non-comparisons, between North and South in respect of housing.  One area where we could look to the North, and where the minister there does have powers, relates to the terms and conditions of contracts.  The Northern Executive has just been accredited as a living wage employer, something this State has not achieved.  It is wrong that those working within the public service or the Civil Service would not automatically earn the living wage.  Perhaps the Minister will update on us whether there is an intention to move there.  Crucially, in the North, that includes those who provide services such as catering, cleaning and others.  More important, as the Minister of Finance in the North, Conor Murphy, has informed me, is that from June of next year, the Executive will use the &pound;3 billion it spends on goods and services for a greater public good.  This will ensure any contract that bids for and is granted those services, whether in construction or supplying to the Departments of Education, Health or whatever, will have to abide by the living wage.  Nobody will be able to be employed at a rate under the living wage.<\/p> <p>  That is an example we should follow here, and that is the spirit of our amendment.  It is not about the granting of a contract of State money to a private sector employee, which is what the Executive will commence doing from June of next year, whereby in the case of every private sector contract that is awarded, all the staff will have to be paid at least the living wage.  Rather, given that the section seeks to grant a benefit on companies here through tax relief, we are saying we should insist on decent pay and conditions and opportunities for those working within the sector.<\/p> <p>  It is timely to have a review of this, not just of the section I mentioned but the wider section, to examine how the State uses the vast sums it spends on contracts and to ensure it will not only be of benefit in the case of contracts awarded for the provision of, say, healthcare or education, but also that there will be the enhanced benefit whereby employees within the sector will be paid fairly.<\/p> <p>  I strongly urge the Minister to examine this issue next year with a wider lens, bringing this sector in particular, about which concerns have been raised for many years, under that microscope.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#K00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Section 481 provides a 32% payable credit for eligible expenditure on film production in Ireland.  The scheme is intended to act as a stimulus to the creation of an indigenous film industry in the State, creating quality employment opportunities and supporting the expression of Irish culture.  The audiovisual sector has largely continued to function through the most challenging period of the pandemic.  It has provided quality employment at a time when so many other elements of the culture sector were severely impacted.  The protocols put in place by the sector have meant workers have been in high demand.<\/p> <p>  It is expected that in the provision of such opportunities there will be compliance with all applicable employment obligations, including legislative obligations and policies and procedures to ensure dignity at work.  To grow the industry in Ireland, we want quality and sustained employment and training opportunities in the sector.  This is reflected in the undertaking of quality employment, which is required to be signed as part of the application process for section 481.  This undertaking applies not only to the producer company but also to the designated activity company.  In addition to the requirement to sign an undertaking of quality employment, an applicant company is required also to submit a skills development plan as part of its section 481 application if the relevant project is worth more than &euro;2 million.<\/p> <p>  There has been good progress over the past year in respect of negotiations between employer and worker representative bodies in the sector.  For example, from January 2021, a modernised crew agreement was introduced that promotes good practice, regularises evolving work practices and provides for an industry pension scheme operating under the construction workers pension scheme.  A monitoring structure to oversee the operation of the agreement is included, as is a commitment to develop the first work-life balance policy for the film and television industry.  The agreement acts as a framework for the industry, covering all grades except film construction.<\/p> <p>  I understand, however, that a proposed construction crew agreement is also under negotiation, and my officials will continue to monitor progress in this regard.  In respect of any specific workplace disputes, the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court are the organs of the State tasked with the resolution of disputes relating to workplace matters and employment rights, and it is appropriate that any relevant claims be referred to these bodies for adjudication.  As a result, I am not able to comment on those matters.<\/p> <p>  In light of these points with regard to the undertaking of quality employment, the skills development plan and the progress with regard to employment relations within the industry, I do not believe it is necessary to undertake a report in line with what has been requested by the Deputies.<\/p> <p>  To respond specifically to Deputy Boyd Barrett on continuity of employment issues, they need to be ruled on by the WRC but this has not yet happened.  My understanding is the issue at stake relates to the fact an individual has worked for a different producer between the projects for which they are claiming continuity.<\/p><p>That is an industrial relations matter that the WRC needs to form a view and make a ruling on, as opposed to it being a matter for tax policy.<\/p><p> To respond to the broad issue the Deputy raised about continuity, many parts of our economy have different employers within a particular sector and employees move between those different employers.  However, that does not give the employee the ability to make the case for continuity of employment if he or she has moved from one employer to another.  I have said to the Deputy in the past - and I know we disagree on it - that film is a sector of the economy, both here in Ireland and across the world, in which employment takes place project to project, film to film.  The progress made by the different bodies in the sector in respect of the regulation of the industry, representation and the agreement on crew means it is in a very different place from where it was a few years ago, when the Deputy began to raise issues about the sector.  Work is under way on a modernised crew agreement, there is a requirement for a skills development plan and work is under way with regard to a construction crew agreement.  None of this was happening a few years ago.  The Deputies, the Department and I have made an input and played a role in that.  That is the way in which we can make progress on the issues Deputies Boyd Barrett and Doherty have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#K00300","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":195,"content":"<p>As I have acknowledged previously, the Minister, more than any other Minister - there are a few Ministers who potentially should have been involved in this - and his officials have responded and there have been changes and improvements.<\/p><p>The awful irony in all of this is that the people who brought the issue to the attention of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in 2018 and gave evidence to the committee have not worked in the industry again.  They are people who had worked in the industry for decades.  There is no doubt that they have been blacklisted out of the industry and subjected to horrendous vilification.  I am sure the people who vilified them will say they are awful people but normally when someone is vilified in an employment relationship, there is a process in place.  If an employer has a problem with an employee, or <i>vice versa<\/i>, there is a process involving disciplinary action, cautions, hearings and so on.  The problem is that these workers have never had the opportunity to have their case heard in a fair way because there is nothing currently to prevent a film producer from simply telling a worker they are not being employed again because they do not like that worker, what he or she said or the criticism he or she made.  The reason there is nothing to stop that is because of the acceptance of this narrative of employees working project to project and the relationship of the DAC to the producer company.<\/p><p>I am nonplussed, as I said.  I know the Minister stated the requirement for equality, employment and training applies to both the DAC and the producer company.  The problem is the relationship between the producer company, which is the recipient, and the DAC, because the DAC is short-lived.  For example, if an employee works for the DAC, while that DAC is in existence, it is required to comply.  However, if it does not comply and the employee later takes a case, the producer company, the only entity that still exists - it is above the project to project work and is the continuous factor in all of this - will argue that the DAC is gone.  The producer company will assert that it does not have an obligation and cannot be held responsible because the DAC, which had an obligation, no longer exists.  However, the person who set up the DAC still exists and that person is the producer company, which is in receipt of the relief.<\/p><p>The Minister has stated that it is up to the WRC to give a direction on this matter, but I do not think that is the case.  I am asking the Minister and his officials to look at the detail.  An instruction should come from the Government, clearly stating that where a film producer tells a worker that they do not have an employment relationship with that worker because the DAC had the relationship with the worker, it is not an acceptable case to make and film producers should not be allowed to make such a case because, in fact, the DAC and film producer are one and the same.  If that instruction went to the WRC or the legislation was tweaked as required to say that that is not an acceptable position to adopt or case to make when employees worked on productions funded under section 481 or, for that matter, by Screen Ireland, it would make a big difference.  It would clarify the position.<\/p><p>Such a direction should apply to the pool of people who have worked in the industry for the past ten years, 15 years or 20 years.  I know of a man, who had worked on the first season of &quot;Vikings&quot; and stood outside Ardmore Studios or Ashford Studios - I am not sure which - a few weeks ago.  He has since died.  He fully expected to work on the next season of the show but he was considered to be associated with the wrong people, was not re-employed and he is now longer alive.  Shortly before he ended his life, he stood outside a place where he had worked for years, wondering why he was not taken back in.  It is brutal stuff, and there is nothing to stop it happening.  For many of the people involved, it is far too late by the time they get through the WRC process, the Labour Court and all the rest of it.  The Minister knows what a rigmarole that is.  The film producer companies have resources, whereas the individuals who have worked in the industry for years and are trying to make their own case do not.  It is just not right.  <\/p><p>The Minister argued that because there are sectors in which there are a number of different operators and people move between these operators, if someone moves from employer A to employer B and then back to employer A, that is just what happens and that is life.  However, I put it to him that there are two big differences in this case.  The first is that none of these film productions - and I mean none - would exist without public money.  The State has a big responsibility here.  The film industry is not like the music industry in this country, for example, because the music industry never got State money until Covid.  The film industry is utterly reliant on public money.  No films would be made without it and, therefore, the State has a particular responsibility in that regard.  Second, if it was just a case of lots of different actors in a particular sector moving from employer A to employer B or from employer B to employer C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J and so on, perhaps that case could be made.  However, as I said, we know there is actually a relatively small group who are the beneficiaries.  Workers will perhaps move from employer A to employer B, and then to employer C, but they are only moving between those three employers.<\/p><p>The film industry is a publicly-funded sector in which the various players would not exist without public money and where, generally speaking, the workers are bouncing between the big three or four players.<\/p><p>That is not being addressed.  Ultimately, unless it is addressed, it will operate to the detriment of the quality of film and to the sector as a whole.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Doherty referred to the North.  I agree absolutely about what he said about the living wage although when one is working on a film, one is quite well paid and generally receives more than the living wage.  The problem is what happens afterwards, especially if the industry decides it does not like you.  It certainly seems to me that in other jurisdictions there is far greater rights for the pool of people to be seen as part of that pool and not to be arbitrarily excluded from the pool because somebody does not like them.  That is what I am looking for.<br\/><br\/>To use an analogy, in the worst-case scenarios of the <i>Strumpet City<\/i>days, dockers would turn up and there were opportunities to load ships for different companies.  The scenario was that a company would either take a worker or not, on a completely arbitrary basis.  One of the ways that was addressed was through the establishment of a stevedore company where dockers became part of a pool.  They might be loading different companies' ships but there was a sort of registered pool of people and, therefore, a bit of fairness in the allocation of work, even though different companies were operating within that pool of dockers.  Something like that could and should be done so that we know who is in the pool of employees and who is in the pool of trainees.  Even commitments on training mean very little if we cannot track the journey of the trainee.  Is the person who was trained on film A still around for film D that is being made by the same producer or group of producers?  Has that trainee qualified?  Is he or she now accepted as part of a pool of people with skills in the film sector?Is he or she, at any point, excluded from that pool?  That issue is not being addressed.<br\/><br\/>I appeal to the Minister and his officials to look at this again to try to tighten it up.  If there is uncertainty as to precisely how the working time directive and the relationship between DACs and production companies are playing out and being represented by different groups in the Labour Court, I believe it would be entirely right and legitimate for the Minister to intervene and state what the Government wants and how it wants these things interpreted.  If that requires now statutory instruments or legislative change, so be it.  I am not even sure it does require those things.  The situation needs to be clarified and the Government needs to crack the whip, as it were.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#L00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I will make a point I think is relevant to the concern the Deputy raised about the role and operation of DACs.  A DAC is required to exist for a year after the cessation of a project in order to receive that tax benefits of section 481.  That may not have been relevant a few years ago because we did not have the kind of framework, from an industrial relations perspective, that now exists.  I acknowledge that the Deputy has played an important role in making that happen.  There is a framework in place within the sector to deal with issues relating to pensions and how people are treated.  The DAC must exist for a year after the project has ceased.  We now have a framework through which issues such as this can be dealt with.  Surely the space is there within the WRC or the Labour Court to hear issues relevant to the agreements that have now been brokered within a year after a project has concluded.<\/p> <p>  I understand the Deputy's point that a DAC does not exist after a period of time and someone can feel like they are going from DAC to DAC even though the group of people in these DACs may well be the same.  However, the difference between now and the past is that we now have agreements against which the conduct of employers needs to be evaluated.  I would be surprised if the Labour Court or the WRC was unable to deal with the issues within a year.  During that year, the DAC is still required to be in existence as a condition of receiving the section 481 relief.  That is a big difference when compared with where we have been in the past.  I do not mean that in the sense of what has happened from a tax point of view, as we debated last time, but simply from the perspective of the kind of work that has happened from a labour relations point of view within the sector.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy said that many of these films or television series would not be made without them.  To be more specific, they would not be made in Ireland without it.  The content would still be made because the demand for films and television series that are all over streaming channels is hotter than it ever has been.  They would still be made but the question is where they would be made.  We want them to be made in Ireland to benefit all who work in the sector.  I do not like to refer to people who work above and below the line.  I want jobs for all those who work in the sector.  I have met a few such people recently and it appears the sector is extraordinarily busy at the moment and doing very well.<\/p> <p>  In response to the different issues the Deputy has raised, I will say a word about progress that has been made.  The WRC, in August 2020, made four different recommendations.  It recognised the importance of good industrial relations and anticipated or was looking for an agreement that would deal with issues relating to pay, terms and conditions, travel time, overtime, sick leave, pensions and all of the issues one would expect to be dealt with in any good workplace.  That is now in place for those involved in shooting films or television series.  That was agreed between SIPTU and Screen Producers Ireland.  That includes within it an industry pension screen, an agreement about how this will be monitored and a commitment to a work-life balance policy.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also made a point about skills and training.  An agreement is now in place between Screen Ireland and Screen Skills Ireland to put a greater focus on training and upskilling.  Screen Skills Ireland has in the past two years, I am informed, completely changed the operation of the upskilling requirement of section 481 relief to provide far more skill opportunities and training opportunities, regardless of whether a worker is joining the industry for the first time or has been at it for a little while.  There is also more recognition of the role of guilds within the industry and on how HR can be improved within that sector.  I imagine that is critical for dealing with many of the different issues the Deputy has raised.<\/p> <p>  I will continue to take an active role in what goes on here.  My officials and I accept the importance of points the Deputy raised two finance bills ago.  We are making progress.  We could always make more, but I think we are making progress.  I met representatives from SIPTU and Screen Producers Ireland to indicate my interest in this subject.  The account they gave me of what was going on in the sector was pretty positive.  They talked about the good change that is happening and I was encouraged by that.  We will continue to keep at this.<\/p><p>I do not believe that the Finance Bill is the way in which reports on this issue should be provided and that is why I am not accepting these amendments.  I will continue to monitor this issue and see how we can support gradual positive change within a sector that is important to Ireland but within which there are issues that need to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#M00300","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I genuinely appreciate the engagement by the Minister on this matter, but more needs to be done.

While one union may be happy and, indeed, may have benefited from the actions of others in bringing certain issues forward and putting pressure on in terms of those issues, it would be a cruel and unfair irony if the whistleblowers end up being the victims even though they are ones who helped to move the goalposts and to which the Minister has responded.  I think that injustice must be addressed but questions remain beyond that particular group.  I have recently talked to actors.  The dancers who worked on a film called \"Disenchanted\" made the point that their employment conditions here were much less favourable than similar film situations in the UK.  There remains a problem in that people who raise questions are vulnerable.  Certain people can make agreements but other people should have the right to question those agreements, at least.  They should not be punished and penalised if they question things that others say are fine with nothing to see.  We must protect people, give them the right to question things and ensure they are not victimised if they ask questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#N00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#N00300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I will table an amendment on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#N00400","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy wish to withdraw this amendment or press it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#N00500","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I will press it on the basis that I can come back to this matter on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#N00600","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637107200,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637107200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>SECTION  32<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":207,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 52 has been ruled out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#N00900","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637107200,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 52 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637107200,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 32 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I do not quite understand the section and I ask the Minister to explain it.  I have read the notes and the memorandum and I have tabled a parliamentary question.  I want to understand what is meant by the change in the terms and the extension of the eligibility for section 481 to cover labour-only services.  I am sure the Department officials know that I am concerned about bogus self-employment.  I missed the discussion yesterday but Deputy Nash mentioned bogus self-employment in a well-aimed amendment.  In my opinion, bogus self-employment must be defined objectively and not left to be defined by the employer, for example in circumstances in which the employer says a job is not bogus self-employment and the particular contractor is happy with the arrangement.  Others who work in the industry, or might want to work in the industry, think this is an abuse that effectively excludes them and are concerned about the lack of objective criteria for what constitutes quality employment and training and is thereby eligible for the benefits of the relief.  That is my concern.  I am not saying I am right to be concerned; I am saying I am concerned.  Therefore, I seek an assurance and certainty from the Minister that the relief is not, potentially, going to be abused.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#N01200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I will begin by briefly explaining why this does not represent a change of policy by the Government in this area.  Section 32 amends the definition of \"eligible expenditure\" in section 481 to confirm the current practice that payments made directly by a qualifying company, in respect of the provision of labour-only services by an individual, for the purposes of the production of a qualifying film qualify as eligible expenditure.  Eligible expenditure is the portion of the total cost of production of a qualifying film that is expended on the production of the film in the State.<\/p> <p>  Deputies may recall that in the Finance Act 2018, the film tax credit was moved to a self-assessment basis.  This involved the introduction of a substantial body of new legislation to govern matters previously dealt with by regulation.  It was subsequently discovered that the new legislation unintentionally created a discrepancy between the definition of eligible expenditure and the long-standing practice in the industry.  Payments in respect of self-employed individuals providing a labour-only service had always been treated as qualifying for section 481 relief and this treatment was expressly stated in previous Revenue guidance.  This amendment confirms that the meaning of \"eligible expenditure\" includes labour-only services as described, and in addition to expenditure incurred directly by the qualifying company in the employment of eligible individuals on the production of the film and expenditure incurred directly or indirectly by the qualifying company in the provision of certain goods, services and facilities by a person who is carrying out their business from a fixed base of business in Ireland.  This recognises that self-employed services may be provided in the sector but it is not intended to create a bias either towards or for self-employment.  The characterisation of a worker as employed or self-employed will continue to be governed by the code of practice on employment status having regard to the specific circumstances of each individual case.<\/p> <p>  This change does not change our policy.  It is policy-neutral towards the question of self-employment.  It does not change the policy with regard to that.  To be clear, if it subsequently comes to light that we have done anything here that changes the balance in any direction, we will look at it again but it is not our intention to do so.  We are simply putting on a statutory footing the guidance that currently exists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#N01300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637107200,"counter":212,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637107200,"counter":213,"content":"<p>SECTION 33<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":214,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 53 to 55, inclusive, and amendments Nos. 57 to 69, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#N01600","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 53:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 78, line 20, to delete &ldquo;an EEA state&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;a European Economic Area (EEA) state&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>Section 33 introduces a new relief for the digital gaming sector.  The aim of the measure is to provide an incentive to digital games developers to produce digital games that contribute to the promotion and expression of Irish and European culture.  Subsequent to the publication of the Finance Bill, the requirement for a number of technical amendments to the legislation, as published, was identified to ensure the provisions operate as intended.  I, therefore, commend the amendments to the committee.  What I will do, in speaking to these amendments, is give a broader perspective on the Bill and the section itself.<\/p><p>The relief will take the form of a corporation tax credit, the beneficiaries of which will be digital games development companies.  The rate of the credit will be 32%, available on eligible expenditure of up to &euro;25 million per game.  The credit will be available on expenditure incurred in the design, production and testing stages of the development of qualifying digital games, provided certain conditions are met.<\/p><p>In order to be eligible, the qualifying expenditure must be not less than &euro;100,000.  Games produced solely or mainly for the purposes of gambling or advertising will not be eligible for the relief.<\/p><p> The relief will be a cultural one for state aid purposes and, therefore, a cultural test will also apply.  In order to claim the credit, a company must first apply for cultural certification as a qualifying digital game to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  An interim cultural certificate may be applied for at any point before or during the development of the digital game and will only allow relief to be claimed annually in respect of qualifying expenditure.  On completion of a digital game, the company must apply for a final cultural certification and claim any balance of the credit due.  As part of the certification process, a digital games development company will be required to sign an undertaking of quality employment.  As already stated, the relief will constitute a state aid and, accordingly, must be notified to and approved by the European Commission prior to commencement.  Accordingly, it is being introduced subject to a commencement order.  The scheme will run until 31 December 2025.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#N01700","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I have no problem with the amendments.

We have dealt in particular with Imirt, a representative body that has a variety of different companies included within it.  It has given a positive response to the measure.

As part of the certification process, a digital games development company will be required to complete an undertaking in respect of quality employment in order to qualify for the relief.  This is similar to the requirements in place under section 481.  The undertaking commits applicants to compliance with all relevant employment legislation.  It is crucial that employee rights are upheld in all industries.  The inclusion of this provision reinforces the importance of adhering to employment legislation in the digital gaming sector.  Should a digital games development company fail to adhere to a condition or obligation specified in the undertaking, the conditions of certification will not have been met, which means that any credit claimed pursuant to an interim or final certificate may be subject to recoupment by Revenue and an application for a final certificate may be refused.<\/p> <p>  The issue of bogus self-employment is relevant to all sectors and, as such, needs to be treated in that way.  I am advised that Revenue carries out a comprehensive programme of compliance operation each year across a broad range of economic sectors, including the digital games development industry.  Many of the operations are carried out on a multi-agency basis, which can include officials from the Department of Social Protection and the WRC.  The primary role of these joint investigation units is to detect non-compliance with tax and duty obligations, which includes non-operation of the PAYE system on foot of bogus self-employment.

Controlled foreign company, CFC, rules are an anti-abuse measure, designed to prevent the artificial diversion of profits from controlling companies in the State to offshore subsidiaries located in low- or no-tax jurisdictions.<\/p><p>The controlled foreign company, CFC, rules operate by attributing to the controlling company the undistributed income of the subsidiary which has arisen from non-genuine arrangements put in place for the essential purpose of attaining the tax advantage.  A number of exemptions are provided for, including exemptions for CFCs with low accounting profits or a low profit margin in which the CFC pays a comparatively higher amount of tax in its territory than it would have paid in the State.<br\/><br\/>Section 835 applies the aforementioned exemptions where the CFC is located in the territory which is listed in the EU list of non-co-operative jurisdictions.  The list is compiled by Economic and Financial Affairs Council, ECOFIN.  Territories that constructively engage with the EU and which meet certain standards are removed from the list.  It was anticipated the application of these exemptions for CFCs resident in a non-listed territory would have a twofold effect.  First, it would encourage companies to relocate their CFCs from those territories.  Second, it would encourage those listed territories to take such actions as are required to remove themselves from the list.  The list is kept under review.  Countries may be added or taken off the list, depending on circumstances.  In that regard, I have amended the section so that the list of 12 countries, which was published on 20 October, applies to CFCs resident in non-co-operative jurisdictions, with accounting periods beginning during the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021.<br\/><br\/>The amendment also provides that the list, as updated in October and which now lists nine countries, takes effect for CFCs<b><\/b>resident and non-co-operative jurisdictions, with accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January.  I want to update the Deputy on the list of the nine countries and where that stands at the moment.  Currently, the nine jurisdictions are American Samoa, Fiji, Guam, Palau, Panama, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago, the US Virgin Islands and Vanuatu.  As of the October update, three jurisdictions were removed.  These were Anguilla, Barbados and the Seychelles.<br\/><br\/>To deal with the Deputy&rsquo;s point about my view on the impact of this measure, it is a powerful way of dealing with this issue.  One of the ways it is having an effect is when our ECOFIN meetings are taking place.  Jurisdictions that are being moving onto or fear they may be moved onto this list are vocal in describing the effect a listing will have on them.  Those jurisdictions that move onto the list do their best to try to move off the list and meet the requirements that are laid down by the European Commission.

Of course, it would be a concern if things like that are put in place to engage in extremely aggressive tax planning.  However, the Commission takes this very seriously.

For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, 92 jurisdictions are evaluated to see whether they should be on or off this list.

It was designed to prevent companies from selling assets, such as plant or machinery, between group companies and funding the sales with intra-group debt to create tax deductible interest expenses.  Revenue has been aware of cases where the provisions of section 840A were being circumvented by the use of promissory notes and replacement borrowings.  Section 840A is therefore being amended to bring promissory notes and other agreements or arrangements having similar effect within the scope of the anti-avoidance provision.  The amendment will also ensure any form of refinancing of a loan, as defined in this section, is within the scope of the jurisdiction.

It calls on the Minister to produce a report within six months to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas on the research and development tax credit, its operation, its use among small and medium enterprises and options to enhance and simplify its use for indigenous enterprises and in the context of environmental research and innovation.  This is timely.  The Minister knows that Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling for an enhanced research and development tax credit regime for small and micro businesses.  In fairness, the Minister brought it forward in budget 2019.  We wanted to see the rate increased to 30% for small and micro enterprises.  It is disappointing it had not taken effect despite it being legislated for two years after it was announced.  The Minister said in response to me that it had not received state aid approval and that for it to receive state aid approval would require overly burdensome changes on businesses and revenue.  This is very disappointing.<\/p><p>I am strongly of the view that we need to ensure more small, medium and micro businesses are involved in research and development.  I would like to hear from the Minister on whether he has an update on this measure, which we called for and supported.  In fairness, the Minister legislated for it.  Is it now a dead duck or will we go back to the Commission and look for a way to introduce it without being too burdensome so it would not be a drain on small and medium enterprises or micro businesses?<\/p><p>There is no doubt that we need to support research and innovation among small businesses.  We need to help them to scale up.  We want to see changes to the research and development tax credits regime that would provide it.  One was the idea of a higher rate for these companies.  The second proposal we have been putting forward, and I ask the Minister to look at it, is that under the current system companies whose research and development tax credits exceed their tax liability receive the credits in three instalments over 33 months.  We believe this acts as a disincentive for take-up among small and medium enterprises.  We would like to see it changed for small and micro-companies, with credits paid out in one instalment in one year.  It would only be a cash flow issue because the companies would still be entitled to it over a longer period of time.  The estimate we received from Revenue on the cost of the first year of operation is &euro;25 million.  As I have said, this is primarily a cash flow issue.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on this type of proposal.  I believe it would improve the cash flow position of indigenous businesses that would engage in research and innovation and increase the uptake of the tax credit to support companies that are crucial to our economic future and the success of our economy.<\/p><p>The amendment calls for a report.  We will go through the motions in terms of the restrictions on the Opposition with regard to the Finance Bill.  At the heart of the amendment, as with previous amendments, is the view that we need to do more to encourage research and development in small and micro-enterprises.  Are we giving up on the higher rate for small and micro businesses?  This is already legislated for.  Is there a way around it in the Minister's view?  The other proposal we are putting forward is that those companies with research and development credits that exceed their tax liability would be able to be paid in one instalment in one year instead of three instalments over 33 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#R00100","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I will quickly go back to the question Deputy Farrell asked me earlier on how to define a connected company.

The second criteria is if a group of two or more persons has control of each company and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating a member of either group as replaced by a person with whom such a member is connected.  This is the definition.  I have made a dreadful mistake; I have managed to confuse the Finance Act 2019 with the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  That is where the definition is.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the questions Deputy Doherty has put to me, I will deal with the amendment before the two other matters he put to me.  The Irish corporate tax regime contains a small number of tax reliefs, including the research and development tax credit.  The focus of these reliefs is on the creation of additional employment and on promoting innovation and inward investment, with a view to generating high value economic activity in the country.<\/p> <p>  I note that Revenue annually publishes a report entitled &ldquo;Research &amp;amp; Development (&ldquo;R&amp;D&rdquo;) Tax Credit Statistics&rdquo;.  The report contains a significant volume of data.  The report also provides further statistical information regarding the number of claimants and the value of their claims across a broad range of categories such as the business sector, the size of the claimant and the size of the claimant, based on whether in Revenue&rsquo;s large corporates division, which manages the tax affairs of the largest taxpayer and those claimants not dealt with by the large corporates division, which is a reasonable proxy for SME companies.  The report also shows a breakdown of the research and development tax credit by value of the credit claimed as profiled against the corporation tax liability of the claimant.  As the information sought by the Deputy is already available I cannot accept the proposed amendment.<\/p> <p>  The primary focus of the Government over the past 20 months has been to support businesses during the pandemic.  Revenue advises that the companies using the extensive Covid-19 supports were primarily SME companies.  These interventions were designed primarily to deliver immediate cash support to enable affected businesses to maintain a level of trade and retain their staff in employment.  However, as Deputy Doherty has noted I gave a commitment to look at measures to continue to encourage greater take-up of the research and development tax credit by small domestic companies and to examine certain aspects, such as the pre-approval procedures and record-keeping requirements.<\/p> <p>  As I stated at the time when I introduced measures in budget 2020 for micro and small companies, they were subject to a commencement order pending state aid approval from the European Commission.  Following initial engagement with the Commission it was determined it would be necessary to introduce some changes to the enhancements for micro and small companies to secure state aid approval.  However, as the measures in their current form are enhancements to the existing general research and development tax credit this could pose a significant administrative challenge to taxpayers and Revenue if different criteria were to apply to two elements of a claim for the same research and development cost.  Adding complexity and an administrative burden would be counter-productive to the aim of assisting small and micro companies.  To answer the Deputy's question on whether this is something I will progress further, at this point it will be difficult for me to fulfil the original commitment I gave on enhancing the research and development regime for micro and small companies given the issues I have just acknowledged.<\/p><p>I am now looking at other ways in which we might support innovation for small, innovative companies.  This is why we have moved ahead with the innovation fund, which I hope we will be able to launch over the next couple of months.  We are putting in place supports through Enterprise Ireland and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to make new forms of funding available to smaller companies to help them with innovation.  It is also why I tried to move ahead with changes regarding the employment investment incentive scheme, EIIS, to find new forms of capital to support smaller and younger companies that are looking to start up.  I will have better chances trying to support those companies in those ways than I will have through changes in the research and development machine.<\/p><p> The Deputy made a point about the cashflow issue.  The information that I have is that 69% of companies avail of it within the current accounting period and 12% look to convert it into a payable credit, with a smaller number looking for a second payable credit, and an even smaller number looking for a third payable credit.  The majority of companies in 2019 used the credit within the current accounting period.  I would be happy to look at this again if the Deputy thinks there is a case to look at how it could be managed in a different way so that it would be more beneficial to companies that access it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#R00200","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I know the higher rate for research and development for small, medium and microenterprises is out of the Minister's hands.

If it is not possible then it is not possible, but we should continue to look at how we can support more research and development, which is important.  The Minister said he is willing to look at the other suggestion that I put forward, which comes from the engagement that we are having with business.  It is good to see that nearly 70% are able to use that in year 1, but the other 30% are not.  We are told that it is a disincentive in the first place, so it is not just about the 31%.

As we know, the late Brian Lenihan brought forward changes to the Finance Act at the time of the bank bailouts to ensure that when banks became profitable again, they would begin to pay tax at an earlier stage.  He limited the amount of losses that could be carried forward to 50% for those who received the injection of capital from the State.  This continued for a period until Fine Gael and the Labour Party decided to get rid of it and banks were allowed to carry forward 100% of their losses into the future.  This is probably more relevant now than ever before.  One could argue it by asking if it really matters, since at the end of the day, they will end up paying the tax at some point.  The late Brian Lenihan made the point that they needed to start paying tax at the earliest stage possible, which is important.<\/p><p>We have seen a number of banks leave the Irish market.  Those banks will not be in a position to pay taxes.  We need to be careful with this.  It means that banks which are now profitable, having recovered from the impacts of the pandemic, will not pay any corporation tax on their profits in Ireland this year, including AIB and Bank of Ireland.  They will pay corporation tax on their profits in England but they will not pay taxes on the profit they make in Ireland.  This amendment is about going back to what Brian Lenihan introduced, which reduced the amount of losses that can be carried forward in any given year and ensuring that they cannot carry forward those losses indefinitely.  Ireland is one of the outliers in the European Union since it allows the carrying forward of 100% of losses for an unlimited time.  Countries usually have percentages that can be carried forward or a period of time like ten or 15 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#S00600","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":300,"content":"<p>We have only a minute left so I suggest that we suspend until 3.15 p.m. and then we can reconvene and have a response from the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#S00700","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":301,"content":"<p>Before we do that, I wish to mention that I may bring forward an amendment on Report Stage regarding an initiative being developed by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on a Brexit-related matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#S00800","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637107200,"counter":302,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 2.29 p.m. and resumed at 3.15 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637107200,"counter":303,"content":"<p>Deputy John McGuinness took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Deputies may recall that in 2018, my Department produced a detailed note for the committee on the subject of both bank losses and corporation tax losses more generally.  This technical note was published online and is still available.  It considered in some detail the potential implications of restricting the use of losses carried forward, or the introduction of a specific time limit or sunset clause on loss relief, for Irish banks, the wider banking sector or the corporate sector as a whole.  Among other considerations, it examined the possible effect of such a restriction on consumers, with the probability an increased cost base for the banks would be passed on to the consumer in the form of higher fees, higher interest rates on loans or lower deposit rates.  It also noted potential negative consequences for the valuation of the State&rsquo;s banking investments and for capital levels in the banks, with possible resulting regulatory impacts.  It considered potential effects on competition within the banking sector in Ireland, a factor of increasing relevance as banks have since left the market.<\/p> <p>  Taking all these factors into account, it is my view it would be detrimental to Irish consumers and taxpayers if a restriction were placed on the use of losses carried forward by the banks.  As each of the three pillar banks posted losses in its 2020 financial statements as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is likely limited corporation tax liabilities would have arisen for 2020 regardless of the banks&rsquo; historical losses.  However, notwithstanding the trading losses forward, the Irish banks have been paying Irish corporation tax in recent years, as the tax losses forward are restricted in their use and do not shelter profits made in all their corporate entities.  Given the level of analysis that has been published, I do not believe a further review on the matter is merited and I will not accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#Y00100","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I do not want a report either but it is the only way we can table this issue.

I have read the report but I still do not understand why he will not do that.  An argument was made at the time it was important to allow the banks to carry forward losses of 100% because of its potential in respect of capital ratio but those arguments no longer wash.

While I can understand the attractiveness, politically, of a change in tax policy such as that which the Deputy supports, it would, ultimately, undermine the ability of those banks to contribute to more lending for more homes and more attractive and lower rates for customers and would undermine the growth I believe it is in the interests of the economy for them to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#Y00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":307,"content":"<p>The Minister's argument is that if we do not tax the banks, there might be a cheaper interest rate on mortgages, even though it is the highest in Europe, or the banks might lend into the economy.

In regard to AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB, there is a relationship framework with the Minister and there are restrictions on what they can do in making certain types of investment or disposing of assets.  There are restrictions on the CEO remuneration and bonuses they can pay.<\/p> <p>  Those restrictions are all there for a reason.  The then Minister, Brian Lenihan, brought forward another restriction, namely, that they could carry forward only 50% of losses, and that was there for a reason as well.

Anybody could argue the banks should be let go tax free and they might reduce interest rates or whatever.  That is not a solid argument, particularly in the case of Bank of Ireland.

This is a new trend that is happening in the State.  It is happening on a professional level through the use of an online platform that is based in the UK, which charges a 10% commission fee.  I believe there are serious reasons the Minister should legislate for this.  I understand and agree with the principle, but it is illegal to promote gaming or lottery in the State without a licence.  That is very clearly stated in section 3 of the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Act 2019.  It is open to any private individual or company to get a gaming or lottery permit, but the value of the prize cannot be in excess of &euro;5,000.  Only a charity or philanthropic body can allow people to win prizes up to &euro;360,000.  I have concerns because people are selling their homes using this method.  The company they are engaging with says it does not need a licence and that it is a prize competition.  British law is obviously very different to Irish law in this regard.  There are loopholes in British law that ensure that it would not fall under the definition of a lottery if one asks a skill-based question.  For example, how it gets around it not being a lottery to have a raffle competition for a house in Ireland is by asking which of these countries is home to the kangaroo.  A multiple choice of four answers is provided.  That question exempts them from having a lottery licence or coming under regulation from the lottery legislation in Britain.<\/p> <p>  The problem is that people who sell their houses through this means put a lot of their own resources behind it.  They have to advertise heavily online, and they could be out by tens of thousands of euro.  If the option is closed to them, they will be out of pocket.  I have concerns in that regard.  Before Report Stage we should look at how this interacts with the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Act 2019 and check the situation with the Department of Justice.  I am mindful as well that we have new heads of a Bill coming forward on online gaming in particular, as much of our legislation is catching up with where things are at.  I would encourage the Minister to consider that.  However, this section does capture the scenario whereby, hypothetically speaking, somebody in Ireland could use that platform and not promote the raffle in Ireland.  If it was only promoted in England it would be completely in compliance with the law.  Therefore, the intention is to ensure that those games would be captured.  I understand that.  I will move on to that kind of scenario, but I do not think it is what is happening in practice.<\/p> <p>  In the definitions on amendment No. 75, it states: \"This subsection applies where an individual disposes of or of an interest in an asset (being an asset within subsection (2) or (11)) by way of a lottery or game with prizes and the proceeds of the lottery or game exceed the market value of the asset.\"  The key words I use are \"lottery\" and \"games\".  In this State, we have the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Act 2019, so if one wants to organise a game, one must have a gaming permit or licence, depending on the value of the tickets and the prize fund.  However, in Britain, they have different definitions.  Raffall, which is the main company that is raffling properties in Ireland, makes clear that this is neither a lottery nor a game, that it is a prize competition and it falls under that definition by asking questions.  Will this amendment capture that definition in relation to those prizes?  I am conscious that the Minister may not have the answers.<\/p> <p>  In the last part of the amendment, the incidental costs that can be offset include the fees that would be charged by the online platform.  The most dominant company in the market currently charges 10%, but there are other fees such as paid advertisements.  It is not about paid advertisements to sell the house for &euro;300,000, but to say that there are 20,000 tickets available at &euro;20 a ticket.  The paid advertisements are sometimes in the print media or on radio but predominantly on online platforms such as Facebook, YouTube or whatever.<\/p><p>They could impose a sizeable cost on the individual.<\/p><p> I have a number of issues in this regard.  I know that this deals with one part of it but there is probably a wider conversation required as to how this is happening, how our laws are interacting with England, how online activity muddies all of that and how one polices that.  I am concerned.  No individual in this State is legally entitled to raffle off their house.  This is not accommodated under Irish law.  It is illegal, it is an offence and it cannot be done.  The only way that a house can be raffled, as we see being done by the GAA, the credit unions and so on, is because they are allowed to apply to the court for a licence to raffle a one-off prize to the upper value of &euro;360,000, but no individual or company is allowed to do that.  These are things that are developing quite quickly but this section should be examined by the Department of Justice as to how it interacts with the Gaming and Lotteries Act, in particular, and the new Bill, the heads of which are before us.  I support the concept of this.  I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#CC00100","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Does the Minister wish to go through the section?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#DD00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy very much for his questions on this part of the Bill.

It looks for a report to be brought forward on that concept.  I was brought forward with a view to build a better, more responsive State in order to improve our public services and strengthen our social safety net.  While some work is ongoing on that with the Commission on Taxation and Welfare, this is a proposal that the Department of Finance should examine.  It seeks to introduce a CGT rate equivalent to the higher rate of income tax, including income derived from gains.<\/p><p>The basis for the proposal was stolen from President Biden's American families plan and tax agenda.  A White House press release stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe President&rsquo;s tax reform will end one of the most unfair aspects of our tax system: that the tax rate the wealthy pay on capital gains and dividends is less than the tax rate that many middle-class families pay on their wages.  Households making over $1 million&mdash;the top 0.3 percent of all households&mdash;will pay the same 39.6 percent rate on all their income, equalizing the rate paid on investment returns and wages. <\/blockquote> <p>He brought forward reforms whereby gains in excess of $1 million would not benefit from the lower rate of capital gains tax, but would be paid at the same rate of income tax at that band.  That is similar to my proposal, which I believe is worthy of merit.  It would ensure the rate of tax paid on gains for the wealth in this society is the same as the top marginal tax rate levied on income for so many middle-income workers.  This would introduce a CGT rate of 40% on the disposal of an assets made by persons in cases where the gains accrued are in excess of individual incomes, including incomes generated by gains.  If the Minister were to introduce that, for example, on amounts in excess of &euro;500,000, it would yield &euro;28 million and individuals could still avail of the reliefs legislated for in our tax code.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#EE00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":356,"content":"<p>Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s amendment seeks a report on the introduction of a 40% rate of capital gains tax on the disposal of assets made by high-income individuals.  Revenue has advised the estimated additional revenue that could be generated by introducing such a rate of capital gains tax on the disposal of assets by individuals with income in excess of &euro;200,000, is &euro;305 million.  This estimate is based on income and CGT returns for the 2018 tax year, the latest year for which full income information is available and does not include any yield in respect of companies.  It assumes no change in behaviour by individuals resulting from the increase in the tax rate.<\/p> <p>  Increases in rates, such as are contemplated for the purposes of the proposed report, may have a significant behavioural impact.  Capital gains tax is dependent on individual behaviour and a change in rate may not produce a corresponding increase or decrease in tax yield.  In current economic conditions, any estimate of additional yield must be treated with a high level of caution.  The realisation of any estimated yield from an increase in taxation on assets relating to property is subject to movements in the value of such assets, which are currently occurring in the economy.  In addition, therefore, the increase in the rate could, in theory, not lead to such a significant change in the yield from the tax.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy is aware, CGT, in line with all taxes, is subject to ongoing review, and this forms part of the consideration of the Tax Strategy Group and its paper on CGT which it publishes every year.

These are businesses in which workers of the enterprises own at least 51% of the enterprise shares.  In this structure, ownership and labour work together: by giving workers control, more is given to the communities and so on.  It helps retain wealth at local and regional level.  It is a more sustainable way.  They perform well at meeting local employment needs and there are numerous advantages for them.  Work co-operatives are more likely to pay the living wage, have lower pay differentials and so on.<\/p><p>In 2005, the Scottish Government established the state agency, Co-operative Development Scotland, which is a subsidiary of Scottish Enterprise.  It was tasked with the responsibility of developing Scotland's co-operative sector.  Between 2005, when this agency was established, and 2012, the sector experienced modest growth.  This was, however, followed by a substantial 300% increase in the number of worker co-operatives in Scotland.  The number of businesses has gone from 30 to 100.  Among the measures introduced was an exemption from CGT up to a certain threshold where the sale of the controlling interest in the company was made to an employee ownership trust or worker co-operative.<\/p><p>This will not change the way we do business here or change enterprises dramatically.  It is a model worthy of being looked at.  A jurisdiction not far from us has looked at this issue and brought forward a taxation proposal to encourage worker co-operatives.  Not only is it certainly worthy of consideration, but it should be introduced and monitored to see if this would indeed have a positive impact on the retention and growth of companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#EE00700","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I understand that the Bill brought forward by the Deputy's colleague moved to Second Stage in the Seanad on 28 June.

Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell's Bill on lobbying kick-started the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, to produce a Bill in that area.  My Bill in regard to moneylenders, which has been kicking around for a number of years, kick-started the Minister for Finance to deal with that issue.  There are number other examples from insurance to other issues.<\/p> <p>  If an idea is a good one, then we should grab it regardless of where it comes from.  This amendment seeks only that the Minister would examine this issue in terms of a report.  There is no need for a restructuring of the sector.  As I said, this is not going to rock the system.  It is about exempting from CGT the proceeds from the sale of shares to co-operative structures.  I recall that during an engagement I had with the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Noonan, on the introduction of some type of incentive that I thought went too far, his response was that it was okay to introduce and monitor these and, if they do not have the right effect, they can always be amended.  That is what we do every year in the finance Bill.  This is something that should be considered.  As I said, one our nearest jurisdictions, that is, Scotland, is operating an exemption up to a certain threshold.  I encourage the Minister to examine that and to get his officials to examine it.  We have a tax strategy paper every year.  A commitment to look at it in that context would be fair enough.  I am disappointed with the response.  <\/p> <p>  Senator Gavan has been championing this issue for many years on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in.  I mentioned Scotland.  In Spain and elsewhere, there are good examples of how co-operative models can be successful in terms of enterprise and benefits to the local and regional economy, but the model needs help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#FF00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":363,"content":"<p>Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#FF00300","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#FF00400","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"vote","time":1637107200,"counter":365,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 3; N\u00edl, 6.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#GG00150","aye":["1522","1462","1579"],"nay":["1558","1584","1572","1626","1496","1473"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637107200,"counter":366,"content":"<p>Sections 39 and 40 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637107200,"counter":367,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 79 to 83, inclusive, not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637107200,"counter":368,"content":"<p>Sections 41 to 43, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Would it be possible to take a five-minute sos at this point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#GG00600","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#GG00700","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637107200,"counter":371,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.45 p.m. and resumed at 4.59 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637107200,"counter":372,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 84:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 96, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/><b>&ldquo;Waiver of excise duty on special exemption orders<\/b>  \t<b>44. <\/b>No duty of excise shall be chargeable, leviable or payable under section 78(4) of the Finance Act 1980 on a special exemption order granted under section 5 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1927 in respect of dates falling within the period beginning on 22 October 2021 and ending on 31 December 2021.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote> <p>This amendment provides for the insertion of a new section relating to the waiver of excise duty associated with court fees in respect of applications for special exemption orders.

This is a question about a report on the projected tax revenue generated by increases in carbon tax in each year from 2021 to 2030, its resultant impact on household carbon emissions and its interaction with the national development plan.  We have made it clear time and again that we are not opposed to behavioural taxes in principle.  We supported sugar taxes, plastic taxes and tobacco taxes earlier, in section 39, and we have supported many other such measures, but they have to work.  In the case of carbon tax, we must ensure the alternatives exist for everybody - workers, families and households.  Otherwise, all the carbon taxes will do is generate revenue for the State and make households poorer.<\/p><p>We know from the work that has been done that that impact falls on poorer households, lone parent households and rural households in particular.  The Government has not implemented the 100% dividend model in respect of carbon taxes as other jurisdictions have done.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in are opposed to the further increase in carbon tax that has been planned.  Some of it has already taken effect in respect of motor fuel, and we can see the impact increased prices are having on individuals.  It is not the case they are jumping onto the train or getting out to buy electric cars.  This is just leaving many people poorer.  There are planned increases on home heating oil later next year, and we know where that has gone to.<\/p><p>There is a need for a focus on energy policy.  However, the Government's 2021 climate action plan states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe planned carbon tax increases are expected to raise an additional &euro;9.5 billion in revenue over that period.  This revenue will be allocated ... [in the following ways] ... <\/blockquote> <p>This reliance on carbon tax revenue is repeated in the national development plan, which makes clear that &euro;5 billion in additional carbon tax over the period of the NDP has been allocated to increase capital investment in energy efficiency levels.  In response to a parliamentary question, the Minister told me the additional carbon tax revenue yield estimate of &euro;9.5 billion was based on an increase in the rate of carbon tax to &euro;100 per tonne by 2030, above the &euro;20 per tonne rate that existed until 2019.  Crucially, he said this additional total yield was calculated on a static basis, so it is estimated at an additional &euro;9.2 billion over the period 2021 to 2030 rather than &euro;9.5 billion.<\/p><p>The problem here is that the Government is baking into its assumptions that it will get &euro;9.5 billion in carbon tax revenue and no one will reduce their consumption of carbon between now and 2030.  The estimate is on a static basis.  The Government has put that estimate into the national development plan and the climate action plan, while we are told the Government's point of view is this is supposed to be about changing behaviour.  If it were to be successful, we would be looking at a diminishing return on carbon tax, but that is not what is planned here in numerical terms.  Will the Minister clarify that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#HH03400","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I will boil down to the human level the question Deputy Doherty has outlined very well about the rationale for carbon tax and what it is intended to achieve.  I got a call this week from somebody who lives in a council house in which the windows and doors are completely inadequate to insulate the house against the cold weather.  She moved into the house just a while ago.  The whole row of houses is in that condition, and the residents have to blast the heat to keep themselves warm at a level at which somebody who has a well-insulated home and the right to insulate his or her home does not have to do.  Tenants in the private rented sector and council tenants have no right to do that.  It is not allowed.  Also, in many cases they would not be able to afford to do so even if they did have that right.  They must, therefore, expend far more money to heat their homes.  The woman who contacted me described how, as the cold weather begins to set in, the cost of keeping the heat on in her house has already completely outstripped her weekly budget.<\/p> <p>  In my area 1% of the social housing stock will be retrofitted next year and approximately 1% was retrofitted last year.  That is about 40 houses, and there is no indication at all that retrofitting will ramp up much beyond that.  It is worth saying that in the Government's announcements on upscaling the retrofitting of homes, it anticipates, I think I am right in saying, only just over 35,000 homes by 2030.  That is out of a total social housing stock of 137,000.  The likelihood, therefore, is that many people in either social housing that will not be retrofitted for years or private rented accommodation, where it is up to the landlord, will be pumping money into keeping their homes warm, which they have absolutely no choice about doing, for their own health and well-being, and they will suffer the consequences.<\/p><p>Some of those people will get fuel allowances but many of them will not.  The woman I spoke to described the draught coming through the door and windows.  In that situation, one is just throwing good money after bad to try to keep the place warm.  The heat is going straight out under the door or through the windows, which need to be fixed.  The fuel allowance increases will not cover the cost and many people will not get the fuel allowance anyway.  People who are working and have an income above a certain threshold will not be entitled to the fuel allowance.  That is not just transition.  Let us be honest about it.  It is unfair to penalise that group of people or to imagine that by increasing the price via carbon tax, they will be forced to change their behaviour when they simply cannot do it.  <\/p><p> One could give many other examples.  Public transport in particular areas is an obvious example.  I do not mean rural areas in particular, although they are particularly badly hit by a lack of public transport, but so too are suburbs.  It is a significant issue.  Certain areas are not well served by public transport.  Indeed, there is often pressure to cut back on public transport services in those areas because they are not considered commercially viable and so on.  Therefore, the opportunity for people who are elderly or have mobility problems to get out of their cars is not there.  They are unable to get to hospital or the shops without their cars.  It is in that context we are saying this tax is unfair and the Minister needs to look at it again, particularly given the massive hikes in energy prices that are currently taking place.  I would be interested to hear how the Minister responds.  What would he say to the woman who phoned me up in that situation?  She is now going to face excessive bills because the Government thinks it is acceptable to increase carbon tax this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#HH03500","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>My point is along the same lines as that made by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  The logistics of bringing relief to people who want to insulate their homes to the extent required within a short space of time is definitely going to be difficult.  I am thinking aloud, which I know is a dangerous thing to do, especially in politics.  One must do it, from time to time.  I wonder is there a possibility to arrange a system whereby the grant or grants available can be used as a guarantee with lending institutions in order to enable the household to make the application forthwith and allow the retrofitting to proceed.  When the work is done to the required specifications, the lending institution will get its money out of the grant and arrangements can be made to make up any amount that remains outstanding.  Something similar was done in the 1980s, relating to the extension of dwellings.  It worked very well.  Costs were lower at the time but everything is relative.  I wonder if that might be a possibility.  It would certainly resolve the problems for many people who have homes that are not energy efficient at all and who have no possibility of meeting the deadline within a reasonable time.  The State would benefit from reduced energy provision.  The householder would also benefit.  The difference is fairly substantial.<\/p> <p>  I was a member of a committee which dealt with energy and transport issues in 2007.  A considerable amount of research was done at the time.  In my own humble way, I decided I would practise some of the suggestions of that research, and I did.  I introduced double glazing all round.  I ceased burning coal and introduced a wood-burning stove.  There was a considerable difference.  There was no real recognition of what was done.  Nobody recognised it.  Nobody said, \"Well done\" and told me that was a move in the right direction.  Nobody commented at all.  As a matter of fact, there was a review done by a television programme.  I think one had to be trendy, which is an awful phrase, to qualify for mention in it.  I happened to be the only person on that committee who was not mentioned although I was the only one who made any major improvement to the insulation of my house with a view to reducing carbon emissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#JJ00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  It is important to put in context the impact that carbon taxation is having on changes in energy prices that I know are having an impact on the living standards of many commuters and families at the moment.  In January of this year, the price of a litre of petrol stood at &euro;1.31.  According to AA Ireland, for the month of October the price for a litre of petrol stood at &euro;1.65.  That is an increase of 33 cent across the year which, for a tank of petrol or diesel, is having a large effect on the commuting costs many are facing at the moment.  However, if one looks at the change across the period from January to October, carbon taxation accounted for 2 cent of that change.  Those who appreciate and understand these things as well as I do will say that carbon tax is only one of the taxes levied on petrol and diesel, but if one looks at the movement on the price of a litre of petrol between January and October, 76% of it was due to changes that were not tax-related.  While many are facing increases in the cost of energy and fuel at the moment, the majority of the reasons for that are not related to carbon tax.  They are driven by the fact that the price of energy globally is going up for many reasons.  While I accept that here in Ireland the change we are making in carbon taxation is adding to the cost of energy for many, and commuters felt those increases from budget night onwards, it is a small share of the increase in total cost that many are facing at the moment.  If somebody was going to make the argument that carbon taxation is the reason we are seeing an increase in the price of a tank of diesel or petrol, I would reply that it is a contributory factor but it is the smallest of the factors at the moment.  There are many other forces at play that are driving the inflation of the cost here and elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Doherty talked about the effect that an increase in carbon pricing can have on the most vulnerable.  I understand that, but that is why it is important to read into the record of the committee all of the things that the Government is doing from a budgetary point of view to help support those who might be most affected by such a change.  There has been an increase of &euro;2 per week in the qualified child payment for a child under the age of 12 and &euro;3 per week for a child over the age of 12.  There has been an increase of &euro;3 per week in the living alone allowance.  There has been a &euro;5 increase per week in the fuel allowance.  There has also been an increase of &euro;10 per week to the income threshold of the working family payment.  The cumulative effect of those increases is that those who have the least are protected the most from the changes we have made in carbon taxation.  The ESRI and others would state that carbon taxation has the ability, in the absence of measures that can offer compensation, to be a regressive tax because it is based on how much carbon people use with no regard to their income.<\/p><p>That is why the Government has come forward with a package of measures that are cofunded by the increase in carbon tax to protect those who could be impacted most by a rise in energy pricing and the cost of fuel to which the carbon tax is only a contributory factor but not the cause.<\/p><p> Deputy Doherty said we should not move forward with a measure like this unless options are available to more who face the rising cost of commuting.  This is the reason, for example, the Government is involved in the roll-out of the ConnectIreland programme, which tries to expand the bus network available to towns and villages across the country.  It is why the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, and the Government have sought to make additional funding available to CI&Eacute; to support the availability of bus services around the country and to put routes in place, through ConnectIreland, that will provide public transport options, particularly for those in our rural towns and villages who do not have the kind of public transport options that they want to have.<\/p><p> Deputy Boyd Barrett's asked what I would say to the older constituent who contacted him.  I get those calls myself.  I would tell that person that we are making funding available to local authorities to accelerate their retrofitting programmes for local authority housing.  That programme is working.  I can see it in my own constituency.  I can see the homes that are owned and run by Dublin City Council gradually being upgraded.  That is happening.  Those in the most need of upgrading should be prioritised.  I would tell that person that I will do all I can to try to ensure that the local authority prioritises those most affected by having poor energy efficiency in their homes.  For those who do not live in local authority housing, we are supporting Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, with grant programmes.  As the Deputy is aware, at other points there has been a higher demand for grants than there has been money available to SEI to make grants available.  That is why as we move into next year and beyond, we are making more money available to fund those grant programmes.  At the moment the cost of retrofitting is prohibitively expensive for many.  The Deputy will tell me that because it is expensive at the moment, we should not go ahead with these types of changes, or I think he might make that argument to me.  I will not put words in his mouth.  The Deputy spoke about the older person who contacted him, and I am also contacted, but he will also be aware of all the contact we have from teenagers, children and younger adults who are convinced, and they are right to be convinced, that they will not have the environment and ecology that the Deputy and I grew up with and enjoyed.  They are scared about what that will mean for their lives and for their children.  They are right to be worried because our environment and world is changing.  I do not believe it is honest to argue that we can deal with that scale of change, try to mitigate it and reduce the harm that is coming without saying that we will not put up the price of the ingredient that is the cause of that change.  That is what carbon tax is.  The vast majority of scientists and economists who are advising governments and policymakers about what to do to deal with this say that carbon taxation is not all the answer but a vital and necessary component.  That is one reason this type of change, which is probably the most difficult move in carbon taxing we have made in the last three years, is still on balance the right thing to do.  I appreciate all the arguments that the cost of electric vehicles or retrofitting homes is too high.  However, we know that where there is consumer demand for technologies the price will fall over time.  Take technologies that have become commonplace in our homes, such as televisions or phones.  The price of technologies that were prohibitively expensive not too long ago have fallen as demand increased and as the private sector, enabled by governments, responds to that demand.  I accept that electric vehicles and hybrids are too expensive for many but they are falling in price and they are cheaper than they were some years ago.  There are more vehicles available which have that technology.  <\/p><p> That is part of the answer to Deputy Durkan's point.  He asked how to make those technologies more readily affordable to more people.  There are two ways.  The first is that the Government does more to bring the cost down through grants and low-cost loans.  We already do good work on that through SEI, for example.  The second is that over time the cost of those technologies should fall.<\/p><p> This section is contentious and will be opposed by many on  Committee and Report Stages.  I appreciate the difficulty that an increase in carbon taxing creates for many now.  However, it is a low share of the total reasons for the increases in energy prices.  Some 76% of the cost increase in petrol and 71% in diesel is not related to what has happened in tax.  Global forces are at play.  If we accept that the climate crisis is a crisis that can threaten our civilisation, which are big words to use but I believe that is the prospect we face, then moves such as carbon taxation, as tough as they are, is the right thing to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#JJ00300","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I had an amendment here-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#KK00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I am allowing leeway on this but at the end of each section, there cannot be further questioning to and fro.

I was on local radio this morning, not my local radio but Shannonside, on this matter which I have raised with the Minister's Government colleagues for the last month.  The number 30 bus which provides connection between Donegal and Dublin, particularly the airport, and goes through Cavan, left people standing on the side of the road at 3 a.m. on Monday morning, missing flights to Germany and other places to go to work, because it did not turn up.  Forget about all these glossy brochures that the Government keeps launching, if the Minister lived in rural Ireland he would know that it was the 75th time this year that bus did not turn up in the middle of the night leaving people on the side of the road.  He might also be conscious that it was the 109th time in the last year that it did not turn up.  That is the reality.  Those are the realities for people living in my community and all the rest.  The first day I came here, I laughed when someone asked me if I had taken the train.<\/p><p>The last time there was a train in Donegal was in the early 1960s and that is the reality for a lot of people.  The reality is that a carbon tax will increase the price of diesel and petrol when their price is at an all time high.  Another reality is that for every litre of petrol as much as 95 cent is tax.  We know that behavioural taxes work but there must be alternatives.  When a bus does not turn up in the dead of night or when people do not have money under their mattresses but the Minister for Finance says that sometime in the future prices will reduce and people will be able to afford the price of an electric car so suck it up in between because we are pushing up the price of heating and petrol.  The reality is that a carbon tax makes people poor.  I ask the Minister to answer my question.  The Government has baked in &euro;9.5 billion of carbon taxes that does not factor in a reduction in consumption.  Is this a revenue raising generator?  Will there be a 10% reduction in carbon consumption as outlined in the climate action plan?  If so, does that leave a hole in the financing of the national development plan so the allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for agriculture and the billions of euro for just transition?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#KK00600","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Yet again the Deputy has put words in my mouth.

This is in a context of rising energy prices and their impact on low- and middle-income households.  Let me be clear we are looking for a temporary waiver which recognises there is a major issue with energy prices.  The Minister may wish to hit back and ask me what side I am on in the great debate but next time he is talking to Secretary Yellen, or maybe President Biden, he might tell them they are on the wrong side of that debate as well because I do not think any carbon taxes are being introduced at a federal level at the minute.  They have a different policy which is supply-side.  That is what is needed.  We need real investment to ensure we can allow for people to change their behaviour away from fossil fuels and carbon.<\/p><p>There have been 35 hikes in energy prices over the last period.  The Minister has acknowledged to me in the D&aacute;il that two European countries are engaging with the Commission on a temporary reduction of their VAT levels on energy.  The Minister has made the point, and rightly so, that Spain, for example, was moving from a higher rate than we have.  Ours is 13.5% while Spain's was over 20%.  However, Spain has reduced energy bills by 11%.  The Czech Republic has moved further and zero-rated energy bills.  It is engaging with the Commission on this.  What the Minister did not acknowledge in the D&aacute;il debate is we have the highest level of energy bills.  While other countries might have a higher rate of tax, when we compare the household in Spain, France or Italy to the Irish one we pay a higher cost in terms of our energy bill.  Therefore, this pressure on families across the State is quite significant.  It is probably felt in different ways in different places.  We can see from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures that energy prices are increasing.  Electricity has gone up.  Gas has gone up.  Home heating oil has gone up.  Significantly, home heating oil has gone up the most.  Indeed, in some cases it is more than two or three times more expensive than other ways of heating a home.  Home heating oil is the dominant means of heating a home in more rural communities, especially those in the west, north west and Border areas.  Unfortunately, these are also communities with lower disposable incomes and houses which are more likely to be energy-poor.  This is a real pressure on people facing into this winter.<\/p><p>We are not arguing for reducing VAT on this forever.  We are asking if the State can do something at this point in time to take the pressure off families who are at the pin of their collars as a result of these energy price hikes over the winter months.  There are two ways to do that.  The Government can do as other European countries have done by reducing VAT or follow the Czech Republic and zero-rate it.  Alternatively, it can use the toolbox provided to members states whereby a refund is also possible.  However, the Minister has decided on an alternative strategy, that is, to actually increase the price of these energy Bills come next year by increasing the carbon tax.  That is not the great debate.  I am serious.  If the Minister thinks that is the great debate we are in serious trouble.  The real debate is how to make the necessary investment across broad sectors of society to ensure people have the opportunity to make the transition.  The Minister should also remember the biggest polluters are not individuals but large companies.  Everybody has their role to play.  I will say this again and he can brand me whatever way he wants.  We believe in taxes that change behaviour.  We have called for them in the past.  However, we do not support taxes which are just going to make houses poorer for the sake of it when the Government is not providing alternatives.  Thus what is missing in this Finance Bill are the type of initiatives we suggested.  Examples of this include additional support for second-hand electric vehicles, additional support for those on lower incomes to purchase electric vehicles, additional support for households for retrofitting, the expansion of our public transport fleet and so on.  These are not included.<\/p><p>Returning to the amendment, this is a temporary issue.  It is what I would be doing in if I sat in the Minister's seat.  I would be looking at introducing a temporary VAT rate of 0% over the winter months to help people with what are unprecedented and unexpected rises in their energy prices.  Many households may be able to sail through but others simply were not budgeting for this and in the run-up to Christmas it is putting them to the pin of their collars.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#MM01800","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Boyd Barrett wish to speak?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#MM01900","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Yes.  Was it the Garrett FitzGerald Government that fell over VAT on children's shoes?  I am not sure about the Minister's take on the historical debate around climate change and the issues around addressing it or failing to address it and whether he is right that it is a carbon tax.  However, if the energy price crisis now unfolding for people continues at the current pace because they cannot do anything to opt for alternatives as those alternatives do not exist then he may have a very serious political problem.  Ultimately, the answer is to move away from dependence on fossil fuels, which me must do rapidly to address the climate crisis, and ideally to have more sustainable sources of energy that do not damage the environment and which are not vulnerable to the swings and roundabouts of the market.  We need to have the ability to produce our own energy that is in stable supply, is not too expensive and does not pollute and destroy the environment for the future.  However, in the meantime, if the policy pursued by the Government is one that ends up punishing the least well-off and those least capable of dealing with the transition, due to the tenure of their homes, their income levels, how the transport issue impacts on them or whatever, I tell the Minister the Government will sabotage efforts to deal with the climate.<\/p><p> We know that some of the more dark political forces in this world have actively tried to turn people against the climate action agenda.  Pretty much everyone in here agrees that we need to pursue climate action vigorously in order to address this existential crisis.  The biggest danger for us in trying to address the climate crisis - I really mean this and it is not rhetorical flourish - is the fear that fairly dark and dangerous political forces might turn people against the climate agenda and use the fact that it is economically punishing them in order to gain traction for climate scepticism.  This should not be a surprise to us.<\/p><p>The Minister has to do something about the energy price hikes.  I accept what he said to the effect that the carbon tax is only part of it, but it does add insult to injury in a situation where people are seeing price hikes of hundreds of euros.  There is a big distinction between discretionary spending and non-discretionary spending.  It seems as if the Government's approach to carbon taxes does not really see this distinction.  It is not discretionary for people to heat their homes.  Earlier, the Minister told me to tell the woman I spoke about that we are putting money into retrofitting her home.  In fact, I did say that to her.  I told here there was a retrofit programme but that I had absolutely no idea when her home would be retrofitted.  I can take a pretty damn good guess that it will not be for a few years.  I hope I am wrong and that when I speak to the council this week I will be told it will go straight down and do the windows and doors.  I strongly suspect that this is not the answer I will get, however.<\/p><p> The promise is that at some time it will happen.  In our area, 1% of the relevant properties are being done per year.  It seems to be the pattern in the Dublin councils that 1% of the social housing stock is being done each year.  This is just not good enough.  Potentially, the woman to whom I refer could be waiting ten or 15 years at this rate.  It will be cold comfort to her, to use a really bad pun, that her doors and windows will be insulated in ten or 15 years' time but that, in the meantime, she has to suck up shockingly high energy costs and, perhaps, get blamed for being a climate laggard because she is not reducing her CO2 emissions.  Others who can afford to do this have done it.<\/p><p> It is about the level of comfort.  I find that ironic.  This is why I am not sure about price signals when it comes to these kinds of usages of CO2.  In our budget submissions, we proactively proposed carbon-type taxes on aviation, some of the polluting sectors in the economy and the profits of those sectors that make money from pollution.  When we are speaking about expenditures that people have no choice but to make in order to live their lives, and stating that putting a price signal on them will change their behaviour, I do not buy it unless there are alternatives.  I suggest the Minister takes seriously the warning that if we get this wrong and do not have a just transition, then we may turn off the climate action agenda significant sections of the population and the people we need on our side to make the necessary climate changes and to carry through the climate action we need to deal with the climate crisis.  This would be very dangerous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#MM02000","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":458,"content":"<p>There are dangers.  I should mention that the Government that fell did not do so as a result of a tax on children's shoes.  It fell over VAT chargeable on all clothing and footwear.  The Opposition of the day selected the children's bits and that is how it has been tagged ever since.  These are the type of things that happen in politics.<\/p> <p>  I remember back in the 1970s when we built a lot of houses.  They were built, in anticipation of the future, with no chimneys.  A grant had to be given in order that chimneys could be put in place in countless houses throughout the country.  At the time, everyone had been saying it was going to be warm because there was climate change at that time as well, but it went in the opposite direction.  There is a pitfall we need to be wary of.  I mentioned what I have done in my own small way to address the issues involved.  The action we took reduced, by approximately 65%, fossil fuel consumption in the house.  When the really savage winter came, which drove temperatures way down, we were able to control the heat and keep 14 or 15 radiators going while at the same time never touching fossil fuels.  It was a practical experiment I carried out to prove it could be done.  We need to do a few more things.<\/p> <p>  I am afraid that we could have a cold snap that lasts two or three months, particularly because the weather has been more extreme in recent times.  We see this from looking at our televisions.  It might be beneficial to consider how it could be dealt with.  LPG biogas is one option.  It seems to reduce emissions by more than 90%.  It may be a step in the right direction in the meantime.  It would help to keep people with a reasonable degree of comfort in some shape or form while we stride towards the targets we have to achieve in any event.<\/p> <p>  I have had many arguments and debates about this in recent years, particularly those who have said it will never happen, that we will never need to adapt our lifestyles in this fashion and that it was all a scare and part of an international scam to scare people.  We have to get away from that.  I fully accept that the Government is doing what it needs to do as quickly as possible, but it might not be quick enough for the people who will be caught in the meantime.  I ask that some provision be made or a plan put in place to address the issues that might arise in the event of a sharp severe cold winter or cold spell during the winter that would affect the people we are speaking about.  It affects all walks of society, including the wealthy, the not so wealthy and the poor.  Everybody is affected by the extremes of temperatures when they come.  Those extremes will come again.  I ask that we look at this and not take panic measures but, rather, take steps that will have an impact and to place in the hands of the people the ways and means of working their way out of this particular situation until we reach the position to which we aspire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#NN00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":459,"content":"<p>Energy price hikes are a huge issue.  It will cost a household &euro;800 on average.  There have already been 30 hikes since 1 January.  People are already hard pressed with the cost of childminding, cr&egrave;che facilities and rent and now they are faced with this.  It is an issue of life or death.  There is the concept of excess winter deaths.  I have been trying to get my head around it recently.  My understanding of it is that it measures the number of people who die over the winter months over and above the number of people who die, on average, over a similar period at other times of the year.<\/p><p>My understanding is that the State, fairly consistently, is at the top of the European table for the highest number of excess winter deaths - 2,000 or 2,500 per annum.  Those people do not die simply of the cold; they die of a combination of the cold and fuel poverty.  Now that we have this huge surge in energy prices on top of that.<\/p><p> What is the Government doing?  The Minister is doing little or nothing, I would suggest.  In some European countries, governments have taken significant action, not off their own bat but under extreme pressure from below in society.  We have seen that in Spain, Greece and Italy, but there has been little or nothing here.  There are things the Government could do.  There is a 30% increase in the carbon tax.  The Minister does not have to agree and say that the carbon tax should be abolished and replaced, by the way, with a serious tax on the big polluters in big business.  He could just say, \"Freeze the increase for this year\", but the Government will not do that.  The Minister could say that we will go down the road of price controls, with a tough maximum per-unit price for electricity and gas for home heating, etc.  The Government will not do that.  The Minister could say that the ESB should be run on a not-for-profit basis.  The ESB made &euro;363 million in the first six months of this year.  Up until 2001, the ESB was allowed to operate on a break-even basis.  Legislation was introduced and changes were made, and the company cannot do that anymore.  It operates on a for-profit basis.  It should operate on a not-for-profit basis whereby it would be allowed to break even and give back some of those huge profits to protect householders' living standards and, in some cases, lives this winter.<\/p><p> Deputy Doherty's proposal is a good one.  It does all that we, as a committee, can do to suggest that a report be made.  The State is charging VAT on these energy bills.  The idea of waiving or reducing that is a positive step that could be taken to protect people, but the Minister will not do that.<\/p><p> Briefly, on the idea that this hits the wealthy, the not-so-wealthy and the poor, it may do so.  If you are wealthy, you can absorb it.  If you are not so wealthy, you will struggle to absorb it, to make ends meet and to heat your home.  What many people are doing is rationing and only heating their homes to a fraction of what they really need.  If you are poor, and particularly if you are poor and old, you could pay a very heavy price this winter.  The policy could and should be changed.  I support the proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#NN00300","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for the different points that they have raised.  I will begin with the points put forward by Deputy Doherty.  He is correct in stating that two countries within the European Union are pursuing the action that he has described, but 25 are not doing so.  As for what those other countries are doing, they are doing the kind of things that we are looking at doing, which is putting in place social welfare measures to support those who are affected the most by it and putting in place other things to try to support families and workers at a time of big challenge.<\/p> <p>  Of course, the most significant thing we are doing to try to help families with the rising cost of living is to increase tax credits and reduce the amount of income at which somebody pays the higher rate of income tax in Ireland, something  which Sinn F&eacute;in and Deputy Doherty are opposed to.  If the Deputy looks at the Sinn F&eacute;in budget submission, which, incidentally, does not include the VAT measure he is now championing, there are no measures that talk about how the Deputy will significantly reduce the cost of living in the way that, for example, the changes that we are making to tax credits and to the standard rate cut-off point are capable of doing.  The measure that the Deputy is championing in respect of VAT is not included in the Sinn F&eacute;in budget submission.  Somebody on a middle income who is experiencing a rising cost of living should benefit from the tax changes that the Government is making from 1 January that are about trying to support workers at a time in which costs are going up, which Sinn F&eacute;in is opposed to doing.<\/p> <p>  I have also taken the opportunity to look at the measures that Deputy Doherty is proposing here to try to make public transport more available.  The Deputy is proposing an increase of &euro;49 million in funding for the Department of Transport on current terms, of which &euro;25 million would be a grant for taxi drivers.  The Deputy is proposing a change in the Department of Transport funding of &euro;119 million, of which &euro;40 million is for roads improvements - something I would support.  However, of that &euro;119 million, only &euro;32 million is increased investment in the public transport fleet.  Deputy Doherty is talking about wanting to increase and improve options for those who use public transport but in his alternative budget, which I am sure the Deputy would want to implement if he was Minister for Finance, there is no evidence that he has the thinking, the solutions or the vision to make that happen.  This is derived from the document the Deputy has that he has championed.<\/p> <p>  At a time when we will be approaching a point where we will see families under pressure from energy prices that are going up for reasons that are far bigger than the change in carbon taxes, we will be making a change in personal taxes that is targeted at helping them, which, I accept, everybody will benefit from, and Deputy Doherty is against doing that.  The Deputy does not believe that should happen.  While I understand why Deputy Doherty is championing this idea, the fact that the majority of countries in the European Union are not doing it points to the fact that there are different ways of doing it.  Those are different ways and different policies that the Government is pursuing and implementing, particularly through what we are looking to do with changes in personal taxation.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett said something very important about darker forces at work that would seek to introduce further division at a time in which we need to make a change in how we use carbon and how we organise our economies and even our societies in view of the imminence of the climate crisis.  I take the Deputy's point that we need to challenge ourselves about how we can maintain public consent for what we are doing at a time when there are already so many pressures evident on building.  That is why we are using the money that we are receiving from a higher level of carbon tax to reinvest in things that can be meaningful to help our society cope with the changes that we will have to make and that may be imminent to deal with the climate crisis, such as what we are looking to do with the retrofitting of local authority homes.<\/p><p>I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point that we need to do more and do it quicker.  Ultimately, however, we need to pay for how we are going to do it.  That is why we are putting so much of the money back into social welfare measures to maintain that consent.<\/p><p> In the change in carbon tax that is often pointed to as an example of the potential to galvanise public support against this, which is the change in fuel taxation that happened in France, my understanding is that the additional revenue just went into the general coffers of the French state.  In Ireland, we have made a very different decision so that we are, in effect, hypothecating the additional tax revenue that comes in from the higher taxes to try to win and maintain public support for the changes we are making at a time in which things are tough enough.<\/p><p> I do not want to rehash the debate we had earlier.  I would say to the Deputy, however, that there is another danger here, which is the danger of not being open and honest with those we serve regarding the kind of change that we will have to make.  The kind of change that we will have to make will involve using lower amounts of carbon and engaging completely with our environment but in a fundamentally different way.  Deputy Doherty is right that this something that states are not in a position to do at the moment.  However, it does not take away from the fact that, again, the overwhelming majority of scientists and economists who are experts on this topic say that carbon taxation is part of what we have to do if we are to have any hope of bringing about change in our society in advance of nature completely changing in front of our eyes.  I accept it is a difficult argument to make at this point but it is an argument that is worth making, and it is worth making in this Finance Bill and in the months to come as we have to make the case for this measure.<\/p><p> In regard to the points made by Deputy Barry on excess winter capacity, I will definitely look at the data sets to which he referred to understand this a bit more.  In the short time in which he made his point to me, I have taken a look to try to understand the issue and the data set to which he referred.  Any death that happens in Ireland at any point in the year is a death we are trying to avoid, particularly if it is for reasons we can control or influence.  From the quick look I have had at the data to which the Deputy refers, he is correct that, across the winter period, there appear to be pointers of excess winter mortality in the country.  However, the same data also indicated there has been a decline in Ireland since 2009, when the recording may first have begun.  This is only a provisional point from me and I will study this further before Report Stage.  Nonetheless, the data suggest excess winter mortality has declined and that there is a broad set of factors that lead to that.<\/p><p> On the carbon tax point in particular, I go back to what I said earlier, namely, out of all of the reasons the price of energy is going up at the moment, carbon tax accounts for a small share of the total increase in energy prices during this year.  It is a small share and there are other reasons behind it.  The Deputy made the point we should be taxing the big companies and the big users of energy more but they will be paying carbon tax.  Anybody who is consuming the forms of energy covered by this carbon tax will be paying it.  They will pay more because they use more energy; they can afford to pay more and they will.  Many of those companies are now making commitments to move to net zero and to reduce their use of carbon by 2030.  That is the contribution they will have to make to play their part in how we get ready for the change that is coming as we try to reduce harm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#OO00200","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":463,"content":"<p>By agreement, the committee decided to suspend at 6 p.m. and resume at 7 p.m.  It is a little past 6 p.m. so we will suspend now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#PP00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637107200,"counter":464,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 6.05 p.m. and resumed at 7 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637107200,"counter":465,"content":"<p>Deputy Steven Matthews took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I wish to make a short point on amendment No. 92.

The Minister informed us, through a reply to a parliamentary question, that it would not be possible to zero-rate energy prices.  That question was raised with the Minister by my colleague, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, in seeking clarification as to whether that would be allowed by the European Commission.  The Minister did not respond to Deputy Farrell's request at that time.  The day after the budget, the commission published its toolbox to tackle rising energy prices, which allows for a rebate of energy prices, of which the Minister will be aware.  On 25 October, the Czech finance minister wrote to the European Commissioner for Economy, Paolo Gentiloni, asking for a temporary waiving of VAT.  The reason that we did not argue for this prior to the budget is because the Minister told us it was not possible.

Amendment No. 112, which is coming up, relates to the same issue.  The Minister has decided that the amount of money that will be accrued by the State in relation to the banking levy will be reduced by &euro;63 million.  The levy is being extended, but the revenue will be reduced by &euro;63 million.  The Minister has indicated that this is a result of KBC Bank Ireland and Ulster Bank leaving the market.  However, they have not left the market yet.  They are still servicing their loans and they will have a footprint here.  Crucially, what will happen is that the loans will be transferred to the other banks, and therefore, the other banks will get larger and will have bigger capacity to make a contribution.<\/p><p>Despite that, the levy will be reduced.  I think that is the wrong decision in the context of the discussion we had earlier where the Minister has facilitated, through the Finance Bill and not accepting amendments, that these same institutions will not pay tax on their profits for the guts of two decades.  The levy we were getting from the banking sector will be reduced even though these deposits will go to these large banks, in the main.  The levy was originally introduced in line with the DIRT tax which was in relation to the level of deposits that the institutions held.  We understand the Minister is one of those who is resistant to the idea of 100% redress for the families whose homes are crumbling around them.  It probably speaks to why he has not met them.  I will not open that again but the reason he should meet them is not because I have asked him many times or that the families have but because it is the decent thing to do.  In the context of the Bill that will come in from the State in relation to this, I put it to the Minister about a month ago about the motion that was passed, which, indeed, the Minister voted for on 100% redress and a contribution from the banks.  Last week, the Minister confirmed to me in a response to a Parliamentary Question that he has not had any engagement with the banks about a contribution to the mica redress despite the fact that whatever scheme comes forward will improve the balance sheets of those banks substantially.  I do not know what it takes.  I would really encourage the Minister to go and see the families.  I have spoken to them many times and told them that despite the differences of opinion between the Minster and I on politics and those between our parties that he is a decent person.  I think that any person who goes into those houses and looks at what is happening to those homes and those families will be impacted.  You cannot really learn or read about this, you need to see it and feel it for yourself.  I think then that the Minister would have a different approach to some of these measures because the financial institutions need to make a contribution on this.  Maybe he has something up his sleeve, such as a levy.  This was one way of ensuring that a contribution would be made over the coming years by retaining the levy for a substantial period where the financial institutions would pay a significant price towards the final cost of the scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#VV02700","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I was in the Chair yesterday when this was being discussed and I could not contribute, although I wanted to.  I dealt with the pyrite situation several years ago when it became obvious at the very beginning.  I agree entirely that this is something that the homebuyers or home builders could do nothing about.  They were victims of circumstances outside their control.  Prior to that, we had the house builders guarantee scheme in this country, which was very effective.  It was a simple way by which the construction industry, through self-regulation that worked, tried to ensure that the quality of materials going into the construction of houses was such as not to leave them liable to claims in the future.  The insurance companies and local authorities were involved in it.  It worked well until somebody decided it was no longer necessary.  With pyrite, the guarantee was up to &euro;30,000 and after that there was a serious problem.  After &euro;30,000, the problem was still the same for the individual householders.  I suggest that whatever arrangement is arrived at that it be done in such a way to ensure that all the constituent bodies are involved.  That means the Construction Federation of Ireland, Engineers Ireland, local authorities, insurance companies and the banks all have a contribution to make, and can do so.  I am not sure that punishing the banks beforehand will encourage them to do anything like that.  The primary aim now should be to address the issues of the appalling disintegration of people's houses.<\/p> <p>  I walked into those houses back then and it was appalling.  I walked into the trenches that were dug in the middle of the houses, in some cases by the people themselves, in an effort to remedy the faults.  That was before there was a remediation programme.<\/p> <p>  This is a serious issue and will become serious for all parts of the country as time goes on.  I fully appreciate that people are directly effected by it now and the extent of that.  We must all stand in solidarity with the public representatives of all parties in those areas who are united in doing everything possible to try to ensure that the issues are dealt with in a way that does not mean that the people have to live in penury for the rest of their lives.  Something along the lines of what was a solid reliable scheme should be put in place.  If it has to be done retrospectively, then so be it, but the constituent bodies should be brought into it.<\/p> <p>  There used to be a clerk of works in local authorities which was dispatched.  That was not a good idea.  With the banks, there was a system where someone building a one-off house could not draw down the loan unless there was some certification on the quality and condition of the houses.  Why would they?  They were going to be liable afterwards.  All these issues need to be wound into a scheme that will deal with the issue and assuage the concerns of the public, particularly the householders whose quality of life has been seriously threatened by something that was totally and absolutely outside their control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#WW00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Unless the Minister can persuade me otherwise, this section should be opposed.  I apologise if I am repeating points made earlier.  This is effectively a &euro;63 million tax cut for the banking sector.  The Minister is planning to exempt KBC and Ulster Bank, which are exiting the market, from the bank levy.  The business that KBC and Ulster Bank do will remain and will be taken over by other entities.  The projected revenue for the bank levy goes from &euro;150 million to &euro;87 million.  We will get &euro;63 million less, even though the amount of banking business that will be conducted in the State will remain exactly the same.  The beneficiaries of this will be the remaining pillar banks which will have less tax imposed on them, in terms of the bank levy, than they should for the amount of business they have.  Maybe it is Ulster Bank and KBC which are the beneficiaries.  The Minister can enlighten us on that.  As I understand it, and I am open to hearing what the Minister has to say, this amounts to a &euro;63 million cut in the levy that would otherwise accrue from the banks.  It also points to something else, namely, the problem with the banking sector in this country.  Given the huge suffering and hardship endured by people in this country in order to bail these people out because of their systemic importance to maintain this banking system.<\/p><p>That is the way I want to put it.  People will say that some of those banks were not beneficiaries, Ulster Bank, for example, although it was bailed out elsewhere.<\/p><p> I question the system.  We suffered greatly and are still suffering the consequences of the approach that was taken to the banking and financial crash.  The banking sector is still in disarray.  Let us not forget that it also charges the highest interest rates of any banking sector anywhere in Europe.  It has not exactly done us many favours since we bailed it out.  Should the lesson that we take from the financial and banking crash, and indeed from the departure of many players in the Irish banking system, not be that we need to fundamentally revise our attitude to how banking operates and look for a different model of banking?<\/p><p> Deputy Barry or Deputy Doherty may well have said this before me but it will not surprise anyone to hear me say that we need to think about a not-for-profit banking model, essentially a bigger version of what credit union banking is about.  Credit unions pursue social and societal objectives rather than the bottom line, which is what banks do.  That approach leads banks to do certain things or just depart when it does not suit them to do certain things, leaving customers in the lurch, flogging off their mortgages and creating great uncertainty, fear and anxiety.  That is a bigger point arising from this.<\/p><p> I ask the Minister to explain how this is justified.

There are three points here.  One is about how we respond to the great harm done by mica.  I am faced with calls all the time to meet groups about every issue the Government is dealing with that involves the use of money.  I am inevitably called on to meet those affected by mica.  If I decide to meet residents and homeowners who have had such an awful time with this trauma, it will not be because of public calls for me to do so but because I either feel it is the right thing to do or decide that it can help me with inputting into the decision the Government will make.<\/p> <p>  On the issue before the committee, it is worth noting that this revenue stream was due to come to an end this year.  We had not included in any of our forecasts for 2022 the extension of a bank levy and assumed the continuation of revenues from it.  From a budgeting point of view, any decision made about the extension of the bank levy was going to bring in additional revenue versus our budgetary forecasts for 2022.<\/p> <p>  I made the decision to do this because we have two banks that are either closing down for new business or have closed down.  Next year, we will need to see 1.4 million customer accounts transition from the two banks that are leaving Ireland to the three banks we still have.  That is a massive change in the loans, savings, business and personal lives of well over 1 million business owners and workers in the State.  My view was that any change in how the bank levy was applied could make that more difficult.  As to whether we are giving a tax reduction to any bank, AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB will continue to pay the same bank levy they paid this year.  No bank will receive a reduction in the bank levy.  Two banks are in the process of leaving Ireland and since they are leaving this economy, my view was that it was not appropriate that they pay the levy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#XX00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637107200,"counter":503,"content":"<p>Question put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637107200,"counter":504,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 105 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637107200,"counter":505,"content":"<p>NEW SECTIONS<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":506,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 106 and 112 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#XX00600","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 106:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 122, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:  \t<b>&ldquo;Report of Minister<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>58.<\/b>The Minister shall, by 31 December 2022, lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas reviewing the financial impact of the exit of Ulster Bank and KBC from the Irish market on Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland, whether the levy on certain financial institutions should be increased on Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland as a result, outlining the deferred tax assets still held by these two banks and whether they have increased charges for domestic customers following their increased share of the banking market.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote> <p>I covered quite a few of the arguments in my previous contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#XX00700","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":508,"content":"<p>Yes.

I do not quite understand, from the Minister's response, how the decision was reached and what precisely he is trying to effect.  I am one of the account holders affected by this and it is of extreme concern, as it is for 1 million other people too.  It is a major hassle.<\/p> <p>  All the account holders and their business will stay here and be transferred over.  My point is that all the business stays here.  It is just that Ulster Bank and KBC will leave.  I cannot figure out who is benefiting from that.  As far as I understand, the levy is linked to the amount of business and the deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, obligations of the banks.  Do the DIRT obligations change?  If they are calculated as they were previously and applied to all the banks, then the DIRT obligation remains the same because there is the same amount of deposits and so on.  All of that remains the same.  The only difference is that KBC and Ulster Bank have moved out because it suits them.  Either they are being rewarded for essentially doing the dirt on a 1 million customers for commercial reasons or the banks that remain, which will now have all of that business and accounts transferred to them, will escape the levy that they would have paid if those people were all their customers to begin with.  The amount would remain at &euro;150 million.  I take the Minister's explanation that he had not projected it and this is an extension, but assuming the extension was applied to everybody as if all those account holders and business had been in just three banks before, we would be getting &euro;150 million, but now we will get &euro;63 million less.  That is how I understand it.<\/p><p>We are looking for a report on all this, reviewing the implications of the banks' departure from the market and whether the levy should now be increased for Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland as a result, including consideration of the deferred tax assets these banks hold.  I would like to hear the Minister explain a little more convincingly why he has made the decision.  It seems to me somebody is benefiting from an action that will cause a lot of hardship, difficulty, stress and anxiety for 1 million bank customers, who are the same people who helped bail out many of these banks, with the exception of Ulster Bank.

This year, &euro;87 million will be paid by three banks that between them control 100%, or the vast lion's share, of the Irish banking industry.

How, precisely, does not extending the levy to the two institutions that are the cause of that disruption and anxiety benefit the 1 million people who will be seriously disrupted by their action?<\/p> <p>  If it is a goodbye reward for the two banks that have just deserted those 1 million people, it is bizarre in the extreme.  I do not see how it lessens the difficulty, hardship and anxiety one iota.  One would have to assume that it is not that, and this is where I would like clarification, but a kind of boon to the three remaining banks.  It is saying that given all of this, and the fact they will be getting all these extra customers, we are not going to charge the levy to the same extent we might in the situation where we made the decision to extend it.

Frankly, I would keep the bank levy going for decades.  I take the Minister's point that he had not projected the money so it is not a loss of money to the Exchequer.  He decided to extend it by a year.  By only levying it on the three remaining banks, less money comes in.  However, when there is the same amount of business and it is calculated based on the DIRT payment requirements, which are related to the amount of business, I do not understand why it is less.  Does it not mean that the amount of levy being paid as a proportion of the number of accounts is now less?<\/p><p> I do not get why is he doing that.  Who is benefiting from this?  However the Minister might explain it, I do not see how the customers are benefiting.  I do not see how not imposing this levy on the institutions is benefiting the customers.  Arguably by getting in additional revenue, which he would if he still collected the &euro;150 million, that would be extra money to the public which he could possibly use to alleviate difficulties, hardship and distress.

The Minister claims he is not increasing the levy on banks because they will suffer disruption, but they will be beneficiaries of the disruption.  That does not add up for me.  It could be flipped the other way around.  The two banks that are exiting keep a footprint here when we owe them nothing.  It is a scandal that they are on the way out the door.

That will create further incentives for them to look at how they might reduce the number of current accounts they have.  I am eager to avoid that happening.

This was examined in the tax strategy group papers.  In the North, a 2% surcharge on acquisitions by non-residents came into effect on 1 April 2021.

Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed an increase to 12.5% in the context of budget 2022.  This would have an advantage of dampening activity in the market and directing labour resources towards the residential housing sector, where it is most needed.  Furthermore, it could review the impact of Covid-19 and the move to remote working on this tax head.  As noted in its tax strategy group paper, the Department believes the rebound in commercial property activity and occupancy this year may be more of a reflection of how low demand was during the height of the pandemic and long term, it anticipates lower office demand than pre-Covid levels, due to the implementation of a more permanent remote hybrid working policy.<\/p><p>These three amendments all concern property and stamp duty.

The 10% being charged on some residential property, where it is over nine properties, is completely inadequate to deal with the phenomena of the big property investment vehicles coming in here and bulk buying property.  No measure has been taken by the Government to prevent them bulk buying apartments.  If the levy is imposed on some parts of the housing sector in terms of homes of ten or more, rather than apartment homes, is the Government concerned these vehicles will simply start to set up entities that will do nine?<\/p> <p>  I have certainly seen vulture funds behave in that way in my constituency in trying to get around other regulations, including thresholds such as the Tyrrelstown amendment and they have succeeded.  If they cannot evict ten tenants, they will evict seven, even though their intention to evict all tenants is clear.  However, they do it over a period of time.  I do not see why it is not possible for them to do the same, but that is an aside.<\/p> <p>  These entities are pretty ruthless and profit driven and the last people in whom they have an interest are those who need affordable housing.  That is not their interest, at all.  They are just here to make money.  Indeed, the advertisements on many of their websites to the people who might invest in these entities say they will maximise the value of people's investment.  That is how they promote themselves as businesses.  They do not say they are trying to do good for housing around the world.  They say to people who are thinking of investing that they will maximise the value of their investment.<\/p> <p>  That is the business they are in and they are not the sort of people on whom we should be relying to resolve a housing crisis, which is about human beings accessing a basic human need.  I would exclude them completely from the market.  Some 17% certainly goes much further than the Minister is proposing.  In some ways, I would be inclined to put it at 90%.  I just do not see the value of these people.  They should be driven out of the market.<\/p> <p>  The direction of amendment No. 110 is correct.  I highlighted some time ago on Leaders' Questions the issue of hotels being built, while we have a desperate need of housing and a shortage of construction labour.  This amendment tries to get at the same issue.  The Taoiseach replied that we needed hotels and told me not to counterpose the two.  However, there is a shortage of construction labour in this country.  If loads of construction workers are building hotels, they are not building houses.<\/p> <p>  If there is a priority at present, it is to build houses for people to live in, rather than more hotels, which are littering and in some cases destroying this city, because so many of them are being built.  They are destroying the city's heritage, as well as directing labour resources which are in short supply and are needed to build homes for people.  The objective of these amendments by Deputy Doherty is absolutely right.  I am interested to hear whether the Minister really believes the Government's current policies will deter the sort of objectionable activities being conducted by these profit-driven investment vehicles and the damage they are doing.<\/p><p>Does the Minister have measures that prioritise the construction of homes as against less essential construction of the hotel kind?  Indeed, is he interested in such measures?  I know less about the commercial office sector and whether there is an oversupply.  It gets my goat when I see the Seamark Building while travelling on the Merrion Road.  I do not know whether the Minister has ever passed it.  One of the NAMA developers, Bernard McNamara, built the big blocks beside St. Vincent's University Hospital.  They are huge impressive looking buildings.  There are about seven or eight of them.  At least one, which has been advertised for office space, has been sitting empty for ten years.  Do we need those kinds of developments or do we need homes?  In some areas, there is clearly an oversupply of office space, such that it cannot be rented.  I support the thrust of these amendments and am interested in hearing the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#AAA00900","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":546,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 109, 110 and 111 are grouped together and I will speak to each of them in turn.<\/p> <p>  Turning first to amendment No. 109, as the Deputy is aware, earlier this year I introduced a special 10% rate of stamp duty to apply to the purchase of ten of more houses in any 12-month period by any person or corporate entity.  This rate came into effect from 20 May 2021.  The new rate does not apply to the bulk purchase of apartments and is subject to a number of other exemptions for social housing purposes.<\/p> <p>  This measure was complemented by guidelines introduced by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) Regulation of Commercial Institutional Investment in Housing.  The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure that own-door houses and duplex units in housing developments are not bulk-purchased by commercial institutional investors in a manner that causes the displacement of individual purchasers and-or social and affordable housing, including cost-rental housing.<\/p> <p>  It is too early to evaluate how effective the stamp duty has been as a deterrent to institutional investors.  However, on the planning front, there have been a number of instances where An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted permission for the developments of new housing estates in Dublin and Galway, subject to conditions that houses and duplexes can only be occupied by individual purchasers and cannot be first owned by a corporate entity.  This is a significant development in response to the problem of housing estates being bought in bulk by investors.<\/p> <p>  As was acknowledged, I excluded apartments from the 10% stamp duty charge.  The reason for this was that a key objective of this tax was to achieve a balance between addressing the issue of multiple purchases by institutional investors, while at the same time ensuring that the supply of financing is not undermined, particularly in the construction of new apartment developments.  The rationale for this exemption was twofold.  In order for apartment complexes to be built, it is necessary in virtually all cases for an institutional investor to commit, through a binding contract, to purchase all or part of an apartment complex on completion.  This is a forward-purchase model and is usually entered into once planning permission has been obtained.  The benefit of this approach is that it allows a developer to obtain the necessary funds through bank lending to finance the project.  This financing could be unobtainable or more expensive in the absence of such a contract and there is, therefore, a risk that these apartments would not be built.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has indicated that institutional investors are only likely to commit to such arrangements if they can be certain that, at a later stage, they will be able to sell these apartments.  They are concerned that a 10% stamp duty levy would inhibit such a sale and, in turn, discourage such investors from participating in the financing of apartment complexes in this country.  Therefore, this is an important distinction as in its absence there is a significant risk that developers might not participate in and might exit the apartment building market because such projects might no longer be viable, and an important element of our future housing strategy would be undermined.<\/p> <p>  The Government has done a lot to discourage the bulk purchase of houses this year through the tax and planning systems.  It will be necessary to afford these measures time in order to evaluate their effectiveness.  That is why I do not agree to the amendment that seeks to introduce a 17% stamp duty surcharge on the purchase of all residential property by corporate structures, including real estate investment trusts, REITs, and Irish regulated funds, IREFs.<\/p> <p>  Moving to amendment No. 110 and the issue of purchases of residential property here by non-residents.  Deputy Doherty raised this issue with me last year during the passage of Finance Act 2020 through the House in the context of the UK having announced its intention to apply a similar surcharge from 1 April.  The matter was considered by the TSG this year in its stamp duty paper.  It included an examination of the potential benefits and drawbacks of introducing such a surcharge here.  It found that it was not possible for Revenue to provide an estimate of the revenue that such a measure would generate, due to the fact that there is not a difference of treatment of non&ndash;resident taxpayers compared with resident taxpayers for stamp duty purposes when they purchase residential property.  The report noted that additional, albeit unquantifiable, revenue could be generated from such a measure.  It indicated that such revenue would probably be of small amount.  It also suggested that such a disincentive to residential properties being bought as holiday homes by people not resident in Ireland could play a role in releasing housing supply for Irish purchasers, although those purchasers may themselves be acquiring a holiday home or investment property.<\/p> <p>  The TSG paper acknowledged some potential drawbacks, specifically a possible conflict with free movement regulations if a surcharge were applied to EU residents; a possibly negligible revenue gain if numbers of such acquisitions are low, particularly in light of the potential increased regulatory burden on Revenue and others involved; and the possibility of it acting as a disincentive for workers with valuable skills seeking to relocate to Ireland, while still maintaining tax residency in another country.  The UK introduced the 2% stamp duty tax surcharge on 1 April, and I will certainly follow the effect of this.  At present, I do not have any relevant data to allow me to form a view in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Given that the matter has just been considered by the TSG, a report is merited, which is why I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.<\/p> <p>  On amendment No. 111, there are a number of distinct components to the report being sought and I will speak to each of them.  First, we all acknowledge that remote working has become a feature of this pandemic and is likely to remain, in some form at least, a part of working life into the future.  However, at present, we are still in the midst of the pandemic and it is too early to get a clear perspective on how remote working patterns will impact on the commercial property sector over the longer term.  More time is needed for this to become clear.  However, I acknowledge that stamp duty receipts over the coming years are likely to give insight into how changing work patterns are affecting the sector.  In this regard, the committee should note that such receipts fell from &euro;537.64 million in 2019 to &euro;407.6 million in 2020 &ndash; a fall of 24.2% in spite of an increase in the rate from 6% to 7.5%.<\/p> <p>  Second, regarding the impact of activity in commercial property on labour supply, this matter has been raised in the past and I have acknowledged the merit in this as a rationale for changing the rate.  While undoubtedly there are some construction roles and skill sets that can transfer smoothly between both residential and commercial property construction, many specialist roles exist for the various construction property types such as house, industrial and office.  Even if the non-residential sector experiences a prolonged post-pandemic slowdown, putting aside the highly mobile nature of the workers involved, to get such workers to switch to the residential sector will likely require some retraining over time.<\/p><p>Therefore it is at least possible that a reduction in labour demand in the non-residential property sector may not necessarily result in a corresponding increase in the availability of workers for the residential sector, at least in the short term.<\/p><p> Third, the impact of increasing commercial stamp duty has been examined a number of times in recent years and has resulted in commercial stamp duty increasing from 2% to 7.5% between budget 2018 and budget 2020.  In the current economic environment, there will be no guarantee that increasing non-residential rates will generate additional revenue.<\/p><p> However, this area will be looked at as part of next year&rsquo;s tax strategy group, TSG.  I will have a better sense of the direction of travel of such stamp duty receipts at that time and will be in a better position to form a view on this matter.  Given we are going to look at that issue through the TSG, I do not, therefore, propose to accept this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#BBB00200","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comments.  I note the TSG will look at this stamp duty issue in the commercial property sector.  We talk about the role of taxes in respect of revenue raising or behaviour changing, and this measure is very much to try to divert activity away from one sector.  I am not a person who believes there should be no commercial property.  Of course we need commercial property and that type of development, but at this time we need our workforce to be directed as much as possible towards housebuilding in dealing with the existing crisis.  If there was ever an opportune time to try to divert people, it would be now.  I strongly urge us to look at that.  The success in this measure would be a reduction in taxation and a flow of investment and workers into that other channel.<\/p> <p>  On the stamp duty surcharge on the purchase of residential property, I understand there may be no data and that Revenue has identified there may be some benefits to it and so on.  I think the Minister may be going to some extreme lengths to suggest why it could not happen in that there would be more properties for people to buy in this State but they could be bought as holiday homes.  That was a good stretch by whoever was writing the Minister&rsquo;s notes.<\/p> <p>  We focus again on this issue.  We have many cash sales, non-resident sales and institutions buying up property in bulk, and all that restricts the amount of property that is available for first-time purchasers or those who are scaling up or down.  That is seriously problematic so we have to look, therefore, at measures we might not look at in other times.  We had a discussion earlier today on house price inflation, and this is one of the issues we are trying to deal with.<\/p> <p>  My county has seen increases in rental income of about 19%.  Roscommon was 20%, and we know in terms of rents that house prices are coming very close to the peak of the pre-crisis era.  That is no surprise.  We were told at the time that house prices would go back to those levels and it was very clear it would happen when it was decided to turn off the tap.  It was the Government before Fine Gael were in government, when Fianna F&aacute;il adopted that policy of long-term leasing.<\/p> <p>  This is, however, about trying to ensure we support home ownership.  We hear the Taoiseach always saying in the D&aacute;il that Sinn F&eacute;in does not support home ownership.  We do but we do not want the investment funds to own the homes.  We do not want the non-residents to be snapping them up.  We want ordinary people who want to live here and to be part of building their communities to have home ownership at an affordable price and that we are not weighing them down with very significant levels of debt which will have, in the main, to be mortgage-financed.<\/p> <p>  On the first amendment, which relates to investment funds bulk-buying properties, I know the Minister will dispute this, but it was quite embarrassing for him to have sat here for the past number of years, voting consistently against amendments we brought forward to deal with this issue, only then, thankfully, because of the role played by the media and the public anger at what was happening in Maynooth, for him to be forced into a complete tailspin where he and his officials had to cancel everything and draft emergency legislation within a fortnight that introduced a levy on these funds, but only in the case of the bulk-buying of homes.  I argue the rate is too low and can be absorbed.<\/p> <p>  The biggest problem here is this, and the Minister knows or should know this better than I do.  I am from Gweedore in west Donegal but a large number of completions in Dublin are apartments.  That is what is happening in this city.  In Donegal where I come from, I do not have the figures with me but I would say that over 99% of homes there are houses, not apartments.  In Dublin a large number of completions are apartments.  Some 47% of all new homes built in Dublin from January to September 2020 were apartments.  In the city of Dublin, 85% of homes were apartments.  The Minister has handed these over to the vulture funds, the investment funds, which are not financing the construction of them but are entering into, as the Minister acknowledged in his script, purchasing arrangements.  No money passes from the funds to the developer until they are completed and these funds then purchase them from the developer, off the market, and they are not available to anybody in this city or elsewhere to be purchased.<\/p> <p>  I will make the point again where 85% of homes in the city of Dublin are apartments and are being bought by the funds, not by people from Coolock, Drumcondra or Finglas.  That is not just the end of the madness.  As a result of the tax structure that applies to these funds, these apartments are bought at high costs and push prices up.  These funds can do that because they are bought to rent.  They are rented out then at high prices and rent rolls but not paying any tax on the rental income.  That is a privilege that is not available to any other company or individual in this State bar Irish real estate funds, IREFs and real estate investment trusts, REITs.<\/p> <p>  When they sell these assets in years to come they will pay no capital gains tax on the uplift.  On an asset that may have increased in value by &euro;100 million, they will not pay the 33% capital gains tax on that that any individual or any other company structure would have to pay.  It is for those reasons, because there is no taxation within the fund and only dividend withholding tax at a maximum of 20% on disbursement of dividends, that they are able to outbid, push and jack up the prices for these apartments and put prices up across the board.  That is what is happening.<\/p> <p>  I am sick and tired of saying this every single time at this committee.  I say to the Minister, surely to God if it is simply not working year after year and he is sitting in the driving seat, maybe it is time to look in the mirror to see if there is another path we can go down.  If he continues on this road, it is not good.  It is not good for the footprint of Dublin or that he is surrendering Dublin to these funds.  It is not good for home ownership or for prices of property across the board.<\/p> <p>  It is not just I who is saying this and I am sure the Minister will try to dismiss what I am saying.  The Department of Finance the Minister leads published a paper in 2019 entitled Institutional Investment in the Housing Market.<\/p><p>The paper noted:<\/p><blockquote>\tThere is a risk that, should ... [buy-to-rent] investment continue at current growth rates, market forces would over the long-term create socio-economic polarisation in some urban areas.  Under such a scenario average income earners would be priced-out of purchasing or renting from the private market ... <\/blockquote><p>It also stated: &quot;... there is a risk that at sufficient scale an institutional investor or group of investors could, over time, develop monopolistic ... pricing power&quot;.  That is happening under the Minister's nose.  Not only that, but the Minister is facilitating it.  This is eyes-wide-open stuff.  Crazy stuff is happening.  These are things which cannot be reversed easily overnight because they are going to have a long-term impact on property prices, the shape of Dublin and how people live and are able to go about their lives.  It is also wider than just apartments.  This amendment is about calling that out.  It is about ending that practice.  It is about saying, &quot;No, we need to stop this&quot;.  That is what it is about.<br\/><br\/>As I said, I know the Minister is not going to budge on this.  He has no current plans to do the investor roadshow but his Department is planning the investor roadshow and I am sure he has not told it to stop.  That is the reality of it.  What has happened is heartbreaking.  This is not a natural disaster.  It is not a  pandemic.  It is not what we are facing with Covid-19.  It is not climate change and the challenges that will bring.  This is a direct consequence of policies he and his predecessor have implemented and which people at this and previous finance committees continue to cheerlead and vote through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#CCC00300","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#DDD00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":551,"content":"<p>No, I am not finished.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#DDD00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I want to bring in the Deputy's colleague and Deputy Boyd Barrett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#DDD00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":553,"content":"<p>Let me finish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#DDD00500","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":554,"content":"<p>If you would.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#DDD00600","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I am the proposer of three amendments which you will probably reject when I push them to a vote.

I come from an estate that was built in the 1950s and that is home to a very strong and proud community.

They were left with two choices.  We have had the discussion about affordability.  We had a good, long discussion yesterday about the whole issue of the affordability crisis.

Some of us are coming late to the table on this argument.  Some of us were here before, a long time ago, and raised again and again the question of the danger of growing the rental property sector in Dublin and the surrounding towns and cities.  Nobody raised a finger.  Nobody was willing to stand up and be counted then, despite the fact that I tabled countless parliamentary questions drawing attention to that growth, which occurred for no reason at all other than for certain parties to get a hold of the market.  That was long before the crises started.  It was the wrong development at the wrong time, and people stood by and looked at it and never said a word about it.  It went on from there because the argument in favour of this growth at that time was that it was much cheaper to rent a house.  What a load of crazy nonsense.  The point I made at the time was that it would soon become more expensive to rent a house than to buy it, and that is what happened.  No disrespect at all to our friends in the Opposition, but, despite all these arguments, nobody said anything about this at the time.  A couple of us were on our own pointing out what would happen, that is, that the market would be concentrated in a particular area, which would lead to a housing shortage for people who wanted to buy their own homes or to get local authority houses from the local authority.  Every kind of turn was put upon it at the time.  Now this has become obvious to everybody.  Everybody is pointing out what went wrong.  Some of us pointed out all these things before they happened.  That is one thing about politics.  We need to learn to identify the dangers before they occur.  We are not good at that and we are not improving either.  We need to concentrate on that and do it because, if we do not, we will have calamity after calamity and we will not be able to comment until after, when we will say, \"My God, how did this happen?  Somebody is to blame for this.\"  \"Ourselves\" is the answer to that question.  I was a strong opponent of this policy at the time.  My arguments were proven correct.  I do not at all expect anybody to jump up and down and say, \"You were very wise to say those things at the time.\"  It was, however, unpopular to say them and to speak in that fashion.  I am now repeating what I have said before, as did a number of other people.  The core of the argument at the time was that people had a natural inclination to own their own homes, and means should have been found at all times to accommodate them.  It does not matter where they come from or what their background is; they are entitled to aspire to that, and we need to help them all the time.<\/p> <p>  Whatever happens from here on in, let us do the best we can.  The die was cast a long time ago but we have to deal with this now.  I know things will come around.  Wheels turn and come back to where they started, usually, and that will happen again.  How soon it will happen I do not know, but I do know one thing: young people - this affects everybody but young people more than anybody else - who are anxious to own their own homes or willing to accept local authority houses or affordable houses they can purchase, or whatever way it comes, want to do that all the time.  That is part and parcel of their upbringing.  They have always wanted to do that.  It is part of their independence.  It is also part of the taxation system because, obviously, the fewer affordable houses available to people and the higher the rent goes, the more they have to be paid.  It is an economic issue as well, not only for the potential homeowners but for the whole State.  It is therefore in everybody's interest to deal with the issues before they occur, preferably, but still we have to deal with them now and we will.<\/p> <p>  Chairman, I thank you for the opportunity to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#EEE00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I will deal with each of the questions in turn.<\/p> <p>  To begin in the order in which Deputy Doherty addressed the issues he raised, I refer to the issue of commercial stamp duty, the latitude for it to be increased further and the role it might play in not only raising revenue but also, more importantly, shifting capital into the delivery of more homes.  That is one of the reasons I have over recent years increased stamp duty on commercial property.  Further evaluation and examination are required as to whether that policy could be used further in the future.  I will say a couple of things about this.  The rate has gone from 2% to 7.5%, a very large increase, over a few budgets.  It has more than tripled at a time when we can see uncertainty surrounding the demand for commercial property in the future.  How structural that uncertainty will be and how long it will last I do not know at this point, but the reason I decided not to introduce a further change to stamp duty on commercial property in this budget was that I felt there is enough change going on in that sector at the moment and I did not believe a further change would yield significant additional revenue.  The fact that we had seen tax receipts in that tax head decline points to the fact that it is a tax rate that may have a bit less utility at the moment than it has had in the past.  As I said, however, this will be looked at through the tax strategy group, TSG, next year.<\/p> <p>  I outlined a number of different reasons I believe there could be a difficulty with an additional surcharge for non-resident purchasers in Ireland.  One reason was that I raised the point as to what could be the use of the home that might be bought for an Irish purchaser.  It is not the strongest argument there is.  I think there are other reasons that might point to the drawbacks of that measure.  Again, that can be reviewed through the TSG and I will be able to consider it in future budgets.  We can evaluate the impact it will have in the UK, and I hope information from that becomes clear enough soon.<\/p> <p>  As for the broader discussion about the role of institutional investors, specifically REITs and IREFs, and to go back to arguments that have been made and will continue to be made again, it is in this committee and in the D&aacute;il that decisions are made that have very significant effects on our economy, on how homes are built, on the cost of those homes and on who is in a position to buy or rent them.  Again, however, it is vital to put this discussion about institutional investors into the context of the other things the Government is doing to respond to the housing needs that we know are there, are really significant and are growing for many.  I can put the human faces on those cases as well and on constituents I meet who are equally worried about whether they will be able to live in their local community or whether they will find themselves living in the spare room in a few years' time, worried that they might not be able to afford rent tomorrow or afford a home in the future.  I meet similar constituents, experience the same feedback and see the same concern that many people have about this.  That is why in our budget we have &euro;4.1 billion allocated to make progress on housing.<\/p><p> Contrary to what Deputy Boyd Barrett said, we are not relying on institutional investors to solve our housing needs and the great housing difficulties we have at the moment.  They are one of elements that can make a difference to the delivery of more apartments in particular, but they are also why, across next year, we are aiming to build 9,000 social homes and 4,100 affordable and cost-rental units.  We want to see the private sector delivering 11,500 homes for private rental and private purchase.  In addition to whatever work these investors and entities are doing in building or enabling the supply of more apartments is a Government that is actively involved in building more homes directly or enabling their building through cost-rental and affordable models of delivery, which I hope will deliver even more homes next year, and acknowledges that we need the private sector to build more homes for people who want to own their homes in their entirety without a role for the State.  We also acknowledge that the private sector in particular has a role to play in the provision of apartments at scale, that is, to build lots of them.  Particularly within Dublin and some of our other cities, we need more apartments to be built across the coming years to respond to the demand for those apartments.<\/p><p> This brings us back to the role of institutional investors.  I contend that these funds play a role in apartments being built that would otherwise not be built.  The apartments that are the subject of such criticism would not exist at all if we did not have investors like these channelling savings from other parts of the world into the purchase or co-funding of homes that allows them to be built.  This is something that happens in many other countries and forms a part of how apartment development in cities takes place.  While these apartments are the subject of such criticism, what would be the subject of even more criticism would be if apartments were not being built at all.  In a city like Dublin and a number of our other larger cities, we need apartments being built in scale in a way that people will be able to afford.  I know that is tough at the moment, but without apartments being built in numbers, we will not be able to respond to the rental needs that so many people have.  Institutional investors play a role in the funding and delivery of apartments that, in their absence, would not be built.<\/p><p> I am looking at the alternatives that are being proposed here and the charge that is being made regarding our intentions.  The role of these funds is being played beside a State and a Government that, in the first six months of 2021, delivered 2,433 new build social homes and 3,600 social homes in total.  The Government has a further 8,750 social homes in the pipeline and another 9,000 at design or tender stage.  This is the overall record of what the Government is doing - building homes directly at scale for social and public use, as well as for affordable and cost-rental.  Our ambition is to deliver 4,100 of those next year.  At the same time, apartments are being built by these organisations that are the subject of such criticism.  In the absence of their role, the apartments that they are building would not be built.<\/p><p> Turning to the alternatives, I have looked at what Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing as well as its draft budget.  Sinn F&eacute;in says that it would build 20,000 social homes next year at a cost of &euro;3 billion.  That is an average cost per home of &euro;150,000.  The question that Sinn F&eacute;in will need to answer, just as I answer questions on our housing policy, is how on earth does it believe it can build a home for &euro;150,000.  In its alternative budget, it is putting less money into housing next year than the Government is yet it is promising to deliver more homes.  The only way it can make that work is at a cost per home that is a fraction of the cost of building homes.<\/p><p> Last night, Sinn F&eacute;in voted against a measure that was concerned with trying to increase the supply of rental accommodation.  It was the tax code measure, which I have extended, to allow unused rental properties to be renovated by landlords, with some of the costs being defrayed by the tax code.  Over the past two years, this measure has been responsible for 3,335 properties coming back onto the rental market.  Sinn F&eacute;in is planning to build homes at a cost of &euro;150,000, yet it votes against any measure we have that tries to increase the supply of rental accommodation.  It is a party that makes much of its claim that it understands the rental crisis, but it opposes any measure that leads to new rental homes being built and, in its own policies, advocates the building of homes at a fraction of the actual cost of building them.<\/p><p> Regarding Deputy Boyd Barrett's points, his view is that he does not want these entities in Ireland at all.  As always, he is at least clear in his policy.  However, who does he want to build all of the accommodation - houses and apartments - that we will need?  He appears to be against profit playing any role in the delivery of anything in our economy.  It is a fact that those involved in building homes want to make a profit on their return.  In many cases, that profit is reinvested in the delivery of more homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#EEE00300","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I am delighted that the Minister reads our alternative budgets.  Maybe they will give him some ideas on how to change direction.  The Minister has been in the driving seat and this is only going one direction, which is that house prices and rents are going up and up while availability is going down and down.  That is the reality and no one else is to blame.  The Minister is right: this is where we make the decisions.  He has made the wrong ones time and again.  It was only when the public called him out and asked how under God he was allowing these funds to come in and snap up homes from ordinary families that were trying to get homes and start their lives that he was embarrassed into scrambling his officials.  Within a fortnight, he had to introduce emergency legislation that he had voted against six months prior.  That is the reality.<\/p> <p>  I am sure the Minister knows how the financing of homebuilding occurs.  He will understand that there is Exchequer expenditure and non-Exchequer expenditure.  That is why the figures he has misrepresented to the committee are wrong.  The &euro;3 billion he mentioned is Exchequer expenditure.  I encourage the Minister not to embarrass himself any further and to examine the policy and start implementing the delivery of 20,000 social, affordable and cost-rental homes.  But, no.  He has spent the past half hour defending the fact that he will continue to support institutional investors coming to Ireland and purchasing apartments in bulk.

I remember him giving a speech.  Someone drew my attention to it on YouTube a number of months ago.  Well over a decade ago, I spoke about how crazy it was of Government policy to stop building homes and to enter into long-term leasing arrangements, the nonsense of knocking down derelict or ghost estates, and how we would have a housing crisis, the prices of homes within ten years would revert to where they were prior to the crash and people would be evicted from their homes because landlords would sell up.  This was not crystal ball stuff and someone did not need to be a genius.  The then Government decided on a course of action just as the Minister before us is deciding on a course of action.  He has pursued a policy that can only result in house prices and rents increasing and the profits of the funds increasing.  That is what has happened.  It is not crystal ball stuff.  If one does A, one will get B.<\/p> <p>  As the Minister is flicking through our alternative budget, I will offer him a novel idea.  Let us ramp up investment in social, affordable and cost-rental homes.  Let the State step in with the appropriate response and build houses.  It has not built houses for years.  I have no doubt that the Minister's constituents are giving him the same messages mine are giving me.  The difference is that he very much is responsible for the hardships facing many families across the State.  I say this not as a personal attack on him but in terms of him being the person occupying the role of Minister for Finance who has continually pursued a policy that has been detrimental to ordinary families across the State.  That is the reality.  This is where it happens and the Minister is the guy who makes it happen.  He is also the person who, if he changes direction, allows us to start to change the narrative.  We would start making house prices affordable.  I look at the Minister's record, though, which is something from which he cannot shy away.  From a taxation point of view, his record on housing has been appalling.  How can he stand over it?  Prices have only gone in one direction.<\/p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste spoke on RT&Eacute; a year and a half ago - I watched it recently - and said that there was good news, in that house prices had peaked and were starting to decrease, as were rents, and that it would be two years before people started to feel it.  That was a year and a half ago.  In that time, the same thing happened as happened in the years prior, that being, house prices and rents increased and ordinary people were pushed to the pin of their collar.  There is tea and sympathy for the funds but no help for ordinary people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#GGG00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":567,"content":"<p>Does the Minister wish to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#GGG00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":568,"content":"<p>Absolutely, but at what time are we breaking?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#GGG00500","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":569,"content":"<p>We will have to suspend as soon as we see the vote called in the Chamber, but we will return-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#GGG00600","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":570,"content":"<p>Are we voting on this group of amendments after I finish?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#GGG00700","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":571,"content":"<p>It depends on how long it takes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#GGG00800","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":572,"content":"<p>Let us vote on it now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#GGG00900","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":573,"content":"<p>I am going to give the Minister a chance to respond before putting the question on these three amendments and possibly the question on the section.

We made a decision in both cases to work towards handing those back to interests that were not primarily interested in solving the housing crisis but in maintaining their financial position or in benefiting from that.<\/p> <p>  I still think that argument remains the same.  The Minister asks who has the capital and says that the State does not have all the capital.  First, the State has fairly unlimited access to capital at the moment because of the interest rate situation.  There is also huge scope for redistributional taxes in our opinion, as the Minister knows, although I will not go over that argument.  Redistribution of taxes would help find the capital.  We mentioned the credit unions but let us not forget the banks as well.  Where are the savings?  One refers to the savings of other countries as being manifest in these vulture funds in coming over here and supposedly helping us with the housing sector.  We have our own savings here.  Where are they?  The are in credit unions and in the banks.  The people who hold those savings have a bit more interest in solving the housing crisis than the venture funds, vulture funds or whatever you want to call them in New York.  To me, that is self-evident.  <\/p> <p>  There was a time when these funds did not exist.  It was the case that 20, 30 or 40 years ago, when this country was much poorer, it was able to deliver social housing.  It was able to do so far more effectively than it has been proven to be able to do in the past few decades, when the country has been much wealthier.  That is our argument.  There are alternative sources for the capital investment.  These are the savings that exist in this country in our own banking system.  We could access these savings if were to take control of that banking system, which we bailed out, and use them for societal objectives and for social objectives.  To be honest, I do not think most people in this country would object to their savings being used for or directed towards solving problems like that.  <\/p> <p>  On the costing of houses, Deputy Doherty has defended Sinn F&eacute;in's own position.  However, the costings we put in our pre-budget submission were costed by the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  We used the prices for one-bedroom, two-bedroom, three-bedroom and four-bedroom, based on estimates provided by the Department, as to how much it would cost to deliver those houses.  As for our proposal for more than 20,000 housing units, the pricing for them in our budget submission was based on estimates given to us by the Government.<\/p><p>I want to say that for the record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#KKK00500","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":623,"content":"<p>When this debate started earlier this evening I was afraid that I would be bored.  I am happy to say that I am no longer bored because I am shocked.  I am shocked at the loss of memory, the collective amnesia among the Opposition.  Looking back ten years is one thing, but I cannot even rely on them to look back five years and to recall with any kind of accuracy what the situation was.<\/p> <p>  I am very fond of Deputy Boyd Barrett because he has some good ideas.  It is just that when he puts them into operation it is like flying a kite upside down.  It does not work that way, so you have to go the opposite route.  The thing that takes me to the fair most of all is the point that the previous Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, the subsequent Government and the present Government should have done more, but I ask the question, with what?  Does nobody recall that there was no money in the banks and no money to be got out of the banks?  There was no credit.  We had no credit rating.  Mr. Modi was in Government Buildings working out a way to salvage the country, if it could be salvaged.  The problem is that nobody seems to remember that now.<\/p> <p>  I worry about the philosophy behind the thinking when we come to that.  You cannot go into a bank and say you are from People Before Profit and that you should get money because you want to spend it.  Any cause is a good cause, but they are never going to pay it back, because there is no substance to the argument.  I am sorry to have to say that, but it is a fact.  Deputy Boyd Barrett knows that himself because he is a reasonable and shrewd guy.  I give him full credit for that.  It takes a little bit of doing to be able to say that with a straight face.<\/p> <p>  I want to remind people that some of us were talking about the crash long before it came.  The crash is what left us where we are.  We got one hell of a belt and we had to drag ourselves up by the bootlaces and struggle on.  Then Covid came on top of that again, just to remind us that we were not going to be left alone for too long.  When I think back, I used to wake up every morning and wonder if the people in Government Buildings were going to come to any kind of a conclusion that would be to our advantage.  We waited, and every time we switched on the television, there were one or two of these guys walking across the street with large, bulging bags, and it was not money that was in them, it was documents.  We had failed to run our economy because we did not do what should have been done at the time.  We did not manage it.  I remember the Minister for Finance saying at the time to somebody across the House that the economy was like a bank, you had to manage it.  It was ironic.  They needed the banks to be managed, not the economy.<\/p> <p>  I am not blaming the politicians.  I have pointed this out on several occasions.  A number of us put down questions to find out what the hell was going wrong.  I got one answer to a question in about four years that clearly indicated to me that the fat was in the fire and we were in deep trouble.  What I cannot understand is why some of the Opposition in here now do not remember that far back.  It is only seven or eight years ago.  Why did they not raise those questions?  It was to the advantage of the people of the country to be able to raise those questions and say we cannot dig a hole any deeper than it is now.<\/p> <p>  It is on that point that I want to turn the argument to the future.  If some of the philosophies now being put forward are carried through, if the people give an opportunity to our colleagues here to put them into operation, there will be desolation.  Venezuela will be like the garden of paradise.  There will be nothing like it.  It will be an absolute economic desert.  That is not going to come until such time as the lending institutions, the international financiers and the people in this country suddenly realise this thing is not what it was made out to be at all.  These people do not have an economic plan and they do not have the superior knowledge that they claim to have.  They have ideology.  It does not count.  It is hard facts, brass tacks, that count.  We must have a debate that relates to how the economy is managed, how we can spend money that we can afford and how we cannot just go around to people on a door-to-door basis and say we want their money, we have a good idea and we will tell them all about it later.  Look at what happened before.  Do we want to repeat that?  Does anyone in this room want to repeat that and to suffer the indignity of the position we were in?<\/p> <p>  I remember being called to a meeting in Brussels at that time along with a number of other people. I do not know why I was called.  They probably felt that I needed to be beaten up.  All of the member states were there, and they castigated this country for what we did and the implications for the rest of the European Union.  They were angry.  Many people, some who were near neighbours, despised us and ridiculed us on the basis that we were not able to manage the economy, yet here we are going back the same route again.  Have we learned nothing at all?  Surely, we should have learned something and that it is not that far away that we cannot remember 2007.  In 2007 the country was flat broke, and nobody wanted to accept it.  In 2005 the country was flat broke, and it still went on.  I despair at the debate that we have had for the last half an hour or so.  If it is that bad, that we cannot remember what went wrong and we cannot accept it, then we are quite liable to do the same daft things again.  It would be stupid if we go down that route.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#LLL00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I will make a final and brief point.

<blockquote> \t(i) betting (including pool betting), or<br \/><br \/>(ii) any lottery, sweepstake or game with prizes;&quot;.&quot;. <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>This amendment aims to address an anomaly between the way in which non-cash prizes are treated for the purposes of capital acquisitions tax, CAT, in legislation and the way in which they are treated for the purposes of the tax in practice.  In the normal course of events, the receipt by a person of an asset which he or she has not paid for is a gift for the purposes of CAT.  However, section 82 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 provides for a CAT exemption for certain types of receipts.  These include the receipt of compensation payments for personal injuries and the receipt by an incapacitated person of certain trust funds.<\/p><p>Where a person wins a sum of money from betting, a lottery, a sweepstake or a game with prizes, he or she benefits from this exemption by virtue of section 82(1)(c).  Only sums received bona fide qualify.  In the absence of this provision, a person could seek to avoid CAT by arranging with the disponer to bet on some event the outcome of which was certain, or which could be controlled by the disponer and donee.<\/p><p>Where a person participates in raffle or draw and wins a non-cash prize, however, the person is deemed to have received a gift for the purposes of CAT.  As they are not cash prizes, they do not come within the scope of the exemption for certain receipts provided for by section 82.  This means that, strictly speaking, a charge to gift tax arises on the value of the non-cash prize taken by the person in the raffle or draw.  Notwithstanding this treatment of non-cash prizes in the legislation, non-cash prizes have, in practice, been given the benefit of the CAT exemption which applies to winnings from betting, lotteries, sweepstakes and games with prizes.  This treatment is considered to be in line with the original intent of the exemption, if not the actual wording.<\/p><p>When section 82 was introduced in 1976, it would have been very unusual to see property such as a house or a car being offered as a prize from a game of chance, far more usual was the offer of a cash prize.  In recent times, however, the increasingly popular use of raffles and draws for assets such as houses and cars as a means of fund-raising by community-based organisations such as GAA clubs and local schools has highlighted the difference between the legislation and the practice on the ground.  This amendment brings the legislation up to date, so that it reflects the current practice whereby non-cash prizes from bona fide raffles and draws are also exempt from CAT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111700002#NNN00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":644,"content":"<p>I am not 100% sure what the change is in the subsection it is replacing.

The provisions were designed to restrict penalty mitigation in a case where a person has or had offshore matters as defined, notwithstanding the making of what would otherwise be a qualifying disclosure.  The definition of \"offshore matters\" was extremely broad and essentially included any offshore income, gain, account or property.  The provision removes any incentive for taxpayers to approach Revenue voluntarily to regularise their tax affairs where such regularisation involved offshore matters because there was no benefit in doing so.  They cannot avail of mitigation of penalties and cannot avoid publication and potential prosecution, all of which are benefits normally associated with the making of a qualifying disclosure.  Therefore, the existence of subsection (15)(a) and related provisions in other Acts is making it more difficult to finalise interventions in many cases.  Revenue may be unable to agree the penalty with taxpayers as a higher rate of penalty will apply in any case with an offshore element.  In the absence of agreement on the penalty, Revenue must have the penalty determined by a court.  This, in turn, can often cause significant delays.<\/p> <p>  It is considered that the provisions have achieved the objective for which they were introduced, with 3,042 cases having been finalised with a yield of more than &euro;90 million.  As noted, the continuation of these provisions is, in some cases, acting as a deterrent to voluntary compliance and, in others, making it more difficult to finalise cases.<\/p> <p>  I am making this change not only on the advice of my Department, but after my Department has consulted the Revenue Commissioners.

This threshold is considered low and is based on the combined amount of tax, interest and penalties.  Under the current system, given that the interest charge for late penalties is 8% or 10% per year, depending on the tax type, a recent tax underpayment might escape publication because the interest rate charge was relatively low, whereas an underpayment of the same amount from a few years ago might be publishable because of a higher interest liability.  It is considered that the publication threshold should be determined based on the tax amount only, as this focuses on the under-declared tax liability.  A case is only published where the penalty is 15% or more and the taxpayer has not made a qualifying disclosure.  When considered in tandem with those provisions, increasing the threshold to &euro;50,000 focuses the publication process on defaulters and their behaviour and will not dilute the deterrent effect of publication.<\/p> <p>  Increasing the threshold to &euro;50,000, and confining this to tax only, will reduce the number of cases published and represent a more significant level of default that justifies publication, and thereby shall bring a greater focus on those taxpayers who are published.  This may act as a deterrent for those taxpayers who want to protect their good name, thereby achieving the objective of publication.  This change also potentially incentivises the disclosure regime even further.  The original publication threshold when the regime was introduced in 1983 was &pound;10,000 punts.

The Irish Cancer Society welcomes the Bill's provisions to ban the purchase of e-cigarettes by under-18s, to introduce a new licensing fees regime for tobacco and e-cigarettes and to end sales of tobacco products from vending machines and at child-centred events.  These changes will help to reduce children&rsquo;s opportunities to buy cigarettes and that is very welcome.  However, unfortunately, it is not enough.<br\/><br\/>As we all know too well, if young people want something badly enough, they will find a way to get it.  That is why the tobacco industry is spending billions making e-cigarettes attractive to children and why any legislation that does not address its aggressive advertising and child-friendly flavours and packaging is destined to fail.<br\/><br\/>Ireland has a proud history of being a world leader in tobacco control.  The introduction of the workplace smoking ban and plain packaging by former Ministers for Health, the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and James Reilly were courageous and important victories for public health in a world that often values commercial interests more.  Unfortunately, when it comes to e-cigarettes, Ireland is a laggard, not a leader.  Estonia, Finland and Hungary have banned non-tobacco flavouring in e-cigarettes and the Netherlands announced its intention to do the same.  Nine EU countries have total bans on e-cigarette advertising, promotion and sponsorship.  Right now, while young people elsewhere in Europe are being protected against e-cigarette marketing, young Irish people are being bombarded with ads on billboards, on buses and at checkouts.  Our young people deserve better.  As the head of the Health Research Board, HRB, Dr. Jean Long, recently stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tChildren and adolescents require the same protection from e-cigarettes as conventional tobacco cigarettes through a well-enforced regulatory regime of measures including age restriction on purchase, control of availability through licensing outlets, limits to product visibility and attractiveness, and appropriate pricing through taxation. <\/blockquote><p>From speaking to policymakers I understand the need for tougher e-cigarette regulation that their hesitance to do so is driven by genuine concerns.  They want to help adult smokers to quit and believe e-cigarettes have a role to play.  They know individuals, as I am sure we all do, who have moved from smoking tobacco to vaping and they are persuaded by industry arguments that the kind of measures required to protect young people from vaping will hinder the efforts of long-term smokers to quit tobacco.<br\/><br\/>Let us not forget that all the major e-cigarette companies are owned by big tobacco.  When a representative of PJ Carroll wrote to members recently about this Bill, they described the company as an e-cigarette company.  However, PJ Carroll is one of the biggest tobacco companies in Ireland and is owned by the global tobacco giant, British American Tobacco.<br\/><br\/>For years, the cigarette industry told us that cigarettes do not cause cancer, that low tar cigarettes were healthier than other products and that second-hand smoke was harmless.  It produced its own so-called research, misrepresented the findings of genuine studies and hired persuasive lobbyists to hoodwink public representatives and block progressive public health measures.  Now it is at it again.  Companies whose primary business is selling cancer-causing tobacco are trying to convince our public representatives that their main concern is smokers' health and that they want to help smokers quit tobacco using e-cigarettes.  It would be laughable if it were not so serious.  <br\/><br\/>It is true that some smokers prefer vaping to the use of licensed nicotine replacement gums and other products.  However, as the HRB pointed out, e-cigarettes are no more effective than approved and regulated nicotine replacement therapies to help people stop smoking.  The World Health Organization stated that electronic nicotine delivery systems cannot be recommended to help cessation at the population level and warned they could impede cessation among some individuals by prolonging or even increasing addiction to nicotine.<br\/><br\/>The Irish Cancer Society is committed to doing everything we can to help people quit smoking.  We constantly monitor emerging evidence both nationally and globally.  We promote cessation methods that reputable independent bodies have found to be effective.  We provide smokers with individual support and advice and we have helped developed peer support programmes that been proven to help people quit.  We know how hard it is to quit smoking and stand in solidarity with those who are trying.  We understand why many adult smokers choose to try vaping and we respect that decision.  However, we cannot promote something that the WHO and others have found to be harmful.<br\/><br\/>The improvements we are advocating to this Bill will not hinder adult smokers who want to try vaping, but they will protect children and young people who have never smoked and would never take up the habit if it were not for e-cigarettes.  They will protect children from flavours like bubblegum, tutti-frutti and cola that are clearly aimed at them and not at lifetime tobacco smokers.  It is well established that e-cigarettes can develop into a gateway to nicotine addiction and ultimately traditional tobacco consumption, as they mimic and normalise the action of smoking.  Indeed, the HRB found adolescents who have tried an e-cigarette are between three and five times more likely to start smoking compared to those who never used e-cigarettes.  That is the real reason that the tobacco industry is so invested in electronic cigarettes.  <br\/><br\/>The tobacco industry kills one in two of its customers.  Its business model is dependent on recruiting young people to replace them.  It will do and say anything to achieve that goal.  Ireland&rsquo;s delay in effectively regulating e-cigarette sales and marketing has played right into its hands.  Attracted by cool advertising, childlike flavours and aggressive point of sale marketing, more and more young Irish people are taking up vaping.  As research by Professor Luke Clancy has shown, as vaping has become more popular, the smoking rate among our 15- to 16-year-olds has also increased from 13.1% in 2015 to 14.4% in 2019.<br\/><br\/>To conclude, Ireland has a proud tradition of taking on big tobacco and putting public health first.  Let us not undermine all of that by allowing tobacco companies an unlocked back door to entrapping a whole new generation into nicotine addiction.  Let us stand in solidarity with our EU partners in protecting our young people from tobacco and the devastation, disease and death it causes.  To do that, this legislation must include a ban on e-cigarette flavours other than tobacco, a ban on e-cigarette product advertising through all communication mediums and the introduction of plain packaging for e-cigarette products.  Heads 16, 17 and 21 should also be amended to include nicotine inhaling products as well as tobacco products.  Together, we can help adults quit smoking through safe and effective methods while also ensuring today&rsquo;s young people never take up the habit. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021111700002#A00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Averil Power","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":751,"content":"<p>I remind members and witnesses not to mention individuals or companies if they can avoid it.

Our legislators, health authorities and health NGOs have forged a powerful alliance over many years that has made Ireland a leading global force in tobacco control.  Through bold action, enabled by political consensus, many thousands of lives have been saved in Ireland, and countless more in other countries where policies pioneered here have been replicated.  Today, the Irish Heart Foundation urges members to act boldly again to revitalise the faltering quest for a tobacco-free Ireland and to protect young people from the misery and destruction that nicotine and tobacco addiction causes.<\/p> <p>  We fully support this Bill, although we have made some suggestions to strengthen it in our submission.  We greatly appreciate the Department of Health and everyone else who has been involved with moving this forward and all the efforts to get the legislation to this point.  However, we do not believe it goes far enough.  After falling from 41% to 13%, the smoking rate among 15- and 16-year-olds here is now increasing for the first time in a quarter of a century.  Additionally, 39% of this age group have used e-cigarettes and 15.5% are regular users.<\/p><p>There is serious concern that this is the result of a gateway effect from soaring youth vaping rates,with Health Research Board, HRB, research concluding that adolescents who vape are up to five times more likely to take up smoking.  Far from achieving a tobacco-free Ireland, we now risk losing the hard-won gains of the past 25 years, as the world's big tobacco firms that now control much of Ireland's vaping market seek to addict a new generation of young people to nicotine.  To turn the tide of youth smoking back in the right direction and robustly address the dangers of vaping to young people, we believe four further measures are needed to be added to the Bill.  These are: to increase the legal age of sale of cigarettes and e-cigarettes from 18 to 21; to outlaw all e-cigarette flavours bar tobacco; to ban all e-cigarette advertising and; to introduce plain packaging of e-cigarette products.  We do not want to delay crucial provisions in the Bill that must be implemented urgently and therefore suggest complex age-of-sale legislation for tobacco could be enforced through subsequent amending legislation.<\/p><p> We believe a new age-of-sale law is justified on the basis of three key tests.  First, is it proportionate?  Yes, because of the unique harm smoking causes.  Many young people move from casual use to addiction between the ages of 18 and 20.  For every three young smokers, one will die of tobacco-related causes, while for every death, 30 more will suffer long-term chronic disease at some point.  Will it be effective?  Yes.  Tobacco 21 laws effected in various US states before becoming federal law have reduced smoking among 18 to 20-year-olds by as much as a third.  The US Institute of Medicine says 223,000 lives will be saved among those born between 2000 and 2019.  In Ireland, that would equate to approximately 3,500 lives saved.  We can also be confident it will work due to the hugely positive impact of increasing the age of sale here in 2002 from 16 to 18.  Third, would it breach young people's rights?  The answer to that is \"No\".  The notion that young people automatically acquire all rights possessed by adults at 18 is incorrect.  Those under 21 are already prohibited by law from activities such as adopting children, driving large passenger vehicles, supervising learner drivers and standing in national and European elections.  This measure also has overwhelming public support.  Our Ipsos MRBI poll found that 73% of Irish people aged over 15 support the move, including 69% in the 15 to 24 age group and 71% in the 18 to 24 age group.  We regard this as a clear message to policymakers that the Irish public wants decisive action to end the blight of smoking for good.<\/p><p> As in the US, such a law would have to be accompanied by similar restrictions on e-cigarettes or we would risk further fuelling of youth vaping rates.  The need for further tough measures on e-cigarettes is a product of the duplicity of an international vaping industry whose lobbyists promote e-cigarettes as a quit tool for long-term smokers, while their marketers relentlessly target young people with tactics that are as aggressive as they can get away with.  The truth is e-cigarettes are far from safe as they can damage the heart, blood vessels and lungs, while exposure to nicotine can have long-term damaging effects on young people's brain development.<\/p><p> The industry's business model betrays everything.  Would Marlboro manufacturer, Altria, have paid &euro;12.8 billion for a 35% stake in Juul Labs, just to help long-term smokers quit, ultimately putting itself out of business?  Of course not.  The reality is underlined by its recent &euro;40 million settlement with the state of North Carolina, after being sued for using deceptive practices targeting young people.  Long-term smokers represent only a small part of the target market of big e-cigarette brands.  The main objective &ndash; and profits &ndash; lie in addicting young people who have never smoked.  By banning child-friendly flavours and advertising, along with plain packaging of e-cigarette products, the State could remove the key methods used to target young people.  Many e-cigarette liquids are sold in bright, attractive packaging with cartoon characters.  I have a couple of them here that I can show members.  They come in various sweet, fruity flavours such as bubblegum and strawberry milkshake designed to entice young people.  Vaping industry claims that such flavours are not intended for young people but are necessary to assist long-term smokers are nonsense.  US research shows that almost 80% of youth users gave the availability of flavours as the reason why they vape.  US Food and Drug Administration research also found that 97% of youth vapers had used a flavoured e-cigarette in the last month and were more than three times more likely to use fruit flavours as older adults.  This was backed up by research we conducted with the Irish Cancer Society showing unanimous agreement among focus groups of third and fourth-year students that sweet and fruity flavours, along with bright colourful packaging, were aimed solely at young people.<\/p><p> Meanwhile, e-cigarette advertising is banned in print, radio and on TV but is permitted on billboards, public transport and at point of sale.  This means young people are exposed to advertising near their schools, on high streets, in shops and on buses, trains etc., as part of their everyday lives.  Research shows this advertising is effective.  The bigger and hidden danger, however, is online.  While online e-cigarette marketing is illegal, accounts are permitted on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook.  This enables targeting of young people by social media influencers and celebrities promoting e-cigarette brands.  Companies claim they only engage with adult audiences, but research shows they circumvent these rules by using hashtags like #gaelicfootball, for example, to communicate with teenagers.  Despite the success of tobacco control policies in Ireland, smoking still claims almost 6,000 lives here every year, more than have, sadly, died throughout the pandemic.  Without decisive action now we will condemn this generation of children and young people to a similar and completely avoidable health catastrophe.  We cannot let that happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021111700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Macey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":754,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Macey for his opening remarks.

There is a proliferation of marketing going on to make such products attractive to children in particular.<\/p> <p>  The question on whether the industry will try to find another approach if we ban one type of advertising is a good one.  Yes, they will.  That is why we have to keep up with them.  We have seen from other countries that such an approach works.

We have to be vigilant and protect our children.  Industry will find a way.  There have been news reports on the tactics it still uses in the developing world.

Should we also look at this in the context of, for argument's sake, someone who is on 20 cigarettes a day now buying a pack of, for example, 27 cigarettes?

The worry is that when they are sold in those pack sizes, the cost per single cigarette is in fact lower than might be found for a pack of 20.  That is a concern.  We know that higher prices discourage people from taking up the habit and also encourage people to quit smoking.  It is known, and the WHO has shown, that if the price of cigarettes in high-income countries is raised by 10%, there will be a subsequent drop in the smoking rate of 4%.  That is certainly something we should look at.  The Department has stated that there has not been a whole lot of evidence on it to date, but it suggests that the Department should take a look at that, examine what further evidence is available and do research into smoking habits around those larger packs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021111700002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Gordon"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":760,"content":"<p>The other issue that arose during the lockdown in 2020 was that the sale of cigarettes, and cigarette and tobacco products, went up by &euro;150 million.

For instance, Finland was referred to earlier.  My understanding is that tobacco products can only be brought into Finland if the health warning on the packets is in Finnish and Swedish.

That was stopped, then the sale of a packet of ten cigarettes was stopped and we went to packs of 20.  In Australia, cigarettes are sold in packets of 30.  I have seen some evidence that what Deputy Burke is talking about may be a problem and may be something we have to deal with.  It needs to be looked at.  We might be able to look at that through the tax system.  The excise on cigarettes could be amended or adjusted to take account of those larger sales that are cheaper per unit and are, therefore, making it cheaper to smoke.  As Mr. Gordon said, generally speaking, the more young people have to pay for cigarettes, the more out of their reach they tend to be.<\/p> <p>  The issue of bringing amounts of tobacco in that are not smuggled but are not duty paid is one that should be looked at.  There is no point having a high-tax policy if people can circumvent it in any way.  We have to constantly be vigilant in rooting out loopholes to prevent that.  Smuggling is the other area.  Over many years, we have called for Revenue to have more resources, both manpower and physical resources, to ensure that smuggling is minimised.  Up to two or three years ago, it was doing very well in getting the rate down to below the EU average but it is creeping up again.  We have to make sure that there is a proper action plan to tackle, specifically, cigarette and tobacco smuggling.

The Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Heart Foundation work together very closely on this and we have had joint meetings with different Ministers about it.  As I mentioned in my opening contribution, there has been resistance on matters such as flavouring and marketing.  We understand that resistance is driven by a view in some quarters that vaping can be helpful in quitting smoking.  That is not our view.  We have done an extensive review of the research.  It is not the view of the WHO, the US Surgeon General, <i>The Lancet Respiratory Medicine<\/i>or other international experts on this.<br\/><br\/>We understand that people, from their experience, know smokers who swear by vaping and believe, on an individual level, that it is effective.  As I said, we support smokers who want to try to quit through any means they can.  We know exactly how hard it is but we can only advocate for measures that are evidence based.  We have heard from officials that they believe that regulating e-cigarette marketing and flavours will make these products less attractive to adult smokers.  We do not believe that is true.  Do members really think that the packet Mr. Macy showed them, with &quot;juicy&quot; printed on the front and which looks like a packet of sweets, is really aimed at the 60-year-old adult who smokes four packs a day?  That is absolutely not the case.  Somebody moving from the taste of tobacco to vaping does not need something that tastes like pineapple or cola.<\/p><p>We do not believe that is true.  However, while other people have genuinely held views, we must bring forward our evidence- based view that they are not appropriate.  When the Department was before the committee on the Bill, one of the officials said that people are voting with their feet for for vaping because vaping has become very popular. <\/p><p> I will return to the question Deputy Burke has highlighted which is we are not giving them realistic options.  We were really disappointed to see a reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Louise O'Reilly last year that State expenditure on smoking cessation medications actually failed by 12% between 2010 and 2019.  We are not giving people the help they need to use the tried and tested methods of NRT.  People need peer support.  We have developed the We Can Quit programme that we piloted and worked with the Department to have it mainstreamed as a quit support.  People need a mixture of affordable alternatives and practical hands-on peer and behavioural support.  It is only when those are available that it is possible for people to quit.  The advertising and marketing is part of that, to make people aware of the importance of quitting.  Most smokers want to quit.  They know what smoking is doing to their health, the risk of cancer, the impact on their household budget, particularly those on low incomes, but they need the practical supports to make it possible-----  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021111700002#D01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Averil Power","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":768,"content":"<p>I accept that Ms Power has presented the evidence to us but where is the opposition coming from?

The Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Heart Foundation also undertook research.  We consulted young people on this, showed them the packets and marketing and asked them if they believed the advertising and product design were aimed at them.  They very strongly believed they were.  They believed it mimicked sweets that are popular among their age groups.  They are also seeing influencers on social media promoting vaping.  They believe the marketing is very much aimed at them and not at their parents or grandparents.<br\/><br\/>I cannot talk for the officials but we know from the contributions they made to the committee previously there is a view that vaping can be helpful as a cessation aid.  We would say that is not the mainstream view internationally.  There is a minority view from Public Health England, to which the officials referred, but its view on this is very much an outlier internationally and it is not the view of the World Health Organization, <i>The Lancet<\/i>, the European Respiratory Society or the US surgeon general.  The body of evidence on this internationally is that vaping is not effective as a cessation tool, that it is no more effective than the existing nicotine replacement therapy, NRT, tools we have and that there are risks with vaping that are not associated with the other forms of NRT, as Mr. Macey mentioned with respect to the health effects of vaping.  Another problem is that people move from smoking to vaping but then they never quit vaping.  There is an ongoing nicotine addiction with vaping that people do not have if they move from smoking to other forms of NRT.  For that reason, having reviewed the evidence, we do not recommend vaping.<br\/><br\/>The Department previously put much stock into getting the Health Research Board to research this issue.  We note the Health Research Board, having done a systematic review of international evidence came out strongly stating it could not recommend vaping.  I quoted Dr. Jean Long from the Health Research Board in my opening statement as having called for the same regulation for e-cigarettes as for tobacco products.  While I cannot speak for the officials, I believe it is their genuine view with respect to regulating e-cigarettes in the way we have called for young people.  They have told us some adults like strawberry flavour.  That is fine but by not tackling those kinds of flavours, e-cigarette products are being made more attractive to children.  While some people might like the different flavours, if somebody is used to tobacco flavour, does he or she really need the enticement of fruit flavours to move to vaping?  We just do not accept that.  We can only bring an evidence-based view to the committee and ask the members to listen to us.  Our only agenda in the Irish Cancer Society is to stop people getting cancer and to do everything we can to help smokers to quit.  The same is true of the Irish Heart Foundation and international bodies which are urging action on this.  We are not asking Ireland to be at the vanguard of this.  As I said in my opening statement, we are well behind our European partners and we need to play catch-up and protect our young people before it is too late.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021111700002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Averil Power"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":786,"content":"<p>To answer the Deputy's question, what is known about e-cigarettes is that there is a known harm reduction benefit to them for long-term smokers who have failed to quit using other safer methods.  However, at the same time because of the business model and the marketing practices of certainly the vast majority of the people who sell them, there is a danger to young people.  The issue is where to strike the balance.  I do not know how anyone could even think a balance can be struck by having the availability of 16,000 different flavours that are in various markets.<\/p><p>These are marketing tools and they are almost exclusively directed at young people because if young people are not addicted, there is no business model.  As Ms Power said, someone working in an industry whose products kill one in two of the people who use them is not really concerned about what effect those products will have.  It beggars belief that anyone would think it is preferable to ensure that a long-term smoker has access to strawberry milkshake and chocolate fudge flavours of e-cigarettes, even though that creates a danger and risk for a whole generation of young people.  We do not know the full extent of the problem.  We can legitimately say that the impact of e-cigarettes on people's health will be less than smoking but a lit cigarette contains 4,000 different poisons and it has elements of rocket fuel and rat poison in it.  There is little that could be sold that would be as toxic or more toxic than that.  Just being less harmful than cigarettes is not a great recommendation for anybody to use e-cigarettes.<\/p><p> The balance has to be struck with children in mind because we cannot afford to have a situation in ten years' time where we see the effect of wider scale addiction than we have already.  The addiction level is serious.  It can still be tackled effectively but we are running out of time.  We have to move on this quickly.

It might take a smoker who was on ten or 15 cigarettes per day one week to get through that.<\/p> <p>  Ms Power referred to the Department talking about people voting with their feet.  Part of the reason for that is the cost because traditional nicotine replacement therapy, NRT, costs are more expensive and some of it is subsidised on the medical card.  However, a prescription from a GP is required for this, which is another barrier.  The cost for people who are not on a medical card is about &euro;36 per week for patches or about &euro;26 per week for gum.  People are not necessarily moving to e-cigarettes because they find them more effective.  Rather, they do so because they are cheaper than nicotine products, even though they want to quit.  As Ms Power said, we have seen that while the funding towards tobacco cessation as a whole increased by about 1% between 2010 and 2019, the investment in medical cessation products and NRT, including gums, patches and other prescription products like Champix, has fallen by 12%.

We have only the evidence from the general sale of these products for the past 15 years or less to work on and so the harm has not been fully worked out.

We know plenty of doctors who take that view.  As I said, cigarettes are becoming more addictive.  It is really difficult to give up.

The last thing a long-term smoker wants to see is a child or young person taking up the habit.  It is possible to maintain access to vaping for adults who feel in desperation that it is their only option while also protecting children from the flavouring and marketing so that children who never would have taken up e-cigarettes, or who might have tried them once and found them disgusting and so did not go on to develop a nicotine addiction, do not end up using e-cigarettes as a gateway to cigarette and tobacco smoking and, thus, nicotine addiction.  As stated by Deputy Kenny, we are making progress.  We have been winning this fight.  A small proportion of people still need our help to get off cigarettes.  There are people who are really struggling and they need more Government support.  They need nicotine replacement therapy, NRT, to be cheaper and they need more direct support in terms of helping them to quit.  Over time, smoking rates have decreased dramatically in this country both among young people and adults because we have been brave enough to take on industry, ban smoking indoors, introduce plain packaging and increase prices, as well as other positive public health measures.  It would be madness to risk all of that.  We know that the rates of smoking among young people are increasing for the first time in years because of vaping.  It is possible, from a harm reduction point of view, to maintain that choice for the long-term adult smoker for whom vaping is the only option in terms of helping him or her to quit tobacco smoking without having vaping products pushed in the face of children every time they go into a newsagents and on billboards and the sides of buses.

It is the same argument as with alcohol.  The reason the industry invests so much in advertising is to create this view that its product is a lifestyle choice and that it is cool, sexy and attractive.  There are restrictions on direct online advertising for e-cigarettes under the tobacco products directive but the types of things we see on social media are influencers promoting vaping in the same way as cigarettes were traditionally promoted by attractive-looking people promoting the idea that smoking was cool.  That is obviously very attractive to teenagers in particular and they are the market audience.<\/p> <p>  As we said earlier, we can deal with supply all we like, and it is very important that the Bill is bringing in restrictions on supply, but unless we deal with advertising and the relentless promotion of both alcohol and tobacco, we will never really fix the problem because if people - young people in particular - want something badly enough, they will get their hands on it.  We have to do both.  The problem with e-cigarettes in particular is that they are promoted as something that is cool.  They mimic the physical actions of smoking and get young people addicted to nicotine in a way that we know leads them on to smoking.  The industry would not be spending so much on that kind of marketing if it did not work.  That is why it is so important that we deal not just with the supply but with everything that pushes that demand and makes people think that something which, as Mr. Macey said, is inherently dangerous and bad for us is actually cool.  We have to deal with that insidious, disgusting use of advertising that gets children hooked on a product that is hugely harmful to their health and is likely to lead to them taking up smoking, with all the disease and death that smoking causes.  We have to cut that off and make sure companies are not able to promote e-cigarettes in the same way they are no longer able to promote tobacco.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021111700002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Averil Power"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":835,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Power for that.

We certainly feel that tobacco companies are using vaping as a back door or a Trojan horse to try to get a seat at the table in making laws around tobacco control.  That is clearly what they have been doing through vaping.  They have no interest in people quitting their tobacco products and they have no interest in people quitting their vaping products.  An internal R.J.

That is a major amendment we would have to make to the Bill, that e-cigarettes and tobacco products be banned at these temporary facilities.  E-cigarette companies have their stands at festivals or other events in Ireland that young people attend.  They are not even trying to market them as any kind of cessation device; they just want to market them as something cool that people can have with friends while listening to music.

That includes all Government sectors, that is, the executive, legislative and judicial sectors.  In part we have seen the industry use front groups to get around that because compliance with the convention is really good.  In practice, it has meant that Government and public officials can only engage with the tobacco industry if it has a means to progress legislation on technical issues.  For example, a few years ago the Department had to meet representatives of the tobacco industry to say there was a need to figure out the type of font that will go on the plain packaging.  Discussing things like that is where they can meet industry.  Obviously the Regulation of Lobbying Act applies to any lobbyists.  From our perspective, the FCTC is the strongest global binding factor.  The convention looks at declarations of interest by any public officials.  It ensures that Government bodes cannot accept partnership with industry and that Government officials divest themselves of any interest in the tobacco industry.<\/p> <p>  The tobacco industry sees opportunities, through e-cigarettes, to recruit, aggressively market and keep existing customers hooked.

For people to get NRT products on a medical card, they must get a prescription from their GP and collect the products from a pharmacy, whereas they can go into a petrol station forecourt shop, a newsagents and up to a kiosk in a shopping centre or at a festival and get vaping products that are openly available.

We had a transatlantic conference yesterday on this issue.  The HSE spoke in support of this measure.  We believe there is support in the Department for it.  I do not know how substantial it is at this point but there is definitely support.  The Economic and Social Research Institute stated in 2017 that this is the way to go, or one of the significant ways to go to further reduce tobacco use.  This measure became federal law in the United States in 2019, having been introduced in a number of states, starting with Hawaii and California in 2016.  The evidence is suggesting that among people aged 18 to 20, it is reducing smoking by between 21.7% and 33.9%.  It is also having a major impact on people aged between 15 and 17.  Older groups often procure cigarettes for those younger groups when they are underage.  This is a serious and important measure that will come through because it makes sense.  As I said in my opening statement, it is proportional because of the damage that smoking does to people, particularly young people.  We heard evidence yesterday about how one is more prone to addiction to cigarettes when one is young and the damage, not just from the length of time one is smoking but the actual damage being done while one is young, is much more considerable than among people who started in older age.  It will be effective.  We have done it before.  In 2002, we increased the age of sale from 16 to 18 and it was incredibly successful.  It is one of the main reasons our teenage smoking rate fell from 41% to 13%.<\/p> <p>  It is enforced in other countries, such as India.  This is not an out-there, extreme proposal.  The other thing is that it does not go against young people's rights.  People have said to me that if you are old enough to go to war for your country, you should be old enough to buy a packet if cigarettes.  That is fair enough.  The first question is who would want to send an 18-year-old to war.  We did send 40,000 young men to war in the First World War, many of whom were aged between 18 and 20.  Many of them did not come home.  This is about protecting young people's health.  Based on the American figures, if we introduced this measure today, we would save the lives of roughly 3,500 people born between 2000 and 2019.  It is a measure that can have a big and long-term impact on smoking rates.  It would reduce much of the misery and destruction caused by smoking for future generations.<\/p> <p>  We must deal with it.  We need an endgame for smoking.  Tobacco had a beginning and it must have an end.  We cannot just wait and hope, and go along as we are doing, with 6,000 deaths a year in Ireland.

Perhaps I am missing it, but I am not seeing the same happening with vaping.  I do not see many people vaping in films or the like.  They are still probably smoking.

Every day from the time he got up, he talked about how he was going to get out.  Would the nurse bring him?  Would someone else bring him?  As I mentioned last week, I am aware of people who have lost limbs from smoking.  Giving up is not that easy.

It is the nature of the e-cigarette evidence that it is constantly evolving, given that it is relatively short term compared with tobacco research.  From what we have seen, though, there is a minor health harm from the second-hand aerosol effect.  If someone is sitting in an outdoor smoking area or indoors where e-cigarettes are constantly being blown into his or her face, there is a minor health harm, but the evidence is constantly evolving and we are always examining it to determine our position on it.  We believe that vaping should be denormalised and people should be protected from second-hand aerosols.  We would support the smoking ban being extended to e-cigarettes so that they are not allowed in workplaces.  I imagine that many restaurants would encourage the same, as it would make it easier for them if there was national legislation telling people who want to have an e-cigarette to go outside and not blow it in the faces of other patrons on whom it might have a health effect.

People are walking down them because there might be garden products on one end, for example.  The witnesses probably know one of the multiples I am talking about.  It sells a lot of cheaper products and food, which brings in families, and there is a whole wall of vaping products.  The different flavours, colours and the like that people have mentioned do not have an impact on me, but there are people who are looking to quit.  Some say that a particular flavour helps them.  A young lad who works in my office says that he used to smoke a brand that he brought in from the US but that he cannot bring in anymore.  My message with this point is that he will now try to give up vaping.

This is something on which we would like to see progress.  Both of our organisations have recommended that.  Both organisations recently undertook research on people's attitudes to advertising and advertising's impact.  Brand recall was highest at point-of-sale, that is, in-store.  In 2009, Ireland banned the in-store advertising of cigarettes, which had a major impact on teen uptake.  Studies showed that, before the ban, approximately four in five teenagers remembered brands based on what they had seen in the store and, after the ban, that figure dropped to one in five.  In-store advertising has a real impact.  Children are bombarded with it if they go into any petrol station or local shop.  It is brightly advertised with bright colouring, attractive flavours like tutti frutti and cartoon-type packaging, which has been shown to make products more attractive to children and make them more likely to use those products.<\/p> <p>  Senator Black touched on the structural separation of alcohol.

If that is the case, why do they need mass marketing?  People have to ask for cigarettes, so let them ask for a vaping product.  It will still be accessible to them, so why does it need to be beside the sweets at the checkout?  Why is that level of marketing to everyone needed?  Their adverts do not tell people to use their products to quit tobacco.  Rather, the adverts stress what a pleasurable experience vaping is, how nice the flavours are, how cool the technology is, etc.  E-cigarette companies are not marketing e-cigarettes just to move people from smoking.  Point-of-sale advertising is a key way in which they reach non-smokers and promote vaping as something that is cool, with a perception of it being risk free.  The Chairman talked about people vaping in front of others.  They genuinely believe that is okay.  They have been persuaded by industry that it is safe and not bad for them, let alone others.  The Chairman mentioned Johnny in the hospital.  Johnny is just another victim of a disgusting and relentless industry that will say and do anything.  It tries to promote as cool something that will lead people to cancer wards and spending their final days with an awful disease.

I ran down the stairs to get to the meeting room.  I had been following the whole debate.  These days, members have to juggle a few things.  I have been following the debate from my office.  I thank the witnesses for their contributions so far this morning.  I have read their written submissions.  It is great to see Ms Power back in Leinster House.<\/p> <p>  The Bill has several aspects, including a ban on the sale of e-cigarettes to those under 18, a new licensing fees regime for tobacco and e-cigarettes and the ending of tobacco sales from vending machines.  I am a child of 1982.  I do not want to hazard a guess as to the ages of those present, but when I was growing up, if you watched Formula 1 racing on Sundays, the cars that whizzed past had tobacco advertising on them.  There were chocolate cigarettes on display beside the Smarties when one went into the local shop to spend one's pocket money.  It was kind of saturation.  When I got to 12 or 13 years of age there was always a huddle of ten or 12 guys smoking down a laneway behind school at lunchtime, with a cloud of smoke rising from them.  I think that has more or less ended.  It is rare to see a huddle of young people smoking and passing a cigarette between them, either on the streets of Dublin when I am up here for the D&aacute;il or down at home in Ennis.  It has become unfashionable.  In fact, younger people are, in general, living far cleaner lives than our generation did.  They are into the gym and healthy eating and living, yet there is still a problem and this legislation seeks to deal with it.<\/p> <p>  In her opening statement, Ms Power referenced the Health Research Board and the World Health Organization, WHO, both of which cite in their research that e-cigarettes are no more effective than approved and regulated nicotine replacement therapies.  That needs to be repeated.  I remember seeing an e-cigarette for the first time five or six years ago when they first came on stream.  An individual took a battery-powered and fruit-favoured e-cigarette out of his or her jacket pocket.  There was a little cloud of vapour and I was told it was going to wean the person off cigarettes.  That claim has been put out time and again but now, several years later, the WHO has published research to state is not factual.  That needs to be repeated.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of vending machines, I do not know if my head is in the clouds, but I have not seen many of them.  Where are they located, in general?  What is it being sought to limit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021111700002#O00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":864,"content":"<p>They are usually located in pubs or hotels.  We are a little bit behind the rest of Europe on this issue.  Approximately 14 EU countries have a ban in place, as does the UK.  I know the Department has been keen to push this ban for several years.  The thinking behind it is that it will help to denormalise smoking as it will ensure that children see fewer tobacco products around them.  In addition, there is evidence from the environmental health service that, despite most places with a vending machine having a token system in place, children tend to be more successful in their attempts to get cigarettes from vending machines than through other means.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021111700002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Gordon"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":865,"content":"<p>The positioning of vending machines is probably more important than the fact they exist.

It is kept as a financial transaction separate from the food or drinks that are sold at the till.<\/p> <p>  We definitely want to curb smoking.  I have never smoked a cigarette in my life.  I am very anti-smoking.  However, there are cohorts, such as older people in particular, for whom it is very difficult to break the habit.  I have grandparents who smoked.  It is very difficult for smokers in their late 80s to give up cigarettes.  It might make more sense for vending machines to be positioned away from children and the main thoroughfares of hotels rather than having an outright ban on such machines.  They should be situated under a bar counter or somewhere like that.  Having a point of sale should not be the main problem; it is more about the location of that point of sale.    <\/p> <p>  Another issue I wish to home in on is the importing of cigarettes.  We have won the battle on many fronts but there is an issue in respect of cigarettes being brought into the country.  Many people come off a flight or a ferry laden down with bags filled with large boxes of 100 or 200 cigarettes.  Is the regulation in that regard a bit soft?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021111700002#O00400","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":866,"content":"<p>As was mentioned, there are moves at EU level to restrict this.  As with alcohol, there are restrictions on sales at airports and in duty-free shopping areas but if one buys a product in another country and pays the tax on it, one is entitled to bring it in one's luggage.  That creates problems for us, as a country that has led on tobacco.  We increased prices to make cigarettes more expensive here but people are getting around that by going to Spain and other countries, buying them more cheaply on the high street there and then bringing them home in their luggage.  That is definitely an issue that we would welcome the Government considering.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is not much younger than me; we are members of the same generation.  He is certainly better than me in terms of being able to withstand all the marketing and never smoke.  I did smoke.  As the Deputy stated, it was very popular back then.  Cigarettes were pushed at you so much when we were younger.  I took up smoking in school and it took me a long time to quit, and it was very difficult to do so.  I know exactly how difficult it is.  Thankfully, I managed to quit while I was in college.  I know exactly how difficult it is for people such as the older people to whom the Deputy referred who have never been able to break that habit.  These products are designed to be addictive.  They have become more addictive through the years.  They are designed to make sure that the older gentleman who was mentioned will still be smoking and a loyal customer of a particular cigarette brand until he goes to his grave.  The more we can do to ensure young people do not take it up in the first place and do not have to go through the trauma and difficulty of trying to quit, the better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021111700002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Averil Power"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":867,"content":"<p>I appreciate Ms Power's honesty.  I refer to the old black and white photographs of nine-year-old or ten-year-old children with peaked caps smoking cigarettes.  One could see the pathway of those children's lives.  They probably aged far more quickly and faced more health problems than would have been the case if they did not smoke.  We want to avoid situations such as that.  Significant inroads have been made in the past 15 years or so in terms of not allowing it to happen again.  We need to double down on that effort.<\/p> <p>  I always feel sorry for the people in their late 80s or 90s who go to the GP and are told to pack in the cigarettes, a product they have been smoking for many years.  The person probably has only a few months or years left in his or her life.  They are dying out, unfortunately,  I want the law to be hard and clamp down on smoking.  I certainly want us to do everything we can in terms of advertising.  I believe that more taxation should be landed on top of cigarettes in each budget.  However, I always feel sorry for those people.  My grandparents were in their late 80s and they were told to pack in the cigarettes.  We do not want other people to take that path but we need to keep those older smokers in the back of our minds.<\/p> <p>  I do not wish to name the company, but every supermarket and convenience store sells roll-up papers made by a particular firm.  Many of the young people I see smoking - and there are far fewer of them than in previous years - make their own cigarettes because they are cheaper.  On the train I took to travel to the D&aacute;il yesterday, there were two girls sitting across from me who were rolling up seven or eight cigarettes to have later in the day.  They were very young.

Studies have also shown that young people consider roll-your-own tobacco to be healthier and somehow more organic than traditional cigarettes that come in packets of 20.  That needs to be addressed through taxation but it should also be highlighted that roll-your-own cigarettes are more harmful, not less harmful, than traditional cigarettes.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of vending machines and the locations where cigarettes can be bought, in order to make it easier for people to quit, we have to cut down on the number of locations in which cigarettes are sold, including vending machines.<\/p><p>We welcome the fact the proposed Bill will put new registration measures in place in the context of where tobacco products are being sold and will introduce an annual fee per outlet.

We need to put a high price on retail locations that sell tobacco.  That could limit locations where tobacco could be sold.

There are not many instances around the country but I can think of one in my county where there is antique tobacco advertising.  In many places, it is replicated signage that people put up for a nostalgic look in a shop.  I know one shop in Clare where the signage is authentic and dates back to the 1920s or 1930s.  It would be no harm in some scenarios to have old tobacco signage.  It is in many pubs as well and harks back to a different era.  It is about nostalgia and creating a historical context.  There needs to be a hands-off approach to that.  There is a building across from Limerick train station I come near to every day I get the train that has old tobacco signage.  That needs to be exempt from this if it is historic.  As for all forms of modern advertising - no way.  That is aimed at selling a product.  This is aimed at historical preservation of the old enamelled signage.<\/p> <p>  I did not choose to be scruffy this morning; I am doing Movember.

Far too many males are still passing from cancer.  There are far too many people passing away from cancer, but one in eight men get prostate cancer.   We are talking about lung cancer this morning.  There are so many forms of cancer.  It is a small gesture to not take the razor and it saves me a few minutes every morning.  I want to highlight the fact that Movember is happening.

I ask them to be mindful of that when making their statements.  If anything potentially defamatory is said, I will direct them to discontinue and it is imperative that they do so.  I ask members to be aware of the long-standing parliamentary practice and traditions, especially with the extra risk to witnesses and the committee arising from remote attendance.<\/p><p> Each organisation will be invited to make an opening statement.

Once all of the statements have been delivered, I will invite members of the committee to put their questions.  There will be seven minutes per member for both questions and responses, and they manage that time as they wish.  If a member wishes to have a long opening preamble, speaking for five minutes with two minutes for responses, that is fine, and if they want to ask questions for 30 seconds and allow six and a half minutes for responses, that is also fine.  When everybody has spoken once, if time allows, we might have a second round, which will be shorter.  I know there is some detail in the opening statements that have been sent to us, so I inform witnesses that I will enforce the three minute rule for their opening statements, but they will have the opportunity to speak again as the engagement goes on.<\/p><p> We will start with Dr. Taylor.

I welcome the Government's commitment to address hate crime as set out in this general scheme.  The principle underpinning the proposed Bill and much of the substance are welcome.  I have some specific concerns.  My concerns are based upon 25 years of practical experience in the equality and diversity, and criminal justice systems in England and Wales, including serving as the director-level senior civil servant responsible for hate crime policy in the Crown Prosecution Service in London.  Based on this experience, together with academic research, I am concerned that if specific issues are not addressed in this proposed hate crime Bill, Ireland risks having ineffective hate crime law.  That would be a significant lost legislative opportunity.  The other point that I want to make is that I come to this in a balanced, proportionate way.  As well as being concerned about victims, I am equally concerned about justice for defendants.  I chaired the Irish Penal Reform Trust, the main defender-focused charity focused on prisoner rights and penal reform in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The most significant concern relates to head 8 of the general scheme, which deals with determining proof of motivation.  The test as laid out is a test of motivation.  Proof of committing the offence is sufficient for most criminal offences.  The proposal here sets a different legal threshold for hate crime.  As far back as December, the Department of Justice acknowledged that this is difficult.  It indicates that without a successful way through this, it is unlikely that the new law will be successful.  A workable and effective way through this has existed for 20 years in the neighbouring jurisdiction in England and Wales, and for a slightly shorter time in the North of Ireland.  The Government risks ignoring effective law in our neighbouring jurisdictions.  Instead, the Department of Justice appears to be proposing inclusion of a set of bias indicators, on the face of the hate crime Bill, from which it seems we would cumulatively adduce motivation.  From my experience, this is inappropriate, unduly complex and fails to learn from considerable practical experience in our neighbouring jurisdictions.  In England and Wales, and the North of Ireland, the determination of whether an offence has a hostility dimension can rests on a legal test of proof based on a hostile motivation and-or evidence of a demonstration of hostility.  Some 20 years of implementing such legislation, involving and accompanied by training, guidance, monitoring and reporting, with the exception of disability cases, now shows similar success rates at court to that for regular hate crimes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021111700002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Seamus Taylor"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":885,"content":"<p>I have to interrupt Dr. Taylor.

As part of the Good Friday Agreement, there is a commitment to ensuring parity of protection on the grounds of equality and human rights in the North and in the Republic of Ireland.  If this Bill is enacted as set out, there will be a much more complex and higher legal threshold to be met for victims of hate crime in the Republic than in the North.

I will shorten my opening statement to the three-minute limit.  \"Nasc\" is the Irish word for link.  We are a registered charity and we work with migrants, refugees and asylum seekers.  We have a long history of anti-racism work.  We have been actively engaged in calling for hate crime and hate speech legislation for over a decade and we are pleased to see progress being made on this legislation.  It is only one step towards tackling racism and other prejudices.  While we welcome this Bill, we have concerns about garda&iacute; having a role in immigration enforcement and registration.  Undocumented migrants and migrants with precarious immigration statuses will be reluctant to make reports.<\/p> <p>  One key issue that we have with this proposed Bill is that the definition of \"hatred\" in head 2 does not reflect international standards and is not sufficiently clear to provide certainty to the public, prosecutors, and Judiciary.  We recommended that the definition of \"hatred\" be redrafted in line with definitions used by the UN special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance.<\/p> <p>  We are concerned about the defences for publishing or otherwise disseminating or broadcasting hate speech in head 3, which are significantly more expansive than those contained in the 1989 Act.  It contains defences where the material concerned consists solely of a reasonable and genuine contribution to literary, artistic, scientific, or academic discourse.  The general scheme does not contain any guidance as to how a reasonable and genuine contribution may be defined.  Is this an objective or subjective test?  We believe that if the discourse would otherwise reach the threshold set out in paragraph 1 of \"inciting or being reckless as to whether such communication will incite, hatred\", it is then an oxymoron to say that it was a reasonable contribution to the discourse.<\/p> <p>  What is political discourse?  There is a reasonable defence for utterances in the Houses of the Oireachtas so we can infer that this refers to speech outside of the Oireachtas.  We are concerned about the potential for fomenting hatred or racism as an election tactic.<\/p><p> Heads 4 to 6 of the Bill create 12 new aggravated offences which all share the same essential elements, namely, that the offence was \"motivated by prejudice\".  We disagree with the sole inclusion of the motivation test.  The requirement to prove the alleged perpetrator was motivated beyond a reasonable doubt is too high and would lead to low levels of prosecution.  We are concerned that in the case of, for example, a racially motivated offence, absent evidence that the offender is ideologically racist, the aggravated offence may not be successfully prosecuted or it may be a defence to say the slur used, for example, was used in the heat of the moment or was unrelated to the reason for the offence.<\/p><p> We believe the use of a demonstration test, as used in England and Wales and more recently in Northern Ireland and referred to by Dr. Taylor, would resolve this enforceability issue.  The demonstration test recognises that harm that occurs to the victim when the victim experiences the offence as a \"hate crime\".  A demonstration test would be satisfied by proof that the offender demonstrated hostility, such as the use of racist, homophobic or transphobic slurs towards the victim during the commission.  Nasc recommends that the Bill be amended to allow for the offence to be proved on the basis of the demonstration of hostility or motivation by prejudice.<\/p><p> I believe my time is about to run out.

At the European Centre for the Study of Hate we study the treatment of hate crime in the Irish criminal justice process, as well as legislative models to address hate.  All of that is grounded in empirical research and comparative legal scholarship.  With Professor Ross Macmillan, we have conducted the first ever general population survey of public awareness and beliefs about hate crime, and hate crime legislation in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the publication of the general scheme.  Our written submission includes specific suggestions with respect to each head.  In this opening statement, we would like to highlight some of the overarching principles we think should guide the committee's scrutiny of the general scheme.  First, we all want the legislation to be effective.  We propose that we critically reflect on what effective legislation is.  We think it is a scheme which achieves a balance of rights between victims and offenders, upholds the principle of certainty, the principle of minimal criminalisation, and the principle of fair labelling and sends a clear message to society that we do not tolerate targeted victimisation.<\/p> <p>  Second, we believe effective legislation achieves a balance between the need to leverage the declaratory potential of hate crime offences on the one hand, and their potential exclusionary effects on the other.  We have shown in our survey of the general population that labelling an individual a \"hate criminal\" is likely to prove an additional impediment to securing employment, as well as social integration.  At the same time, our research on the treatment of hate crime in the criminal justice process shows the creation of aggravated offences is crucial to achieving an integrated system-wide response to hate crime.  We believe that these findings underscore the need for a scheme which creates new offences but also establishes a high threshold for conviction, which is present in the general scheme.<\/p> <p>  Third, in learning from other jurisdictions, we note that while it is possible to later expand the scope and protections afforded by hate crime legislation, it is difficult to contract or remove protections given the message this will send to victims, communities and society at large.  For this reason, we commend the cautious, incremental approach taken in the general scheme and further advise a statutory requirement for a legislative review after five years.<\/p> <p>  Fourth, we emphasise that to be effective the legislation requires a scaffolding of supports for victims, offenders, and criminal justice professionals.  In the absence of these implementation measures the legislation may fail.<\/p> <p>  As a final and fundamental point, we should learn from the experiences of other jurisdictions and draw on international good practice.  This should be done carefully, recognising the need to adapt international lessons and examples to our own jurisdiction, and ensuring the general scheme is appropriate to the Irish legal, policy, and social context.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, our expertise is, as mentioned, in the area of hater crime and we would like to additionally refer the committee to the submission of the Coalition Against Hate Crime, with specific reference to incitement to hatred.  I thank the Chairman.  We look forward to answering all the committee's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021111700002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jennifer Schweppe"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":892,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Schweppe.

I apologise for the technical difficulties.  I thank the committee on behalf of Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre for the invitation to address it on the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime Bill) 2021.  As some members may know, Pavee Point is a national non-governmental organisation that has been campaigning for the last 35 years to address racism at both the institutional and individual level and to promote Traveller and Roma inclusion in society overall.  We welcome the Government&rsquo;s plan to introduce stronger and more effective legislation to deal with hate speech and hate crime.  This is a recognition the 1989 Incitement to Hatred Act is not fit for purpose.  As we all know, there have been very few prosecutions under it.<\/p> <p>  Hate speech and hate crime are different from other crimes.  If other speakers have alluded to this I apologise for the duplication.  I was out for about ten minutes.  Hate speech and attacks are not just on the individual but on the whole community that individual comes from.  As a result, this instills great fear, anxiety and uncertainty in that community.  Hate speech and hate crime create barriers to a more pluralist, inclusive society based on principles of equality and respect.  There must be zero tolerance towards hate speech and hate crime.  Unfortunately, it is well documented that both my community and the Roma community all too frequently experience hate speech and hate crime.  For the committee's information, in the last eight years six homes allocated to Traveller families were either vandalised or suffered arson attacks before those families could occupy them.  This was quite clearly motivated by hate.  Unfortunately, in all six cases none of the culprits was ever arrested and held to account before the courts.  That was one house per year.  It is absolutely frightening.  More recently, we have seen examples of graffiti being sprayed on the walls of Travellers' houses that says: \"Knackers out\".  This was a very recent development.  It occurred in Limerick only three weeks ago.  Thus, it is quite clear we need strong, effective legislation to deal with hate speech and hate crime.  As we all know, hate speech must be nipped in the bud because quite often it is a precursor to hate crime.<\/p> <p>  Before I hand over to my colleague, Ms Liston, who may wish to say a few words, I want to make an observation on an aspect of the Bill I am quite concerned about.  The defence paragraph is certainly very expansive.  In particular, I am very concerned about what I would describe as a loophole or opt-out clause in relation to political discourse.  The Bill as constructed at present would seem to suggest politicians who come out with effectively racist or other homophobic comments can use political discourse as a defence.  That is how I read the Bill and it worries me.  It needs to be addressed because too often, especially with my own community, the Traveller community, and also the Roma community, it is during elections when politicians are canvassing when we hear most of the racist rhetoric and hate speech directed against Travellers and Roma.  If political discourse is going to be a line of defence, then the legislation will be all the poorer for it when it materialises.  I caution against that and urge the legislators and the drafters to revisit that because it worries us considerably.<\/p> <p>  As a final point, we note strong, effective hate speech law must, as a priority, be victim-centred.  It must give an effective legal remedy to those who experience hate speech and hate crime.  Those should be the overriding priorities for this piece of legislation.  As we all know, the legislation on its own will not address hate speech and hate crime.  We need a more holistic, co-ordinated approach.  We need other educational and training initiatives for the Judiciary, for prosecutors and for society overall.  The forthcoming national action plan on racism will be a huge complement to this legislation when it materialises.  I thank the committee.

It was interesting listening to the contributions because when I read through the heads of the Bill, head 8 was the one that stuck out as to how it would happen in practice and three of the contributions highlight that as being a major problem with it.  Funnily enough, if you were an alien looking down from space at our legislation, you would think this was a great country but when you come down and see how the legislation is implemented, it is completely different.  This is a danger with this legislation as well, in that it will be nicely laid out in the law but nothing will happen on the ground in terms of implementation and enforcement.  Could Dr. Taylor expand on what happens in the UK and on how the UK deals with it?  That would be important.  How could we put that into the legislation here to ensure it takes place?  That is something Dr. Taylor might have to follow-up on with suggestions in terms of amendments.  That is my main point.<\/p> <p>  The point Deputy Martin Kenny made about the political discourse defence is very important and should be enacted in the legislation.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask Dr. Taylor about the legal threshold that the victims of hate crime in Northern Ireland have in the Republic and that we need to recognise the Good Friday Agreement in implementing this legislation.

In my experience, relying on a legal test of motivation alone will be very challenging.  It will give for very limited effectiveness in the law and it could give for ineffective law.  The Department of Justice recognised this and said so in a public document in December last.  It stated that without a way through it, it could be very hard to make this law work.<\/p> <p>  The way through it, I believe, is by having more than one limb to the test of proof.  Rather than relying solely on proving motivation, which is about getting into the mind of the perpetrator, I believe we can learn both from the North of Ireland and from England and Wales in terms of what they have done.  They have much longer experience.  This is not to hold up everything in England and Wales as good and hold up Ireland, which traditionally has often been done, as all bad.  We know that we could pick any range of public policy issues and the comparison works the other way.  We only have to observe some of the recent experience in relation to the handling of Covid in Britain compared to here.<\/p> <p>  However, on hate crime policy and practice, it is fair to say that England and Wales are leaders globally and they are recognised as such by the UN supporting UNHCR resources on the ground with experts on mission, SURGE, committee, by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, and by EU Fundamental Rights Agency, FRA, in terms of their legal provision, their policy and the practices.  Therefore, we can learn from very-near neighbours.<\/p> <p>  In the UK, they have two limbs to their legal test of proof: proving motivation; and-or proving a demonstration.

It could also involve the use of graffiti, gestures and other symbols.<\/p> <p>  I did doctoral research on hate crime in England and Wales and I looked at 548 cases in the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPPs, office.  I found that every successful case involved the use of hostile language as well as the base criminal offence, such as assault.  I found that every failed case lacked the demonstrated hostility.<\/p> <p>  The demonstrated hostility is often integral to the offence.  It is consciously used in the moment.  It is often what the victim remembers for life long after the physical wounds have healed.  In a sense, it is what is often crucial to securing a conviction on the day of court.  I will give an example from my research.  Two disabled men in a north-of-England city have become friendly through attending the same day centre.  One uses a motorised wheelchair.  One uses a walking stick.  They often meet up on days when they do not attend the centre.  They meet up socially in a square in the centre of that city.  They met one day in the summertime some years ago in the centre of the city.  They were sitting on seats in the square.  A young man cycles towards them on a bike.  As he approaches them, they hear him making a loud noise with his mouth.  He slows down as he comes towards them and he lands a big spit on the man who is sitting in the motorised wheelchair, he shouts, \"You f---ing mong\", and he speeds off on his bike.  Both men were shocked.  They were shaken and upset, and angry.  There were witnesses, both the man who had not been spat on but also other people in the square.  They went to the police, the young man was apprehended and the case went to court.  The hostility dimension was raised from the outset in the court.  Although it is not required to be raised in Britain until the end at the sentencing point, it was raised at the outset.  The defendant challenged the hostility dimension.  He mounted a defence that the sun was shining in the square, it got in his eyes and it caused him to have a big sneeze.  The witnesses' statement regarding the demonstration of hostility secured the conviction and the enhanced penalty for the hate crime.  It was the actual utterance of the words, \"You f---ing mong\", that were witnessed by other people, that drove the conviction home.  Without this provision, cases like that can be very challenging to bring to a fair and just outcome.  I could go through several cases - I have 15 to hand here - to illustrate that same point.  It leads me to conclude that having a demonstration test of hostility is important to effective hate crime law in the Irish context.  It is also important in the sense of bringing parity across this island to the provisions that also exist in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021111700002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Seamus Taylor"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":900,"content":"<p>Dr. Taylor went a little over time but I did not want to cut him off in the middle of such a troubling story that he was sharing with us there.

Some people agree it should be broadened out to demonstration while others argue it should be kept very narrow.

I have one point to clarify about the end of our previous discussion.  It needs to be made known that there are not a considerable number of convictions in the United Kingdom, either in Northern Ireland or the UK more widely.  Some 130 defendants were convicted of hate crime in Northern Ireland in 2019 and 2020, according to the statistics on the Northern Irish Government website yesterday.  Britain has a population of 67.1 million.  Some 2% of offences are hate crime.  A crime survey in England and Wales captured people's perception of hate incidents.  That figure stood at 190,000 in 2018-2019, when it was most recently conducted.  A total of 105,090 cases were reported to the police and 12,730 went to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution.  There is a difference between what people might perceive and what ultimately ends up being convicted in the system.  The response in the UK is quite proportionate and rounded.  There is not an enormous number of convictions.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about disability.  It is more challenging than other areas for a number of reasons.  All discrimination manifests in different ways.  Racial discrimination is not the same as disability discrimination, homophobic attacks or homophobic discrimination.  There are commonalities but there are also specifics that pertain to each protected ground.  They reflect different histories and ways in which groups are socially patterned across society, whether they are segregated or not.  Policy tends to address disabled people in two ways.  Disabled people are constructed as needing care and protection, which sees them as vulnerable.  The other approach is to construct disabled people as rights-bearing citizens.  This complicates the whole disability area because the challenge is how to recognise the hostility in disability hate crime.  People ask if we dislike disabled people or hate them.  The second challenge is responding appropriately.  What I found in the cases I looked at is that cases involving disabled people are often classified as senseless crimes or attacks on vulnerable victims.  They are often not recognised for the prejudice underpinning them.  As a result, full justice and an appropriate response is often denied.

I want to go back for a moment to the hostility dimension and the aspect of the matter about which Dr. Taylor has spoken.  One needs to be able to prove motivation and that is one of the key difficulties because proving motivation is the problem with all of this.  It always struck me that one of the things we are dealing with here, as has been mentioned in the submissions, is that this is about aggravated incidents.  It is about an attack or incident which is clearly illegal anyway and that an aggravating part of it is that the perpetrator is using a racial or sectarian slur, or whatever, while committing the illegal act and, therefore, there is clear evidence that the perpetrator is acting out of hate.  However, hate speech, in itself, without a physical attack on, or violation of, somebody, is also something we must recognise, as was mentioned earlier.  Such an act can cause as much harm to a victim as a physical attack, in many cases.  I know that from speaking to people from the Travelling community and people of different ethnicity across the country who find such acts hurtful and horrible.  It can have a long-term effect on them.  Are we prepared to accept that we must prove, in some way, the hostility dimension?  Is it possible to do it in a context where there is not another clear violation of a person's rights?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021111700002#E00700","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":912,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  He summarised the situation very well.  One of the challenges is that although it is very laudable to bring incitement to hatred and hate crime into one overall Bill, they have quite distinct features.  With incitement to hatred, the speech is the offence in itself, whereas, as the Deputy has correctly pointed out, in hate crime, there is a base criminal offence, such as assault, and the hate dimension is an aggravation, if, for example, a hostile slur is used at the time.  Speech on its own is the offence for incitement to hatred while hate crime involves a base criminal offence that is aggravated by the hate dimension.  That makes it quite challenging.<\/p><p> I am firmly of the view, based on my experience and research, that a practical way through the regular hate crime is by accommodating the demonstration of hostility and accepting that as a valid test of proof.  It makes motivation real because it gives one a standard to judge it by.  It gives one an empirical actual reality.  That is why I believe that the demonstration test is valid.<\/p><p> I am not an expert on incitement to hatred.  Many of the provisions that are proposed strike me as reasonable in terms of incitement to hatred.  I would particularly commend the proposal to introduce a test of recklessness into the incitement provisions.  I think that is a significant improvement on what existed before.  However, I share the valid point made by Mr. Collins about political discourse and what legitimate parameters can be and could be considered to be placed around hateful political discourse.  I do not consider myself an expert on the incitement part of the Bill.  My expertise rests in the regular hate crime area more. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021111700002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Seamus Taylor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":914,"content":"<p>Deputy Carroll MacNeill mentioned the Good Friday Agreement and I will go into the legislation on that.

That is one of the reasons there has been resistance from almost every level of society.  With such a divided society it has been difficult to bring in the kind of legislation that would work and set up the grounds of equality that we seek to achieve.

In my considered view, the hate crime Bill, as published, falls short of the commitment to at least an equivalent level of protection because in the North, the legal provisions on hate crime allow for proof based on demonstration of hostility or motivation.  Here in the Republic, if this Bill goes ahead unchanged, it only provides for proof on the basis of motivation.  Therefore, hate crime victims in the Republic will not have got equivalence of protection.  In addition, hate crime victims here will face a more challenging, more complex and a higher legal threshold.  Also, hate crime victims here will be less likely to get full justice in the Republic than in the North.

With respect to the incitement provisions, we need to be very cautious when we carve out an exception to freedom of expression.  We know that there are some issues with the application and implementation of the 1989 Act and it needs some work.  Perhaps amending the existing Act is better than repealing and replacing it with this inherently inconsistent legislation.<\/p> <p>  With respect to the Good Friday Agreement, it is of course the case that in Northern Ireland there are no aggravated offences.  On one argument we have much stronger protections and much stronger legislation here, having aggravated offences, because in Northern Ireland it is simply an aggravated sentencing provision.  There is nothing to stop us having a similarly broad aggravated sentencing provision.  We can do that.  That will not go on the criminal record of the individual.  That will not affect their future employment history.  What is presented in the legislation is a dual model.  So what we would say is have a narrow model used in the aggravated offence and then have a much broader model in the sentencing provision, which can be exactly the same as Northern Ireland if that is what legislators want and that is certainly a commendable approach to take.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Carroll MacNeill, what is really dangerous and the Law Commission cautioned this with respect to introducing legislation, is that if one has a broad framework it is incredibly damaging to reduce that framework, to contract it and remove protections.  What we would advocate is to build on what the Law Commission says.  Introduce a narrow model, particularly with the offences, then build it after five years if there are insufficient convictions.  If one feels that the court has interpreted the motivation requirement too narrowly, and we do not know how they are going to interpret it, then review it after five years.  One cannot introduce broad legislation and then say that it is too broad, and say that all those things that we called hate crimes before we actually do not think they are and we are going to narrow it.  As the Law Commission said, that sends a very damaging message to society and victims, which is why we advocate the dual model, so a narrow, broad and incremental approach. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021111700002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jennifer Schweppe"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":918,"content":"<p>Dr. Schweppe has made interesting points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021111700002#F00600","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":919,"content":"<p>I want to speak to the incitement question asked by Deputy Kenny.

In effect, when we talk about the dual model, we are talking about being able to address hate crime through two different means.  One is the creation of these new offences.  If somebody is convicted of one of these new offences, that person will have the label of \"hate crime offender\" on his or her criminal record.  That will appear when the person is vetted by the Garda.  We know from research we did with Professor Ross MacMillan that this will impact, additional to a criminal record, upon the way that person is viewed by the rest of society, including as a neighbour and a potential employee.<\/p> <p>  The other method we have of dealing with hate crimes through this Bill, and we commend the fact that it includes this dual model, which is appropriate, is the aggravated sentencing measure that will lead to enhanced penalties.  If somebody is convicted of an assault, for example, that person is convicted of an assault.  It is not a hate-aggravated assault, but there is an enhanced penalty because of the hate element that is associated with the crime.<\/p> <p>  In both cases, the offender will receive an enhanced penalty and we are marking out that hate element as unacceptable to us as a society.  Where we are talking about the offences, the person will also get the label of hate crime offender, which will be on his or her record and will have significant impacts upon his or her life chances.  We are asking committee members to think about whether they want the same threshold in place in both cases - when somebody receives an enhanced penalty and when somebody receives an enhanced penalty and the label \"hate crime offender\".  Do they want to use the same threshold?  Does the committee want it to be the same for persons who commit a crime against somebody because they have decided to act out of their prejudice against that person on the basis of his or her characteristics, as for persons who commit a crime, for example, for financial motivation, and in the course of committing that crime used an admittedly harmful slur?  Does the committee want those persons in those two cases to be treated in the same way?<\/p> <p>  The Bill as it has been created offers the possibility of treating those individuals differently.  It could be that we only consider the case of a person where we can prove the crime was wholly or partially motivated - it does not have to be wholly motivated and there can also be financial motivation - and it is also in evidence, that he or she decided, at least in part, to commit that crime because that person decided to act out his or her prejudice against an individual due to that individual's characteristics.  It would then acquire the label of \"hate crime offender\" as well as the additional penalty.<\/p> <p>  Do we also want that to be the case for the person who committed the crime for no reason other than a financial motivation, but in the course of committing it used a tool that is available to us because we live in a society that is racist, homophobic, transphobic and ableist, and deployed that tool against an individual but did not commit the crime for that reason?

Are there any such statistics based on complaints in Ireland?  Mr. Collins might be able to outline whether there are statistical data about complaints to GSOC or criminal complaints made by members of the Traveller community which had a racial element and did not proceed to prosecution or conviction perhaps because of inherent bias in the system.  Are any such data available?  Has Mr. Collins come across, for example, any cases involving assault, the use of threatening, abusive or insulting words or public order crimes where hate crime had been identified as an aggravating factor in sentencing?

Irish Travellers had the third highest rate out of all the countries surveyed at 52%.

That is down to distrust of authorities and the response to such reports.  In the UK they found that even when they did report these crimes, there was a very low level of response to the crimes due to institutional racism.  We touched on it a little bit in our opening statement but the legislation alone will not be enough to respond to hate speech and hate crime against Travellers and Roma but also against other protected categories and that we need special measures to be introduced in conjunction with the legislation to make sure that we address the wider issues in society around racism, prejudice and looking at what kind of mechanisms are required in our institutions to make sure that the legislation is capable of being implemented as well.

All that is totally accurate.  We know anecdotally that the level of hate speech and rhetoric and hate crime directed at Travellers and Roma is significant.  There is also some evidence in the Irish Network Against Racism, INAR, study of hate-motivated attacks.  It is significant but as Ms Liston has said, it is also hugely under-reported for reasons of lack of trust and lack of confidence that it will be taken seriously or investigated and dealt with effectively and so on.  We need to develop mechanisms whereby Travellers and Roma can feel confident in reporting such incidents and where such incidents will be fully and effectively investigated.  I deliberately stated at the very beginning that this Bill, which will become legislation after it goes through the various Stages, needs to be victim-centred and it needs to give an effective legal remedy to those who experience hate speech and hate crime, because the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act did not do that.<\/p> <p>  It is correct to state that it is so difficult to prove intent.  I am aware of a court case in Kerry a couple of years ago where a man was brought to court.  He admitted that he posted a message in Facebook that baby knackers should be used as bait for sharks.  He was identified and brought to court and he admitted posting it, but the judge dismissed the case because intent to incite hatred could not be established.  I am not an academic or a human rights lawyer but I imagine that if the demonstration test was applied in that instance, a conviction would be secured.  I may be wrong in that but it is a layperson&rsquo;s opinion.  The motivation test is important but it is essential that the demonstration test be included in the Bill when it is finalised.<\/p> <p>  People frequently and unnecessarily conflate two issues.  This is not about curbing freedom of expression.  We all know that freedom of expression and free speech also carry with them certain responsibilities and obligations.  As we all know, free speech does not entitle anyone to incite hatred or violence towards marginalised or disadvantaged communities.  As it has happened in other jurisdictions, it is not beyond the ingenuity of our lawmakers and drafters to develop a piece of law that protects the right to free speech, which is essential in any democratic society, but also protects vulnerable groups from hate speech and hate crime.  It is essential that the Bill is victim-centred but I also acknowledge the rights of defendants.

Cognisant of the concerns that Dr. Taylor has expressed with respect to disability hate crime &ndash; we know that even with the demonstration test in England and Wales, it is extremely difficult to get a conviction for a disability hate crime - we have proposed the use of the term \"contempt\" in the definition of hate.  As Senator Ward says, the legislation uses just the word &ldquo;prejudice&rdquo;, whereas we would advocate for a broader definition there to include hostility bias, prejudice, bigotry or contempt.  By using the \"contempt\" definition, which was recommended to us by Inclusion Ireland in our Out of the Shadows research in 2015 and then also recommended by Judge Desmond Marrinan in the Northern Ireland hate crime review committee report, we think that may go some way to address the concerns people have.  While some of the manifestations of disablist hate crime are not driven by prejudice, we think that if we include \"contempt\" that may allow for a broader framework to address that particular manifestation of hate crime.

I am aware of instances where, for example, somebody is arrested for something like a public order offence akin to our section 6 or 6A in this context and calls the arresting officer a Welsh prat, as opposed to a prat.  Having called the arresting officer a Welsh prat creates essentially what is referred to as a racially aggravated offence and therefore it enters into a much higher tariff.

We should also look at what other training is needed in conjunction with that, such as anti-racism and anti-discrimination training for garda&iacute; and other professionals involved.  If we have a public awareness campaign about the introduction of this legislation, we should consider all the protected categories in its provisions and how we target the public campaign so people are aware.  I work on the Roma programme.  How do we get this information to people whose first language is not English or who have language and literacy issues?  It is about thinking in a more holistic way.<\/p> <p>  The question was asked earlier about the data we have on the impacts of hate crime and hate speech in Ireland.  We do not really have any.  As we set this up, we need to think about how we form the baseline data around how this affects the protected categories.  Once we have those data, how will we monitor what happens as the legislation is rolled out?  What targets can be set?  As Dr. Haynes said, I hope it is about reducing the incidences of hate crime, rather than just looking at what happens when somebody is convicted.  How do we set targets to reduce these incidences?<\/p> <p>  I think Mr. Collins mentioned that we are looking at the national action plan against racism that is due to be published.  How can we combine the two to make sure there are people with specific responsibility and accountability for how this is looked at and not forget about the institutional and structural racism and discrimination that impacts at every level on how most of these protected categories interact with the law and with most services.  There is much work to be done to make sure it is effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021111700002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Jenny Liston"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":978,"content":"<p>Ms Liston put it brilliantly and I am not sure I can add much to what she said.

Before we commence, I remind members participating remotely that they must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.<\/p> <p>  Today, we convene to continue our discussion on the recently published report of the Commission on Pensions.  We are all aware that the State pension is valued by all of society and it is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at preventing pensioners from falling into poverty, and we want to make sure that this remains the case into the future.<\/p> <p>  The Commission on Pensions chaired by Ms Josephine Feehily was an independent body comprising pension experts, academics and workers' representative groups.  As Members will be aware, the committee made its own submission to the commission with 18 specific recommendations.  The commission has completed its work and a comprehensive report was published in October.  The report stated that the current State pension is not sustainable in its current form and changes are needed.  The population, as we know, is set to increase from 5 million currently to over 6 million by 2050, which is something that we need to plan for in order to ensure that older people have an adequate pension and a safety net to keep them out of poverty.<\/p> <p>  There will also be fewer working age people supporting each older person.  Currently, 4.5 working-age people support each person over the age of 65 but this is set to halve to 2.3 working-age people per person over the age of 65 by 2051.  It is important to note that the proportion of older people in receipt of a fully Exchequer-funded non-contributory State pension is decreasing steadily and will continue to do so.  Eventually everybody will have paid some entitlement to a State contributory pension into the future.  There are clear challenges in ensuring the sustainability of State pensions for future generations.  This has been known for many years and confirmed in the report of the Commission on Pensions. <\/p> <p>  The Government has asked this committee for our views on the recommendations set out in the report.  This follows on the from the committee's remit and our recent submission to the Commission on Pensions.  In this regard, I welcome Ms Josephine Feehily, Chairperson, Commission on Pensions, and Ms Roma Burke, who is the Chairperson of the technical subgroup, Commission on Pensions.  I also welcome Mr. Tim Duggan, Assistant Secretary, and Mr. Alan Flynn, principal officer, Department of Social Protection.  All of the witnesses are very welcome here this morning.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.

I thank the Chairman and the committee very much for this invitation to discuss the Report of the Commission on Pensions.  I apologise for not being able to attend in person.<\/p> <p>  As I am sure the committee is aware, the Department is required by law to conduct an actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund every five years.  The last such review, reflecting the financial position of the fund at the end of 2015, was completed in October 2017.  Among its projections were that annual shortfalls were estimated to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population starts to have an impact and that in the absence of action to tackle it, the deficit will increase to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  Those are annual figures.  Since then, certain findings of the 2015 review were examined again in preparation for the work of the Commission on Pension's work.  In short, this examination confirmed the significant deficits that the fund is expected to experience.  We are now finalising preparations to conduct another review for completion in 2022.<\/p> <p>  It is clear to the Department that considerable change is under way in the demographic make-up in Ireland whereby, thankfully, people are living longer, healthier lives, which means that action is required to secure the viability of the Social Insurance Fund in the near and distant future and, by extension, to protect the current contributory State pension system which is, as the Chairman said, the bedrock of pension provision in Ireland.  In that context, the law had been changed to increase the State pension age to 67 this year and to 68 in 2028, preparations were under way to change the system from the yearly average approach that applied for the past 60 years to a total contributions approach.  In addition, consideration was being given to options for increasing funding.  This resulted in considerable debate during election 2020 about State pensions and, in particular, about the imminent increase in the State pension age.  Arising from that, the Government committed in its programme for Government to establish a Commission on Pensions to examine sustainability and eligibility issues with the State pension system and the Social Insurance Fund and to defer any changes in the State pension age pending its analysis and report.<\/p> <p>  The commission was established this time last year.  It was an independent body and, as stated by the Chairman, its membership comprised 11 people who were pension experts, academics, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.<\/p> <p>  As a result of the State pension age deferral, the Department estimated that the increase in expenditure in 2021 on State pensions would be &euro;221 million, that this would increase to an additional &euro;453 million next year and that the figure would continue to increase every year thereafter.  The actual additional expenditure to the end of September 2021 was &euro;207 million.  It is now expected to total approximately &euro;275 million by the end of the year.  That increase is also likely to be reflected in future years.  As a result, the additional expenditure will actually be likely to be in the region of more than &euro;500 million next year and will get higher every year from then on.  This shows clearly how the demographic impacts on the State pension are real and how the sums involved are large and grow quickly, even when relatively simple decisions are made or proposed alleviating actions are postponed.<\/p> <p>  This underscores the need for very careful analysis of policy options and positions and highlights how the establishment of the Commission on Pensions was necessary to look at the State pension system in the round and provide independent advice to Government, first, on the options it has and, second, on a recommended course of action.  The commission, as referred to by the Chairman, has completed its work and its report was published on 7 October 2021.  It is a comprehensive report that takes account of an extensive consultation process, an examination of international approaches, and an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections.  It has unambiguously established that the current State pension system, as it stands, is not sustainable into the future and that change is needed.<\/p> <p>  In this regard, the commission has set out a wide range of recommendations.  Some of these are designed to make the system fairer, some to mitigate cost pressures and some to increase the funding of the system.  In the interests of older people and future generations of older people, the far-reaching recommendations in the report need to be considered very carefully.  With that in mind, in its initial consideration of the report at its meeting on 7 October, the Government decided first: to ask the Commission on Taxation and Welfare for its view with respect to the PRSI changes recommended by the commission by end February 2022, which is in keeping with that commission's terms of reference; to refer the report to this committee for its views; and to refer it to the Cabinet sub-committee on economic recovery and investment for consideration over the coming months.  It is expected that this will be done over a number of meetings.<\/p> <p>  Taking all of this into account, the Minister intends to bring a recommended response and implementation plan to the Government by end of March 2022.  In this regard, the Minister is looking forward to hearing this committee&rsquo;s view, at its convenience, and I hope this morning&rsquo;s discussion will be helpful to it in developing that.<\/p> <p>  I would like to conclude by saying that there are no policy proposals for the State pension system that cannot be challenged or, equally, that would find universal support.  We need, however, to be realistic here as our State pension system is facing very serious sustainability challenges.  We need to consider the very real consequences of failing to implement essential reforms to fund a sustainable and adequate State pension system.<\/p> <p>  I would like to compliment and thank Josephine Feehily, who was chair of the Commission on Pensions, Roma Burke, who chaired its technical sub-committee, and their nine other colleagues on the commission on an excellent analysis and report.  My team provided the secretariat to the commission, and I can assure this committee that it was a very busy team indeed such was the intensity of the commission&rsquo;s activities over its eight months.  I will now hand over to Ms Feehily to take the committee through the work of the commission and its recommendations in some detail.  Mr. Flynn and I will be more than happy to assist the committee with any questions it has after that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#B00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":988,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Duggan and call Ms Feehily to speak now, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#B00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":989,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  Good morning everybody.  I have a long presentation but the committee will be pleased to know that I do not intend to read it all.  I want to give the committee more of a sense of the commission's approach and the reasoning behind the findings rather than necessarily reading them out literally.<\/p> <p>  The commission considered it very important to say that it is a good thing that older people are living longer and are living healthier, longer lives resulting in there being more older people.  This is a good thing.  Characterising this as a problem and a crisis is not language we like to use, nor is not something we want to contribute to.  It is a challenge that has to be planned for and managed rather than having it characterised as a problem.<\/p><p>Intergenerational equity was one of the considerations in the commission's terms of reference.  Characterising the fact that there are more older people as a problem gives rise to a real risk of breaking the intergenerational solidarity that we have, and we are very clear that that is not something we want to do.<\/p><p> With that in mind, beginning with the commission's approach, we had very narrow but focused and specific terms of reference.  They were set within the programme for Government.  When we looked at the programme for Government, we found that a number of elements there, which I will list, and members can read them at their leisure, were already settled Government policy and so we obviously had to take account of them.  The other thing we found when we examined the programme for Government's direction, was that a number of other aspects of pensions had already been given to somebody else, for the want of a better word.  For example, a universal income pilot had already been agreed and was located somewhere else and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare had already been agreed and was located somewhere else.  Focused terms of reference and certain jobs that were already focused elsewhere were very much part of forming our approach to the work.<\/p><p> After we reviewed those and the terms of reference, we concluded that the most useful thing we could do was contribute to fixing the \"system within the system\", which was the language that we used to describe it.  We set ourselves the task of identifying the scale of the sustainability challenge.  In that context, we defined fiscal sustainability but also social sustainability as important.  It was not just about money.  We had a lot of contributions from experts.  We had a consultation process where we had in excess of 200 submissions.  Some 80% of them were from individuals.  We had a survey which had more than 1,100 responses, so we had a lot of inputs to our work.  We established a technical group chaired by my colleague, Roma Burke, to help us to establish with some certainty what all the inputs were telling us.  I will hand over to her now because that group gave us an evidence base for the recommendations.  I will come back in to outline the recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":991,"content":"<p>In your opening statement, Chairman, you stated that the population of Ireland is currently 5 million and is going to increase to 6 million by 2050.  You also observed that the relative proportion of younger to older people is going to change.  As the population ages, there will be more older people and they will be living longer.  It is great news.  The challenge of that is that at the moment the State pension works on a pay-as-you-go basis.  That means that the current working population supports the State pension paid to older people.  At the moment, there are approximately 4.5 working age people to every older person.  As the population evolves and people gradually get older, that will reduce, so that by 2050 we estimate that the number of working age people to older people is going to drop to just 2.3 for each older person.  This is a big challenge.<\/p> <p>  When we are looking at a big demographic challenge, we look at big levers to try to address the challenge.  The two big levers available to us are fertility and migration.  The committee found that fertility is quite slow-moving and is unable to react quickly enough to address this very significant challenge.  Another lever is net inward migration.  That can react in a much faster manner in order to address this problem.  Putting it in the context of the total expected population in Ireland in 2050 of 6 million, we would need a working population of 7.2 million people in order to maintain the dependency ratio.  That translates to an extra working population in the order of 3.3 million, over and above the official Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures.  We concluded that in order to maintain the dependency ratio at its current levels, it would require actual fertility and migration rates that would be multiples of the current assumptions.<\/p> <p>  With more older people and older people living longer, the cost of the State pension is going to increase.  There is going to be twice the number of older people by 2050.  That means that the cost is going to double by 2050.  At the moment, expressed as a percentage of modified gross national income, the cost is 3.8%.  That is going to go up to 7.9% by 2050 and then it will continue to increase and will reach 9% by 2070.  To put it into context, if we were in 2050 today, we would need all of the PRSI income just to pay the State pension.<\/p> <p>  We looked at how to address the increasing cost of the State pension.  If we can get more people working, that would certainly help to address the challenge, and it does help, but the difficulty with that is that even if we have more people working within the working age population, the fact that the population is ageing in total means that as a proportion of everybody, the number of workers continues to fall.  It is like maintaining a boat on the sea.  You are maintaining your boat, but the tide keeps coming in and it is very hard for the boat as there is not much that the boat can do in that case.<\/p> <p>  We looked at other ways to address the challenge, such as increasing the State pension age.  We looked at increasing the rate of employment of older people, facilitating them to work longer.  We looked at net inward migration, which I talked about a moment ago.  We also looked at higher economic growth and higher employment.  While all of these levers help to address the challenge, we found that changing the State pension age had the most significant impact.  Notably, helping older people to work also has a fairly significant impact on addressing the challenge.<\/p> <p>  The State pension has a role in poverty prevention.  We did a lot of work on this.  The committee concluded that the State pension plays a very positive role in reducing poverty among older people.  We have already heard that without the State pension, poverty rates among older people would be in excess of 85%, and that is reduced right down to below 11%.<\/p> <p>  I will make a few points to help the committee with its discussion today.  There is a range of poverty measures and one of them, which is used quite a lot, looks at poverty in relation to income.  It compares what your income is to what is called an at-risk of poverty measure.  However, the State pension target is pegged against an earnings benchmark &ndash; gross average industrial earnings or a more recent iteration of that.  We must be aware that even if you are targeting an earnings benchmark for your State pension, there is a risk because the formula or the definition of poverty is related to income, but that does not move in the same manner as an earnings-related benchmark.<\/p> <p>  We then went on to have a look at increasing the State pension.  When the State pension is benchmarked, it gets increased in future in order to give certain benefits such as maintaining people's purchasing power and keeping them out of poverty and so on.  We looked at linking it to price inflation, earnings and other measures.  We must be careful, because if we link it to price inflation, there is a risk that more people can fall into poverty.  If we link it to other measures, there is a risk that the cost could escalate beyond what has been expected.  It requires a careful approach going forward.  That is a whistle-stop tour of what the committee did.  We fed in a series of papers to the commission for consideration.  I will hand back to Ms Feehily to continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Roma Burke"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":992,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Burke.<\/p><p>In a nutshell, in terms of the commission's report, our key considerations led us to conclude that there is a very strong attachment in the community to the State pension.  That attachment is built on certainty.  Certainty is required for all sorts of reasons.  It enables people to plan and to feel confident but it is also important for other aspects of their lives, including working and saving.  We considered that there was a need for transparency and much better communication around the whole issue to avoid surprises and to help people to better understand the issues involved.  We were very much driven by considerations of equity and fairness.  An overarching conclusion was that we should move on funding first rather than on other policy levers.<\/p><p> Our overall conclusions related to social solidarity.  The attachment of the community to the pension was evident in submissions to the commission not only from pensioners and those soon to be pensioners, but from people right across the different demographics and in work done for us among young people.  It is the view of the commission that, if it is accepted that we want older people to have an adequate pension, everybody should contribute to ensuring that outcome on the basis of social solidarity.  The five key elements of our conclusions and recommendations involve increasing funding through a gradual increase in PRSI, an increase in PRSI for the self-employed, broadening the PRSI base, contributions from the Exchequer and a gradual increase in the pension age.  I will address those various points in the next few slides.<\/p><p> Based on those five levers, we put together four packages.  We considered a range of options and settled on package 4.  Package 4 uses all of the levers I have mentioned.  With regard to extending the PRSI base, the details of this extension being set out in some detail in the presentation, we excluded its extension to social welfare payments but recommend extending the PRSI base to remove the exemptions currently in place for people aged over 66 and for supplementary pensions.  We do not recommend a universal pension for a range of reasons, which I am happy to discuss if members wish.  The principal reason is that the job is also located somewhere else.  <\/p><p> I do not expect the members to be able to interpret the graph on slide 9.  It gives a visual sense of what we were about.  The detail is in the report.  The coloured bars represent the elements of the packages.  They show the contribution made to addressing the challenge under each package by the various elements, including funding, a change in the pension age and Exchequer contributions.  The commission is strongly of the view that, if the Government and Parliament choose a different mix for the future policy direction, as they are absolutely entitled to, compensating measures will be needed.  If it is decided to use less of a given measure and to invent a package 5 or a package 6, each of these elements will need to be addressed.  Otherwise, there will be a shortfall.<\/p><p> On the funding side, we confirmed the pay-as-you-go approach.  This is a structural piece which we think is quite important.  There was some discussion in the committee's meeting last week about the notion of the Social Insurance Fund.  The commission fully understands that this is not technically a fund in the sense that there are pension funds which have been put away for 20 years.  It is a pay-as-you-go fund, almost like a bank account.  We recommended that, within the fund, the funding and costs for pensions should be separated out to make them visible and transparent.  This would mean there would be no risk of it getting confused with other demand-led schemes.  We consider that an important transparency measure.  <\/p><p> On the payment rates side, the Minister made it clear to us at our first meeting that the Government would not contemplate reducing rates, which is an obvious lever to consider when there is a funding problem.  The commission would not have been inclined towards that view anyway.  We did say that, since the roadmap on social inclusion, there has been a proposal in place with regard to a smoothed earnings approach to benchmarking.  We asked that this be implemented because, if the rate going forward is not known, how can the sums be done?  How can the shortfall be worked out?  We recommended that an independent standing body be put in place to advise the Government on the rates derived from that benchmark each year.  Having done that, the body should then periodically review whether that was the best benchmark in terms of pensioner poverty.  We were very mindful that the risk of poverty is higher for people living alone than for a couple.  We were therefore keen for the Government to continue to increase the living alone allowance at a faster rate than the basic pension, as it did in the recent budget.<\/p><p> With regard to calculation methods, it has been the policy of a series of Governments to move to a total contributions approach on the basis that it is fairer.  However, this has not been fully implemented.  The commission is basically asking for it to be implemented.  If that is the Government's policy, it should implement it.  Again, how can we know what the shortfall is if the denominators keep changing?  There has been a policy of maintaining the old system, the yearly average approach, and allowing applicants for a pension to take the better of the two options.  That is a recipe for serious cost increases.  If the total contributions approach is fairer, which we believe it is, then the yearly average approach should be gradually removed.  We recommend that people be allowed to calculate which approach is better for them but that, over ten years, the payment under the yearly average approach be reduced by 10% per year so that, at the end of ten years, that option will be off the table.  By then, the total contributions approach will be serving a greater population and more and more people will be getting full pensions, based on the trajectory of employment.  If that is not done, the grounding for calculations in respect of the pensions challenge will be shifting all of the time.  The Government might as well forget about the total contributions approach because there is no point in having it as a policy while implementing something else.<\/p><p> We recommend that the total contributions approach become the definitive approach.  This is based on 40 years or 2,080 contributions to include ten years of credited contributions and 20 years of home-caring periods.  That policy change with regard to home-caring periods has been really important with regard to the point the Chair made on the increased proportion of pensions being based on the contributory rather than the non-contributory side.<\/p><p> We also believe that regular PRSI statements should be issued to contributors so that they are aware of how much they are paying and when their pensions are likely to kick in.  If the Government accepts the recommendation to phase in pension age changes, people should be able to see that, based on current policy and so on, they are likely to get their pensions at, for example, 66.75 years of age.  I am aware that the Department will issue pension contributions statements on request.  We are talking about more than that.  We want interpreted statements to be issued rather than just a list.  Again, this comes back to the idea of better communication and no surprises.<\/p><p> We made a recommendation in respect of carers.  I will not go into it in detail.  We had very specific terms of reference to address.  We came up with a solution which we think achieves the objective of making sure that there is special recognition and a special credited approach for the particular group of people for whom 20 years of caring credits are not enough when they reach pension age.  We also took up a recommendation from Family Carers Ireland.  It told us that it would like to see the establishment of a register of family carers.  This would run across government and not be confined to pensions.<\/p><p>As we thought it was a good idea, we recommended that the relevant Departments might look at that, so it will be broader than the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p> The retirement age on employment contracts was one of the dilemmas that arose from the pension age discussion; there was a gap.  We received many submissions pointing out that people do not necessarily want to retire at 65.  A European directive is also in place.  It is hard work for somebody to challenge it and it requires going to the Workplace Relations Commission and so on.  Equally there are people who want to retire and have the right to retire in their existing contract.  Therefore, it is not as simple as changing everything.  The recommendation is the legislation should allow but not compel an employee to stay in employment until the State pension age.  That is designed to take care of two different groups of people.<\/p><p> Again, having taken account of submissions, we also felt that the social partners in government and the WRC could issue guidance to employers and workers on how to manage the transition if people want to stay at work.  There are issues with recurring contracts, issues with people who may want to reduce their working hours and so on.  That is a discussion which goes beyond our scope, but we felt that might be the right place for it.<\/p><p> We then come to the age.  As members of the committee will know we recommended that the age should increase beginning in 2028 at the rate of one quarter per year reaching 67 in 2031, which is ten years' time.  We then recommended it should increase by one quarter every second year reaching 68 in 2039.  It is gradual and much slower.  We felt the gradual approach which removes some of the cliffs and surprises was appropriate.  The table displayed on your screen shows at what year the different age changes would come into being.<\/p><p> Many people raised the issue of flexible access with us and it is also contained in the programme for Government.  We made a number of recommendations on it.  One is that a person could choose to defer access up to age 70 and receive a cost-neutral increase in their pension.  The second one was that a person whose insurance record was short might continue to contribute in order to establish an entitlement.  The third recommendation is an option for the Government to consider done in conjunction with an age increase.  The commission sees merit in recognising very long PRSI histories by including a provision whereby those who choose to retire at 65 with a very long record of 45 years may receive a full pension.  The reason we say this must be done in conjunction with an age increase is that on its own it is a cost-increasing measure, which would only add to the sustainability challenge.  It certainly has merit in the context of a total flexibility package where the age in general is going up.<\/p><p> The recommendation on the funding side of PRSI for self-employed has come in for some comment.  The commission was unanimous in this.  I should have said, when discussing the slide about the recommendation on age, that it was not unanimous.  Ten out of the 11 members recommended the age increase; I should have made that clear.  The self-employed PRSI of 4% is the best bargain anywhere for return on investment.  I used to work in social welfare and I remember when it was invented everybody was very excited.  I believe 4% or &pound;102 was the number.  Now 4% or &euro;500 is the floor.  The benefit range was modest.  It covered State pension and widow's pension.  The benefit range has been increased, but the rate has not.<\/p><p> To maintain equity and fairness relative to other workers, the self-employed PRSI contribution rate needs to increase.  We are very clear and we suggest a steeper increase for self-employed PRSI than we do for class A, which is workers and their employers.  There was a range of views in the commission about how far it should go.  We settled on 10%.  There is an argument for it to go to 11.05%, which is the employers' rate.  There is an argument for it to go to 14%, which is the combined employer and employee rate having regard to the range of benefits.  However, we will leave that to the Minister.  We did not go there, but we debated it at some length.<\/p><p> We are also recommending an increase in the class A rate for both employers and employees.  This is much more modest and does not need to kick in until after 2030.  We were very mindful not to impact on the labour market by increasing it too soon and too steeply.  It was not necessary in the context of package 4.  Some of the other packages have a steeper and larger increase, particularly if the age is not included.<\/p><p> In a way, base broadening is not new.  In 2014, PRSI was extended to unearned income on a social solidarity basis in the form of class K, which is payable on income over &euro;100.  It is payable on a class K solidarity basis by Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas without entitlement to benefits.  Therefore, it is not a novel idea.  Other than applying it to the social welfare payments themselves, on a social solidarity basis PRSI class K, which is 4% on all income currently subject to PRSI, would be payable by people over 66 and would be payable on existing supplementary pensions - occupational pensions, personal pensions and public sector pensions - by way of a contribution from existing pensioners.  If the community at large wants pensions to be sustainable, adequate and certain, then the community at large ought to contribute to the balancing required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":995,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Feehily for that detailed presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#E00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":996,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation and for the enormous amount of work that went into the development of this document.

I strongly agree with the value system that underpins this piece of work.<\/p> <p>  I have some broad questions and some more specific questions.  I will begin with the broadest question and this may or may not be useful.  A certain formulation of words occurs several times in the document and it was repeated this morning about the terms of reference being quite narrow or focused, whichever way we want to put it.  The commission noted that the scope of its work was positioned within a set of parameters and decisions already made by the Government.  A particular formulation of words occurs a few times in the document.  It struck me that it was repeated.  Should I read into that that the members of the commission would have liked a broader frame of reference?  This may require them to unpick their entire document and so it may not be worth looking at.  Was there something they would have liked to address in their body of work that they did not have the opportunity to address, given their terms of reference?  That is a very broad question.<\/p> <p>  The second slightly less broad question is about universal pensions.  There is one line, saying we are not doing that.<\/p><p>I would like to have that investigated in more detail.  <\/p><p> On the specifics did the modelling examining the various packages in respect of the funding contributions concerned consider issues such as income smoothing?  Is that already built into that modelling?  Regarding the total contributions approach, were the figures outlined to us earlier predicated on the income smoothing and total contributions approach being in place?<\/p><p> The Chair can cut me off if I hit my limit on questions, but on that income smoothing aspect as well, I had a look back over the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025.  Two elements of that are being considered, but do the witnesses have an opinion regarding whether we should have the third element as well, and a triple lock?  It might be concerned with the concept of the minimal essential standards of living, MESL.  Should that be in there as well?<\/p><p> Mention was made in the report as well of using \"non-labour revenue sources to help fund the State Pensions system\".

We formed the view that if there was something that we felt strongly enough about, then we would not constrain ourselves in that regard.  For example, we made a recommendation concerning a register of family carers, an aspect that was outside of our focus, and we also made a recommendation regarding the provision of guidance to ensure that older workers might be prepared.  In the end, however, we decided, given the short timeframe we had, that our work was mainly addressed to the audience.  That is why it is repeated.<\/p> <p>  I said to the Minister about six months after we started our work that if I had thought of it at the start, we should probably have been called the commission on State pensions, because the audience, the submitters and the commentariat were giving us jobs that we did not have.  Therefore, this facet of our work was more addressed to the audience to make it clear that the reason we stayed in the areas where we stayed was a function of our terms of reference.  We did not have a function in respect of private pensions, and neither did we have one regarding the tax system.  Many of the submissions and much of the material addressed to us raised those hares.  The main reason this point is repeated, then, is because we were probably feeling that much of the audience did not quite get how focused and specific were our terms of reference.  That was the reason.  We debated this point, and we were content that a job of work needed to be done and that was a useful contribution we could make.  Therefore, we came up with this language we used about \"fixing the system within [...] the system\".<\/p> <p>  Moving onto the matter of universal pensions, a longer text in the full report deals with this aspect.  I just cannot find the relevant reference now.  What we state there, however, is that aspect is outside of our terms of reference, because those are based on a contributions system and a universal pension does not have that idea.  The concept, therefore, was outside the scope of our terms of reference, but we did examine it.  We found that not only was it out of scope, but we also decided that it was placed somewhere else in the form of a basic income pilot.  We arrived at that conclusion because, in the context of a basic income pilot, a pension is clearly a version of basic income.  <\/p> <p>  In addition, inherent in the idea of a universal basic income, whether for pensions specifically or for everyone, is the involvement of the tax system.  That was definitely out of scope, and was also placed somewhere else.  In the end, therefore, it was not a case of us having decided to recommend against the concept, we just did not recommend it on those grounds.  I hope that is okay by way of an answer.  We took that approach particularly because of the contribution element.  Once our job was grounded in the Social Insurance Fund and contributions, then the dynamic of a universal basic income would have been a different job, as it were.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the information we presented earlier, I am certain that the total contribution approach, TCA, change is included.  Ms Burke will be able to help me to clarify whether the income aspect is addressed in that information as well. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":1000,"content":"<p>The numerical breakdown of the information we presented earlier, including the bar charts, can be found on page 224 of the full report.

The Deputy may recall that at the time there was some fairly intense debate in the UK about what is really an intergenerational issue in the context of the national budget.  The triple lock seemed to prevent the most equitable outcome, so we did not recommend a triple lock for that reason.  We certainly feel that by setting up the independent standing body, and by giving it the job of periodically reviewing the form of indexation, as well as the mathematics in that regard, that the form of indexation might need to evolve over time.

A large volume of work has been done.  It is just a pity that it was not done before any mention was made of pension age increases in the first place.  It would have been a huge help.  The report contains a great deal of knowledge, and a great deal of work went into it, and I thank the witnesses for that.<\/p> <p>  I agree with much of what is in the report, especially regarding the need for a pension for carers.  That has been an issue for a long time and it is something that must be sorted out as quickly as possible as well as the need to allow for PRSI to be accrued by those who remain working beyond the age of 65, to examine retirement ages in contracts and to establish a body that will recommend increases in respect of the State pension, similar to the Low Pay Commission, as has been suggested.  The remit of that body should go beyond the State pension and we should require a body to recommend increases across the board for social protection payments overall every year before budget time because we have this issue, as has been said, where people receiving the State pension or other social protection payments experience great uncertainty regarding those payments.  They have no idea what they are going to get, and we have the annual football being kicked around in this regard concerning the debate on an extra fiver every year.  Therefore, I agree with a great deal of what is contained in this report.  <\/p> <p>  What was suggested concerning the Exchequer making annual contributions to the Social Insurance Fund was interesting.  I wonder if consideration was given to a situation where the State would make that contribution and then we are also asking the State to make a contribution regarding auto-enrolment.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on their comments on the Exchequer contributing in this regard.  I think it is something that is worthwhile and something to look at.  <\/p> <p>  Flexibility is really important.<\/p><p> In the commission's report, Ms Feehily puts forward the idea of providing a State pension to those retiring at 65 and, of course, she has added to that where they have a long contribution history and she has put in a figure of 45 years.  Can she expand on why it is 45 years and whether she considered it being less?  What was the rationale for suggesting that?  Obviously, we have an issue with people who are engaged in manual labour.  They may have started work in their late teens and by the age of 65, in some cases, they have worked for 40 or 50 years.  It is an issue if we are going to ask those workers to remain on until they are 67 or 68, when they physically cannot do so.  There is also going to be an impact on their health, if that is the way we are going.  Will Ms Feehily comment in that regard?  Will it be a transition State pension being provided at 65 or a full contributory State pension, and how would that work?<\/p><p> Ms Feehily speaks a lot in the report about State pensions and how they protect people from poverty.  With the recent increase, the State pension will now reach the minimum standard of living, which was listed as &euro;252 by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.  That is welcome.  In the context of those pensioners who are qualified adults or who are on reduced pensions, is there a protection from poverty for them, and was that looked at?  In regard to what is now the benefit payment of &euro;203 at 65, did Ms Feehily look at poverty protection for such recipients in view of the fact that they are locked out of secondary benefits like the fuel allowance?  There is an impact at 65 of going onto this benefit payment, which is set at the jobseeker&rsquo;s rate rather than the rate of the transition State pension, which was there previously.  Again, that is set well below the poverty line.<\/p><p> On the legislation, there are employment contracts that stipulate a retirement age of 65.  Ms Feehily said the legislation that is needed would apply to existing and new employment contracts.  She will probably know that legislation was unanimously passed twice in the Oireachtas in the past six or seven years with regard to banning mandatory retirement.  The issue that came up the last time was that the Department of Justice said it could not be done and that we could not look retrospectively at employment contracts.  Does Ms Feehily think that is feasible?  I agree it is something that needs to be sorted out because people are being forced to retire at 65 due to their contracts even though they do not want to retire.  Frankly, if they just had to wait a year to get the State pension, many would probably remain on at work for that year.<\/p><p> Page 132 of the report contains a table that relates to the expenditure projections from 2019 to 2070 in the context of keeping the State pension age at 66.  On a similar question to that asked by Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh, do those projections include an indexation link to 34% of earnings?<\/p><p> The submission that we made recommended 30 years.  Ms Feehily has opted for 40 years.  She might speak a little about why she believes that 40 years is agreeable or even reachable.  For many people who are immigrating or coming home, there could be difficulties in that regard.  We have put forward 30 years.<\/p><p> There are a number of references to the widow&rsquo;s pension in the report.  We had put forward a recommendation regarding an issue that has arisen whereby a person has to be married in order to get the widow&rsquo;s pension.  While I appreciate that is outside the remit here, I ask whether there was any discussion around that requirement for the widow's pension.<\/p><p> Mr. Duggan referenced the increases in costs and what it costs to defer the pension age increase to 67.  If we did not have a mandatory retirement age as stipulated in contracts and if we allowed people to work on from 65 and accrue PRSI contributions, what would the cost be?  Do we know the figure in respect of what we will save by not paying out the contributory State pension at 66 and instead paying out a benefit payment for 65-year-olds?  In the context of the pension age increases that Ms Feehily has put forward, how does she see that working if we go to 67?  Will there be a benefit payment in the middle for those people who still have 65 in their contract?  How will that work for people in manual labour who will be expected to work up to 67?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#F01400","speaker":"1604","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":1012,"content":"<p>Before I ask Ms Feehily to come in, I ask members who are participating through Microsoft Teams to turn their cameras off and on.

I thank the Deputy for the comprehensive way she has reviewed our work.  I will answer the questions in the order I got them.<\/p> <p>  As to why we picked 45 years for the very long insurance record, it follows from 40 years.  The Irish social insurance system is somewhat unusual in that people pay full PRSI once they earn &euro;38 a week, so people start paying PRSI very young for casual employment.  It is one of the reasons why the averaging system is not very fair in terms of the pension, but that is another day&rsquo;s work.  It is not unusual when people reach the age of 65 for them to have worked for 45 years.  Given that the recommendation for a full pension was 40 years, taking account of flexible access for people who had an exceptionally long record, it seemed to us that 45 was appropriate.  It was as simple as that.  As I said, quite a number of people start paying it at 16, so it is not exceptional.<\/p> <p>  I would like to talk a little about the Exchequer contribution.  There were couple things driving our thoughts on that.  First, the original policy grounding of the Social Insurance Fund in 1952 was tripartite funding.  The tripartite funding has been observed but the Exchequer bit has been on a contingency basis and, for the first umpteen years of the fund, up until the middle of the 2000s, it was always in deficit.  That was designed into it.  It was meant to be tripartite funding.  We took the view that capturing that general community solidarity contribution by a contribution coming from general taxation, which would not be discretionary, was an important return to that tripartite funding principle which was established from the outset and maintained for the first 40 to 45 years of the fund's existence.  That was the first point, which was a solidarity point.  How does everybody contribute?  Everybody contributes through taxation.<\/p> <p>  Second, we felt that in order for the maths to be done appropriately every year, we needed certainty around the Exchequer bit and that it should not be down to squabbles.  Third, the Exchequer makes a demand-led contribution which is legislated for in regard to private pensions in the form of tax relief.  It is likely to make a demand-led contribution, which will be legislated for in the form of auto-enrolment for second-tier pensions, which will not be optional, so we felt that, for the first-tier pension, it should not be optional either.  That is the thinking: the original policy driver plus the way the other two tiers of pensions are treated.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether we looked at poverty in respect of the adult dependants.  We are aware of the Vincentian Partnership and the various definitions.  It is quite clear from those definitions that a couple together has less risk of poverty than a person living alone.  We looked at it from that point of view.  We also looked at it from the point of view that if we take that at-risk-of-poverty measure, the likelihood is that the adult dependant will himself or herself be entitled to a non-contributory full pension,.  That was as far as we looked at it.<\/p><p>In terms of the poverty risk, it is important to remember that if there is a couple at that point, the non-contributory pension is an important piece of the safety net.<\/p><p> We did not look at the retirement benefit of &euro;203.  I am afraid it was out of scope.  We did not examine any issues to do with that.<\/p><p> On employment contracts, we clearly were aware that there were legal issues surrounding employment contracts.  There is an overarching entitlement in the European directives as well.  That is why we came up with a formula that would allow but not compel.  It is a property right of the people who want to go at 65 years of age and they want their entitlements at 65.  In many cases, it washes into their occupational pensions.  That is how we understood the risk and that is how we came up with the formula to allow but not compel, and that future contracts should be aligned with the State pension age, whatever that may be from time to time.<\/p><p> On 40 years' contributions as opposed to 30 years' contributions, it goes back to the point I made about people starting really young.  Thirty is very short.  I would point out that the 40 years' contributions that we are recommending is for a full pension and a person with 30 years' contributions could very well get a partial pension.  A person who emigrated could very well end up with a partial pension from another country where he or she worked.  There are European Union rights but also there is a broader social security family with reciprocal agreements, etc.  The emigration piece is probably well enough catered for by the range of agreements that would allow people to get perhaps two partial pensions.  We did not look at the issue to do with martial status of widows.

I have to confess I have not yet read the 244 pages, although I will do so over Christmas, because a lot of stuff comes in all the time.  There is a lot of daily work in this job and I just did not have the time with all the other commitments.<\/p> <p>  Can Ms Feehily quantify the savings the Pensions Commission estimates because people have been encouraged to work longer and, therefore, make contributions into the system for a longer period?   What savings would arise because pensions would not be paid to anybody over 66 until he or she got to the new pension age?  That is a crucial question that goes to the nub of a big problem that will arise if you start raising the pension age.<\/p> <p>  I confess I am over the pension age, but the kind of job I do means I do not have to lift blocks every day, I do not have to plaster ceilings and I do not have to do lots of things that I might not feel up to.  I feel up to what I do.  One of the big problems of this is that there is a large cohort of people who by the time they come to their mid-60s are unfit for the work for which they are trained to do.  It is a phrase they use for invalidity pensions, etc., that we are all familiar with on this side of the House.  When people get to a certain age, they no longer can do the work.  This can involve people who have to spend long hours standing in retail, etc., and have problems.  It is fair to say that for a fair number people general wear and tear - they might not be very ill in the conventional sense - means they cannot do their jobs.  For example, the Army will not keep people after a certain age.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not keep people after a certain age, and it would be younger than the normal retiring age.  It is because these jobs require physical agility and ability.  People of 65 to 67 years of age will not be kept in the ranger unit.  That is an extreme example, but this is well recognised by the State.  We often allow teachers to retire early because they are burnt out after 40 years in the classroom, etc.<\/p> <p>  What do you do?  What do you say to these people when they come in to you?  What are we meant to say to these human beings?  Should we apologise and say that they are really meant to be working until they are 67 or 68 years of age?  That is the dilemma.  Is it to try to encourage people to work for longer or is it a cash saving and, if so, how much?<\/p> <p>  Of course, there was a third way round this that does not seem to have been examined.  I have to confess I have not read the whole report, and maybe it was examined.  Did the commission examine returning to the concept of the State pension transition?  The idea of the State pension transition is that if you retired and you were not earning a substantial amount of money - you could earn a very small amount - you could get the State pension but if you continued to be employed, you could not get the State pension.  Was that looked at, because one of the big disappointments is that people worked?  It is interesting and key that one trade union representative did not sign off on the age increase because that particular trade unionist would have been familiar with the human problem that really came to the fore in the last election, that is, all the people who cannot physically continue to work after their mid-60s and were looking forward to retiring having put in 40 years' very hard work.<\/p> <p>  The second question I have is a technical one because it is a change of policy.  When total contributions were first mooted in 2008, the policy was 30 years' contributions.  The 40 years' contributions came in when the carer's credits came in.  What made the commission decide on 30 years' contributions versus 40 years' contributions?  Even during the previous Government, when I asked the former Minister, Senator Regina Doherty, about the transition from 30 years' contributions to 40 years', the replies I got fudged the issue and stated that it only applied where you were claiming the carer's credits and that no decision had been made in terms of people who had worked or drawn credits for the 30 years.  When did that morph from 30 years' contributions to 40 years' contributions as a general policy as opposed to a specific policy?  It was introduced to deal with the reduction in the payments to people who did not have the full average.  The commission is obviously making a firm recommendation.  Was the Department providing the data working as 40 years' contributions as a given, even though to my knowledge that policy was never decided on?  As I said, the only policy that was decided on was 30 years' contributions.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Ms Feehily about the self employed.  Even at the very beginning, on an actuarial basis, it was way better at 4%.  As the commission pointed out repeatedly, the biggest cost for social welfare is the contributory State pension and, therefore, the adds-on are not what have added the costs.<\/p> <p>  It is fair to say it is the best value, as Ms Feehily pointed out.  You pay your tax and your USC, which, God knows, was only meant to be a temporary provision.  It is like income tax, when Wellington introduced it the first time as a temporary expedient.  It has had a long legacy after him but USC was in the same vein.  It was meant to get us over a little hump.  It is something we should grasp the nettle on and I agree with Ms Feehily there.<\/p> <p>  I have probably said enough.  My big issue is the human issue.  This increase in the age does not factor in all of those people, many of whom get out of full-time work earlier on and are on invalidity pensions or whatever and cannot reasonably be expected to work after 66 years of age.  Pushing it from them is really pushing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#H00300","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":1017,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will pass over to Ms Burke to deal with the question on costings and savings.  By the way, income tax was introduced by the British Government as a temporary arrangement during the Napoleonic Wars.  The issues of transition and long working lives are kind of tied in together.  We did not revisit the transition pension.  We received quite a lot of inputs and views that the retirement condition irritated many people in the transition pension.  Back in the day, it was called the retirement pension.  The idea that one retired for a year and then went back to work the following year and continued to get the same pension was regarded by many people as being slightly laughable.  That point was made to us.  We did discuss returning to a thing called a transition pension.  We discussed whether we might recommend the reinvention of a retirement condition for an early pension but, taking account of the submissions made to us, decided that would be complicating things all over again.  I take the Deputy's point that some people are able and willing to continue to work and, in fact, actively seeking to continue to work, otherwise we would not have a row about the employment contract issue.  There are people who wish to keep working, while there are others who do not wish to keep working or cannot do so.  In the context of any increase in the age, we recommended that at the age of 65 people with a long insurance record - they are likely to be the people the Deputy is describing who cannot continue working and are likely to have started quite young - would get a pension without any transition or retirement condition.

It is a tremendous contribution to this debate on pensions and how we plan for the future.  I will home in on the issue of the retirement age.  I will declare an interest in that I have a trade union background and have worked with workers in meat factories, on construction sites and in retail.  I agree with Mr. Duggan that we have to be realistic.  How realistic is it to expect these workers to work until the age of 68 after a lifetime of working, bearing in mind that many of them will not have spent their entire working lives in Ireland?  Many will have come in as foreign workers over the past 30 years or so.  Many others, including me, will have spent a long time abroad because of our unfortunate tradition of emigration over decades.  How realistic is it to expect these people, who have given a lifetime of work, to work on to the age of 68?<\/p> <p>  I again compliment the work done by the commission.  I am intrigued by the four potential packages it presented.  I prefer package 3 to package 4, because it does not force workers to work on to the age of 68.  We all support the idea of flexible working, which is a key requirement.  I am curious as to why package 3 was not chosen.  I am looking at the potential increases in employer and employee PRSI.  I see employee PRSI would go up by 0.2% under package 3, as opposed to no increase under package 4.  The difference is between a 1.55% increase and a 1.35% increase.  How do these PRSI rates compare with those of our European counterparts?  My understanding is there is a significant gap between the PRSI paid by employers here and what is typically paid in Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#K00400","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":1045,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his remarks about the work.  The idea of the four packages is exactly the point he homed in on.  We provided options, which is what our terms of reference asked us to do.  The Government is entirely free to choose any or none of them.  We provided an evidence base for all of the options.  Package 3 is entirely on the funding side, with no contribution from the age.  The commission is a group of 11 people with a range of views and we formed the closest consensus on package 4.  We felt that the age increase makes a significant contribution to solving the challenge.  We also had submissions from bodies, including the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, showing there was a large body of people who want to continue at work.  As I said, the employment contract issue would not be arising if there were not people who wanted to continue at work.  It was not as simple as everybody wanting to retire.<\/p> <p>  Package 4 emerged from a distillation of all of the inputs.  By providing the option for a pension at 65, at the same time as the age is going up, we were finding a levelling in there.  Package 4, on the age ground, emerged from a distillation of all of the inputs and addressing the scale of the problem, as well as a desire not to have everything falling on the funding side.  The trade union people, and I am sure they would not mind me saying this, would not necessarily have wanted employee PRSI going up either.<\/p> <p>  I take Senator Gavan's point that the difference between the various packages in the incidence of PRSI is modest, but it does have an impact on the labour market and that was also on the table from various inputs to us.  There was not a desire to increase PRSI at the same time as auto-enrolment is coming on, with a potential increase from both employers and employees to their personal pensions and things such as statutory sick pay imposing additional costs.  There were many things in the mix in the submissions to us.  However, we were particularly driven by the fact there is no fixed view that people should retire at 65 or 66.  People were looking for a range and so we put the age piece into package 4 as the optimum mix of interventions to help address the deficit, noting that people with long working lives might get a pension at 65, and as an option for Government.<\/p> <p>  I take the Senator's point about people having worked in different countries.  Modern social security frameworks provide for reciprocation, not just in the European Union, but beyond.  People who work in different in countries can end up with two partial pensions or combined insurance records.  It is not the sort of fatal hit it used to be many years ago.<\/p> <p>  There are two answers to the Senator's question on PRSI in other countries.  Social security systems are not always directly comparable.  In many countries, which I am sure the Senator knows from his own work, some elements of social security are provided through funds, including trade unions.  Several contributions can come from a payslip, so pension, unemployment insurance and health insurance can all be quite different.  Comparison is quite difficult but it is the case that we are a bit behind the curve on both the employer and employee side.  How far we are behind the curve depends on who one looks at for comparisons.  As if that was not complicated enough, the benefit range is also a bit different.  As a general comment, the Senator is correct.  We had a presentation from the OECD and when that question was put to it, the OECD pointed out we were also behind the curve on the employee side.  Does that capture the Senator's questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":1046,"content":"<p>It does.  In terms of the potential savings of raising the pension age, I will go back to Mr. Duggan's point about being realistic.  Realistically, a number of these people, if they are forced to work on to 68, will find themselves in receipt of some kind of social payment, rather than actual work.  Age Action described this point very well last week in that we know once people get into their 50s and 60s, it is much harder to get another job.  Is it realistic to suggest this level of savings, given the Department of Social Protection's analysis suggested that many of these people will still require an alternative form of payment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#K00600","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":1047,"content":"<p>I can only repeat that the evidence put to us was that there was a growing desire to continue working among older people and those coming up to pension age, balanced by some among whom there was no such desire.

I will be brief.  I have an observation and one or two comments to make.  I thank the commission for this extraordinary body of work.  I am of the Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v school, in that I am familiar with the headline details but not the minutiae of the report.  The background is the decision to raise the pension age to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028 that was made by the Government led by then Taoiseach Enda Kenny between 2011 and 2016.<\/p> <p>  A fundamentally dishonest debate was held in the midst of the most recent general election campaign, during which voodoo economics prevailed and nobody was prepared to stand up and say that more people cannot qualify for payment from the Social Insurance Fund without an increase in contributions.  Some even advocated for reduced contributions.  People should not have been told that more will qualify for pensions equivalent to those being paid today or increased pensions.  That is a fundamentally dishonest position.  There was further dishonesty from some who voted for an increase in the pension age in Northern Ireland from 65 to 66, which came into effect last year, but who, in June of this year, voted in this jurisdiction to reduce the pension age to 65 and argued that the only cost of that was &euro;120 million to the Social Insurance Fund.  Those positions are dishonest.  The report is stark in its detail and what is abundantly clear is that we face a difficult challenge.  The Social Insurance Fund will be in deficit to the tune of more than &euro;3 billion, and growing, by 2030 if we do nothing.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate the fantastic piece of work that has been carried out under the stewardship of the chairperson of the commission and by all of the members of the commission.  Why does Ms Feehily believe that the proposal in the commission's report, which, if I understand it correctly, is for an incremental increase in the pension age to 67 over the period to 2031, and to 68 some time thereafter on an incremental basis, will be in any way more acceptable than the lead-in time envisaged in the original legislation to raise the pension age to 67 and 68 in 2021 and 2028, respectively?  These are difficult issues.  We must all face up to the realities.  People are living longer, which is a fantastic achievement in our lifetime, and, consequently, they are active and healthier in society for much longer.  That brings challenges with it.  Meeting those challenges has significant economic consequences with which we are grappling.  Why does the commission believe its proposals will be more politically palatable than those that were outlined and legislated for previously?  I again thank the commission.  It has made a fantastic contribution to a very challenging area.<\/p> <p>  Ms Burke alluded to policy levers relating to fertility and the requirement of additional migrant workers.  Is the argument around migrant workers not bogus?  If we bring in more workers and have more people paying in, they will fund the pension entitlements of those who are hitting the pension age either now or in the near future.  However, future pension liabilities for those workers are also being incurred.  I accept we have labour shortages and requirements for non-EEA workers to fill vacancies here but that migrant worker argument is short-termism.  It is unsustainable in the long term.  Through their contributions, those workers are creating an entitlement to social welfare benefits, possibly including a pension entitlement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#L00300","speaker":"1454"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":1051,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will invite Ms Burke to answer the Deputy's second point in a moment.  The Deputy asked a key question about the palatability of the age recommendation.  We have included a couple of things which we think might help.  The more transparency there is about the nature of the funding problem, the better the chance of creating an understanding across the community that this is not just a political whim or something that is being done for fun or to annoy people but is an important part of having a pension system that has certainty.  The comfort of certainty, as you get older, is enormously important.  We are strongly suggesting that in the lead-up to any new changes, whether they are recommended by the commission or not, more public debate take place about the underpinnings of, and the rationale for, any such decision.<\/p> <p>  In the debate that took place about the age increase at the beginning of 2020, there was a lot of focus on what I am calling the gap between 65 and 66.  Many people were concerned.  There are recommendations in our report that would address the gap on the employment side.  There were some people who were content to stay at work but could not do so.  We have recommended addressing the gap.  The Government has addressed the gap with a retirement benefit for the age of 65 to 66.  The gap has been addressed, or would be addressed, if our recommendation was implemented and attached to that to a fair degree.  At least one of the debating points would be addressed.<\/p> <p>  We also recommended a lot of communication and the issuance to workers of statements to allow for a lot of notice.  We are not recommending that the age increase begin until 2028, so there is lots of time.  The statements to workers would tell them their specific situation, pension age and contribution record.  It would set those out that information and explain it in good time.  That should be done not only once but more than once.  We recommend better communication to help understanding.<\/p> <p>  We felt that by moving a quarter at a time, we were reducing the sense of loss.  Some people felt they were losing a year, relative to their predecessors the previous year.  By doing it slowly and more gradually, although people still \"lose\", they are losing a lesser amount relative to their colleagues who retired the preceding year or the year before that.  As part of the question of addressing the gap, we recommended the option to provide a pension for people with very long records at 65.<\/p><p>We felt we were contributing to enabling a rounder debate in the future.<\/p><p> At the committee's meeting last week, which I reviewed in recent days, one of the members said there are no easy decisions in this and we agree.  There is only a question of which hard decisions will be made.  The points I have made are about contributing to a rounder discussion and to having some answers to a discussion around the age point.  The 65 age gap has been partially addressed and would be further addressed if people who wanted to stay at work could do so.  We need to have much better and earlier person-specific communications.  We must tell people that their pension age will be, for example, 67 and three quarters or 66 and we will shorten the sense of loss involved by doing it much more gradually and more slowly.  Those were our considerations on how we might help that debate to be rounder the next time.<\/p><p> Ms Burke might be able to help with the question on fertility and migration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":1053,"content":"<p>That question ties in nicely with the Deputy's first question on why this might be more palatable now than the previously legislated for State pension age increases were.  A couple of years ago when we saw those increases about to come through, everybody had a bit of an understanding about the problem but not everybody was fully informed, including myself.  Before I became involved with the commission I thought that we did not need to worry about it, that more people would come into the country and that the average age of retirement would be maintained.  Other people might have said that the State pension was getting more expensive but I thought the State would cover that cost.  Everybody had a partial solution for this problem and everyone partially understood it but when the Commission on Pensions was formed, it set out to look at each of these ideas that people had, such as the possibility that migration or fertility might solve the problem.  We took a systematic and evidence-based approach to examining each of those matters in isolation and to examine if they could be relied on, if they would help to solve the problem or if they would cause other problems as the Deputy has suggested.  We looked at each one individually and we looked at the migration question purely in the context of a simplistic ratio, namely the number of working age people versus the number of people past the State pension age to see how we could maintain that.  The Deputy is correct that if the population increases by 50% over the next 30 years there will be other significant challenges for the State in housing, healthcare, childcare and in people getting older and developing an entitlement in their own right.  That would cause much wider challenges apart from just the State pension.  It was important to us to examine how many people we would need if we just wanted to maintain that simple ratio.  It demonstrated to us that the ideas we might have had previously, that a small increase in net inward migration might solve the problem, would not work.  The process allowed us to tackle that and answer the question and now we can systematically move on to other headings that might help us tackle the challenge.<\/p> <p>  On Ms Feehily's comments on palatability, being forewarned is incredibly important.  A key part of the second pillar of pension provision is telling people every year what they are saving, what they have saved to date and what they can expect at retirement if they continue what they are doing.  That has been crystallised for people who are actively in employment as well as for people who might have saved for retirement but who have left their pension scheme to move to another job.  Under recently introduced legislation, every year those people will get a statement that sets out their expectations and any assumptions surrounding that.  It is a question of applying that approach to the first pillar of the pension system.  We must give people that information so that they understand what they will get at retirement in order that they can plan and see if, for example, auto-enrolment or saving for a private pension and so on would be important and worthwhile for them.  Forewarned is forearmed and action can be taken if needed and if no action is needed they know that as well if they are forewarned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Roma Burke"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":1054,"content":"<p>I asked one other question on the actuarial cost of reducing the pension age from 66 to 65 rather than increasing it.

I am around long enough to remember the reduction in the pension age from 70 to 66, which happened in the 1970s and was a staggered reduction every year over four years.  It is a different kettle of fish to go in the opposite direction but it is worth remembering that we are revisiting an area we occupied within living memory when the retirement age was 70.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#M00300","speaker":"1454"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":1055,"content":"<p>I would be relying on my wider understanding of pensions to work out the actuarial cost of reducing the pension age to 65.

If it is assumed that the average male might live until 83, for example, and if he is getting pension increases along the way, the value of that pension is about 30:1.  If that is brought forward a year, an extra year's payment is being added to it and all the future pension payments are also being increased so it would probably increase it by at least 10%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Roma Burke"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":1056,"content":"<p>With regard to Ms Feehily, the commission and all the staff who supported the commission's work, a substantial body of evidence has been produced.  Regardless of what decision is taken down the road, this is significant and useful and it clearly sets out the challenges, issues and options.  It starts the conversation we need to have in this country on how we address this challenge into the future.  A lot of the tools are here and members have raised questions on the figures and modelling behind that.  I want to publicly acknowledge that because it is significant work and I want to commend everyone who has been involved in that.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  Ms Feehily's presentation mentioned the issue of class K stamps for additional income being paid by people beyond the age of 65.  Within the commission report it is also acknowledged that some people beyond the age of 65 or 66 can no longer pay PRSI contributions to build up an entitlement.  How does one square the circle of paying two types of contributions beyond someone's 66th birthday?  Some people will pay class K contributions and others might pay class S or other stamps.  Should it not be the case that if someone pays PRSI, he or she should make a contribution to his or her pension up to the threshold of 30:1, 40:1 or 45:1?  People will continue to pay beyond that if the commission's report is implemented.  Why is there a need to pay some stamps that do not have an entitlement built into them?  Should that system be streamlined?<\/p> <p>  I want to follow up on Ms Burke's final comment on modelling and emigration and I want to come back to the other issue.  The ESRI was not able to answer the question of childcare and the indigenous working population for us last week.<\/p><p>If we look at what is happening here at the moment in childcare, which is replication of problems we have seen right across Europe over previous generations, the cost of rearing a family and particularly the cost of childcare has a double-edged impact.  One, it reduces the fertility rate in a country and is part of the contributing factor to that.  The other is that it also reduces participation in the workforce, PRSI contributions and taxation.  This is a double-edged effect with both a short-term and longer-term impact.  What would be the benefit of actively supporting childcare and greater participation of women in the workforce and what would that impact be on the long-term prognosis as to the cost of pensions?  Our witnesses may or may not be able to provide some information today and, if not, perhaps they might try to come back to us and grapple with this particular challenge because it was one that the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, could not answer for us here last week.  <br\/><br\/>Turning to Mr. Duggan, in his evidence he referred to the projected modelling costs of the pension and the actual cost of the pension.  The projection was that not increasing the age from 66 to 67 would cost &euro;221 million.  He is now projecting that that figure will be &euro;275 million by year-end and over &euro;500 million in a full year.  What is the jobseeker's benefit impact on that?  If people retire at 66 years of age but cannot claim their State pension until they are 67 years of age, they would have an entitlement to jobseekers&rsquo; benefit which, to me, would negate much of the potential savings that are there.  Can Mr. Duggan give the committee the projected cost of the jobseeker's benefit if one increases the age from 66 to 67?<br\/><br\/>It sounds strange to me that the projections are actually going up when, if one looks at the CSO analysis of the data from <i>RIP.ie<\/i>, this shows that there are 2,300 additional deaths as a direct result of Covid-19, or this is the indication that has been given.  A number of people, disproportionately and sadly in respect of many older people, have died as a result of Covid-19.  As a result of Covid-19, we have fewer people claiming a State pension yet Mr. Duggan&rsquo;s projections are &euro;54 million out from where it would be.  How has that happened when, sadly, there are fewer people claiming the pension as a result of Covid-19? The cost projections have gone up by close to a quarter; that seems to me to be a significant error in respect of those particular calculations by the Department.  <br\/><br\/>On the famous Telecom &Eacute;ireann shares that were lodged in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF we all know that that fund has been raided to bail out the banks and has also been used to invest in stimulating the economy.  There will be a return, however, from those investments at some stage.  The Minister for Finance is telling us that the investments that were put into the banks are turning into a profit and the reality is that the National Treasury Management Agency. NTMA, will get a return on the investments that are now being put in to indigenous businesses, and so forth.  Has that been modelled into this?<br\/><br\/>Has any consideration been given to the fact that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, has stated that the windfalls we are gaining at the moment in corporate tax should not be put into day-to-day spending?  Is there merit in ring-fencing some of that corporate tax windfall and putting it into something like the NPRF which was there to plan for the cliff edge down the road by way of costs?  Our witnesses might answer some of those specific questions, and Ms Feehily might start, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#M00500","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":1058,"content":"<p>The question for me related to class K PRSI.  By way of general remark, this is not the commission&rsquo;s business.  PRSI needs streamlining and that is a different question.<\/p> <p>  The range of solutions in our recommendations in the commission&rsquo;s report around PRSI and older people would bring some complexity and the Chairman is completely correct on that.  We are recommending that those who wish to keep contributing would pay a full contribution up to age 70 if they wanted to increase their pension.  We are also recommending that if they do not have enough contributions they would keep paying and then they would stop when they had enough.  That would involve another subclass A, where A is already broken down into people with an income below &euro;300, or whatever the exact figure is.  There are subdivisions in class A and there would now be a new one.<\/p> <p>  The separate recommendation is about funding.  This is simply a solidarity contribution where pay is the most convenient box to put that into because it exists already as a solidarity contribution in the PRSI system.  The Chairman is correct in saying that we would be introducing some complexity.  The alternative is to simplify everything into a single rate.  It is not unusual in the history of PRSI, going back to 1979, for there to be these complexities.  In fact, in preparing as part of the commission&rsquo;s work, I discovered class P, which I had never heard of, which has all of about seven people in it.  It is not unusual within the PRSI system for it to provide subclasses to address particular issues.  We acknowledged that the complexity was already there and we may add a little bit to it but not an enormous amount.  <\/p> <p>  If we could use the flexible options, in particular, for people to continue paying in order to enhance their pension or to fill out their record, we thought that it was worth the complexity.  The class K piece is a straightforward funding hypothecated tax, almost.<\/p> <p>  Ms Burke will talk about the modelling in a moment but there are sections in the report about labour market interventions.

Childcare is the trigger for helping more women participate in the workforce.  The Chairman is really asking whether the commission considered the impact of women being better facilitated to either return to the workforce or work more?  Yes, that was fully and very carefully considered at our technical sub-committee level.  I am a lay person on economics but I was sitting beside two very able economists and we had a discussion about participation rates within the workforce, how that increases and the role of women within that.  One of the conclusions from the committee which is already built into the calculations is not what I would consider to be an optimistic calculation but one which is at the higher end of a range of assumptions.  Basically, an increase in the labour force participation rate from 62% to about 66% is built into these calculations.  Looking at the research and discussing it with my colleagues, we felt that there was probably limited scope for further participation given that that was a fairly challenging increase in labour force participation.  That, in turn, is dependent upon childcare and other factors to help people.<\/p><p>We also looked at the impact of increasing education levels on people going into the workforce and staying there.

Sadly, childcare is seen as a cost rather than as a long-term financial benefit to the economy.  It is important that is part of the overall narrative and discussion.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Duggan might answer one other question.  Is it feasible and practical for the existing social welfare software system to pay State contributory pensions on an incremental quarterly basis, as is being proposed by the commission?  That seems to be an issue in that the quarterly incremental payment could be challenging purely because of the software system currently operating in the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#O00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":1062,"content":"<p>I will take the Chairman's last question first.

I do not think it would be a showstopper.<\/p> <p>   I do not have figures to hand regarding the benefit payment for 65-year-olds, but the yearly expenditure on that is in the region of &euro;35 million to &euro;40 million, based on the number of people who seem to qualify for it, or are applying for it, at this juncture.<\/p> <p>  On the &euro;221 million likely increasing to &euro;275 million, remember the latter is a projection rather than an actual figure and it is impossible to be definitive about projections.  The best we can do is estimate based on previous understandings and likely behaviours.  The Department almost always errs on the side of a conservative estimate when projecting because it does not want to overstate the nature of problems.  Consequently, even though there have been, tragically, deaths from Covid, it is still the case that people are living much longer and healthier lives.  That dynamic, which is changing quite rapidly and has done so over the past ten years, coupled with some budget increases, such as the living alone allowance and matters of that nature, means that our projections may have been a little out and a little conservative.  Consequently, the actual costs being realised are a little higher than we expected.  That is because it is incredibly difficult to predict what the numbers will be over the full year and, at the time we made the projection, we did not know of some of those budgetary increases.

I will again make the point I made to Mr. Duggan regarding the figure of more than &euro;200 million that had to be charged because we did not increase the age to 67.  If we looked at removing the ages in contracts that see people forced to retire at 65, and we also allowed those who remained at work to accrue PRSI, I believe that figure would be much lower.<\/p> <p>  We need to move on getting rid of those ages stipulated in contracts that are below State pension age and allow those who want to, and are willing and able to, work on to accrue PRSI contributions.  In some cases, they need to work on because they do not have the PRSI for a full State pension.  In other cases, they want to work on for social reasons because, in some cases, they have nothing else.  It is not always financial.  I would argue that those savings are limited given that we are paying out.  Will we continue to pay out when the pension age increases to 67?  Will that benefit payment extend to two years once the pension age increases?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#O00700","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":1067,"content":"<p>Ms Burke talked about forewarned being forearmed and that is important.  I made the point last week that people of my age or a bit younger are often so busy in their lives they may not be thinking ahead to pension age.  Having communication on what people's PRSI entitlements will amount to, done clearly and in a personalised way, as Ms Burke said, is key.  It is also a huge factor in the idea of auto-enrolment, which we have not discussed today.  As people become more aware and think in that longer term frame, auto-enrolments will become an increasingly important part of the picture.<\/p> <p>  The Chair might laugh at this, but he opened the door by talking about the changing nature of the world of work.  I put this question to the ESRI last week and nobody bit, as such.  We are modelling pension structures out to 2070 in this report.  In the conception of the world of work that underpins this, were we looking at a business-as-usual model?  With regard to childcare, for example, we know the caring economy will expand greatly as we have an older population.  Will that have an impact on how we fund our pensions model?  We can also look at areas around artificial intelligence and digitalisation.  It is outside Ms Burke's terms of reference but is it in the terms of reference of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  There are also climate impacts.  Are we factoring this in?  If we are planning the fiscal future of the State out to 2070, are we actively taking account in our modelling of those long-term disruptive forces or presuming a business-as-usual model?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#P00100","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":1068,"content":"<p>First, I will address one or two of the Chair's questions to clarify.  We made a deliberate decision in terms of the data to ignore the <i>rip.ie<\/i>blip, for want of a better word, because we are looking at trends over time.  When we were settling our technical papers we had that conversation because our member, Seamus Coffey, was the first person to start on that particular analysis.  One could not tell whether it will be a blip or be sustained or whether it will have impact.  Now that we are in year two of a health emergency, some nations are starting to adjust downwards their life expectancy rates.  Whether that will be a blip or a trend, we decided to ignore it.<br\/><br\/>We also had a conversation about the pension reserve fund early in our work and a number or members had a view that maybe that was another part of the funding solution.  We came back after much analysis and decided that certainty was more important.  That is why our funding proposals are around social insurance and the Exchequer, which is recurring.  That is why we recommend the Exchequer contribution should be hardwired in.  Relying on occasional payments is not a way to fund something that is recurring and growing.  We discussed it but the Chair will not find it in the report because it was left out.<br\/><br\/>On Deputy Kerrane's questions, we will have to come back to her about page 132.  The Department ran models for us.  I do not know quite what the precise elements of the model it ran was.  It is better, as Mr. Flynn said, that we get it right.  There were some things included, I know that.<br\/><br\/>On the age 65 proposal, we decided that trying to define long hard-working lives was another complexity and debating point so we settled instead on years of contributions.  What is arduous for one might be fun for another.  I do not mean to be glib but some people like to go to work.  There is interesting stuff in the report on the labour market from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, TILDA, which showed quite a number of people self-reporting that they want to remain at work.  We talked about that but reckoned the definitions could be tricky.<br\/><br\/>On Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh's question, we did not envision a different future.  Our terms of reference, as we discussed at the beginning, were quite focused but we were clear in our own chats.  It is not in the report but we were clear in talking to colleagues that this would not be the last word.  It cannot be, because we are looking at sets of data and trends.  While we are modelling the cost out to 2070 based on the <i>status quo<\/i>, our age recommendations top at age 68.  We reckon another view would have to be taken of what the trend is then, what the world is like and what and the inputs are like on the funding side.  There are issues of sustainability and climate.  The impact of climate issues on the labour market is something we are only beginning to debate.  While we have labour market evidence in here relating to health, education, female participation and age, we have not factored in what happens if people, having learned in the last year and a half that they can work differently, adopt a new model.  The evidence was not there for us to do so.<br\/><br\/>A proposition was put to us by some submitters and in the previous work done on pensions that the pension age should be linked to life expectancy and we said we would not go that far because one would need to implement certain things, assess the new reality and form another set of proposals.  Nothing is ever set in stone.  We thought about whether to go beyond age 68 as an example and we decided going to 68 was enough and we would not link it to life expectancy.  That is partly connected to the Deputy's question about the nature of work in the future.  I do not know if that covers the various elements of the members' questions.  Ms Burke wants to add something.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637107200,"counter":1069,"content":"<p>Deputy Marc &Oacute; Cathasaigh took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637107200,"counter":1070,"content":"<p>I will add a couple of things to fill in some little gaps.  There have been a good few questions today on the table in page 132.  On the previous page, it states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Commission considered it appropriate to review the wider expenditure impacts of changing the pension age rather than just considering the impact on State Pensions&rsquo; expenditure [alone], as expenditure on working age payments would increase as a result of an increased pension age. <\/blockquote> <p>It goes on to state:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTable 11.4 below sets out the impact of overall pension expenditure (which includes public sector pension and wider social protection payments) of changes to the State Pension age. <\/blockquote> <p>That might help with that question.<br\/><br\/>On Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh's comments about looking to 2070, who knows what life will be like then?  The further you move out, the more uncertain things become.  Nobody three years ago could have predicted what has happened in the last year and a half.  It goes to show that things come which are unexpected.<br\/><br\/>We were mindful of the work the technical subcommittee did.  Any findings we thought would be useful to the Pensions Commission were based on looking at 2050.  We felt that was a point in time that was definable and which we could see.  That is what we focused on and then we said what we think happens if you go out to 2070.  Even in the infographic the Pensions Commission produced, the focus is on 2050 because the further you go out, my version of the world might be different from somebody else's version by that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021111700002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Roma Burke"},{"type":"speech","time":1637107200,"counter":1071,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending and for their constructive and positive engagement.
