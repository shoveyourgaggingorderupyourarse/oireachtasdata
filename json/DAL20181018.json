Ireland&rsquo;s overall competitiveness performance remains positive.  Our improved fiscal position and increased cost competitiveness have all contributed to Ireland&rsquo;s improved international competitiveness.  This improvement is reflected in a range of metrics, notably economic growth, increased employment, falling unemployment and a strong trade performance.  Notwithstanding this strong position, addressing Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness remains a key economic priority for Government and we continue to monitor Ireland's cost base and analyse the factors that are crucial to improving our cost competitiveness.<\/p>  <p>  Recent reports published by the National Competitiveness Council found that the cost base for enterprise is internationally competitive across a range of metrics, for example, the cost of starting a business, communications costs and average income taxes.  The council also highlighted that Ireland remains a relatively high-cost location and cost pressures are evident in residential property, credit, energy, labour and business service costs.<\/p>  <p>  A range of initiatives in the Action Plan for Jobs 2018 are in train across Government to enhance our cost competitiveness and productivity, improve the ease of doing business, reduce the administrative burden and drive greater efficiencies across the enterprise base.  Through the Action Plan for Education and Pathways to Work, the Government is working to ensure the pipeline of talent can meet the demand for labour to reduce labour cost pressure.  My Department has reviewed the policies underpinning the current employment permits regime to ensure it is fully supportive of Ireland&rsquo;s emerging labour market needs, whether they are skills or labour shortages in certain sectors.  The work of the Personal Injuries Commission, whose second and final report were published in September 2018 by my Department, the implementation of the report on the cost of motor insurance and the complementary work of the cost of insurance working group should help to reduce insurance costs for businesses.<\/p>  <p>  I launched the &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme in March 2018 which supports the working capital needs of companies on which Brexit has, has had or will have an impact.  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Finance, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and the European Investment Fund, is developing the &euro;300 million future growth loan scheme as announced in budget 2019 to allow businesses to borrow for up to ten years to support capital investment.<\/p><p>Enterprise 2025 Renewed also places increased emphasis on enhancing our competitiveness position by developing Irish-owned enterprises.  We are placing a spotlight on innovation and skills.  Enterprise Ireland also places strong emphasis on competitiveness.  It supports exporting enterprises with initiatives in Lean, research and development and innovation, as well as management development.<br\/><br\/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><br\/><br\/>In addition to the wide range of existing supports provided by my Department and agencies, budget 2019 allocated additional funding for my Department to boost business productivity such as a doubling of the allocation for the retail online pilot scheme to &euro;1.25 million.  An additional &euro;2.75 million was also awarded to Enterprise Ireland for its SME regional innovation and technology clusters programme.  The budget provides an extra &euro;8 million for my Department&rsquo;s Brexit response and global footprint.<br\/><br\/>In ensuring our cost competitiveness there is a role for the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage the controllable portion of their respective cost bases, drive productivity and continue to take action to minimise costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800003#A00600","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539855300,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The reason I raise this issue is it is a concern.  There is no point in us highlighting the positives if we fail to accept that there are significant pressures such as the cost of finance, childcare, property, labour, insurance, transport, energy and other business services.  Equally, I can identify many areas in which we are doing exceptionally well in terms of competitiveness.  Overall, however, there are significant pressures within the economy.  While there is rapid expansion for the next few years, these costs can often be camouflaged.  Owing to increased cash flow to businesses, it can hide these costs for a while, but it is inevitable that it will have a major impact in the time ahead.  The time to undermine these pressures is now, rather than in several years when it will be too late.  The key issues have to be addressed, namely, the cost of finance, housing, transport, insurance, business services and energy, as well as the cost of childcare which I accept is outside the Minister's remit.

We are acutely aware of the vulnerabilities in the domestic economy such as low productivity levels in indigenous firms, with growing uncertainty in the global economy and Brexit.  We must ensure the economy is well positioned to adapt to a low carbon future, as well as the revolution in digitisation and automation.  Otherwise, we could see negative economic and employment impacts in the future.  The Government has recognised the need for a concrete and co-ordinated plan to address these challenges and opportunities.  That is why in July it agreed to the development of the future jobs initiative which will be a whole-of-government approach, with concrete and ambitious actions to enhance productivity, create quality and sustainable jobs and build a resilient and innovative economy.

The pillar banks are gouging the economy.  They are in our pockets every day of the week.  This issue must be addressed.  The average interest rate across the eurozone for small and medium-sized businesses is 1.77%.  In Ireland it is 3.25%.  The banks are pillaging us, but we do not seem to be doing anything about it.  It is inherently wrong that we are at a complete disadvantage with our European colleagues and competitors because the pillar banks are gouging the economy.

The divergence between Irish and eurozone interest rates for enterprise is particularly noticeable in the case of loans up to &euro;250,000.  The interest rate for new business loans in Ireland was double the eurozone average rate throughout 2017.  On 28 March 2018 I opened the Brexit loan scheme for applications to allow for the roll-out of a &euro;300 million fund in working capital for eligible Irish businesses which will be impacted on by Brexit.  The scheme will be delivered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland through the commercial lenders, the three pillar banks.  It will make &euro;300 million available to eligible businesses, with up to 499 employees, at an interest rate of 4% or less.  That is an attractive rate for an overdraft facility.  In addition, we have a &euro;300 million long-term future growth loan scheme which will lend to businesses, with terms up to eight to ten years.  Currently, the pillar banks will only lend for up to seven years.  We have identified this gap in the market.

I am allocating an additional &euro;5 million for the local enterprise offices, which will include a specific measure for customs training for importers and exporters.  I am providing an additional &euro;1 million for InterTradeIreland to step up business preparedness actions.<\/p>  <p>  On the effectiveness of the supports, a recent survey of 2,400 Enterprise Ireland clients found that 85% were taking Brexit-related actions.

It is important to note that companies are choosing from the full suite of supports available from the agencies.  Among Enterprise Ireland clients, in the first six months of this year alone, 43% of the 1,600 most exposed firms received grant aid.  Similarly, the number of firms using the Enterprise Ireland Brexit scorecard is at nearly 3,000.

The offers matched financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500 and were aimed at getting micro businesses, those employing ten people or fewer, to trade online.  The voucher scheme is supported with training and advice.  Since the start of the scheme in July 2014 to 30 June this year, over 4,100 micro enterprises had availed of TOVs.  The LEOs also offer a wide range of short training programmes to support their clients in building their online presence to compete in the online marketplace.  The programmes focus on different elements, including marketing which is so important, social media, e-commerce sales, strategy and search engine optimisation. <\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, as chairperson of the retail consultation forum, has prioritised supporting the retail sector to develop its online capability and enhance its competitiveness.  In 2017 interesting data from the Central Statistics Office showed that 66% of Irish enterprises in the wholesale and retail sector had reported having a website or homepage.  However, of these, only 28% are able to facilitate online ordering.  To support the new project, a new pilot online retail scheme was recently launched, with a fund of &euro;625,000.  It will be administered by Enterprise Ireland.  The fund was later doubled to &euro;1.25 million as part of the Department&rsquo;s 2019 budget.  The scheme will support retail businesses with 20 employees or more that have already decided strategically to grow online in the areas of research, strategy development, implementation and training.

Working closely with the Irish Internet Association, Enterprise Ireland delivers a range of funded and advisory e-commerce supports for its clients to develop their online marketing capabilities.  In addition, it regularly organises events which can connect clients with leading experts and inform them on best practice.  An additional &euro;1.8 million has been earmarked for the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland in the next three years.

I have also allocated an additional &euro;5 million to the local enterprise offices, LEOs, for 2019 to increase their Brexit supports to businesses in every county.<\/p><p>The level of uptake of these supports shows that businesses are aware of the assistance on offer and are engaging with various initiatives and schemes that have been made available.  A September 2017 survey reported that 38% of Enterprise Ireland clients surveyed had taken Brexit actions.  In May 2018, this figure increased to 85% of Enterprise Ireland client companies surveyed.  The survey reported that Enterprise Ireland client companies are taking action in areas such as market diversification; developing strategic partnerships; improving operational competitiveness; improving financial management; and strengthening business in the UK.  This is a positive indication that companies are preparing for Brexit.<\/p><p>The Enterprise Ireland Brexit small and medium enterprises, SME, scorecard is an interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit.  To date, 2,962 Brexit scorecards have been completed.  The Be Prepared grant, also available through Enterprise Ireland, offers SME clients a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to assist them in preparing an action plan for economic shocks such as Brexit.  The grant can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and travel expenses associated with researching the direction of their action plan.  A total of 137 Be Prepared grants have so far been approved.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland has run eight Brexit advisory clinics throughout the country to date.

Technical assistance grants for micro export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities and 293 clients have been approved so far for this scheme.<\/p><p>The Brexit loan scheme, launched in March this year, makes a fund of up to &euro;300 million available to eligible businesses to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenge.

To date, the Brexit advisory service has engaged directly with more than 2,350 SMEs in Ireland through the various elements of the service.  I have allocated an additional &euro;1 million to InterTradeIreland for 2019 to increase the impact of its Brexit support for businesses.

Of this number, I have been informed that 300 staff based in Limerick and Cork can transfer to Eir under their existing terms and conditions.

The information gathered during this and previous engagements has provided departmental officials with a comprehensive understanding of the potential benefits of membership of CERN.  While these benefits are recognised as significant, the cost is also significant and must be assessed in the context of other departmental and national investment priorities.<\/p>  <p>  The Department continues to keep the position in relation to CERN membership, and its cost, under review and maintains contact with officials in CERN regarding Ireland's potential membership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800010#H00700","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1539858900,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Professor Emmanuel Tsesmelis visited Ireland in July 2018, at my invitation.

Therefore, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, it would be &euro;30 million.

Yesterday, a figure was revealed showing that 9,864 people aged over 75 were left lying on trolleys in emergency departments for longer than 24 hours.  Almost 10,000 people, aged 75 or older, in the first eight months of 2018 were waiting longer than 24 hours on a trolley.<\/p>  <p>  When people get through our health services there is fantastic treatment.  The staff work incredibly hard to give them world class treatment.  Yet, when we see that figure and the trolley figures for July and August, which are traditionally quiet times in our hospitals, they show the crisis facing our health service.<\/p>  <p>  Regrettably, there is little action to deal with the crisis.  Today is 18 October but we have yet to see details of the winter initiative or the ongoing capacity review.  Have the 600 or so beds promised by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, amid the usual flurry of spin and public relations, actually been delivered?  The evidence suggests they have not.  We have oceans of promises and spin, yet 10,000 people aged 75 and over have been left for more than 24 hours on a trolley in our hospitals.  That figure will only rise as the winter kicks in with the usual avalanche of cases of the cold and flu, etc.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health launched the bed capacity review and outlined the country's bed capacity requirements until 2031.  He said that some 600 extra beds would be delivered in the system in 2018.  Many hospitals cannot see these extra beds.

The idea is to ensure the most effective response to the challenges that we know always come through the winter months.<\/p>  <p>  As part of budget 2019, an additional &euro;10 million in funding is being provided in 2018 to prepare for and manage the expected peak in demand for health services in the winter ahead.

Support for patients in the over-75 age group will be a priority, with measures to respond to a surge in capacity, transitional care beds and aids and appliances to support the journey home for patients following a hospital stay.  The Minister for Health has asked for a significant increase in the provision of social care measures to promote hospital discharging in the first quarter of 2019 in response to the expected surge in demand after the Christmas period that we can always expect.<\/p>  <p>  I assure Deputy Calleary and patients that while of course we recognise the pressures in the system that result in patient care not being as good as it should be &ndash; in other words, far too many people, including elderly people, are on trolleys - we are trying to plan ahead for the surge in demand that we know our hospitals will have to cope with in the months ahead.<\/p>  <p>  This is seasonal and happens every year.

What we did not expect was that nothing would be done.<\/p> <p> Last May, when the Minister announced this response, GPs told us that they had not been consulted on the provision of additional tests.  It should have been clear then that different responses were being announced, but that no actual strategy or planning had gone into them.<\/p> <p> Announcements are becoming the hallmark of this Government; delivery, on the other hand, is often sadly lacking.  Furthermore, the Minister did not even plan for how to categorise the delivery of additional smear tests so that high-risk tests, those who were due for scheduled tests and those attending for a re-test were separated.  What was, and still is, a good idea has been completely mismanaged to the point that it is having the reverse effect of what was the intention.<\/p> <p> The measure was supposed to assure women, but now we have women articulating further worry and discomfort over the length of time they are waiting for the results of their tests.  Women were told that they would have the results in six to eight weeks, but they have now been left waiting for up to 18 weeks because the laboratories cannot deal with the additional volume of tests being sent to them.  That is having the knock-on effect of samples expiring because the laboratory cannot process them quickly enough.  That is creating a cyclical effect where samples are being taken and then expiring because of the increased waiting times due to the volume of tests taken, and it is being repeated again and again.<\/p> <p> Not being able to plan and resource services is the inevitable consequence of outsourcing.  If we do not tackle the issues around a lack of human resources at the laboratories to deal with the backlog, these issues will continue and women will not get the peace of mind they need.<\/p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Harris, has said that this serious issue is a priority, so what is being done address it?  Can we, and the women affected, be given a realistic timeframe for when these issues will be dealt with because there are people who are worried?

Will he use that campaign to highlight the realistic timeframe for repeat tests?<\/p> <p> We know that screening saves lives.

The level of uptake showed that many women wished to get the reassurance of a smear test out of cycle.  The Health Service Executive regrets that there are significant delays currently in the reporting of smear test results.<\/p>  <p>  I know that addressing the backlog is a priority for the Minister and the HSE.  The programme was operated for many years with a reporting time of between four and six weeks.  Unfortunately, results are currently being reported within 18 weeks of the test being taken.  In a small number of cases, it is even longer than that.  That is not good enough.  I would like to apologise to those patients affected and assure them that everything possible is being done to try to improve the position.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the difficulties these delays are causing smear takers and GPs as well as patients, primarily.  These delays have been caused by an upsurge in women presenting for smear tests.  There are two main factors contributing to the increase in demand.  As well as women presenting for out-of-cycle smear tests since April, we have also seen an increase in the number of women attending for normal CervicalCheck appointments.<\/p>  <p>  While this increase in participation by women in cervical screening is very welcome, it is contributing to delays and pressures.  Between 1 May 2018 and 30 September, 42,469 repeat or out-of-cycle smear tests were undertaken.  As of 13 October 2018, 86,210 smear test samples were still in progress and not yet reported on.  That compares with approximately 23,000 smear test samples which would normally be expected to be in progress in the system.  What we are seeing, therefore, is a dramatic increase in both out-of-cycle tests for understandable reasons, as the Deputy said, to reassure people, and CervicalCheck seeing an increase in the normal testing system as well.<\/p>  <p>  We have asked laboratories to undertake additional recruitment and that they try to streamline processes around release of reports.  Laboratories are continuing to provide for overtime and to manage annual leave and schedules, with their best efforts, to try to reduce the backlog.<\/p>  <p>  The whole point of this process was to be able to get test results back in a timely manner that would reassure women.  I can tell the Deputy that addressing this issue is a top priority for the HSE and for the Minister, and we are working with the laboratories to try to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800013#L00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1539860700,"counter":130,"content":"<p>While the T&aacute;naiste's apology is welcome, there is not much evidence that this is actually a priority.

I thought it would have been very easy to predict that but, instead, a promise was made and a commitment given, and that was broken.  I put the question again to the T&aacute;naiste.  Will he commit to an information publicity campaign advising women of the realistic timeframe they can expect?<\/p>  <p>  I will not personalise this but there are women who are waiting, and they are justifiably anxious.  They need to know when they will get their results.  At the heart of the CervicalCheck scandal was the fact that information was withheld from women.  Dr. Gabriel Scally found there was a paternalistic attitude on the part of some people in the HSE.  Withholding information from women is what was wrong.  Being honest and up-front with them is what is required.  If the delays are going to continue and if the plans were not made, the T&aacute;naiste should be honest and come out and tell women publicly the length of time they can expect to wait before they get a repeat test and a result.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800013#L00300","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1539860700,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I do not disagree with the Deputy on that.

We have received assurance from Dr. Scally on the quality of the laboratories we currently use.

My colleagues in the Oireachtas and in local authorities across the country have shared information with me about a succession of very challenging cases.  People have been left for weeks without payment.  This morning, a Labour Party councillor in Wexford spoke to a woman, who is in work, who is awaiting an appointment to have surgery.  She has no money to buy food and today she had to resort to getting vouchers from the Society of St. Vincent De Paul; thank God they were there.<\/p>  <p>  People have been given minimum payments instead of their full entitlement.

In a statement issued this morning the Department accepts this fact.  It is greatly impeding our ability as public representatives to respond to the needs of persons who are waiting day by day to receive money to which they are fully entitled.  Urgent action is required.  I understand there have been IT difficulties that have led to delays in processing forms GPs send to certify people's unfitness to work.  The bottom line is that people who are off work owing to illness or an injury are not receiving the money for which they have paid through an insurance fund and on which they are absolutely dependent.  It is leaving them in dire straits.  In addition, some long-standing recipients of illness benefit have found that their payments have stopped suddenly.  Many of those who depend solely on this payment have been left with no money whatsoever for a number of weeks, placing them in an impossible position.  No adequate explanation has been provided by the Department or the Minister as to why this has happened.  The Minister claims to have consulted the IMO and that her Department has written to all contracted GPs setting out the changes that have happened recently.  The commitment given by the Minister to continue to consult the IMO is not the same as actually stepping in to solve the problems people have.

People who are in dire need of money should certainly speak to the community welfare officer in the short term, but that is not a sustainable answer.

The river needs to be cleaned from Gortahoosh bridge through Curreal and Glenflesk village up as far as Loo Bridge against Clonkeen.  This stretch of the river is almost totally blocked with trees, silt and gravel which in the past nine or ten years has caused many houses in the catchment area to be flooded several times.  Up to 35 homes in the area of Glenflesk are under threat or affected in one way or another.  The houses have been flooded or people cannot get into them.  In the last couple of days one eye of the bridge at Glenflesk has been blocked by a fallen tree.  There have been many deputations led by me to the area committee meeting in Killarney and they have been supported by all of the area councillors.  My daughter Maura led a deputation last May, a meeting I also attended and at which I was a spokesperson.  People are very agitated and upset that the river has not been cleared.  In the early 1980s Jackie Healy-Rae brought locals in a deputation to meet Charles Haughey at the Gleneagle Hotel and the river was cleared at the time.  There were few problems for 25 or 27 years, up until nine or ten years ago.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, for coming to County Kerry last year when he saw for himself the problems in Glenflesk and other places in the county.  He gave an assurance to the elected Members in the Chamber that he would provide funding once Kerry County Council had made an application for it.  Last April the council applied for funding to clear half of the river.  That is why we had to have a second deputation to get agreement that the other half of the river would also be cleaned.  A total of &euro;168,000 is needed to clear the river from Gortahoosh bridge to Curreal bridge.  Rivers - the Flesk is no different - need to be cleared and maintained all of the time.  However, in the past 20 years landowners have not been able to touch any river because if they do, they will lose their farm payments.  This rule of cross-compliance has to be adhered to.  That is why the river is so bad again and affecting so many.  Houses cannot be lifted, but roads can.  The N22 was raised because it was being flooded.  However, even though it has already been raised by 10 ft, it is still being flooded to a height of 3 ft.  The river needs to be cleared.  That is what we are asking the Government to do.

In 2014, the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, amended our freedom of information legislation in ways which have helped to shine a light on the operation of politics and the spending of public money in the State.  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomed that legislation which was a positive move in circumstances in which we need to see the highest levels of accountability and transparency.  However, the then Minister exempted the Office of the President from such requests.  Constitutionally, the President is not answerable to the Houses of the Oireachtas or the courts, although this right is not absolute as the President can be investigated and impeached by the Oireachtas if need be.  Having said that, the President is answerable to the public and there is no reason the President should not make public what he or she does with public funds.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not believe there is any constitutional impediment to subjecting the Office of the President to freedom of information.  In reality, it would be an Accounting Officer or management in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in who would respond to freedom of information request, not the person holding presidential office.  Having information made publicly available about the expenses of the Office of the President and the President being answerable to the Oireachtas for what that information reveals are two different things.<\/p><p>The Freedom of Information Act is about transparency and that should exist in relation to the spending of all taxpayers' money.  The public has a right to know and, along with journalists and other organisations, to ask questions and get responses.  Since the Act has been in force, there have been numerous requests from journalists for information on spending by the Office of the President.  On each occasion a request has been made, it has been denied on foot of the exemption in the Act.  This is not about the incumbent or the person who currently holds the office.  It is about whether this should be the case.  This matter has arisen because of the work of the Committee of Public Accounts which examined recently the spend relating to the Office of the President's account.  One of the issues which arose was that the office was not subject to freedom of information.  That is not right.  The idea that millions of euro in public money received by the President is somehow exempt from public scrutiny is a throwback to the days in which public accountability was not seen in the right way.  There is a fundamental philosophical principle that the public has a right to information.  It is the people who put us into these positions and elect Presidents.  No information should be secret or kept from the public.  No information should be outside the purview of journalists, politicians and those whose responsibility it is to hold people to account.  That may be the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Committee of Public Accounts, the D&aacute;il, committees of the Houses, the courts or members of the public.<\/p><p>We all accept that there is a clear separation of powers between the President and the Oireachtas in respect of the President's role and duties.  However, there is no impediment to making the Office of the President and its spending subject to the Freedom of Information Act.  I do not know why Deputy Howlin exempted the Office of the President when he was Minister.  It may have been due to advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  In any event, it was wrong and it should be corrected.  This Bill is an opportunity to do that.  I appeal to parties across the House to support the Bill.  It is important.  There has been an issue of public scrutiny and people believe this should be subject to freedom of information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800017#P00800","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1539863100,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800017#P00900","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1539863100,"counter":196,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800017#P01000","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539863100,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1539863100,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800017#P01200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1539863100,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800017#P01300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539863100,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Dublin Transport Authority (Amendment) Bill 2018: First Stage","time":1539863100,"counter":201,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800017#P01500"},{"type":"speech","time":1539863100,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 to provide that no direct award public service contracts of public transport passenger services in excess of ten per cent of said service contracts currently entered into with a public transport operator, (and other than with Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann) shall take place until such time as a period of five years has elapsed from the date of commencement of said contracts and a full review of same has been carried out and to provide for related matters.<\/blockquote><p>I welcome the opportunity to present the Dublin Transport Authority (Amendment) Bill 2018 to the House.  The Bill is designed to prevent any additional privatisation of Dublin Bus routes pending a comprehensive review of the routes which have been privatised to date.  This is a prudent measure to prevent further privatisation in advance of a full determination of the impact of privatisation on service levels and public transport more generally.  Fianna F&aacute;il recognises the crucial role public transport plays in Irish life and that it must be promoted strongly.  Unfortunately, the Government has fallen well short over the last number of years with the result that there is now chronic overcrowding on all forms of public transport, including DART, Luas and Dublin Bus services.  If we are serious about getting people to move from the private car, we must be in a position to offer them an efficient, reliable and affordable service.<\/p><p>As matters stand, there are a number of public service obligation routes in Ireland.  These are routes which it is considered socially necessary to operate but which are not economically viable.  One contract is drawn up for the operation of all such routes within the greater Dublin area while another is drawn up for the operation of all such routes outside Dublin.  Currently, 90% of routes outside the greater Dublin area are automatically assigned to Bus &Eacute;ireann with a competitive tender for the remaining 10%.  Earlier this year, Go-Ahead won a proportion of these competitively tendered routes.  It must be acknowledged also that Bus &Eacute;ireann managed to hold onto some of the competitively tendered routes in this process.  Similarly, 90% of these routes in Dublin are assigned to Dublin Bus with a further 10% going to tender.  Go-Ahead won this 10% tender and commenced to operate a number of routes a few short weeks ago.  However, the National Transport Authority, or NTA, has the power to change this unilaterally whenever a contract falls to be renewed.  That stands at every five years currently.<\/p><p>The original decision to put 10% of routes out to public tender was taken to provide a comparative basis on which to ensure that we were getting value for money for the taxpayer and to determine whether the public transport was effective and efficient.  Fianna F&aacute;il does not believe the NTA should have unchecked powers to privatise any further bus routes.  As such, the Bill seeks to provide that no further privatisation should occur until a minimum of five years has elapsed since the original contracts were awarded.  At that point, a full review of these contracts should be presented to the D&aacute;il, which should then decide whether further routes should be contracted out.<\/p><p>This will ensure we have a full and open analysis of the impacts of the privatisation of the six existing routes to ensure we can have confidence in the level of service offered on our public transport.  We would not buy a car without checking its paperwork or NCT records, so why should we consider privatising one of our most important systems without ensuring we have checks on the existing routes that have been put out to tender?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800017#P01600","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539863700,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800018#Q00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1539863700,"counter":205,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800018#Q00300","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539863700,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1539863700,"counter":207,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800018#Q00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1539863700,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800018#Q00600","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539863700,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Competition Act 2002 (Section 27) Order 2018: Motion","time":1539863700,"counter":210,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800018#Q00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1539863700,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the following Order:Competition Act 2002 (Section 27) Order 2018,copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 3rd October, 2018.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800018#Q00900","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539863700,"counter":212,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Taxation Agreement: Motion (Resumed)","time":1539863700,"counter":213,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800018#Q01100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539863700,"counter":214,"content":"<p>The following motion was moved by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Michael D'Arcy, on Wednesday, 3 October 2018:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539863700,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Debated resumed on amendment No. 1:<\/p><p>- (Deputy Eamon Ryan)<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1539863700,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I must now deal with a postponed division relating to the motion regarding the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures Order 2018.

I welcome its passing and want to reflect on its importance and significance.  On a personal note and at a political level, it was one of the most important issues in which I had ever been involved.  I will never forget being in the count centre on 26 May when we received the excellent news.  I commend everybody involved in the Together for Yes campaign and this House, including the Minister who has a very strong record in dealing this issue.  It is important to give credit where it is due.  I want to mention, in particular, the activists in Carlow and Kilkenny who were involved in the Together for Yes campaign and thank them for all of the very important work they did.<\/p>  <p>  I want to make a few points about the legislation.  I hope there will not be any major delay in passing it in this House, particularly on the part of Deputies who may have had a different opinion or their own agenda.  Unfortunately, in the past people tried to delay the passage of legislation because there were matters on which they disagreed.  I hope the fact will be respected that the majority of people in the country voted \"Yes\"; they voted to repeal the eight amendment.  I hope, at the very least, their decision will be respected to ensure the legislation is passed in a timely manner.  During the debate on the referendum legislation we heard Members tell many stories in this Chamber of women who had to travel to England for an abortion or who had accessed abortion pills online.  That is still the reality for women today.  It is very important to bear this in mind to ensure the Bill will be passed as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I want to make a few comments on the 72-hour waiting period.  I would like to see it removed.  This is a very difficult decision that women make in conjunction with their partner, family or whoever they feel they want to consult.  It is not one they make lightly and I do not believe they will change their decision after the 72-hour waiting period.  Therefore, have such a requirement is unfair.  It is almost as if we are questioning women.  A woman will come and say this is what she wants to so, but she will then be told that there is a waiting period of 72 hours.  It is as if there is nearly an element of doubt about her decision.  This is a women's health matter.  Therefore, the requirement should be removed.<\/p><p>We also need to ensure that there are good, robust rules and regulations around respecting this legislation and respecting those attending clinics.  If there are protesters at such clinics, they cannot be allowed to intimidate or bully others.<\/p> <p> A Deputy on the Sinn F&eacute;in benches spoke in the Chamber last night and I want to put in on record that he does not reflect the Sinn F&eacute;in position on this issue.  We have an excellent spokesperson in Deputy O'Reilly who has always articulated our position very well.  I want to be completely clear that Deputy O'Reilly is our party spokesperson and nobody should be in any doubt about that.  Our policy is clear.  We sought the removal of the eighth amendment and now we want to see this legislation passing through the Houses in a timely manner.  We also want to see certain provisions like the 72 hour waiting period removed from the Bill.  I would like to see some guidelines issued regarding protesters and respect because we have seen many examples in England where women who travelled to clinics were intimidated and bullied.  It is nobody's business what a woman does with her body or what choices she makes about her health.  As I have said, most women do this in consultation with a partner or family members and it is not appropriate for anyone else to try to bully them into making a different decision.<\/p> <p> That is all I want to say on the matter.  Having made the point that we do not want to delay the passage of the legislation, I do not want to delay things further now.  I will finish by stressing the importance of this legislation.  It was amazing to see the referendum on the removal of the eighth amendment pass, and I was very glad to play my part in that, along with a lot of other people.  I appeal to Deputies - they know who they are because they have a history of delaying legislation in this D&aacute;il - to remember that nearly 70% of the people voted to repeal the eighth amendment and to respect that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800021#W00500","speaker":"1266","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539865500,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to make a few brief comments on the legislation.  This is an issue that has polarised Ireland for many generations.  It is very difficult for many of us and very personal to most of us.  I am grateful to my party for laying out a pathway six years ago in terms of respecting the right of conscience and allowing Deputies to act according to their personal views on this issue.  Indeed, the Fine Gael Party and other parties followed suit in terms of respecting that and providing for a free vote on an issue that has polarised society for many generations.<\/p>  <p>  I was a No voter.  I chose not to campaign, preferring to leave it to civil society groups to advocate the various sides of the argument.  I felt that they were best placed and best qualified to do so and, for the most part, they did it very well.  The referendum campaigners were very respectful in the main, as were the debates in this House, but less so in the media at times.  There were aspects of media that got very evocative in their writings on behalf of both sides, as opposed to the individual protagonists themselves, and that was regrettable.  As I said, I voted No and the outcome of the referendum saddens me.  My position is not based on church teaching, political expediency or anything other than my personal judgment and thoughts on it.  I have profound respect for everybody with the totally opposite view and I respect that they have come to their position based on their personal analysis of the facts and their own morality.  That is fine.<\/p>  <p>  Given the outcome of the referendum, the people have spoken clearly.  I had hoped to be in a position to separate my personal view on this issue from my legislative responsibilities.  I know that the people voted in substantial numbers to repeal the eighth amendment and on legislation that was broadly reflected in the heads of Bill that were presented in March, as opposed to those that were presented in July.  I stated after the campaign that I would support the legislation but, sadly, I have been struggling with my conscience on this issue and I am not sure that I can do so.  I look forward to the Committee Stage debate and hope to engage in the process, but I have particular concerns about the conscientious objection of doctors.  While I know it is dealt with in the Bill in part, it is not as clear as it could be.  There is the potential to lay down in legislation the provision of appropriate services and the entitlement to such services, including counselling.<\/p>  <p>  As things stand, I do not think I will be able to vote in favour of this legislation on Second Stage.  I acknowledge that this is contrary to what I said after the referendum.  At that time I said that I would have to separate my personal view from my legislative responsibilities, but I am afraid I do not think that I can.  This is borne out of fear, quite frankly.  I fear that this will become the contraceptive of choice for people down the line; not today, next week or even next year, but in time.  Abortion will become something that is the norm rather than for the hard cases.  That is a concern for me.  That said, I will not be obstructing the legislation.  I hope to play my part on Committee Stage and to express my views on various amendments.  I certainly do not want to obstruct or unnecessarily delay the Bill's passage.  I want to put on record that having said that I wanted to respect the democratic outcome of the referendum, I am afraid that my conscience may not permit me to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800022#X00200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1539865500,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill today.  There is no doubt that this Bill, regardless of one's position on it, will go down in history and will be spoken about for many years to come.  Hundreds of people were here last night to express their serious concerns about this legislation.  I am conscious of the fact that people have strongly held views on both sides and we must respect that.  Since I have been elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann I have been careful to ensure that, while I have my personal view, I have always been willing to talk to people from both sides of the argument.  That has led some people to abuse me online but that has happened to Deputies on both sides and we have to accept it, given our position.  In the interests of covering every aspect of this Bill, I have spoken to members of the public from both sides.  I have also spoken to social workers who have a lot of experience in supporting vulnerable women facing difficult pregnancies.  They are very concerned about the lack of protection for vulnerable women in the Bill as drafted.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that this Bill addresses issues that are difficult for many people to discuss.  Abortion can be a divisive issue and has been thus for many years.  I do not take issue with people's stance on this, provided they are open, honest and do not shy away from making their voice heard.  I agree with many of my colleagues on both sides of the debate who have called for a respectful and reasoned debate.  As my colleague, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said earlier this year, if one does not stand for anything, one will fall for everything.  Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion on this topic.  I respect the fact that the people have spoken through their vote in the referendum to repeal the eighth amendment.  I am not standing up to try to change anyone's mind but I am standing up to protect and promote the right of all mothers to receive the genuine support to which they are entitled.<\/p>  <p>  Many people who voted Yes in the referendum were acting in the interests of choice and compassion for women facing unexpected and challenging pregnancies, but they are not necessarily on board with the more extreme aspects of the Bill before the D&aacute;il today.  Exit polls showed that many Yes voters had very serious concerns that they hoped would be addressed to have a reasonable, restrictive regime put in place.  These specific issues must be addressed through amendments to the Bill.<\/p><p>It should be noted that the Minister declared in the Chamber in March that he would not debate the details of the draft heads of the Bill because the people would not vote on the Bill but on the removal of the eighth amendment.  The Referendum Commission stated, in its booklet, as confirmed in the High Court during the summer, that people were not being asked to vote on any legislation as there was no guarantee the proposed legislation would ever come to pass.  Therefore, to claim the Irish people have voted on this legislation and no deviation from these proposals can be allowed is to speak out of both sides of the same mouth.  It is also extremely disrespectful of the democratic process.  The Irish people are entitled to have the legislation that comes before the House debated.  There is too much at stake to rush this Bill through the D&aacute;il with undue haste, which is the approach the Minister seems to favour.<\/p> <p> It is also important to note there are a number of areas of major difference between what the people were led to believe before the referendum and what is proposed in the legislation.  The Minister repeatedly stressed that early delivery would be mandated after viability, yet the Bill makes no mention of early delivery and instead allows for the deliberate ending of a baby's life at any point in the nine months of pregnancy in certain cases.  The Irish people did not vote for that.  It was stressed that unborn babies would be protected against discrimination on the grounds of disability.  I can find no such protection in the Bill.  The Minister owes it to the Irish people to add those protections about which he spoke.<\/p> <p> Irish people were not told their taxes would fund procedures that will end the most innocent lives in homes, abortion clinics or hospitals.  We now know that a poll in August suggested 60% of Irish people are opposed to their taxes paying for abortions.  How much will it cost the State?  Will it be &euro;12 million or &euro;20 million?<\/p> <p> Additionally some sections of the Bill have already been amended by the Minister to widen the grounds on which abortion would be legal and available and reduce the protections for vulnerable babies and healthcare workers.  I am specifically referring to the redefinition of the term \"viability\" to exclude life-sustaining medical treatment to which a premature, wanted baby would be entitled, to require that a baby with a life-limiting condition be likely to live for 28 days after birth and to narrow the grounds for conscientious objection.  This Bill does not legislate for restrictive grounds for abortion beyond 12 weeks, as many were led to believe it would.  It does not contain many of the protections the Minister promised Irish people it would contain for healthcare workers, vulnerable babies or mothers.<\/p> <p> Irish people were not asked to, and did not, vote on this extreme legislation and there is no obligation on any Member of this House to put his or her name to a Bill that so utterly disregards the lives of the most vulnerable members of our human family and so dismally fails to provide genuine support for mothers or freedom of conscience for healthcare workers.<\/p> <p> Prior to the referendum, I made the point that if we offer abortions instead of real support services and compassion to pregnant mothers, we are failing those pregnant mothers and their unborn children.  I still stand strongly by this point.  In order to provide adequate support services and compassion to pregnant women, we need to consider the following points.  An important question is whether there will be a three-day or a 72-hour cooling off period.  For example, if a woman visits her doctor on Monday evening at 6 p.m., under a three-day cooling off period, she will be able to have her termination at 9 a.m. on the following Wednesday because under the three-day cooling off rule, the day of the doctor's visit and the day of the termination are both considered one of the three days.  Under the rule, therefore, a woman may only have to wait 39 hours before her termination.  It is important that every woman is given a minimum of 72 hours from the time she visits her doctor until she makes her final decision and a termination is carried out.  This is where the supports I mentioned are vital for a pregnant woman.  It is clear that, after a woman visits a doctor to discuss termination, she should have a minimum of 72 hours to digest the information given to her by her doctor and to contact any support service that may be able to help her access choices available to her.<\/p> <p> During the cooling off period, I also suggest that a booklet be provided to all women with unbiased information on all her choices, all support services available and any other information that is relevant to pregnancy and termination.  It is vital that any girl under the age of 18 be accompanied by a parent or guardian if she is seeking a termination.  We do not allow the sale of alcohol and cigarettes to persons under 18 for their own protection and, for a girl under 18 to make a decision in respect of termination, it is vital she is accompanied by a parent or guardian for her own protection and support.  <\/p> <p> My main concern continues to be the protection of all mothers.  A free counselling service should be made available to all mothers who are facing unexpected or challenging pregnancies and in particular for those women considering termination and post-abortion support for those women who have terminations.  If women are to be adequately cared for, support services must be widely advertised and fully funded with ring-fenced moneys.  <\/p> <p> If the health service is to cope with the upcoming demand for terminations, safeguards need to be put in place to ensure the care of other patients is not compromised.  There are already huge waiting lists in the country.  A person could wait for five years for a simple procedure like a 15-minute cataract procedure.  It is vital the Government provides an adequate level of funding and resources to meet the future demand of terminations and also that other waiting lists do not get longer as a result of this Government not supplying adequate resources.  <\/p> <p> If a woman is seeking a termination on mental health grounds, one of the doctors involved must be a psychiatric doctor, a comprehensive mental health assessment must be completed and appropriate mental health supports must be provided before any decision is made and following any termination provided.  We all heard the shocking figure that one in every five pregnancies in Britain ends in abortion.  The vast majority of those, 98%, are performed on the grounds of mental health.  Either the UK has a mental health crisis of epidemic proportions among pregnant women or that ground is being widely abused.  Section 10 of the Bill provides for grounds that are extremely similar to the grounds used in Britain.  It is imperative that protections are included to protect against similar abuse of those grounds here and to ensure pregnant women with genuine mental health concerns are identified and supported.<\/p> <p> Accurate dating of the pregnancy must be carried out with ultrasound equipment as one measure by a medical practitioner.  This is vital to protect both mothers and doctors against the medical, legal and life-threatening complications that can arise from inaccurate dating of pregnancy.  <\/p> <p> Protections also need to be placed in this legislation for the unborn child.  For example, with all the recent outrage over the Tuam babies, some of whom are reported to have died before birth, there can surely be no objection to an amendment that will require the remains of terminated babies to be treated with respect.  There should be respectful arrangements with regards to burial.  <\/p> <p> As the Government seems determined to ensure most women terminating their pregnancies do so at home, consideration must also be given to how the tiny babies&rsquo; bodies are delivered and taken care of thereafter.<\/p> <p> We need also to address the harrowing scenario of babies who are born alive after a failed abortion.  All necessary care should be given to the baby.  This should go without saying, but we know in many other countries where abortion is legal babies born alive during failed abortions are all too often left to die alone and uncared for.<\/p> <p> It is also of note that the Minister has taken it upon himself to completely redefine how the term \"termination of pregnancy\" is understood in our health system.  Currently our medical guidelines acknowledge that it may occasionally be necessary to perform a termination of pregnancy where a mother&rsquo;s life is at risk, while giving the baby a chance.  This Bill now clearly redefines \"termination of pregnancy\" as a medical procedure intended to end the life of a foetus.  While it is occasionally medically necessary to end a pregnancy to protect a mother&rsquo;s life or health, it is never medically necessary to intentionally terminate the life of a child.  Early delivery must always be mandated beyond viability and babies born alive must always be given necessary medical treatment to give them a chance to live.<\/p><p>The Minister's Bill would more accurately be titled the Regulation of Termination of Life Bill as it currently stands.<\/p> <p> Protection also needs to be put in place for anyone involved in any activity linked to termination.  I believe, in line with international practice in many countries, medical practitioners such as doctors, midwives, pharmacists and also any other persons such as cleaners etc. should be allowed the decision on conscientious grounds whether or not to be directly involved or indirectly involved in any services that support terminations.  Some medical professionals have approached me and expressed their concern that they would be indirectly involved in a termination if they referred a patient for a termination.  There is a system in New Zealand which is an opt-out regime.  Those willing to provide a direct or indirect service that links them to termination could opt in.  I feel this would be more respectful for anyone working in the medical profession.  Writing into law a positive right to freedom of conscience would be the best approach to guarantee the desired outcome.  As I said earlier, I am not here to change any voter's mind on the decision voters made on the eighth amendment to the Constitution but I want to ensure that life-affirming choices are incentivised and also to ensure that women will not feel under pressure to terminate.<\/p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Harris, seem to be extremely concerned that cost will never be a barrier to accessing terminations but if he truly wants to support women then will he ensure that cost will never be a barrier to a woman continuing a pregnancy or raising her child?  In light of the fact that the Oireachtas committee noted that the majority of terminations were for socioeconomic reasons, and had nothing to do with rape or life limiting conditions, this is even more crucial.  I want to make it clear that while I am opposed to much of the contents of this Bill and will be voting against it, I intend to support reasonable amendments as I respect the people have spoken.  As I said earlier, I did my best not to direct any hit at any party or group here but I am disappointed, especially in one political party which did its best to stop somebody from speaking and even criticised that person who was speaking here today.  That same party was censored from speaking for many years in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800022#X00300","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539866700,"counter":237,"content":"<p>Like women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800024#Z00200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1539866700,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Exactly.

This year, as previously noted, we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the extension of the franchise and votes for women over 30 who were ratepayers.  We have thankfully come a long way since then to this legislation, which follows the repeal of the eighth amendment, which was wrong in 1983 and in 2017.  I am pleased to see that we as a society have, through the ballot, expressed our desire to see changes that will actually allow women, men and families control over their fertility in a way that is appropriate to their individual and family circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  It is possibly an accident of history that this week, the report, Clann: Ireland's Unmarried Mothers and their Children: Gathering the Data, was published.  Anyone who has doubts about the importance and significance of this legislation and what happened to women who were unable to avail of any form of contraception, up to 40 years ago, where they had liaisons and relationships outside of marriage, will see that they had no capacity to control their own fertility.  Instead, what happened in this society, as with many other issues, is that they became one of our hidden secrets.  They were shut away in mother and baby homes, laundries, orphanages and other institutions.  It has only been in the last 20 years that many people, including women and their children, boys and girls who are now men and women, have been able to come forward to find out some of their own history and address some of the issues that arose in post-Famine Ireland.  I do not know if the absolute catastrophe of the Famine changed Irish culture.  We became an island of incarceration for women who had children and relationships outside of a recognised framework, which is to say that they were not married in a Catholic or Protestant church.  Therefore they became social outcasts and, as has been identified in this report and others, the critical social control lever that was exercised was shame.  It was shame for the women, children and their families in their local districts and areas.  That was why a parish priest could come up, figuratively tap someone on the shoulder and send someone to take the woman away by car or a hackney, with her baby.<\/p>  <p>  At times, due to the kindness and care of families, the women could go home but the babies did not.  In many cases, the women were incarcerated, effectively for the rest of their lives.  When I went to school in Stanhope Street in Dublin, I ended up, through my adoptive mother, going to visit what was, to me as a small child, a really horrifying laundry full of large machinery where women worked.  \"Worked\" is not a proper description, but \"slaved\" is.  They had no autonomy.  I remember one woman who visited us every Tuesday evening.  She did not even have a child.  It was her misfortune that her father became a widower and busybodies, very often on behalf of local churches, ensured that children such as that could be taken away.  This was a woman in her 40s or 50s.  After we got a television, she became very fond of some of the programmes on it because they did not have that in the convent, in the laundry.  No matter what was on, whether \"The Riordans\" or something else, I remember clearly that though she was a grown woman, she had to be back at the convent by 9.30 p.m.  I know trainee teachers were treated the same in places like Carysfort, and possibly the male teachers in Drumcondra, probably up to the late 1960s.  There is a social story here about the Ireland that we were.<\/p>  <p>  Much of the debate on the 1983 referendum was a fraud.  It was designed to deny an open secret.  In other words, it was a secret that everybody knew about if they were old enough.  If they were younger, they maybe listened to the chat around the kitchen and got to know about such things.  What is really sad and significant in these stories is that no matter how often one reads or hears them, they remain a monument to the sadness and tragedy that one group of Irish people visited on another group of Irish people.  They probably, for the most part, did not intend to be as cruel as much of it was but they were told that somehow this type of behaviour, locking people up, was consistent with a certain form of Christianity.<\/p><p>The only explanation I have, at a social level, is that this was partly an outcome of the disaster of the Famine in Ireland and also being a colonial country where, in effect, we shut down certain things and closed them off.<\/p> <p> Turning to the Bill, as other speakers have said, we owe a debt of thanks to all of the doctors, midwives and others involved in women having babies, delivering them safely and going on to have a family and a home life where those babies are cherished and loved.  We have that in our maternity hospitals in Ireland, but one element of the services is absent and the Bill is seeking to address that.  In that sense, in terms of the rights of women now and in the future, it is important that we pass this legislation.<\/p> <p> Points have been made by various Deputies about areas where the legislation could be improved and issues that need to be addressed, including having a detailed debate on conscientious objection.  Such debate is good.  I welcome any insights people have to bring that would allow us to make the legislation as good as we possibly can.  I also welcome the constructive tone of many of the contributions by people whom I am aware did not vote to repeal the eighth amendment.  I have also encountered many people who were opposed to repealing the eighth amendment.  Quite a few of them asked me to speculate on the reason the vote was so overwhelming.  One woman approached me and said: \"Joan, what is all this stuff on RT&Eacute; about older people being completely opposed to repeal?\"  She then pointed to her husband, who is 84 - she is 83 &ndash; said that they have five granddaughters, and that they did not want any of them to be in a situation where they felt obliged either to take the boat to England or to face some kind of uncertain future in terms of having a baby in circumstances in which they are not able to proceed with the pregnancy.<\/p> <p> What many of the critics of repeal have failed to understand is how practices have changed, so that for the most part we are not talking about surgical abortion or, except in grave situations where the life or health of the mother is threatened or the life of the baby, and the tragedy of fatal foetal abnormality.  The latter scenario has affected several people I know who have desperately wanted a baby but it was not to be.  We are now talking about medical termination.  Let us be clear what that means.  I am very grateful to the various doctors and midwives who took part in so many small meetings in houses, community centres and workplaces throughout the country explaining the current custom and practice in maternal care in the context of termination services.  I approve of the Minister's arrangement that Dr. Peter Boylan would be available to look at the maternity services in that specific area.  That is very important.<\/p> <p> One thing that is very worrying is the severely limited availability of scans and MRI technology in many areas outside of Dublin.  That is wrong.  The budget needs to be progressed in that area in order that people will have as much information as possible, with the objective for the most part of having a healthy, viable baby.<\/p> <p> We also need realistic education in schools so that, in particular if teenagers fall pregnant in a situation where they are unable to cope with the pregnancy, they are empowered with the knowledge to get the best care and attention as soon as they can.  That is the key to the provision of appropriate services in Ireland that are genuinely available to all women, and to young women in particular who, in the event of not having had an appropriate sex education, are able to access services in a timely way.  The discussions have started on the school curriculum and I hope it is realistic in terms of issues that are likely to face young men and young women as they enter into sexual relationships as they mature.  That is very important.  We need a national conversation in that respect that gives people the knowledge they need to be able to deal with their own decisions in terms of relationships as they grow older.  They must be aware of the risks.  Many colleges are now doing a lot of education around relationships and consent and the fact that no means no.  We can empower young people to be able to both look after themselves and protect themselves and, should they need services, that they know how to access them as early as possible.<\/p> <p> It is a milestone for women in Ireland that we will finally have a full service available to women within the not-too-distant future that will support them in the independent lives they wish to lead.  It is ironic that during the referendum campaign I met more people who, sadly, had issues around infertility, and they were very anxious to be supported by the State.  Nowadays, partly because of the housing situation but also because of social changes, people are getting married and forming permanent relationships later and later.  If they want to start a family, very often they must first find appropriate housing to buy, rent or lease and then they must have sufficient resources to be able to bring up a family.  That means a lot of pregnancies in Ireland are among women in their late 30s, and that trend is likely to continue for at least the next five years because I do not see a significant number of houses and apartments becoming available for rent or purchase at reasonable rates under current Government policy.<\/p> <p> Many of the pregnancies in Ireland are much-wanted pregnancies and one of the distressing parts of the recent debate was the discussions on fatal foetal abnormality.  Most Deputies are aware either from family circumstances, friends or others they know of much-wanted pregnancies having to be terminated, the tragedy of having to go to England, for example, Liverpool or London, and bringing home the baby's remains, if they are lucky, in a cardboard box on the ferry.<\/p><p>It is a tragic circumstance.  As one young woman put it to me, at a time when she most wanted her family around her she could not have them because they could not go to Liverpool with her.  Her partner could go, obviously, but they wanted one of their mothers or an aunt to come with them and maybe one of their fathers to drive them.  They wanted family members to be there to hold them at a very difficult time in their lives.  I hope the people in our maternity hospitals will now be able to do that, perhaps under the direct care of the physicians they were dealing with during the period when they had hoped it would be a successful pregnancy.  They could then get appropriate treatment and would be able to go home as soon as possible to their own beds and mourn their baby.<\/p> <p> I have been approached by people who wanted to find a burial place for the baby.  Unfortunately, burial plots in Dublin are difficult to get.  Many of the Dublin cemeteries will not allow people to pre-buy and we do not necessarily entirely recognise a fatal foetal abnormality like a baby that was delivered in the end.  These are all the little practical things that happen to people in this sad situation.<\/p> <p> I am really pleased the Bill has come before the House.  The Minister and the Taoiseach gave an undertaking that this would be addressed as quickly as possible.  The people who voted in the referendum understood that clearly and expected it.  I congratulate the Government on bringing forward the legislation so quickly.  I hope that it will be possible to put into place the appropriate training, practices and changes in the HSE that will be required.  It will be a major change in terms of what our maternity hospitals and institutions will be doing.  I really hope it will be possible to do this in the maternity hospitals and institutions.<\/p> <p> The whole issue of exclusion is relevant.  In the past, if a woman had a baby outside of wedlock or if she was in a relationship that was not a marriage relationship there was a sense of exclusion.  I believe we have managed to end that sense of exclusion and now treat people when they need treatment within our ordinary health and maternity services.  In due course I believe that will help.  Again, going back to families who have experienced fatal foetal abnormalities, there is hope that if they have a subsequent pregnancy, the pregnancy will come to a successful conclusion with a baby being born to the couple.<\/p> <p> I welcome, and the Labour Party strongly supports, the legislation.  Nevertheless, we will pay detailed attention to any proposals for amendments and issues that require to be addressed.  Presumably, these will be discussed in detail on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800024#Z00500","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539867900,"counter":243,"content":"<p>N&iacute; chuirfidh m&eacute; an iomarca moille ar an Teach mar tuigim go bhfuil deifir orainn.

It is put very eloquently in English in the draft Bill which states: \"\"termination of pregnancy\", in relation to a pregnant woman, means a medical procedure which is intended to end the life of a foetus\".  That is a very interesting sentence for many reasons and in the context of the debates that have taken place here over many years.

I will not disclose how she was thinking of voting in the referendum; that is her business.

She told me that her mother had had a tricky heart problem and, as far as I can recall, that she had been born at either 23 or 24 weeks, which was extraordinary in the early 1940s.  She told me that the doctor who was well known had told her mother that there was no way the baby could survive, but she did.  I heard the Deputy opposite.  I will check with the woman concerned, but I am sure that that is what she said.  She received very skilled care, of that I have no doubt, but the basis of the story was that even though the doctor had thought the baby did not have a chance and would die, to save the mother, he intervened.

They believe we cannot equate a born person with an unborn person, even if the born person is only one second old and the unborn person is within one second of being born.  That is their dividing line; so be it.  That is their belief.  I do not in any way question anybody's belief, but I do not understand the reason others cannot see that the other belief is equally reasonable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800027#CC00500","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1539868500,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800027#CC00600","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1539868500,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Just because someone is behind a piece of skin and fed in a different way does not make him or her any less of a human being.

Knowing that they will not do that, the Minister will get his Bill through the House without any difficulty.

They are issues for Committee and Report Stages.  We can deal with them one by one.  There is one interesting amendment that caught my eye.  The Bill uses the term \"pregnant woman\" and says that \"woman\" means a female person.  This seems to be a strange term to use in view of the fact that we have various genders and transgenders and so on.  The Minister should correct that because it is out of line with other legislation we have brought in.  It is unnecessary terminology in the circumstances.  It goes against a European court ruling that allows people to be recognised by their gender and whatever.  I happened to be the Minister with responsibility for social protection when we started to deal with the European court judgment and I instructed that the legislation be prepared.<\/p>  <p>  Our maternity services have been at stretching point for a number of years.  We saw some terrible things happen as a consequence.  The public deserves very caring, well-funded maternity and obstetrics care.  We have seen recently in another scandal in the treatment of women's health how important that is.  If there was &euro;12 million there all along, it is deeply regrettable that it was not made available three, four or five years ago to deal with all of the challenges faced in the maternity hospitals, including the maternity hospital in Galway.  I hope this Bill will not add to the crisis levels that seem to arise regularly in our maternity hospitals as a result of pressure on them.  I also hope the Minister will make resources available for those who need either obstetric or gynaecological care, which are so important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800028#DD00300","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1539869100,"counter":260,"content":"<p>The referendum took place and the people spoke.  There has been a protracted debate on abortion down through the years, even when we were youngsters.  The issue caused great differences of opinion between people.  Ireland has changed a good bit since then, considering the votes that took place before.  I do not think anyone questions the numbers in the referendum, the 66% or 67%.  The Irish people spoke unanimously to remove the eighth amendment from the Constitution.  That has to be recognised.  I do not think there is a Deputy who does not recognise the vote.  However, there is one other thing that also needs to be recognised.  I watched the debate between the presidential candidates last night.  It was the only night so far that the candidates sparred with each other, which is not good in any debate.  No matter what side we are on, as the previous Deputy said, people are entitled to different views.  There is 34% of the population who still believe what they believed.  They are entitled to that belief and we must recognise it, as we must also recognise those who voted \"Yes\".  There is an obligation on every one of us as public representatives to do that.  Respect is needed on all sides.<\/p>  <p>  A budget will put in place for abortion services.  We should ensure services are free for all women who are expecting a child, whether they want to go ahead and have the child or want to have an abortion, if that is the road we are going down at the moment.  People need to be given the choice, as the people of Ireland have decided.  That should be done as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Looking at other parts of our health service, I do not want to hear in one, two or three years' time that somebody could not get a counsellor or anyone to talk to.  I see in mental health services at the moment that we have lovely glossy magazines about what we are going to do for people.  There is talk about community care teams but unfortunately some people do not get the services described in the glossy booklet.  I ask the Minister to make sure the services are put in place in the way of counsellors and people giving advice so we do not have people saying in a year or two that this or that did not happen.<\/p>  <p>  On my way up this morning, I was listening to a debate on the radio.  There was a person talking about schools, parents and youngsters.  They were on about Facebook, Snapchat and all the different things and saying how parents need to make sure to keep an eye.  They were on about bullying and online abuse and saying the parents need to keep tabs on a lot of these things.  I hope it does not happen but if there is a 13 or 14 year old who decides she wants to have an abortion, what is the scenario?  This is not clear from what I have read and I would like the Minister to give us clarification on that.<\/p>  <p>  No more than anyone else, I do not claim to be an expert but I have met health service professionals such as local doctors, midwives and even consultants working in all parts of the health service.  I am fairly tough skinned but the other evening I met some of them and I found the meeting touching enough.  Some of these people feel they are being boxed into a corner.  If someone wants an abortion, the facilities need to be available.  However, I cannot understand why we do not first provide a helpline or phone number.  The Department or the HSE should know all the different doctors and places in every county that would be prepared to carry out an abortion.  It should be done without forcing those who have a belief that they cannot do this.  That message was coming across very strongly the other night and we need to work around that.  We cannot afford to lose too many from the health service.  That is the first thing.<\/p><p>Some of them were in tears when I met them the other night.  They are adamant that they will not stay in a service where they have to do it.  They are not saying it cannot happen.  They just do not want to be forced to do something that is totally against their beliefs.  While I am not a legal expert, we need to work around that in case down the line someone decides they are not going to be forced into something.  Where does it go if someone refuses to do it?  We know that the HSE cannot get rid of somebody for no reason.  Some of these people are talking about leaving, which is very unfortunate to hear.  These are good people.  It is important to find some solution to that.  The Minister may have better ideas.  I suggest having a helpline that is advertised everywhere, including on television, in newspapers, online etc. so that people can just make one quick phone call and know who is prepared to look after it in the different counties.  That may be a workable solution.  I do not say it is the only one.  There may be better ideas for doing that.<\/p> <p> The Minister spoke about the disability issue before the referendum.  We also need clarification on that.  I will not stay here talking.  The previous speaker mentioned people trying to hold up the legislation.  I am not into that.  It was rightly pointed out that there are ways of doing things if the Government wants to get it through.  People recognise that abortion will happen in Ireland.  It will be carried out in hospitals or in whatever scenario the Minister sets up for it.  We need to ensure healthcare professionals are not forced into something.  If that happens, it is not a great way of doing it.  I ask the Minister to come back to us with clarification on those points.  I will not take up any more of the Minister's time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800028#DD00400","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539869700,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I sincerely thank all Deputies, regardless of their perspective, who contributed to the Second Stage debate on the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018.

I was just making the point that, as the people's representatives, everybody has had ample opportunity, as is right and proper in this House, to give their views.  I thank all Deputies for giving those views.<\/p>  <p>  I also make the point that it is 146 days since the people voted to repeal the eighth amendment.  It is important that we do not forget what has happened in that time.  We know that, every day, about nine women leave our country to go abroad to access termination.  These are women in crisis looking for help that they cannot get in Ireland today.  In addition, every day about three women will take the abortion pill, obtained online without any medical supervision or advice.  That is roughly 12 women every single day since the referendum passed who have continued to have to access termination in either dangerous circumstances or abroad.  As we have the luxury of sitting in this House today, nine women are in our airports and ports heading off to the UK or other jurisdictions.  That means that 1,752 Irish women - our mothers, sisters, wives, neighbours and friends - have had to access termination since the people voted to repeal the eighth amendment.<\/p>  <p>  While we have an important job to do to make this, as Deputy Burton rightly said, the best possible Bill we can pass in this House, we must also be conscious that the reality of women in crisis pregnancy continues today.  Until we pass the legislation, the instruction the people gave us to get on with and do our job is an instruction we have yet to fulfil fully.<\/p>  <p>  Only this week I received a very heartbreaking email from a woman with fatal foetal abnormality in her pregnancy.  This was a desperately wanted baby.  She pleaded with me to see if I could do something to help her and her husband to ease what is already such tragedy and pain.  The harsh reality is that until this legislation passes, we are not in a position to do that.  Those sitting here need to realise that we cannot decouple the scrutinising we need to do from the reality facing women today.  That woman is sitting at home today knowing that even though the people have voted to repeal, she will still have to travel abroad because doctors who really want to help her here cannot do it until we pass this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Deputies rightly say that the people only voted on the question of whether to repeal the eighth amendment.  That was the question.  Of course, the chairperson of the referendum commission was right.  I believe I, myself, said it on a number of occasions.  The people voted either for or against repeal; that was their decision.  However, they voted in the context of knowing what legislation I would introduce if they voted to repeal the eighth amendment.  Those who campaigned against repeal highlighted elements of the Bill and quoted elements of the Bill on posters, in my view often distorted elements of the Bill.  We had debates in television studios, radio stations and community halls.  We had literature from both sides dealing with the content of that draft legislation.  While it is accurate to say that the people's decision was to repeal or not to repeal, it is important to say that the people made that decision in the context of a very detailed debate, following the excellent work of a cross-party committee and the excellent work of the Citizens' Assembly.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore the legislation we are introducing now is not a surprise.  It is what we promised to do.  There is an onus on me as Minister - I would argue there is an onus on all of us in this House - to legislate within those parameters.  I am sure people on both sides of the argument will want to see changes.  We should consider each and every amendment; that is our job.  I will approach the debate feeling a huge responsibility to introduce a Bill along the lines of what we promised we would do.  We told the people if they voted to repeal, this is the legislation I would introduce and that is the task we now have.<\/p>  <p>  I sincerely recognise that there are deeply held views on all sides of the Oireachtas and throughout the country.  In taking the next steps as an Oireachtas and as a Government, we must respect and hear them all.  However, language is important and insightful.  We have had many excellent contributions, including from speakers with a completely different view from mine.  Deputy Butler gave a very eloquent and honest speech in this House last night.  As a woman who had campaigned against repeal, she was very upfront about her views while also recognising the reality of the people's decision.  She made a very important contribution last night.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, some people talking about the issue in this House are using language that gives an insight to a mindset that is worrying.  I wrote down a few phrases I heard today.  I heard reference to \"those women\".  I have heard reference to \"a cooling-off period\".  I heard an horrific and bizarre suggestion that termination will replace contraception.  These sorts of views are offensive, but are also ignorant.  They show a lack of understanding of the very difficult decision-making process a woman goes through before accessing termination.  To equate in any way termination to contraception shows a fundamental lack of respect for women.  It also shows a fundamental lack of understanding about termination and contraception.<\/p>  <p>  As we go to the next Stage of the Bill, which I hope we will in the next few days, it is important that we all use language that is respectful.<\/p><p>They are not &quot;those women&quot;.  They are women from every town and every community in this country who are looking for help in a crisis.  We need to be very careful we do not use language that stigmatises, and I ask that we reflect on that.<br\/><br\/>I assure Deputies I have listened carefully to the contributions made so far.  I am pleased to note that, in general, there is very significant support for the Bill in the House, although I recognise there is far from unanimous support.  I am mindful, however, that issues have been raised around certain provisions in the legislation and I look forward to Committee Stage, when we will be able to discuss and address these concerns in much greater depth.  I am aware, for example, that some Deputies expressed a concern that the term &quot;abortion&quot; is not used in the Bill.  I want to address that issue because I think it important.  The reason is that this is the result of the wording inserted into the Constitution by the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Act 2018.  That amendment inserted a new Article 40.3.3&deg; into the Constitution which states: &quot;Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy&quot;.  Therefore, this Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill is the means by which the Oireachtas will exercise its new constitutional authority under the new provision.  In this way, the Oireachtas is carrying out the will of the people as expressed in the result of the referendum.  Using the language of the new Article 40.3.3&deg; in the legislation that seeks to give effect to this provides necessary consistency and clarity in law.  What I am doing in the Bill is mirroring the language used in the new constitutional article.  That is why we use the terminology in regard to &quot;termination of pregnancy&quot; rather than &quot;abortion&quot;.  It ensures that the Bill is consistent with the wording in the Constitution and avoids any potential doubts or unintended consequences which could potentially flow from departing from that language.  It is for that reason, rather than for any other reason.<br\/><br\/>I am aware some disquiet was expressed around the positioning of the offences provision in the Bill.  Again, I get this: people pick up the legislation and one of the first things they see are the offences.  I have heard the sincere views of Deputies that this could create a chilling effect.  The general scheme of the Bill published in July provided for offences in head 19 but the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, when it drafted the Bill in three parts, decided that under this arrangement offences are in the first part of the Bill.  I want to clarify that this section is based on Part 1 of the Bill for purely technical consideration by drafters, as opposed to any policy or political decision.  There was no other reason for placing it there and certainly no symbolic consideration behind it.  It is something I am happy to look at with Deputies as we move forward.<br\/><br\/>Several Deputies raised the issue of safe access to services and I thank them for doing so.  As they are aware, it is my intention that, following the passage of this Bill, services for termination of pregnancy will be a normal and lawful part of the Irish public health service for women.  I recognise, however, that these services carry a significant likelihood of demonstrations taking place, demonstrations which may be distressing and upsetting both for service users and for healthcare professionals.  I am concerned we have already had maternity hospitals like the Rotunda having to take to their social media channels to alert women to this very upsetting situation happening outside the hospital.  When a woman is accessing a maternity service, and going into a maternity hospital either to have a baby or to deal with a crisis pregnancy situation, that woman and her family deserve to be able to access those services in a way that does not further add to their distress or pain.<br\/><br\/>I believe we need to act in this regard.  Many countries providing abortion services have included provision for safe access to those services in their legislation.  In July I sought and received Government approval to draft legislative proposals to ensure safe access to premises in which termination of services may be provided.  This would allow patients, service providers, healthcare staff and members of the public to enter the premises without fear of intimidation or harassment, and without being subject to unwanted communications about termination of pregnancy by any means.  This would include oral, written or visual displays like the ones we were subjected to during the referendum campaign.  While it was my original intention to provide for such safe access in this Bill, a number of issues were identified during the drafting process.  In order to allow for full consideration, I decided we could not delay this Bill and that the best way to proceed would be a separate companion piece of legislation.  I, therefore, requested and was granted Government approval to draft a separate general scheme of a Bill to provide for safe access to services which may provide termination of pregnancy procedures.  Work on this companion legislation will be concluded without delay and, I hope, will be in place by early next year.<br\/><br\/>Another issue that has been the subject of concern by some Deputies is that of conscientious objection and the drafting of section 23 of the Bill.  Some Deputies have suggested the Bill should not require doctors or midwives to refer a woman on for care where they have a conscientious objection to providing termination of pregnancy services.  I would like to point out very clearly, because, frankly, there has been a lot of misinformation in this regard, that section 23 of the Bill as it is drafted is absolutely in line with the current section 49 of the Medical Council's Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners 2016.  This obliges doctors to enable patients to transfer to another doctor for treatment in cases of conscientious objection.  It is also in line with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland's Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics 2014.  Let me be very clear.  This legislation does not require medical practitioners, nurses or midwives to do anything new or, indeed, to do anything more than they are already ethically required to do under their own professional guidance.<br\/><br\/>I am somewhat concerned that, while everyone has raised conscientious objection, nobody has raised it with regard to the impact on the woman.  We cannot have a situation where a woman finds herself going from GP practice to GP practice in search of a doctor.  I have asked Professor Boylan and stakeholders in medical colleges, when I met them in the last month, to consider the conscientious objection from a woman's perspective to ascertain how the woman can find out the information in a way that is safe for the woman and safe for the doctor.  I cannot imagine how awful is the extra distress that arises when a woman has to go before a doctor in such a situation, and while that doctor has an absolute right to conscientiously object, this will add to the woman's distress.  While we talk a lot about this from the healthcare professionals' point of view, and that is fine and is a legitimate issue, and conscientious objection will be provided for in this Bill, we should perhaps look at this more from the perspective of a woman in distress seeking help from the Irish health service.  The question is how we help that woman navigate the situation to find the services she needs.  I believe there is something that can be done in that space, as Professor Boylan and others work on implementation from a practical and operational point of view.  I am sure we will be discussing this further on Committee Stage.<br\/><br\/>Some Deputies also raised the issue of greater support in regard to pregnancy in general, but more specifically for women in crisis pregnancy situations.  In this regard, several colleagues pointed to the need to implement the ancillary recommendations made by the joint Oireachtas committee on the eighth amendment.  I hate that title &quot;ancillary&quot; and while it is only a word, I know the committee very much had these as central, key recommendations.  While we sometimes talk about them as though they are merely add-ons, they are very much at the heart of what the committee, the Government and the people want to do.  We have seen other jurisdictions like Portugal and Spain that have liberalised their laws on abortion also put in place better services in regard to sex education, counselling, perinatal hospice support and, crucially, contraception, and, as a result, the number of abortions declined.  I looked at those figures not long ago, so I know that both Portugal and Spain have seen a very consistent downward trend regarding abortions as the supports have been increased for people in crisis pregnancies, but also in regard to trying to help people not find themselves in a crisis pregnancy situation.  No woman wants to find herself in that situation.<br\/><br\/>I assure the House I am committed to working with the Oireachtas to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and this is part of ongoing work in my Department.  Work has been progressing on the development of more comprehensive sexual health and well-being education information and promotion.  Recent progress includes the formal launch and ongoing development of a new website, <i>sexualwellbeing.ie<\/i>, which provides information on contraception, crisis pregnancy, consent, relationships and sexually transmitted infections.  A new safer sex campaign targeted primarily at young people was also recently launched using the hashtag, <i>#respectprotect<\/i>, and there is ongoing extension of the provision of free condoms to target harder-to-reach groups, including, for example, people living in direct provision.<br\/><br\/>Regarding Deputies' concerns and legitimate issues on obstetric care in general, I am proud to be part of a Government working with an Oireachtas which is committed to the development of our maternity services.  Over recent years there has been a very significant focus on the development of national maternity policy in order to ensure our maternity services are developed in a coherent and evidence-based way.  It is hard to believe we did not have a national maternity strategy in Ireland until 2016, so it is clear all of those who talk about the need to do more in this space do not tend to talk about it outside of referendum campaigns, sadly.  Nonetheless, we now have Ireland's first ever national maternity strategy, Creating a Better Future Together 2016-2026.  It was developed by the current Taoiseach when he was Minister for Health.  We also have the HSE's national standards for bereavement care following pregnancy loss and perinatal death, including in situations where somebody has experienced loss through abortion.  In addition, HIQA has now finalised national standards for safer, better maternity services.  When we take all of these developments together, they are clearly key building blocks which will enable us to provide a consistently safe, patient centred, high quality maternity service.<br\/><br\/>For my own part, I am fully committed to ensuring that all women accessing maternity services should receive the same standard of safe, high quality care, regardless of where they live in this country.<\/p><p>Every woman from every corner of Ireland should expect and be able to access the maternity services she needs.  Deputy Joan Burton rightly raised the issue of access to anomaly scans.  We are rolling out this capacity across maternity services and recruiting sonographers to ensure access to scans will be available in all maternity units.  While it is quite an involved process to get through all of the recruitment, we are making good progress and I expect access to scans to be available nationally by the end of 2019.<\/p> <p> Last October I launched the implementation plan for the phased roll-out of the maternity strategy which had been developed through the national women's and infants' health programme.  While we have a great deal more work to do in this area, we have legislation before us to fulfil a commitment to the people which I made with many Deputies across the House that if they repealed the eighth amendment, we would bring forward legislative provisions largely in line with the all-party committee's report and very much in line with the general scheme published before the vote took place.  I am pleased that the debate on Second Stage is concluding and look forward to progressing the Bill through Committee Stage.  I continue to think of the nine women who will travel from the country today, the nine who will travel tomorrow and the nine who will travel the day after that.  I think of the three women who will continue each and every day to access abortion pills online without any medical supervision.  It is for them that we will put our shoulders to the wheel to pass the Bill and that the HSE will work with Dr. Boylan to ensure we will be ready to implement new services at the beginning of 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800029#EE01100","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539870900,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1539870900,"counter":275,"content":"<p>By order of the House today, the division is postponed until after the Order of Business on Tuesday next, 23 October 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800031#GG00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of Swiss Delegation","time":1539870900,"counter":276,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800031#GG00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1539870900,"counter":277,"content":"<p>Before proceeding with the business of the House, I welcome the Swiss delegation to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery.

The legislation is being brought forward because of a commitment given by the Government to remove the legislative prohibition on allowing full access for members of An Garda Sioch&aacute;na to the workplace dispute resolution bodies in the State, namely, the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court.  This commitment was made following a protracted dispute in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which culminated in a real possibility of a withdrawal of labour by garda&iacute;.  At the time of the dispute and following consultation with my ministerial colleagues, I asked the chairman of the Labour Court and the director general of the WRC to assist in the resolution of the ongoing dispute in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a manner that would mirror on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis the normal dispute resolution procedures which had been successfully deployed in other difficult disputes.  I took this step owing to the unprecedented gravity of the proposed withdrawal of labour by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the impact it would have on members of the public and businesses.  In November 2016 agreement was reached at the Labour Court which resolved the dispute.  As part of the resolution, a commitment was given by the Government to provide the Garda associations with permanent access to the WRC and the Labour Court.<\/p><p>To assist the Government in honouring its commitment, a working group was convened under an independent chairman, Mr. John Murphy, a former Secretary General at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, to examine the industrial relations issues in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The working group consists of representatives of the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Defence, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the WRC and Garda management.  The first report of the working group on industrial relations structures for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was published in July 2017.  It acknowledged that the Garda associations had a legitimate aspiration to have access to mechanisms dealing with all matters related to the terms and conditions of their members' employment.  It recommended that the Garda associations be granted access to the industrial relations machinery of the State, namely, the WRC and the Labour Court, to aid in resolving issues and disputes that could not otherwise be resolved.<\/p><p>In September 2017 the Government accepted the recommendations made in the first report and approved the drafting of legislative amendments to provide for the granting of full access for the Garda associations to the workplace dispute resolution bodies.  It also mandated the working group to continue to the second phase of its remit, namely, the creation of a regulatory framework within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure the legislative ambition of this Bill could be achieved.  The working group is analysing, in conjunction with the Garda associations, the detailed operation of the industrial relations processes within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A robust internal dispute resolution mechanism is essential to the ongoing normalisation and professionalisation of industrial relations processes within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Such dispute resolving mechanisms should provide full responses to issues raised in the generality of workplace issues arising and must operate effectively for all concerned.  It is important that there be clear timelines and that issues can be resolved.  This approach should ensure that, in line with other places of work, only the more serious and complex cases would be referred to the State's industrial relations bodies for a determination.  My Department and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel have actively engaged in drafting the Bill in discussions with the Departments of Justice and Equality and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Garda associations have participated fully in this process and more detailed discussions facilitated by the WRC.<\/p><p>The House may be aware that some of the Garda associations have expressed disappointment at the decision of the Government not to extend trade union status and the benefits that status gives to the Garda representative associations in the same manner as other employee representative bodies.  In that regard, we must bear in mind that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a unique organisation.  Within our society, garda&iacute; have exceptional and unique powers.  They include powers to invade our privacy, deprive us of our liberty, demand answers to questions and achieve some of these things by force, if necessary.  It has been said the defining feature of a police force is that it has a monopoly of the legitimate use of force in society.  Thus, the question of the right of those working in essential services to take industrial action involves striking a delicate balance between the importance of the public's need for essential services, on the one hand, and the right of employees to a voice in the workplace and appropriate employment standards, on the other.  Taking all of this in to account, garda&iacute;, as members of a single national police force which is responsible not only for general law enforcement but also State security and immigration, are not the same as other workers.<\/p><p>In their unique circumstances different rules must apply.<\/p> <p> I propose to outline the main provisions of the Bill, which is short and contains just five sections.  Section 1 provides for the insertion of new definitions into the principal Act, that is, the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  Section 2 provides for the amendment of section 3 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to include definitions of a \"member\" of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, \"Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na\" and \"Garda Commissioner\".  Section 3 provides for the amendment of section 23 of the principal Act, which deals with the definitions of a number of terms used generally in the context of industrial relations legislation, that is, the definition of \"worker\", which in the normal course constitutes a person over the age of 15 who has entered into or works under a contract with an employer.  In the context of this Bill and the untypical nature of the employment relationship for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Bill provides that a worker includes a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that a reference to \"employer\" means the Garda Commissioner and that a reference to a contract with an employer is covered by the particular terms and conditions to which members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are subject.  Section 4 of the Bill sets out the provisions of the various industrial relations enactments being actively disapplied in the context of the Act.  These provisions will form a new Schedule to be included in the principal Act of 1990 and will include provisions relating to trade union law as well as the right to collective bargaining under sectoral employment instruments such as employment regulation orders, sectoral employment orders etc.  Section 5 relates to the Short Title, collective citation and commencement.<\/p> <p> I look forward to hearing the views of the few Deputies present and working with them to progress this important legislation through the Houses as quickly as possible.  I am very proud to commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800031#GG00800","speaker":"1272","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539871500,"counter":281,"content":"<p>We will support the general principle of the Bill.  During the legislative process we may seek to table some amendments to improve and enhance it, but in the main we welcome the opportunity to speak on it.  It is important and timely that we acknowledge the challenges that members of trade unions and workers across this country have gone through in rebuilding the State's finances and in the sacrifices they have made in both the public and private sectors.  This is very evident if one looks back at the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, cuts that were introduced, which had a profound impact on people's take-home pay.  This was emergency legislation introduced to underpin the basic financial viability of the State when it was threatened by forces in the form of the financial crisis coupled with an internal recession and a collapse of the housing market.<\/p><p>The reason I highlight this is that it is critically important to acknowledge that during the passage of that legislation, very often there were concerns and protests on the streets.  We sometimes had tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of people on the streets protesting pay cuts or cuts to public services.  People are entitled to protest freely and wilfully and in a peaceful manner, in fact this is a sign of a healthy democracy, but of course one organisation that is equally obliged to maintain the peace is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were equally involved in these protests, there would have been a very difficult position to address in the event of them turning violent or public disorder becoming part and parcel of a protest either in the main or on the fringes.<\/p><p>This is why this legislation is welcome.  It acknowledges the critical role An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na plays in the protection of the State, upholding the rule of law and keeping the peace.  For all that we need to accept that members of the Garda must be treated differently in how we assess their pay and terms and conditions and equally their contractual obligations to the State.  I welcome the Bill from this perspective.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be entitled to collective bargaining, as has been highlighted by the Council of Europe's European Committee of Social Rights.  There should be some formal process whereby An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can go to our industrial relations process, the apparatus of the State, and have their grievances aired and their terms and conditions scrutinised and even set.  Of course, every sovereign government is entitled to be the final arbitrators on the pay and conditions of any public sector employee or organisation.  The system we have in place is a voluntary form of industrial relations whereby people go to the Workplace Relations Commission, their grievances can be heard and the Labour Court can adjudicate if there are still issues to be addressed or to see whether or not they have been maintained.  As I said, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be entitled to access these processes.  Equally, however, there is no way we could as a State or as a people allow a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the organisation collectively to withdraw its labour, which is effectively what an industrial dispute is.  It is the threat of workers, and their entitlement, to withdraw their labour to highlight grievances they have with their employers, the employer in this case being the State itself.<\/p><p>Some will say that every worker has this entitlement, but equally An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a special status within the State in the sense that, as the Minister of State outlined, it has extraordinary powers conferred on it.  Of course, all these powers are conferred on it by this Parliament, underpinned by the Constitution, so they could be mitigated and withdrawn if Parliament so deemed it necessary.  The Garda has extraordinary powers, both as individuals and collectively as an organisation, but only within the rule of law.  If a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na breaches the rule of law, then as with everyone else, there is a sanction for that.<\/p><p>There are a number of reasons we are here.  First and foremost, the European Committee of Social Rights, in EuroCOP <i>v<\/i>. Ireland, found that the State was not in compliance with a number of elements of the European Social Charter.  This is non-binding, but at the same time we like to comply when and if we can and as best we can with these recommendations from the various committees adjudicating on Ireland's performance <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>European obligations.  The ECSR identified a number of breaches: in respect of Article 5, concerning the right to organise, on the grounds of the prohibition of police representative associations joining national employment organisations; in respect of Article 6.2, concerning the right to bargain collectively, on the grounds of restricted access of police representative associations to pay agreements and discussions; and in respect of Article 6.4, on the grounds of the prohibition faced by members of the police of the right to strike.  The ECSR also indicated that restrictions on the exercise of the right to strike, such as requirements relating to the mode and form of industrial action, were acceptable.  The type of restriction was not detailed in the ECSR's EuroCOP decision.<\/p><p>In a way, then, the ECSR did find against the State in certain areas, but it equally accepts the fact that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na hold a special place.  A precedent for this has been set in the context of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, and the Defence Forces themselves.  I do not think anyone would suggest we could have members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and members of the Defence Forces actively involved in an industrial dispute at the behest of a trade union movement to further the rights, terms and working conditions and pay of either the individuals in those organisation or other workers in some other part of the economy.  It simply would not be accepted and would do a grave disservice to the State.<\/p><p>Just as important, it would do a grave disservice to the standing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.  I appreciate that Deputies do not need to give one another history lessons, but I remind the House that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has served the State exceptionally well.  It has been very loyal to the State and, in the main, the State has been very loyal to it in terms of trying to ensure garda&iacute; are protected by the law as they go about their business of ensuring the country functions, the law is upheld and peace is maintained.  People may take those sorts of things for granted now, but they were threatened at various times in recent history.  The members of the Garda did their duty in that context.  Some of them gave their lives in defence of the State.  We need to try to find a mechanism for accepting that members of the force will have grievances from time to time, that they are entitled to air those grievances and be listened to, and that there is an obligation on the State to respond to those grievances in a positive way.  This Bill has done that.  Ultimately, the State and the Government should always hold the entitlement to set pay and conditions in emergency circumstances like those of the past decade.<\/p> <p> The members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are being recruited at present deserve good working conditions.  There is no doubt that the freeze on promotions and transfers brought about a certain element of despondency for a number of years.  The garda&iacute; who get up in the morning and put on their uniforms are proud and passionate about wearing those uniforms.  They look forward to going to the workplace, engaging with society, upholding the peace and ensuring we have a lawful and orderly country.  We should acknowledge that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is, by and large, a force that works on structures and order.  We need to look at how we can facilitate Garda transfers in very difficult personal circumstances.  Members of the force are sometimes posted in areas that are not near their homes, the places where they previously resided or the locations they and their families come from.  In recent years, difficulties have been caused by the freeze in transfers that were normally accommodated on a compassionate basis.  This led to a great deal of anxiety and disquiet among some members of the force.  They were unable to transfer closer to home when their parents or other relatives were ill.  We are recruiting garda&iacute; and expanding the force, but the human element must also be taken into account as we try to address the concerns of individuals.  I know this cannot always be done.  There must be some understanding of the plight of individuals.  We have encountered traumatic cases which we have been unable to address through the normal process or through any process.  There is no real process other than the internal Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na process, which is hierarchical.  Messages always come from the top down.  We should be able to be more imaginative, understanding and compassionate in such cases.<\/p> <p> This Bill represents a step in the right direction.  It is acknowledging something that needs to be acknowledged.  There have been previous cases of industrial action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I do not believe the Garda was well served when services were withdrawn, in effect, in the case of the blue flu.  Citizens have huge loyalty to the members of the police force in this country.  We are policed by consent rather than by fear.  Garda&iacute; are unarmed, by and large, and I hope that remains the case for a long time to come.  I hope we do not give in to the pressure that exists across the western world to have a heavily armed police force on the streets.  While I understand it is necessary to have armed response units, I believe the presence of the uniform without heavy armoury reflects well on Ireland and Irish society.  It encourages the public to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and encourages An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to work for the public.  It has stood the test of time for the State, the Garda and the people of this country.<\/p> <p> The GRA and PDFORRA should give this legislation time to work.  The State and the Government should reciprocate that patience so that when grievances arise, garda&iacute; can go to the Workplace Relations Commission and, if necessary, the Labour Court.  In such circumstances, a positive response must come from the State and the Government to ensure we have a harmonious police force and defence force.  The members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces must be well rewarded for the risks they take daily to maintain peace in other parts of the world.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800032#HH00200","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539872100,"counter":283,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Teachta O'Reilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800033#JJ00200","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1539872100,"counter":284,"content":"<p>T&aacute; s&eacute; sin aontaithe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800033#JJ00300","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1539872100,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach as an deis a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an mBille seo.  This Bill deals mainly with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I do not know whether the Minister of State is aware that Deputy Cullinane and I introduced a Bill in this House in April 2017 that would have allowed members of the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be classified as workers in legislation and thereby give them the option of forming trade unions.  The purpose of the Bill in question, the Trade Union (Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces) Bill 2017, was to allow the representative associations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces to reconstitute themselves as trade unions if they wished.  This would have given garda&iacute; and members of the Defence Forces full access to the industrial relations mechanisms of the State while making it illegal, for reasons of public safety and national security, for them to have engaged in strike action.  Our Bill recognised the different contexts in which the Garda and the Defence Forces operate and the differing needs of the two organisations.  We believe workers in both organisations should be allowed to join trade unions to enable day-to-day employment and industrial issues to be dealt with and to be able to avail of certain actions and mechanisms.  We introduced our Bill on foot of rulings by the European Court of Human Rights and the Council of Europe, the increase in industrial action within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the continued negative treatment by the State of members of the Defence Forces in terms of pay and conditions.  I will return to the latter issue later.<\/p>  <p>  The State's continued ban on trade unions within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces is in violation of international agreements.  It also violates the fundamental rights of people employed in these sectors.  The Bill that has been introduced by the Minister of State has a similar, albeit considerably more limited, aim.  It seeks to amend the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to allow members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their representative associations to access the State's industrial relations mechanisms, namely, the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  I acknowledge that this is a step forward.  Garda&iacute; have waited for far too long to be allowed to access the industrial mechanisms of the State.  Internal disputes have escalated because no forum has been available to address conflicts at an early stage.  Although this legislation is long overdue and is welcome, it falls far short of what was intended when the international courts found in a certain number of cases that police forces, soldiers and defence forces in Ireland and other countries should be able to access the full trade union mechanisms.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces should also be allowed to join trade unions if they wish.<\/p><p>Members of the Defence Forces should also be allowed to access the WRC and Labour Court in the same way as the Minister of State has indicated garda&iacute; will under this Bill.  Will he clarify whether there is a particular reason members of the Defence Forces are specifically excluded under the Bill?  The indication given to me in my discussions with the Minister of State with responsibility for defence, Deputy Kehoe, was that accommodating their demands was being considered.  Obviously, he failed to contact the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, or at least failed to persuade him, given that the legislation before us does not deal with that issue.<\/p> <p> We only need think back to last month, 19 September, when several thousand men, women and, in particular, families attended the \"Respect and Loyalty\" protest outside the gates of Leinster House.  The Wives &amp;amp; Partners of the Defence Forces, WPDF, organised that march.  Central to it was retired Sergeant Major Noel O'Callaghan.  Anyone who met the retired members outside would not need to be persuaded of their loyalty to the State or their pride in the duties they undertook over the years in the Defence Forces.  What the people outside were asking for was simple, namely, to be respected, to have their work respected to change the conditions under which they lived and for someone somewhere to take cognisance of the fact that some of those in the Defence Forces were sleeping in cars and were asked to do duties in the Phoenix Park when the Pope visited in the same month.  They get no overtime because it does not exist for them, yet the other arm of the State that was there to protect the dignitary in the Phoenix Park could get overtime.  Members of the Defence Forces are expected to sleep in bivouacs and eat canned food all while doing a good job, which they do with pride, yet members of the Garda rightly get the overtime and recognition they deserve.<\/p> <p> In many other circumstances down the years, the terms and, in particular, conditions in the Defence Forces have not reached the standard of a modern army or air force.  I debated some of these conditions with the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, at a committee meeting today.  Nowhere else in the Irish workforce would people be expected to put up with poisoning by chemicals as happened in Casement Aerodrome.  Nowhere else in the Irish workforce would people have to comply with taking medication that has been deemed by other defence forces to be virtually poisonous as in the case of thousands who have travelled to sub-Saharan Africa to carry out UN duties, a task they have done with pride for years, only to come home with totally changed lives.  Any other workers would be allowed to join a trade union, advocate and protest such conditions, but those who are in the Defence Forces are expected to put up with it or get out, as some have been told.  That they can like it or lump it and suffer the consequences because they joined the Army and, therefore, there was an entitlement to make them suffer.  That seems to be the attitude in some ways.  When making a change like the one outlined in this Bill, I see no reason for the Defence Forces not to be extended the same protections afforded to members of the Garda.<\/p> <p> In her recent budget announcement, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, allocated an additional &euro;1 million to the WRC and the Labour Court.  Despite not having the extra &euro;1 billion that the Government found down the back of the chair two days before the budget, Sinn F&eacute;in was able to allocate even more than the Minister's amount in our pre-budget submission.  We suggested that &euro;1.4 million would help to alleviate some of the delays at the WRC and Labour Court.  We have expressed our concern at those delays.  While &euro;1.4 million might not have helped enough people, our information is that, in July of this year, there were 3,140 complaints waiting to be heard in the WRC, with almost half of those waiting for 12 months or longer.  In addition, 1,473 cases were waiting for a decision.  That is the backlog.  We welcome the extension of protections to garda&iacute;, but unless they can reach the mechanisms and have their cases heard quickly, it is not as laudable as suggested.  The Minister of State needs to ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to check the other chairs in his house.  He might find another few million euro stuffed down their backs.  The delays are a cause for concern, as many of those who have taken cases and are waiting for them to be heard find it difficult to get alternative work due to their previous employments being under examination.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that enough money has been allocated to address the significant delays and provide for the estimated 10% increase in case numbers that this Bill will bring?  If its protections were extended to the Defence Forces, that figure could be increased further, possibly by much more.<\/p> <p> We intend to table amendments to strengthen the Bill and give effect to the points that I have raised, particularly regarding the Defence Forces.  I thank the Minister of State for introducing the Bill.  It is a step in the right direction and we will not oppose it, but I will argue strongly on Committee Stage that it needs to do more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800033#JJ00400","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539872700,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I echo the sentiment expressed by my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, regarding this being a step in the right direction, but it really is just a step and is not what the Garda representative organisations want.  They want trade union status, to be represented by a recognised trade union and to have the protections that gives.  It is interesting that the people in these buildings who have drafted this legislation have access to a trade union.  It is not outrageous to suggest that people should have access to trade union representation.<\/p>  <p>  It was pointed out that members of the Garda and Defence Forces were special and not like other workers.  That may be true, but both of the major political parties - we often say that they are in government together - treated them the same as every other worker when cutting their pay.  There was no special status accorded to them then.  I was a full-time union organiser with SIPTU in 2009 when we joined up with firefighters, prison officers and nurses from other trade unions and members of the Garda.<\/p><p>We would have joined up with the members of the Defence Forces also but that was not permitted.  We formed an organisation called the 24\/7 alliance.  During that time, I had occasion to speak and work closely with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We teased out the issue of access to industrial relations machinery, what that would mean and how one could ultimately get some value out of it.  Around the same time, I had a case before the Labour Court, which I won.  The recommendation made by the court entitled the members in question to a small amount of compensation.  I could not get the recommendation enforced and I returned to the Labour Court to see if anything could be done.  The then chairman of the Labour Court was blunt with me and told me I knew what I could do, which was to get out the ballot box and ballot for industrial action.  <\/p> <p> In a voluntarist system of industrial relations the journey to the end of the road is a long one.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh outlined the wait involved in getting access to the industrial relations machinery but a significant amount of time is spent at local level before one even gets to that point.  One then gets to the Workplace Relations Commission, the WRC, which was previously the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, and even sometimes when one wins the case, one must still have recourse to a ballot for industrial action.  There are hundreds of thousands of unionised workers in this State and very few days have been lost to strikes.  That is a testament to the men and women working in industrial relations, human resources and the WRC.  Strikes are very rare.  <\/p> <p> I stress that Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes this Bill as a step in the right direction.  However, these workers are to be treated differently from other workers.  Another worker who has won a case at the Labour Court but cannot get enforcement of the recommendation has recourse to industrial action.  Does the Minister of State have plans to give members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, I hope, members of the Defence Forces, if they are included in the scope of the Bill, the option to take this final step?  He said they cannot take industrial action but what option is open to them given that strike action is the last resort?  We have not lost many days to strike action for a long time.  We hit a peak sometime in the 1970s.  I worked in industrial relations for a long time, as did my father, and I have a small amount of knowledge of the issue.  Strike action is the last action one will take.  When it is taken it is because it is necessary and there is no other avenue.  Will consideration be given to ensuring there is a mechanism for enforcement?  Other workers have such a mechanism, namely, the withdrawal of their labour.<\/p> <p> The refusal to allow members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na access to a trade union and full trade union status is short-sighted.  That is what garda&iacute; want and if it is not provided via this legislation, consideration must be given to how garda&iacute; will be able to use the industrial relations mechanisms.  Once members of the Garda have access to the WRC and the Labour Court, how will a recommendation be enforced when a member of the Garda wins a case and reaches the end of the road?  Having represented public service workers, I can tell the Minister of State that there is zero appetite on the part of human resource managers to simply accept someone has won a case in the Labour Court and then write the cheque or make the necessary change to conditions.  It does not work like that.  Some sort of recourse is needed to be able to make good on foot of the recommendations of the Labour Court because in a voluntarist system they are nothing more than recommendations.  In the event that the Labour Court makes a recommendation and the members reject it, what happens then?  Does the Government simply tell members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that it has legislated to give them the right to be unhappy about the outcome of a Labour Court case and they should not go about their business?  It is a little pointless if there is nothing at the end of the process to which they can aspire, as they would do if they were members of a trade union.  <\/p> <p> I do not wish to be overly negative.  I say that based on my experience.  In 2009, when the threat of pay cuts was very real and we formed the 24\/7 alliance, I had lengthy discussions with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their representatives and full trade union status and access to the third party machinery was certainly what they were seeking at that time.  Access to the third party machinery is a welcome step but consideration must be given to what it means in the event that the third party machinery does not deliver or is not capable of delivering for those workers.  I remind the Minister of State that when it came to cutting pay, the Government treated these groups the same as every single other worker in the State.  It is a little harsh for them to hear that they are special except when it comes to pay cuts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800034#KK00200","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539873300,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I also welcome the legislation.  While the Labour Party will support the Bill, I also believe it could have gone further.  I refer to the EuroCOP <i>v<\/i>. Ireland ruling which, as we understand, recommended full trade union rights for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Ireland and in other parts of Europe as well.  While it is welcome that members of the Garda will have access to the WRC and the Labour Court, the aspiration is for them to have full trade union rights.  There is an issue around garda&iacute; going on strike but a mechanism could be found to circumscribe that right in some way to enable them to perform the very important duties they have while also having the full right to be in a trade union.  It would not be beyond the powers of Government to figure out a way to do that.  I am disappointed, therefore, that the Bill has not gone as far as it could have gone or as far as some of the Garda associations would have liked.  Nevertheless, it is progress and we should welcome it.  I hope it will give members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the opportunity to be able to exercise rights in a way they have not been able to do previously.<\/p><p>One of the issues that arose, and it was referred to in the contribution by the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, is that as well as members of the Garda having a role in law enforcement, they also have a role in State security.  That is probably one of the impediments to giving them fuller rights.  However, we have argued previously in a different context that we should separate the functions of State security and law enforcement, as is the case in many other jurisdictions.  That issue should be examined as part of the reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While it is not a matter for debate today, it should be examined.<\/p><p>All of us appreciate the importance of the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Despite the many debates in the House about various issues connected with the Garda, there is a great deal of respect for garda&iacute;.  People very much appreciate the fact that, by and large, they are unarmed and that they perform a duty in all our communities that is very much respected and regarded by people throughout the country.  The fact that, until now, garda&iacute; have not enjoyed the same rights as other workers has caused a great deal of disquiet.  This applies also to the Defence Forces, as previous speakers noted, although I acknowledge we are dealing with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this debate.  I hope this Bill will go some way towards addressing the issues of concern.<\/p><p>I ask specifically about some of the content of the Minister of State's contribution on the working group convened under the independent chair to examine the industrial relations issues in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That process is ongoing and the Minister of State indicated the working group is currently analysing, in conjunction with the Garda associations, the detailed operation of the industrial relations processes within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He noted also that only the more serious, complex cases are referred to the State's industrial relations bodies for a determination, as is the norm in many workplaces.  We need more information on what exactly this, as it were, pre-industrial relations process within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is likely to be and how much progress the working group has made. <\/p><p>I would like more information on that, either in the Minister of State's response today or as we move through the later stages of the debate.  We need clarity in all of this.  All of the processes must be very clear to members of the force and members of the public.  I hope that all of these issues will be teased out as the Bill progresses.  <\/p> <p> Generally speaking I welcome this Bill.  While it is fairly simple and short, there are many broader issues around it that will continue to be debated.  I hope we will have the opportunity to tease them out further as we move on with the Bill.  The Labour Party welcomes its publication today and will support the Bill on Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800035#LL00200","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539873900,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2018.  This Bill is the result of a number of events that led to the Government finally promising legislation to allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to have access to the industrial relations machinery of the State, namely, the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court.  Of course, the need for this legislation was very evident and never more urgent than in November 2016 when the so-called \"blue flu\" was averted at the last minute.  While this Bill is a welcome first step, I agree with my Sinn F&eacute;in and Labour Party colleagues that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whose members are such an important group of workers in our society, should have full trade union rights.<\/p>  <p>  As always, the work of the Oireachtas Library and Research Service in producing an informative Bill digest is excellent and particular thanks are due to the digest's author, Ms Adele McKenna, from whom I also received a short briefing yesterday.  Currently, the conciliation and arbitration scheme is the main industrial relations mechanism for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, according to the aforementioned digest, the scheme remains in place but does not meet very often, if at all.  Since the events at the end of 2016, it was agreed that the WRC and the Labour Court would be made available to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on an informal basis until necessary legislation was published and passed.  That legislation is, at long last, before us today.  <\/p>  <p>  Historically, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has not been allowed to engage in industrial disputes and to do so would be seen as a breach of discipline under regulation No. 5 of the 2007 Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na discipline regulations, SI 214\/2007.  The Industrial Relations Act 1990 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, about which we had a very lengthy discussion in this House previously, prevent the formation of Garda trade unions and prohibit engagement with umbrella organisations such as ICTU due to possible conflicting demands on the need to police other union protests or the protection of State infrastructure.  <\/p>  <p>  In other jurisdictions, such as the UK, New Zealand and Australia, the rights of members of law enforcement bodies to engage in industrial action are restricted.  It seems incongruous, at the very least, that the Bill before us would not include full recognition of the rights of garda&iacute; as workers, including the ultimate right, as Deputy O'Reilly so eloquently said, to secure enforcement of the decisions of the Labour Court and the WRC by withdrawing their labour.  I do not agree that any worker should be prevented from participating in collective action.  In a 2007 paper by Ms Wiebke Warneck about strike rules in the EU 27, the author provides a list of countries, including Croatia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland and Spain, that restrict the right of their police forces to organise and to pursue industrial action.  The security role of all of those police forces is highlighted in the paper.  At the same time, this critical group of workers in our society is being denied a right that the rest of us regard as both essential and fundamental.  <\/p>  <p>  There are four bodies representing members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, comprising the Garda Representative Association, GRA, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, the Association of Garda Superintendents and the Association of Garda Chief Superintendents, AGCS.  The GRA is reported to have 10,000 rank and file members but these associations were not invited to take part in the cross-departmental working group on industrial relations structures for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They were invited to send in written submissions but it would have been preferable for them to be involved in across-the-table discussions.  Preceding the working group, as other Deputies have mentioned, in 2012 the European Confederation of Police, EuroCOP, brought a case against Ireland on behalf of the AGSI to the European Committee of Social Rights, ECSR.  The AGSI is a member of EuroCOP and the case was based on the premise that it is a breach of the European Social Charter to deny access to the WRC and the Labour Court.  In 2014, the ECSR ruled that Garda associations perform the same duties as trade unions and therefore garda&iacute; do not to join other trade unions.  It also ruled that Garda associations should be allowed to join umbrella union organisations under Article 5, that access to pay negotiations was restricted, breaching Article 6.2, and that garda&iacute; should be allowed to strike under Article 6.4.  <\/p>  <p>  The ruling was non-binding but in 2016 Mr. John Horgan, who was previously deputy chairman of the Labour Court, led the Haddington Road agreement review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Horgan review found that the four Garda associations should become official trade unions and agreed with the ECSR that they be allowed to join national umbrella organisations such as ICTU but that strike action should not be allowed.  The working group mentioned previously was established in 2017 and its first report goes against the recommendations of the ECSR and the Horgan report.  It did, however, recommend that garda&iacute; be allowed to access the WRC and Labour Court.  It is the recommendations of the working group that formed the basis for the Bill before us.  The second report of this working group on how industrial relations will operate going forward was due to be completed this time last year but is still outstanding.  When will that report be published?<\/p>  <p>  We cannot underestimate the incredibly stressful and difficult working life of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At a recent meeting of the AGSI, topics discussed included levels of depression and stress suffered by members of the force as well as a range of welfare issues.  Disturbingly, it was noted that 12 members had died by suicide between August 2017 and March 2018.  We know that there have been morale issues within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There has been much discussion and coverage of scandals involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including most recently the Charleton report.  It must be remembered that many of the pressures on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as with other workers, stem from the savage cuts in pay and conditions that were imposed from 2008.  We are talking here about a lost decade.  When I questioned the Taoiseach recently about crime levels in our society and referred to the pressures on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly at community policing level, he referred constantly to 2021 and 2022, when the force will have 21,000 members and ancillary support staff.  The existing staff have had to try to deal with very serious anti-social and criminal matters day after day, year after year during this horrendous period.  I read an article recently by Mr. Stephen Collins in which he argued that the blanket bank guarantee actually worked.  We know, however, from the levels of cuts to our public services, from the disaster that is housing and health and from the 400,000 young people who emigrated that it did not work.  Austerity did not work here, no more than it worked in Greece and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and law enforcement were seriously impacted by it.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of rights of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the most fundamental is full trade union rights and all that this entails.  While I support this legislation as a step along that road, we must be prepared to give garda&iacute; their full rights.<\/p><p> Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh rightly raised concerns about work levels at the WRC and the Labour Court.  A 10% increase, on top of the current backlog of claims sent to the WRC and the Labour Court, is expected, or perhaps an additional 1,500 claims.  The representative bodies, the AGSI and the others, state this is a conservative estimate of what the conciliation service will have to face.  The Minister of State mentioned that the legislation would commence following the establishment of internal procedures and that referrals could only be sent to the WRC and the Labour Court once these procedures were dealt with.  He might come back and tell the House what we are talking about.  What are the additional internal procedures?  Perhaps the Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have discussed this issue, but it is something of which the House is not aware.<\/p> <p> This short Bill amends sections 3 and 23 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  The amendments to section 3 add to the definition in section 23 of the 1990 Act of types of worker and will now include members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, although it excludes the Garda Commissioner and members of the Garda Reserve.  These exclusions are debatable.<\/p> <p> Section 4 inserts a sixth Schedule to the 1990 Act.  The GRA is not satisfied with the Bill because it does not extend the right to industrial action or classify the GRA as a full trade union.<\/p> <p> I welcome the Bill as a step forward.  Access was the first step.  On behalf of the trade union movement, a far-ranging trade union recognition Bill was introduced in this House almost 20 years ago.  I believe profoundly in the right of every worker to trade union representation.  At the time we were campaigning for Ryanair to allow trade union recognition.  I congratulate the trade union movement on the fact that, at long last, such recognition has been achieved in that company.  The Minister of State knows the aviation sector well.  Garda&iacute; should have similar rights.  That is the bottom line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800036#MM00200","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539874500,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I will deal briefly with some of the comments made.<\/p><p>I thank Deputies Billy Kelleher, Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh, Louise O'Reilly and Thomas P. Broughan for their participation in and comments during the debate, to which I have listened attentively.  Some of the issues raised will be dealt with on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh referred to the Defence Forces.  The Department of Defence was an active participant in the working group which led to the development of the Bill.  There are internal industrial relations procedures in that Department, all of which are under review.  I refer the Deputy to the recent report produced by Mr. Gerard Barry who attended the conciliation council for PDFORRA.  The report is under consideration by the Defence Forces and the review is ongoing.  We should let the Defence Forces continue with their internal procedures.  The fact that they were part of the working group should be noted and that they know what has happened here.<\/p><p>Deputy Louise O'Reilly raised the question as to whether the legislation allowed garda&iacute; go on strike.  The answer is &quot;No&quot;.  In Ireland there is no general right for any worker to strike, but trade unions are protected from the consequences of deciding to take strike action in certain circumstances.  The Trade Union Acts 1871 to 1990 regulate the rules for trade unions and provide for a system of registration of trade unions.  In return, trade unions are protected from prosecution for economic torts through the Industrial Relations Act which confers immunity on workers and their representatives if they are acting in contemplation or the furtherance of trade disputes.  Any industrial action must be lawful and several preconditions must be met, including that immunities only apply to members and officials of authorised trade unions.  If the dispute relates to an industrial worker, any agreed procedure in the workplace, or procedure normally availed of by custom and practice, must be availed of first.  If the industrial action or strike is to be supported by a trade union, a secret ballot must be held first.  I assure the Deputy that it remains the position that the trade union Acts do not apply to garda&iacute; and that members of the Garda Representative Association are excluded from the protections under the Industrial Relations Acts for persons engaged in industrial actions.<\/p><p>The WRC was mentioned by a number of speakers.  I secured extra funding for it in the budget for next year and some of that money will go towards improving premises for the WRC across the country.  It is important that it have premises of which people can avail and that people know that they can take their issues to it.  <\/p><p>Some of the Deputies present might have attended recent events such as the national ploughing championships and the Tullamore show, at which the WRC had prominent stands for the public to see what it did.  Some of the money will be spent for that purpose.<\/p><p>The WRC will also be putting funds into increasing adjudication numbers.  I am happy, therefore, to have secured the extra funding in the budget for next year.<\/p><p>The Committee on Social Rights found, in the case of the European Confederation of Police (EuroCOP) <i>v<\/i>. Ireland, that the Garda associations could represent their members.  On that count Ireland was not found to be in breach, but it was found to be in breach by not allowing garda&iacute; to access the industrial relations machinery of the State.  The Bill will rectify that position, which is why it is before the House.<\/p><p>Members of the Garda associations are full members of the working group which is examining the internal Garda dispute procedures.  The second phase of the work of the working group is expected to conclude some time next year.<\/p><p>I look forward to working with all of the Deputies and thank them for their interest in the Bill.  It is short but important legislation.  The reason for it was outlined in my initial contribution.  We do not want a repeat of the situation a few years ago when garda&iacute; threatened to go on strike.  I look forward to working with all of the Deputies on Committee Stage.  Some of them will have amendments to propose which we will go through.  Their support for the Bill is important.

He looks a bit windswept.  The main purpose of the Bill is to alter the boundary between Cork City Council and Cork County Council and to provide for the boundary alteration arrangements and consequential matters.  This revised boundary was proposed by the Cork implementation oversight group, following from the report of an expert advisory group in April 2017, which recommended extending the Cork city area rather than merging the local authorities as proposed in the 2015 Cork local government committee majority report.  This boundary is being altered by way of primary legislation in the absence of clear evidence of agreement between the two local authorities under the existing procedures for amending boundaries.  It is also because the scale of the boundary alteration is very significant, involving the transfer of 147 square km occupied by approximately 80,000 residents from within the administrative area of the county council to the administrative area of the city council.<\/p>  <p>  Key urban parts of the immediate hinterland of Cork city will form part of the city council area, allowing potential for further development within a new city council boundary, while also incentivising high density development and reducing the risk of sprawl.  The extended city area will include Ballincollig, Carrigrohane, Blarney, Glanmire and Cork airport, but not Carrigtwohill, Passage West, Monkstown, Ringaskiddy, Carrigaline and the more rural parts of the city hinterland.  The population of the city will increase from 125,657 to 205,000 and the Project Ireland 2040 national planning framework contains a targeted rate of growth for Cork city of at least 105,000 more people by 2040.  The scale of the boundary alteration meant that it was not possible to include a map of the transferring area in a schedule to the Bill, which had been the original intention.  In order to be adequately legible, the hard copy of the map had to be produced in size A0 which is why it had to be deposited at offices in the Custom House with a physical copy laid before the House.<\/p>  <p>  The main elements of the Bill provide for the revised boundary, which is indicated by hatching on the above-mentioned deposited map that was laid before the House, which will take effect on a transfer day appointed by ministerial order, and that will be fixed to coincide with the new councils coming into office after the local elections in the middle of next year; statutory status, powers and functions of an oversight committee to oversee the boundary alteration implementation process, including provision for an implementation plan to be produced by the committee, which the local authorities will be required to comply with in implementing the boundary alteration; a range of specific arrangements to be made jointly between the local authorities in relation to the relevant area being transferred, including matters such as transfer of assets and liabilities, transitional provisions relating to local authority financial functions, which will largely remain with the county council until 1 January 2020, the performance of functions in the transferred area, transfer of staff and related superannuation arrangements; and an overall financial settlement between the city council and the county council arising from the boundary alteration, to be agreed jointly by the local authorities in accordance with the implementation plan, with default provision for the settlement to be arranged by the Minister, if necessary.  The financial settlement will have two components: an annual payment for a period of ten years from the county council to the city council that is linked to the consumer price index to offset the financial loss that will be incurred by the county council, and any other agreed adjustments of varying amounts that might arise from year to year from the financial implications of the various specific arrangements to be made between the authorities under the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also covers duties of the relevant local authorities and their employees relating to the implementation of the boundary alteration, including regular reports to the oversight committee; provision for ministerial regulations and directions in relation to the boundary alteration; consequential provisions arising from the boundary alteration in relation to the holding of local elections to Cork City Council and Cork County Council in 2019; and other matters consequential on the boundary alteration, including continuance of contracts and legal proceedings, application of development plans and local areas plans, requirements relating to planning applications and development contribution schemes, application of by-laws in the relevant areas, continuation in force of leases, licences, permissions etc. granted by Cork County Council in respect of the relevant areas, and provision for necessary data sharing, and transitional arrangements in relation to valuations for rating purposes.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation will need to be enacted this year to enable all necessary action to be completed in time for the local elections in mid-2019.  While the boundary alteration and transfer of local authority jurisdiction will take full legal effect in mid-2019, the legislation will provide appropriate flexibility in relation to operational arrangements so that transfer of practical responsibility for certain functions can proceed on a more gradual basis, if necessary, to allow time for organisational changes to be completed.  However, it is expected that the transfer arrangements will proceed quickly once the legislation is enacted and that this will not be a drawn-out process.  Responsibility for the detailed planning and implementation of the reorganisation involved will rest primarily with the local authorities, subject to guidance and oversight by the oversight committee and compliance with the implementation plan.  I acknowledge the enormous work that the Cork implementation oversight group, along with the two chief executives and key members of their teams, have put into teasing out the various implications and arrangements that a boundary change on this scale entails.<\/p>  <p>  While the majority of the Bill's provisions relate to the Cork boundary alteration, in line with the Government's decision in relation to local government arrangements in Galway, the Bill also provides for the appointment of a single chief executive with dual responsibility for both Galway City Council and Galway County Council, who will be empowered to implement administrative integration through delegation of executive functions under the Local Government Acts.  This approach, which was recommended by the Galway expert advisory group and is similar to the management arrangements put in place in Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford ahead of the mergers of councils in those areas, will see two separate elected councils being retained for the 2019 local elections and at the same time facilitate the decision in principle to merge the two authorities by 2021.  The Bill also contains provisions to copper-fasten the status of cities and counties by repealing the existing power to alter boundaries by ministerial order, save where agreed by the relevant local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Some further provisions, including ones relating to the holding of plebiscites to consider the proposal for directly elected mayors for Cork city, Limerick, Galway city and county and Waterford and joint structures to facilitate local area and forward planning for urban areas that span county boundaries, will be brought forward on Committee Stage.  Amendments relating to the placenames provisions of the local government code may also be brought forward if the urgency of progressing this Bill permits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800038#OO00500","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539875700,"counter":303,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions (Resumed) - Ceisteanna ar Sonra&iacute;odh Uain D&oacute;ibh (At&oacute;g&aacute;il) - Priority Questions (Resumed)","time":1539875700,"counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800039#PP00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1539875700,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I welcome the new Minister for Education and Skills to the Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800039#PP00300","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1539875700,"counter":307,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, a Chathaoirligh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800039#PP00400","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1539875700,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I invite Deputy Thomas Byrne to introduce his question.

My Department's decision to acquire the site was taken in the context of a review of demographics of the area which demonstrated a substantial projected growth in enrolment, known limited land availability and the impending sale.  From a school provision perspective, this site is\u00a0well located to serve south Dublin city.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2017 my Department requested of the Irish Greyhound Board, that the DPER Circular 11\/15: Protocols for the Transfer and Sharing of State Property Assets be followed to advance the acquisition.<\/p>  <p>  This circular requires the Valuation Office to provide a determination of market value of the property to be disposed which is binding on both the disposing and acquiring Government Department or State body.  The Valuation Office is an independent office which provides independent and impartial market valuations.  It is staffed by civil servants.  The Valuation Office completed its valuation on the Harold's Cross site in April 2017 in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Valuation professional standards and international valuation standards.  The valuation took into account, among other things, an analysis of the existing market, the property's zoning relative to residential values and the need to clear the site of existing structures.  The Valuation Office report concluded that the site had a market value of &euro;23 million.  In May 2017, a formal offer was made by my Department to the Irish Greyhound Board for the site in line with this binding valuation.  The acquisition was completed in May 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In the interests of transparency I have arranged for the Valuation Office report and\u00a0an update from the office related to that valuation that was received\u00a0by my Department earlier this week\u00a0to be published on my Department's website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800039#PP00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1539875700,"counter":313,"content":"<p>It is clear that there is a demand for school places in the area.

The vendor, the Irish Greyhound Board, had the site valued by the reputable estate agent, Savills, at only &euro;12 million if used for housing and only &euro;6 million if the land was rezoned for recreation.<\/p>  <p>  I accept the valuation the Minister received is from the Valuation Office and nobody can blame him for what happened in recent years, but does it concern him that it appears that the valuation of &euro;23 million was almost twice the valuation of the site received by the Irish Greyhound Board?

To place the valuation in context, subsequent to the valuation report I understand that a 3.43 acre site on Harold's Cross Road, about 1 km from the site, achieved a price in excess of &euro;15 million, or more than &euro;4.367 million an acre, in mid-2017.  That is only one example which provides a context.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate what Deputy Byrne said about transparency and the independence of the Valuation Office, which is made up of civil servants.

I look forward to working with Deputy Funchion in that regard.<\/p><p>School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is required to apply the rules of the scheme equitably in the interests of all those using the service and in delivering value for money.<\/p><p>The purpose of the school transport scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside in remote areas from their nearest school.  In the 2017-18 school year in excess of 117,000 children, including more than 12,000 children with special educational needs, were transported in more than 4,500 vehicles every day to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering in excess of 100 million km annually at a total cost of almost &euro;190 million in 2017.  The scheme is under significant financial pressure arising from growing demographics and the increasing numbers of children with special educational needs seeking transport.<\/p><p>Children are eligible for school transport if they satisfy the distance criteria, if they are attending their nearest school and if it is economically feasible to provide a service.  In the latter case, children are eligible for a remote area grant to assist with transport.  Children who are eligible for school transport and who have completed the application process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the current school year where such services are in operation.<\/p><p>Children who are not eligible for school transport can be facilitated where spare seats are available after eligible children have been accommodated.  Where the number of ineligible children exceeds the number of spare seats available Bus &Eacute;ireann allocates tickets for the spare seats on the basis of an agreed selection process.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>The terms of the scheme, which are regularly communicated, make it clear that concessionary places are not guaranteed and are allocated year to year.  It is understood that the cases referred to by the Deputy relate to children who are not eligible under the rules of the scheme or who failed to complete the application process on time.<\/p><p>Under the terms of the scheme, routes will not be extended or altered, additional vehicles will not be introduced, and larger vehicles or extra trips using existing vehicles will not be provided to cater for ineligible children.  Making exceptions to this would effectively create an open-ended scheme with unquantified exposure to the Exchequer and the taxpayer for the resulting cost.

My difficulty is that any time I raise the matter with those responsible, they do not address any of the issues I am raising.  We say to them that there are definitely 12 seats free on the Paulstown route.  They come back and say no seats are free.

Parental preferences were previously collected based on direct engagement with patron bodies.  I take the Deputy's point about lead-in times and the mechanisms involved.

I think the quote was about the two most important times in our lives being the day we are born and the day we find out why we were born.  I will not say what the Deputy told me about that second day but she may tell her constituents in private.  She did not say she was born to meet me, to be clear - she gave a different reason.<\/p><p>I agree with the Deputy that this is a really important area.  The special needs assistant scheme has been a major factor in ensuring the successful integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream education and the provision of support to pupils enrolled in special schools and classes.  This support is very much valued by students, parents and schools, as they provide an indispensable service.  Increased investment has allowed the Government to increase the number of SNAs by 42%, from 10,575 in 2011 to 15,000 by the end of this year.  A further 950 SNA posts are being made available for allocation in budget 2019, increasing employment opportunities in this important field of employment.<\/p><p>The current public service collective industrial relations agreement, known as the public service stability agreement, PSSA, was reached with the public service trade unions in June 2017 and is due to run until 31 December 2020.  The pay benefits of the PSSA range progressively from 7.2% to 6.2% over the three years from 2018 to 2020.  At the end of the agreement, FEMPI pay cuts will have been restored in full to 90% of all public servants.  With regard to the issue of new entrant pay, the measures recently agreed between the parties to the PSSA provide a credible pathway to addressing new entrant pay and represent a fair and reasonable outcome for the approximately 5,000 new entrant SNA recruits since January 2011.<\/p><p>My Department has put in place supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs on foot of proposals brought forward by the Labour Relations Commission.  These arrangements give priority to serving special needs assistants when work is being allocated and enhance the SNAs&rsquo; working conditions.  The arrangement has been demonstrated to work effectively for SNAs and schools. <\/p><p>In 2016, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, was requested to lead a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme.  The review set out to ensure that the scheme is achieving the best outcomes possible for children with special educational needs, supported by the special needs assistants.  The review was published on 30 May 2018.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>One of the review&rsquo;s recommendations is for a new allocation model which would front-load supports into schools.  Such a model would remove the existing need for assessments for many students and ensure the support is available to them as soon as they arrive in school.  If implemented, it would also substantially further improve job security for SNAs in schools, ensuring greater certainty for them regarding their employment status.<\/p><p>The review also recommends ongoing professional development options for SNAs be provided.  The training and development recommendations made by the NCSE review are in recognition of the fundamental importance of building schools&rsquo; capacity to meet additional care needs of students.  These and other recommendations of the review are currently under consideration.  I am committed to the continued effective operation of the SNA scheme in consultation with education partners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800042#SS00600","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1539877500,"counter":348,"content":"<p>As I have said many times in this Chamber, I have a personal interest in the area of children with special needs and in special needs assistants.

Of course, the devil is in the detail and I note that a more detailed announcement regarding the implementation of the review will be made in due course.  The NCSE proposals whereby a greater range of supports would be offered via the special needs assistants makes absolute sense.

They play a vital role.  We need to provide them with certainty and ensure that they have proper conditions.  That is why the review published on 30 May 2018 was so important.  Once we publish a review there is a series of recommendations so the hard work of choices starts now.  These and other recommendations of the review are under consideration.

There are issues and weaknesses in every organisation.  One area which I highlighted when in opposition, and on which I will be happy to work with colleagues across the House, is the position of secretaries in primary schools.  Their contracts stop at the end of the school term, as do their pension entitlements.  This issue, which I have been aware of since I was first elected to the House in 2007, has not been addressed either.  I do not want to create expectations that it will be addressed but I will say that primary school secretaries, as well as SNAs, perform an integral role in schools.

While I appreciate that there is a Minister of State with responsibility for higher education who is not the Minister, we need to look at the SUSI system and how grants are given out.  A great deal of reform of SUSI is required because it can be difficult just to access and deal with the body.  The rules around how far one has to be from a college are very rigid which impacts students from rural areas more than those who can travel to college from home on a daily basis.  That brings me to the matter of rental costs for students.  Many students are now forced to commute or may end up giving college because they cannot afford the cost of living along with rent and fees.  We have a good record of higher education that we are at risk of damaging due to increasing fees and costs of living.  While a promise is there for 7,000 units, we need to see a lot more being done a lot faster to provide student accommodation.

At a time when a parent is letting a child fly the nest, it is very worrying to be unsure about what accommodation is available, whether it is up to standard and where exactly it is located.  That is what is so good about purpose-built and on-campus accommodation.  It gives students, in particular first years, and their parents the reassurance they need that they are somewhere safe and known.  I appreciate that the Minister is new in the role but this is something we need to continue to work on, including in the education committee.  There are many studies on this.  Credit unions have produced a study showing how many people are nearly being forced to use money lenders.  They have got to the stage where they have borrowed to put one child through college and a second child comes along before the first has graduated.  People are getting to the stage of nearly having to go to money lenders because they want their children to move on to further education.  That is unacceptable in this day and age and it is a matter we must address.  That is why I refer to the need to reform SUSI.  Not everything is black and white and not everyone fits into the same category.  The system we used to have meant one could call to a local VEC office regarding a grant but that is all gone now.  It is now just a person on the phone and one either fits the category or one does not.  There is no room for any sort of discretion, which is not necessarily a good thing.

The current status of each of these projects is as follows.  At St. Conleth's community college, Newbridge, the project is on site and is due to be completed shortly.  At Athy community college, the project brief has been completed and the project has been devolved to Kildare and Wicklow ETB for delivery.

Given that the questions are grouped, I have a fair number of points to make.  I will stick to the matter of school extensions in this first supplementary contribution.  As the Ceann Comhairle knows well, the project at St. Paul's school in Monasterevin has been beset by numerous delays, not all of which were caused by the Department of Education and Skills.  While the project is at pre-qualification of contractors stage, we must ensure there is no delay in moving to tender.  I reassured parents this week that the change of Minister would not have any impact on that and that the Department will stand ready.  I will stay in touch with the Minister on that one as, I am sure, will the Ceann Comhairle.  Athy community college has been devolved and a service-level agreement has been established with Kildare and Wicklow ETB.  There are now 440 pupils in that school but it was built for 400 and needs to be extended to accommodate 1,000 pupils.  There are prefabricated buildings on site and more are coming while the school is under significant pressure.  We cannot have a delay there.  I am delighted to see the project for Patrician College in Newbridge go to the NDFA.  The next step is planning and design and we must keep pushing because there is significant pressure on school places in the Newbridge-Kildare area.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a delay in the opening of the extension to St. Conleth's and that has had a particular impact on six pupils with mild to moderate intellectual and special educational needs.  This is causing serious distress.  Officials in the Department made the point previously that they would stand with the parents if there were any delays.<\/p><p>The Ceann Comhairle and other public representatives in the area have worked on this matter as well.  What the parents have been offered to date, namely, home tuition, whereby they must find tutors, is not sufficient.  Huge distress has been caused to those parents who thought they would have places in September.  In fairness to the principal of the school, it is not her fault.  She is doing her best to manage a very difficult situation.  I ask that the special education section of the Department give every support to these parents and that we try to get these six pupils into their special accommodation as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800045#VV01300","speaker":"1237","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539879900,"counter":396,"content":"<p>There are a number of schools in the area.

I welcome the fact that we are very close to a final announcement on the need for increased provision beyond these extensions.<\/p>  <p>  The South Kildare Educate Together campaign was established in 2014.  Since then, we have had meetings with two taoisigh, two Ministers for Education and Skills and departmental officials.  Deputy McHugh is the third Minister in the job and we still have not gone away.  There is huge demand from parents in Kildare South who have children at primary level for improved provision of choice at second level as well.  The Department should not be surprised by this demand.  Two Educate Together primary schools were opened a number of years ago in south Kildare.  The Educate Together primary school in Kildare town this year has a sixth class for the first time.  The parents involved travelled to Portlaoise to look at a second-level Educate Together school because they do not have that option in Kildare south, and this need to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of a new school would require all the decisions on the patronage process to be made and site selection and acquisition would take a long time.

Two years ago I stated that one very good fit to work with the Educate Together campaign and to address these issues of pressure on spaces would be to look at the Curragh post-primary school, which absolutely deserves a new building.  There are great staff and students working in very difficult circumstances.  A partnership or joint patronage process with Educate Together and a new school building for the Curragh could deliver increased capacity in an area between two very big towns, Kildare and Newbridge, that are at bursting point.  It could attract pupils from primary schools such as those in Athgarvan, Ballysax and Suncroft and many more in the area that all feed into those towns at present.  This would rejuvenate the area.  It would be a very overdue shot in the arm for the staff and students of that school.  Irrespective of the location of the site and whether the Department of Defence works with us on the provision of a new site on the camp or whether we have a new site outside of the Curragh but in the surrounding area, this is probably the most common-sense approach that would give us that increased capacity as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I have no doubt that the most recent figures the Minister's officials possess - these were compiled at the end of September - show that the pressure the Ceann Comhairle and I and other public representatives have indicated exists in the constituency of Kildare South is very real and will not be offset solely by the extensions that are proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800046#WW00300","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speech","time":1539879900,"counter":398,"content":"<p>The Deputy's observation on the review of the provision of post-primary schools in the general school planning areas of south Kildare is important.

Incredibly, at the beginning of this month, the Department issued a new circular essentially capitulating on all this.

I just wanted to put that on the public record.<\/p>  <p>  In February 2018, my Department published Circular 0013\/2018, which set out an approach to the arrangements that were to be made for religious instruction and worship in education and training board and post-primary community schools.  This arose as a result of concerns that multidenominational education and training board, ETB, schools were requiring attendance at classes with Catholic religious instruction.<\/p>  <p>  Section 4 of the circular provided that the school is required to ascertain parental wishes in respect of the child's attendance at such religious instruction.  Where a parent did not want his or her child to receive religious instruction, the school was required to provide an alternative subject.  Where there was any practice of combining or including religious instruction and formation or worship in the same class time as the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, religious education syllabus, parents were made aware of this fact in order that they could make an informed decision to withdraw their children from that class if this was their wish.<\/p>  <p>  The newly published circular to which the Deputy referred clarifies in section 3 that withdrawal with an offer of an alternative subject does not arise in respect of the NCCA religious syllabus where there is no religious instruction or faith formation.<\/p>  <p>  Religious education is an examinable subject just like history or geography, for example.  It aims to develop students' ability to examine questions of meaning, purpose and relationships, to help students understand, respect and appreciate people's expression of their beliefs and to facilitate dialogue and reflection on the diversity of beliefs and values that inform responsible decision-making and ways of living.  Crucially, it is not delivered from any one religious perspective.<\/p>  <p>  The second important clarification is that where a school intends to provide religious instruction classes, parents must give consent before admission to the class.  This means that the issue of opting out does not arise because the parent has requested a place in the religious instruction class.<\/p>  <p>  This circular has no impact on the right of parents under the Education Act or the Constitution to opt out of any subject for reason of conscience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800046#WW00800","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1539879900,"counter":403,"content":"<p>We need clarification here.

As a former philosophy student at Maynooth University, I agree with the idea that space should be provided within the curriculum for people to address many of the difficult questions we all face on a day-to-day basis.  That does not mean instruction.  There is no religious-specific instruction within the religious education syllabus.  As part of its normal inspection processes, the Department's inspectorate will inspect whether the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment's religious education subject is being delivered in schools in accordance with the requirements of the circular that was published recently.  Schools have discretion in the context of religious education.  They may choose not to offer the subject at all.  If religious education is to be mandatory or optional in any particular class, group or year, it is to be treated the same as all other subjects, such as history or geography, for these purposes.  It is subject to inspection.  I reiterate that religious education is a separate subject.  It does not involve instruction in any one faith or another.  It probably provides an opportunity to broaden the discussion regarding well-being at a time when children and young people have different anxieties and pressures that teachers are dealing with.  At this morning's meeting of the joint committee, we discussed how to make progress in the area of well-being.

At my first philosophy lecture in UCD, a priest who was a member of Opus Dei - there were many of them in the UCD philosophy department - said that before he and his colleagues started to teach us about all the great philosophers, he wanted us to know that Karl Marx, Nietzsche and a whole load of other secular radical philosophers were not philosophers.

Schools have been pleading for capitation increases for many years.  The increase in the recent budget was something, but it was very small.  Capitation grant funding is still well below where it was in 2010.  It is hardly surprising that the INTO has described it as a \"pittance\", given that it equates to just 4.6 cent per student per day.  As the ASTI has stated, the increase will merely keep up with growing student numbers.  It is simply not adequate for the real costs of running schools in Ireland today.  Principals are under huge financial stress as they seek to make the money stretch.  School costs in my constituency of Dublin Rathdown can be higher, but principals have the same amount of money per student to work with as principals in every other part of the country.  Schools are buckling under this weight.  We spoke at the joint committee about relieving the stress that is being experienced by teachers and principals.  The stress in this area could be relieved by means of proper restoration of the capitation grant.  According to the action plan, this was supposed to begin in 2017 and was to happen over three years.  However, it now appears that the first sign of an increase will be in 2019.

I am deeply concerned by the level of violence in Yemen and by reports of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.<\/p>  <p>  Three years of war have had devastating consequences for civilians.  Yemen is now the world's largest humanitarian crisis, with more than 22 million people, or three quarters of the population, requiring some form of humanitarian assistance and approximately 2 million people internally displaced.  The latest report from the UN's humanitarian co-ordinator in Yemen, Ms Lise Grande, sounds an alarm that between 12 million and 13 million Yemeni citizens will be at acute risk of famine in the coming months if the conflict continues.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has provided almost &euro;16.5 million in bilateral humanitarian assistance to Yemen since the conflict began in 2015.  Of this, &euro;4 million was contributed in March to the UN Yemen humanitarian fund.  Ireland pledges global funding to a number of organisations that are particularly active in Yemen, including the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the International Committee of the Red Cross.  Ireland also contributes to EU support for Yemen.  Since the beginning of the conflict in 2015, the EU has allocated more than &euro;438 million to the crisis.  It supports therapeutic feeding centres for the treatment of malnourished children, healthcare, food aid programmes and emergency assistance to displaced populations.<\/p>  <p>  Humanitarian access is a critical issue so that aid can reach those who need it.  There is a pattern of difficulties with this in Yemen.  Commercial access is equally important, since a population of over 20 million people cannot survive on aid alone indefinitely.  This has been one of my consistent messages to all parties involved in the conflict.<\/p><p>Officers from my Department consistently convey the Government&rsquo;s strong concerns to the Saudi, United Arab Emirates and Iranian Embassies in Dublin.  I met the Saudi ambassador this afternoon and stressed the emphasis that Ireland puts on this issue as well as the issue raised by the previous Deputy.<\/p> <p> Both at UN level and in EU discussions on the issue, Ireland has sought at all times to stress that military action will not be sufficient to bring a lasting solution to the conflicts between communities in Yemen.  Military victory, even if it is achievable, will not address the root causes of the conflict.  The pursuit of military victory also brings an unacceptable cost for the Yemeni people on a humanitarian level.  We have seen time and again the tragic results of the errors and recklessness which are endemic to conflict situations.<\/p> <p> Negotiations must be reinvigorated, and Ireland and the EU fully support the work of Martin Griffiths, the UN Special Envoy for Yemen, and his team.  The Government is also vigilant for opportunities to make any progress we can in international fora, including on ensuring accountability for crimes committed during the conflict.  At the Human Rights Council in September 2017, Ireland was part of a small core group of countries that drove forward the adoption by consensus of a resolution establishing a Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen.  I personally worked closely with the Dutch Foreign Minister at the time, Bert Koenders, on this resolution.  The group established is carrying out investigations into all alleged violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all warring parties in Yemen.  Last month, Ireland worked to ensure that the mandate of this group was extended for a year, to allow more time to complete its vital work.<\/p> <p> I assure the Deputies that Ireland will continue to take every appropriate opportunity to urge stronger international action, and will press for a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Yemen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800048#YY01000","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539881700,"counter":434,"content":"<p>There are no angels among states and governments in the Middle East but the Saudi regime is a murderous, brutal, rogue one that is the enemy of democracy.

I am amused that the journalist is getting such coverage and the ordinary people of Yemen are being starved to death.<\/p>  <p>  It has been established by an independent body that the majority of the bombing in Yemen has hit non-military targets.  They are literally bombing food supplies now in order to starve the people.  Whatever about what is going on in Yemen among the different parties in terms of who should be running the country, the bombing has to stop.  The T&aacute;naiste spoke about humanitarian aid.  Give us a break.  The people who are giving humanitarian aid are the same people providing the bombs.  Representatives of M&eacute;dicines Sans Fronti&eacute;res were before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade today.  War is a self-sustaining industry.  We have the Germans, the French, the British and the United States providing the bombs.  The same people who are bombing hospitals are providing funding to rebuild them, thereby creating work.  It is a little like Halliburton making more money in Iraq than some of the bomb makers who dropped the bombs in the first place that caused the destruction.

The assistant CEO of COPE in Galway said that the homeless crisis in Galway is \"unrelenting\" and that, in his 20 years in his role, it is the worst he has ever seen.  I have less than two minutes so I will not elaborate further.  His comments can be read in today's newspapers.<\/p>  <p>  There are people in Galway who have been on housing waiting lists in the city since 2002.  The HAP scheme is the only game in town in Galway.  The last time the local authority built a house was in 2009.  The authority has recently acquired some houses, and earlier this year it completed 14 houses, but these were the first since 2009.  In recent days another young man died on our streets in the curtilage of the city council offices.

He also agreed with me about the acute need to declare an emergency, to put a master plan in place and to ascertain from the local authority where the difficulties lie.  Here we are, almost nine months later and none of that has happened.  I could repeat the same speech again but will not do so.  Since I made that speech, two more people have died, bringing the total in Galway to 25.<\/p>  <p>  I do not like to exaggerate.  I like to stick to the facts.  We have the most acute housing crisis in Galway.  It is worse than Dublin.  People have been waiting since 2002.<\/p>  <p>  I will finish with an email I received today from a parent of three children, two of whom are severely disabled.

This week we learned of the tragic death of a man on the grounds of Galway City Hall on Monday, 15 October.  I join the Taoiseach and others in this House in extending my sympathies and condolences to the family of the man who died.  Clearly, this is a very difficult time for those involved, and I ask that we respect the privacy of the family and do not speculate on the circumstances of the deceased or the cause of his death.<\/p><p>As to the need for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to visit Galway city and to see the housing situation for himself, I assure the Deputies that he is fully cognisant of the housing issues and pressures in Galway city.  The Minister recently visited Galway and held discussions with senior officials in the council on homelessness and wider housing issues.<\/p><p>The Government is increasing the funding to all local authorities to provide services to those experiencing homelessness.  This year the estimated expenditure on homeless services for the west, of which Galway City Council is one of four local authorities, is &euro;5.2 million.  This will increase further in 2019.<\/p><p>Supporting rough sleepers is a particular priority.  Last month, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Minister for Health jointly launched the national implementation plan for Housing First.  Many of those rough sleeping have requirements for significant health supports.  As such, Housing First is a collaboration between the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Health, the HSE and the local authorities.  Housing First recognises that a stable home environment is critical to the success of all other interventions, and by providing the necessary supports alongside rather than in advance of a home, we can empower people to tackle the issues that resulted in them becoming homeless in the first place.<\/p><p>The implementation plan will see this highly effective programme to reduce and end rough sleeping and long-term homelessness extended nationwide.  The plan sets an overall target of more than 660 tenancies, with individual targets for each local authority.  It is one of the most significant responses by the State to date in dealing with long-term homelessness.  Under the plan, 30 Housing First tenancies will be created for Galway city over the next three years, with a further 19 tenancies in Galway county.  A tender process is under way in Galway to deliver these tenancies.<\/p><p>  Supports for families experiencing homelessness in Galway city are also being reinforced.  Galway city&rsquo;s first family hub is due to open in early 2019.  Galway City Council has also identified a site for the roll-out of a modular hub development to be operational in the first half of 2019.  It is expected that 15 families will be accommodated for up to six months at a time on this site, if necessary.The principal advantages of these units are that they are quick to erect on site, portable and redeployable elsewhere.  A place finder service has been put in place, with a dedicated officer funded by the Department, to support households experiencing homelessness in identifying and securing a property in the private rented market.<\/p><p>The long-term solution to homelessness is increasing the supply of homes, as I am sure the Deputies will agree.  A range of measures are being progressed in this regard under Rebuilding Ireland to accelerate all types of housing supply, including social, private and affordable.  By 2021, 50,000 new social houses will be provided and housing output generally will be progressively increased towards the target of producing 25,000 houses per year.  Galway City Council has a target to deliver 145 new social homes in 2018 and about 1,100 between 2018 and 2021 through build, acquisition and leasing initiatives.  In addition, in 2018, a further 254 families or individuals will be housed through the HAP or the rental accommodation scheme.  This will bring the total delivery of social housing supports in 2018 to approximately 400.<\/p><p>Despite all of those numbers, I am well aware of the pressures in Galway.  Those pressures were there when I was the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and they persist.  There are pressures in other cities too.  What we are doing is ensuring that, from a financial perspective, local authorities are supported.  There should be enough emergency accommodation in every town and city in the country for individuals and families who find themselves homeless but, if there is not, we are committed to putting the resources in place to provide such accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800050#AAA00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1539882300,"counter":453,"content":"<p>There is not enough accommodation.

It would make one cry, listening to the people coming into one's office.<\/p>  <p>  I do not want the T&aacute;naiste to get the impression that a large number of the people coming to us looking for somewhere to live are rough sleepers.  Rough sleepers are a small subset of people who need special attention, and I am very well aware of that.  The majority of the people with whom I am dealing do not have social or addiction issues and are not rough sleepers.  They have never slept rough but simply have nowhere to live because we are up to 3,000 units short of the demand in Galway.<\/p>  <p>  There is no emergency accommodation because Galway is a big tourism town, as well as being a university town and a town with a large institute of technology, GMIT.  There is no property available to rent.  The HAP scheme is not the most lucrative market and there are other markets available to property owners.  There are approximately 19 tourist accommodation providers in the city, for example, apart from Airbnb.  There is obviously a strong market in the tourism sector.<\/p>  <p>  We have been told that 1,100 social houses will be built by 2021.  There is one simple step that could be taken tomorrow that will speed up that process.  It is the same step that the Government took when it created Irish Water.  It provided the money to the utility and allowed it to get on with the job.  I cannot understand why local authorities are not being given money at the beginning of the year and being told to do the job.  They should not have to keep going back to the Department for approval time and again, which means that it takes them an average of 59 weeks to get permission to build a house.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800050#AAA00300","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1539882300,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I hope the Chairman will show leniency, given the seriousness of the subject.<\/p>  <p>  While I believe the T&aacute;naiste is genuine and interested, I do not think he realises that it is his Government's policy that is causing the problem.

The Minister has taken a hands-off approach to public transport in Ireland's capital city, where a significant population lives and where people come in from the suburbs all around Dublin, including from my constituency of Dublin West, which includes Blanchardstown, Mulhuddart and Castleknock.  If there was proper investment in public transport, those people would find their commute getting shorter; instead it is getting longer.<\/p>  <p>  The BusConnects proposal has recently been developed.  That proposal, which the Minister was involved in establishing, is seriously flawed.  He said it had nothing to do with him and passed it on.  Communities all over Dublin are left uncertain as to what will happen.<\/p>  <p>  The central part of the BusConnects proposal was, in my view and that of many engineers, premised around the fact that College Green plaza would be implemented and significant numbers of major bus routes would be removed from the city centre.  Those routes were to go down the quays and turn over the Rosie Hackett Bridge and, by other mechanisms, make their way to the south side of the city.<\/p>  <p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la, to which Dublin City Council decided to submit its plans and proposals, stated that the quays are too congested to take much more.  That is clear to anyone who uses the buses daily going up and down the quays, as I do, and I know the Minister is also a bus user.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la saw merit in the plan, but stated the impact, particularly on things like bus services, would be disastrous.<\/p>  <p>  I got details of contracts for consultants relating to transport, presumably authorised in the Minister's capital budget.  For 2017, Jarrett Walker &amp;amp; Associates, the firm which designed BusConnects, is listed as having been paid &euro;407,000.  In 2018 to date, the same firm of consultants is listed as having been paid &euro;208,000.  That is a total of &euro;615,000 in consultancy fees in two years, which is not an inconsiderable sum.  We are now thrown into total confusion.<\/p>  <p>  This relates to the Minister's leadership of his Department.  A hands-off approach is not good enough for Dublin city and the vast population it serves in terms of public transport.  The Minister cannot, like Pontius Pilate, wash his hands of this because he is in the lofty and honourable position of being a Minister.  He cannot say that Dublin city transport has nothing to do with him and refuse to get involved.<\/p>  <p>  This decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la simply adds to the confusion about what will happen in Dublin city centre.  It is a grievous blow to the city, but so too is the Minister's BusConnects programme, which is now out to public consultation.  The topic has been discussed on many occasions in the House.  I do not know what will come back after Christmas because now a central feature of the plan, fewer buses within College Green, has been thrown out by An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the very good reason that there is not enough bus transport and the quays are already too congested.<\/p>  <p>  The proposals the Minister has been flying kites with simply cannot be implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800051#BBB00500","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1539882900,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Burton for raising an issue in terms I have heard before in the House and will no doubt hear again.

The decision is being considered by the council and the National Transport Authority to determine the implications.  From a transport perspective, the proposal was one of a number of measures developed as part of the Dublin City Centre Transport Study, which was a joint initiative by the Council and the National Transport Authority.  The issue of congestion is one which formed the backdrop to that study and forms the backdrop to city centre transport today also.  The measures proposed by the transport study were designed to address the transport issues facing the core city centre area, facilitate the implementation of the Council&rsquo;s development plan and safeguard the future development of the city.<\/p>  <p>  In line with those objectives, the study put forward a number of proposals around an improved public transport offering for the city.  Since the study&rsquo;s publication in 2015, the NTA also published its statutory Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area and we have this year witnessed the publication of the national development plan and now have visibility of the proposed funding allocations over the next ten years.<\/p>  <p>  A number of recently completed projects have already served to improve the capacity and quality of public transport in Dublin.  Since 2015, Luas cross city has opened, heavy rail services have expanded through the re-opening of the Phoenix Park tunnel and ten-minute DART trains have been introduced.<\/p><p>We have invested in improved cycle routes and expanded public bike-sharing schemes.  We have also invested in new bus services and a new fleet and improved passenger experiences through the roll-out of real time passenger information and the continued development of the Leap card.  These are positive developments.  We know that we need to continue to increase our levels of investment in public transport and active travel measures, which we plan to do under the national development plan.  The Deputy will be well aware of the substantial investments planned to improve the bus network and infrastructure through the BusConnects programme to which she referred disparagingly.  The NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland are continuing to plan for MetroLink with a view to construction commencing in 2021 and services being ready to start by 2027.  The NTA is continuing to work with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on the expansion of the DART, which will see the network electrified as far as Drogheda to the north, Maynooth to the west and Hazelhatch to the south west.  The issues underlying the development of the 2015 study remain and the NTA will continue to work with all stakeholders, including the council, to improve public and sustainable transport options in the city centre.<\/p> <p> The Deputy should note that the Government and the Minister set policy, but we also allocate funds.  Not to acknowledge the progress made in the expansion of the DART, with ten minute DART services, the Luas cross-city service, the proposals for BusConnects and the increases in public service obligation, PSO, funding is disingenuous.

It is good of him to come into the House to talk about this vital issue for everybody in the city of Dublin.  The achievements the lists include the study commissioned in 2014 and 2015, the opening of the Luas cross-city service, the expanded heavy rail services as a result of the reopening of the Phoenix Park tunnel and the introduction of ten minute DART services.  I was one of the people who lobbied for for many years for the new Luas service to Broombridge and was particularly involved, as the Acting Chairman knows, in lobbying to have the tunnel under the Phoenix Park reopened.  For the Minister in some way to claim that he has some relationship with these achievements is rather grandiose and history does not support it.  I am delighted that they have all been made and about the real time information application for Dublin Bus.  It precedes the Minister's time in the Department.  I am talking about his time in it, the fact that he seems to have no time at all to get involved in dealing with the slow strangulation happening in Dublin city centre which has a serious impact in places other than Dublin city in Fingal, south Dublin and D&uacute;n-Laoghaire Rathdown.  Each of these council areas has seen huge population growth.  They require more buses and train carriages, particularly on the Maynooth line, electrification to happen much earlier and the College Green issue to be addressed.  The Minister has not told us what his response is as Minister to An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision.  I said the application had been made by Dublin City Council.

Some of the decisions and procedural issues in Caranua raise many questions, with the continuing reports from survivors of abuse on how they have been and are being treated in their interactions with the organisation.  On the \"Today with Sean O'Rourke\" programme last week we again heard some of the human stories behind the fund and the reasons for its establishment.  Of particular concern in the annual report is the lack of information given to applicants on their statutory right to appeal.<\/p>  <p>  Of the &euro;110 million pledged by the religious congregations, &euro;103 million has been received and &euro;80 million expended.  Caranua received 6,109 applications, but 1,195 applicants did not receive support on making an application.  Of most concern is the fact that in the appeals process, of those who appealed, 66% were successful, with 43% of appeals upheld, with others being referred back to Caranua or partially allowed.  There is real concern about the time it took during 2017 to process appeals.  Some 39% took over 52 weeks to process, with only 7% being completed in less than 13 weeks.  Some 23% were completed in 13 to 26 weeks; 20% in 26 to 39 weeks and 10% in 39 to 52 weeks.  These are unsatisfactory timeframes - there were two working appeals officers - and they are very likely to increase now that the second appeals officer has refused to renew their contract and has not yet been replaced.<\/p>  <p>  The sample appeals are particularly shocking and some of the decisions seem to have been plucked out of thin air.  Where are the written guidelines which state only external doors are included?  How are applicants expected to provide the requisite information when they are not even being informed of what the parameters are in decision-making?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800052#CCC01900","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1539883500,"counter":474,"content":"<p>This is another Caranua appeals officer's annual report and another crushing expos&eacute; of the severe dysfunction in an organisation which was set up supposedly to administer a fund for the survivors of institutional abuse and which has, in and of itself, become a vehicle for causing further distress to people who applied for supports such as healthcare and house improvements.  It is a system which has been revealed yet again to be totally arbitrary, inconsistent and bureaucratic when it could involve a simple application form.  It has been adversarial, with a lack of empathy and sympathy being shown.<\/p><p>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy McHugh, on his new job but he is the fourth Minister for Education and Skills with whom we have had to raise this issue.  Year after year the reports point out the patterns and the problems with the administration of the fund and with the way survivors are treated.  As Deputy Broughan said, a clear majority of the refusals by Caranua were subsequently upheld on appeal.  We have to take into account that they are elderly and sick people and time is not on their side.  In almost 40% of the cases, the waiting time for the appeal, which ultimately becomes successful, is more than a year.  That is shocking.  In addition, the failure on behalf of Caranua to implement the reports of previous appeals officers and to deal with the successful appeals is frightening because cases which were successfully appealed as far back as 2014 are waiting on the services that they applied for almost four years ago.<\/p> <p> The question is when this is going to stop and when there will be an end to barriers being put in the way.  People have a statutory right to this fund.  Today, there are still 2,449 applications in the system awaiting a decision.  Are they going to go into the backlog as well?

It is a broad one relating to Caranua's 2017 annual report and the appeals process, so I have a fairly broad answer, but there are statistics and bits of information that might be relevant to the discussion.<\/p><p>Caranua is an independent statutory body established in 2013 under the provisions of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund, RISF, Act 2012 to utilise the &euro;110 million cash contributions pledged by the congregations to support the needs of survivors of residential institutional child abuse.  It is entirely funded by those contributions and no Exchequer funding is involved.  The board adopted the service name Caranua in October 2013 and set up a website, .  Section 22 of the RISF Act provides for a right of appeal against decisions made by Caranua.  Mr. Pat Whelan, the first appeals officer, was appointed to that position in 2014 with further one-year periods in 2015 and 2016.  Two appeals officers, Ms Geraldine Gleeson and Mr. Brendan O'Leary, were appointed in May 2017 to deal with a backlog of cases that had built up.  The 2017 annual report, which is Ms Gleeson's and Mr. O'Leary's first report, covers the period 15 May 2017 to 30 April 2018.  The report was published on 4 October 2018.<\/p><p>There were 140 cases outstanding when they took up their position and they received an additional 87 appeals between May 2017 and April 2018, giving a total of 227 appeals for consideration.  A total of 193 cases were completed during this reporting period, leaving 34 appeals on hand.  The report confirms that of the 193 cases completed between May 2017 and April 2018, 83 or 43% were upheld, that is, the original decision on the application was revoked by the appeals officer; 18 cases, which is 9%, were partially upheld; and 26 cases or 14% were referred back to Caranua for reconsideration in accordance with specific directions from the appeals officer.  A total of 54 cases, 28%, were not upheld, that is, the original decision was affirmed by the appeals officer; and 12 cases, 6%, were either discontinued or withdrawn.<\/p><p>Of the 87 additional appeals received during the period covered by this report, 26 related to home improvements or repairs, 22 related to personal well-being and health matters, 15 related to household and personal items, eight were for funeral expenses, seven were for education, four for eligibility, four for travel or transport, and one for financial assistance.<\/p><p>The two appeals officers were appointed in May 2017 for a one-year term.  For personal reasons, one of the appeals officers decided not to accept reappointment to the position.  Given that the number of appeals on hand is manageable by one appeals officer, I do not intend to appoint a second appeals officer at this time but the situation will be monitored.  I take on board what was said here tonight in that regard.<\/p><p>To date, costs amounting to &euro;82,200 have been incurred in relation to the work of the appeals officers.  Administrative support is provided by a Department official.  The annual report addresses a number of specific policy issues, including issues raised in previous annual reports.  The perception that Caranua made an administrative decision to refuse to process further applications from applicants, on the basis that they had received support and services, in favour of those who had not yet applied or received support was a core issue of previous annual reports.  Caranua's position is that it must manage the fund so that it can be shared fairly among all people who can apply to it.  This policy issue is primarily a matter for the board of Caranua.  Decisions of the appeals officer may be appealed to the High Court on a point of law.  One such appeal was initiated in 2017 by the board of Caranua.  The case centred on the personal allocation limit introduced by Caranua in the revised guidelines published in June 2016.  Based on the legal advice received, the case was settled by the appeals officers.  There is ongoing litigation in the High Court, with seven cases being taken against the appeals officers on the grounds that the personal allocation limit of &euro;15,000 should not be applied retrospectively where the applicant has received funding for services from Caranua.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800053#DDD00200","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1539884100,"counter":477,"content":"<p>Given the lack of intervention on these worrying reports by the Minister's predecessors, including the previous Minister, Deputy Bruton, it is very disappointing that the Minister has said he does not intend to appoint a second appeals officer now.

Mr. Tom Cronin and Dr. Mary Lodato, both survivors of institutional abuse, resigned from the board of Caranua, citing their concerns over the treatment of survivors.

I thank the committee staff for their work in putting together this report.  In particular, I wish to acknowledge the work of Catherine McCarthy in assisting the committee.<\/p><p>This is the first opportunity we have had to hold a substantive debate on gender budgeting.  The committee engaged with several stakeholders during the past two years on the equality budgeting agenda.  They highlighted the important role that the Committee on Budgetary Oversight can play in improving the budgetary process by scrutinising the impact of various budget measures on different groups in society.  In the course of its work the committee met the National Women's Council of Ireland, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, Social Justice Ireland, Mental Health Reform, Inclusion Ireland, the Disability Federation of Ireland and the Irish Wheelchair Association.  We also received assistance from the Parliamentary Budget Office and officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, who provided useful evidence about the practical challenges involved in implementing an equality budgeting pilot programme.<\/p><p>A Programme for a Partnership Government made commitments to develop the process of budget and policy proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights.  It states that arrangements will be put in place to support budget proofing within key Departments.  In this regard the role of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight is to encourage greater transparency in the budget process and to monitor progress in rolling out gender and equality budgeting in Ireland.<\/p><p>One may ask what is gender budgeting.  At its most simple, it is a way of assessing budgets from a gender perspective and looking at how they impact specifically on men and women.  In other words, gender budgeting examines the impact of budgetary measures on individuals and groups.  In practice, gender budgeting can be achieved by asking a number of key questions: what impact does this fiscal measure have on gender equality; and does it increase it, decrease it or leave it unchanged.  It is only by using these questions as a framework for budget scrutiny and budget policy formulation that we will progress to fully gender and equality-proofed budgets.<\/p><p>Equality budgeting is particularly important.  The D&aacute;il should note that gender budgeting is advocated by a number of international organisations, including the OECD and the World Bank.  They argue that there are many historical inequalities between the sexes and that budgets are not usually framed with issues such as the reduction of gender inequality in mind.  Today, almost half of OECD countries are carrying out different types of gender assessment relating to the budget.  Nevertheless, cultural change is required.  This is definitely the case in the Irish context.  The members of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight are keen to assist in leading that cultural change.  International evidence suggests civil servants and politicians need to recognise that the budget is not a gender-neutral exercise.  That was the thinking up until recent decades.  Such thinking is even reflected in the present day, and we can see evidence of that thinking in the present day in some Departments.  For example, many of the chapters in the 2018 tax strategy group papers contain a single line statement regarding the gender and equality implication of various proposed tax measures.  Most of these statements simply state that there are no specific gender or equality implications with regard to a particular fiscal measure.<\/p><p>Many gender equality experts have cited this so-called veil of neutrality as one of the obstacles to implementing gender budgeting and putting women on an equal economic footing.  In a recent study on gender equality, Dr. Angela O'Hagan explained that for gender budgeting to be truly transformative there needs to be recognition that women have had and continue to have an unequal economic status in society and, therefore, public policy must seek to redress the undervalued, underpaid, under-represented and unequal status of women currently and historically.  This is one of the main goals of equality budgeting.<\/p><p>While the committee recognises the challenges involved in implementing gender budgeting processes, it also believes that the benefits to Irish society far outweigh the difficulties.  The substantial benefits include improved economic performance, improved design and transparency of budget measures, good governance and, crucially, increased confidence in Government.<\/p><p>Where does the improved economic performance come from?  Gender budgeting is not a new concept.  Research has established the link between equality and economic growth.  For example, in 2014 an IMF note stated:<\/p><blockquote>The Fund has recognized in recent years that one cannot separate issues of economic growth and stability on one hand and equality on the other.  Indeed, there is a strong case for considering inequality and an inability to sustain economic growth as two sides of the same coin.<\/blockquote><p>The European Institute for Gender Equality carried out a study in 2017 to estimate the socioeconomic impact of improved gender equality.  The study found that improving gender equality across the EU could potentially result in 10.5 million additional jobs by 2050.  That would represent an increase in GDP <i>per capita<\/i>of almost 10% by 2050.<\/p><p>The benefits of gender budgeting extend beyond simply economic performance.  Implementing gender budgeting processes can also help to achieve broader aims of budgetary reform.  In its report, Towards Gender Responsive Budgeting in Ireland, the National Women's Council of Ireland stated that gender budgeting was good budgeting as it could help to increase accountability, transparency, effectiveness and efficiency of the budget formulation process.  The report said it could also help to avoid the expense and time required to reverse unequal policy measures.  One such example of an unequal policy measure was the change to the pension bands in 2012, which had a negative impact on female pensions in particular.<\/p><p>The committee's report also highlights the fact that countries with larger numbers of women in ministerial positions or in parliament tend to have lower levels of inequality and a high level of confidence in Government.  We noted OECD research which found that increasing the number of female policy-makers can result in a more balanced approach to policy design and service delivery.<\/p><p>The key recommendation of the committee's report was an equality budgeting statement.  The report went to the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform requesting that he should produce such an equality statement as part of budget 2019 and that such a statement should be read out in conjunction with the budget document.  The report recommended that the equality budgeting statement should set out broad and ambitious strategic gender equality goals.  These strategic goals should be linked to the gender equality performance indicators, objectives and targets chosen by Departments for inclusion in the equality budgeting initiative.  This would advance the integration of gender and, over time, other aspects of equality budgeting into the annual budget process.  This recommendation was made in line with international best practice.  For example, in Scotland an annual equality budget statement provides analysis that gives citizens useful information on assessing the equality impact of various budget measures.<\/p><p>In the recent budget the Minister referred to equality and gender budgeting in a risible way and in a rather limited paragraph contribution to his Budget Statement.  The committee welcomes the Minister's commitment to make further progress to broaden the pilot project he mentioned to encompass other dimensions of equality.  The committee also agrees that the establishment of the expert advisory group committed to by the Minister will provide further guidance in this area.  However, the committee was disappointed to note that the Minister was not in a position to provide an equality budgeting statement as part of budget 2019 and that he has not responded to the committee's recommendations in this regard.<\/p><p>The committee calls on the Minister to commit to producing a full equality budget statement to be read alongside budget 2020.  The introduction of an equality budget statement would represent a significant milestone for Ireland as it would be the first of its kind.  It would place the issue of gender equality on a more prominent footing and would cement the Government&rsquo;s commitment to enhancing equality in Irish society and improving budgetary reform and transparency.<br\/><br\/>The committee welcomes the introduction of an equality budgeting pilot programme in respect of voted expenditure and the corresponding performance of the public services.  However, the committee does not believe that the pilot programme is sufficiently detailed or ambitious.  The committee recommends that the Parliamentary Budget Office's analysis of the equality budgeting pilot programme and constructive feedback contained in its analysis should be used by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to improve the pilot in the six Departments involved.<br\/><br\/>Another important point highlighted by the National Women's Council of Ireland and other gender equality experts is that the lack of disaggregated data is a key barrier to implementation of a gender budgeting process.  Therefore, the committee recommends that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform put a system in place to help the six pilot Departments identify and record gaps in available budget data.  The committee also recommends that officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform appear before it in due course to discuss the results of its annual review of the equality budgeting pilot programme.  This continued dialogue will ensure that there is continued progress to build on the work of the pilot programme.<br\/><br\/>The committee believes that successful equality budgeting involves bringing together gender equality expertise and expertise in public finance management.  As a result, it recommends the establishment of a dedicated unit within each of the six Departments participating in the equality budgeting pilot programme.<br\/><br\/>The committee also received evidence from representatives of disability groups which emphasised the importance of assessing the equality impact of budget measures on different equality groups, including disabled persons.  The committee hopes that the equality budgeting pilot can be extended, over time, to other aspects of equality budgeting.<br\/><br\/>In terms of developments since the publication of the committee's report in May, we received an excellent presentation from Dr. Claire Keane and Barra Roantree from the ESRI, who showed how budgets can be gender proofed in the future.  The ESRI&rsquo;s simulating welfare and income tax changes, SWITCH, model is widely used at budget time to examine the tax benefit policy changes that have happened and on whom they have impacted.  However, the model only examines the impact on socioeconomic groups.  In a project funded by the Parliamentary Budget Office, the SWITCH model was recently updated.  Improvements to the model mean that it can now be used to examine the impact of tax benefit policies according to gender.  This updated model is a positive development and offers a very practical example of gender proofing in practice.<br\/><br\/>I will give a few examples of the SWITCH model being adapted to the budget in terms of gender equality.  In the context of budgetary policy between 2008 and 2018, when it used the SWITCH model, the ESRI discovered that female lone parents lost out by more than other singles.  When we consider the assumption that couples do not fully pool their incomes, we discover that working-age married women lost significantly more than working-age married men.  Most income losses and most of the gender differences in income losses occurred during the austerity period, whereas fewer differences between the impact of budgetary policy on men and women were observed in the recovery period from 2013 to 2018.  The committee, therefore, strongly supports the use of the updated SWITCH model to carry out ex-post analysis of budget 2019.  Given that the updated model has been made available to Departments, we strongly believe that it should be used to carry out <i>ex-ante<\/i>analysis of key budget measures ahead of budget 2020.  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight also recommends in its report to the Minister for Finance that, arising out of the Scottish experience, a report be commissioned into the role of women in the economy.<br\/><br\/>The committee is committed to its work in continuing to progress, promote and monitor the integration of gender budgeting and other gender equality measures into the annual budget process.  The committee believes that by having these tools available to analyse the impact of different budget options in future, we can hopefully try to avoid policy decisions which have an adverse impact on women.<br\/><br\/>In the context of our recommendations concerning commissioning a report into the role of women in the economy, the Minister has not responded to that suggestion and he has not responded to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight report on gender budgeting, even though it was submitted to him in May.  That is my report on behalf of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800054#EEE00200","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539885300,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I am taking the debate on behalf of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the Committee on Budgetary Oversight report on gender budgeting.  In the past two years, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been working to advance equality budgeting, and the committee&rsquo;s report on gender budgeting contributes to progressing this important work.<\/p>  <p>  Gender and equality budgeting has been a significant part of the committee&rsquo;s work programme, and the report makes ten recommendations in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The ongoing work facilitated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding gender and equality budgeting continues to address many of the report&rsquo;s recommendations and demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to build on the equality budgeting initiative.  The Government&rsquo;s work regarding equality budgeting stems from a commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to develop \"the process of budget and policy proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights\".<\/p>  <p>  Equality budgeting involves providing greater information on the likely impacts of proposed and-or ongoing budgetary measures, which, in turn, enhance the potential to better facilitate the integration of equality concerns into the budgetary process and enhance the Government&rsquo;s decision-making framework.  While inequality is traditionally viewed through the prism of economic inequality alone, equality budgeting goes further in identifying contrasting outcomes in areas such as health and education, and how these outcomes differ across gender, age, ethnicity and those other characteristics which distinguish our society&rsquo;s cohorts.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform announced details of the equality budgeting pilot programme for the 2018 budgetary cycle.  This pilot, which is anchored in the existing performance budgeting framework, is currently under way.  For this first cycle of equality budgeting, a number of diverse policy areas have been selected, with associated objectives and indicators published in the Revised Estimates Volume 2018 last December.  Six streams were identified, with five of those focusing on gender.  Progress towards achieving these targets was reported on in the public service performance report published in April.<\/p>  <p>  The committee&rsquo;s report recommends that the gender budgeting focus of the equality budgeting pilot be expanded to other equality dimensions.  The Minister outlined in his Budget Statement last week the commitment to advancing equality budgeting and expanding the initiative to other dimensions of equality, including socioeconomic inequality.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise that getting a wide range of opinions is crucial to progress this work effectively.  To support this expansion, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has established an equality budgeting expert advisory group, including representatives from the National Economic and Social Council, the Central Statistics Office, the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the ESRI and academia, as well as the Departments of Finance, Justice and Equality and Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  This group will provide expert knowledge and advice on the most effective way to advance equality budgeting policy and progress the initiative.<\/p>  <p>  Strong stakeholder engagement remains central to the work regarding gender and equality budgeting.  The expert advisory group has a significant role in this, as does the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform continues to liaise closely with key stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  In developing Irish equality budgeting policy we also looked at international best practice.  A number of countries have begun to develop frameworks in this area.  The Austrian, Scottish, Icelandic and Canadian models, among others, were examined.  Although many of these approaches are relatively new, it is useful to see the methodology and common themes that have been adopted.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is currently working closely with a number of line Departments to identify new measures for the 2019 phase of equality budgeting.  As I said earlier, we are building on the gender dimension and expanding to other areas, including socioeconomic inequality.<\/p><p>This is in parallel to other more long-term work.  As outlined in the committee&rsquo;s report, there is a need systematically to identify and record relevant data gaps.  The ongoing work of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in areas such as performance budgeting and the spending review seeks to address the issue of gaps in relation to data on the outputs and outcomes of public expenditure.<\/p> <p> Awareness and implementation of equality budgeting is also key in order to refine and improve the selected indicators as outlined in the committee&rsquo;s report.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform continues to work closely with line Departments and will undertake awareness-raising measures to maximise the application and impact of equality budgeting policy.<\/p> <p> There are a number of established practices and procedures in place in Ireland that facilitate the consideration of likely equality impacts on proposed and-or ongoing budgetary processes and measures.  These include distributional analysis where the Departments of Finance and Employment Affairs and Social Protection carry out an ex post impact assessment of the main tax and social welfare measures introduced in any budget.  The development of a social impact assessment, SIA, framework has taken place, which is designed to focus on policy areas that cannot easily be incorporated into the existing SWITCH model, specifically the impacts of public expenditure on recipient households.  The framework allows evaluators assess how changes in public expenditure policy can impact on household incomes and living standards.  Seven papers have been published under the SIA series to date, five of which were published on budget day, including on female labour force participation and targeted childcare supports.<\/p> <p> The introduction of equality budgeting has highlighted many issues and identified many areas which need further work.  In this regard, and in line with the recommendations in the report, I look forward to working with the committee in further developing gender and equality budgeting.<\/p> <p> I thank Deputy Lahart for presenting the report.  In respect of his comments on the issues that need to be drawn to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, I commit to doing that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800055#FFF00200","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539885900,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Tommy Broughan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800056#GGG00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1539885900,"counter":489,"content":"<p>As a member of the-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800056#GGG00300","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1539885900,"counter":490,"content":"<p>Are Deputies Broughan and Burton sharing time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800056#GGG00400","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1539885900,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I am not aware.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800056#GGG00500","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1539885900,"counter":492,"content":"<p>No.  I did indicate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800056#GGG00600","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1539885900,"counter":493,"content":"<p>Deputy Broughan's name was in first.

Gender and equality budgeting have been major priorities for our work.  I was of course disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, did not present a gender budgeting report alongside budget 2019 on 9 October last, as is recommended in the report before us.<\/p>  <p>  I am grateful to the clerk of the committee, Mr Ronan Murphy, our policy adviser and economist, Ms Catherine McCarthy, and our administrative officer, Ms Miriam Plunkett, for all their work in bringing this important report before us.  Thanks are also due to Ms Annette Connolly, director, and her staff in the Parliamentary Budget Office and finally, of course, to Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, Deputy Colm Brophy and all my colleagues on the committee.<\/p>  <p>  We were delighted to have such a range of distinguished stakeholders present to the committee on gender and equality budgeting.  We met with the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland, the financial scrutiny unit of the Scottish Parliament, the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Disability Federation of Ireland, and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  We also had representation from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and, of course, the Parliamentary Budget Office.  The committee&rsquo;s policy adviser, Ms Catherine McCarthy, travelled to Germany to attend a conference by the European Institute for Gender Equality on gender budgeting and we also examined experiences of the Basque country and Austria.  Senator Alice Mary Higgins played an important role in initiating the work which led to this report.  I recall a very early meeting that Senator Higgins arranged with Scottish parliamentary colleagues, which Deputy Boyd Barrett and I also attended.<\/p>  <p>  Diane Elson in her 2001 paper, \"Strengthening Economic and Financial Governance through Gender Budgeting\", defines gender budgeting as trying to \"analyse any form of public expenditure or methods of raising public money from a gender perspective, identifying the implications and impacts for women and girls as compared to men and boys.\"  Professor Elson also notes that the practical steps needed to gender-proof budgets include assessing what impact any fiscal measure has on gender equality and determining whether it reduces, increases or leaves gender equality unchanged.<\/p>  <p>  Austria is one of just three countries worldwide that has enshrined the concept of gender budgeting into the constitution.  The nation, states and communes of Austria have to assess each chapter of their budgets on a gender equality outcome basis.  Of course, the Austrian budget committee carries out ex ante scrutiny of gender outcomes on each proposed budget and its court of audit, which is like our Committee of Public Accounts, does the ex post assessment.<\/p>  <p>  As we learned at the meeting organised by Senator Higgins and subsequently from the Scottish financial scrutiny unit, Scotland&rsquo;s budgets since 2009 have been accompanied by an equality budget statement and the Scottish Government is working on a gender index for Scotland.  In 2014, the Scottish Government also commissioned the Sawer review which sets out an action plan to address the inequalities facing women in Scotland.<\/p>  <p>  In our report on gender budgeting, the committee notes the initiative of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in rolling out a pilot programme to progress equality budgeting in Ireland.  The programme, of course, involved six Departments, namely Transport, Tourism and Sport; Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht; Children and Youth Affairs; Education and Skills; Health; and Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  Gender equality objectives and indicators from those Departments have been also published in the revised Estimates volume for 2018.  The committee report notes the launch of the pilot programme but many constituents feel the programme could have been much more far-reaching and ambitious to speed up the attainment of full gender equality in national budgets and in the workforce.<\/p>  <p>  The budgetary oversight committee rightly draws attention to lacunae and gaps in the pilot which were researched and highlighted to us by both the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland and the Parliamentary Budget Office.  Our report emphasises that metrics in the programme were not clearly linked to expenditure.  That is a key point as such a link is needed for this kind of programme.  The key high-level metrics for large financial allocations are not linked to the activities and expenditure of each Department in question.  Clearly, as the report concludes, the formatting and presentation of pilot metrics and targets could be significantly improved.  It is deplorable that a key recommendation of the National Women's Council of Ireland, the publication of an equality budget statement to sit alongside the budget statement itself - and the reading of such a statement by the Minister - was not accepted or acted on by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, for budget 2019.  I believe we should also adopt the recommendation of the National Women's Council of Ireland that gender budgeting be placed on a statutory basis, perhaps indeed underpinned by a constitutional amendment.<\/p>  <p>  The analysis in our committee report reflects on the challenges and difficulties presented by a gender budgeting process.  In particular, the collection of sex-disaggregated data, as begun, for example, by Israel in 2008, is critical to the successful roll-out of gender budgeting for the future.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s request to Departments involved in the pilot programme to identify and log where data deficiencies exist is an important first step but the committee report rightly asks for much more to be done in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  When the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, engaged with the committee, I also asked him if the Department of Finance and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would utilise the ESRI SWITCH model to invigilate the gender impact of budgetary measures in budget 2019.  Regrettably, he replied that his was not possible for budget 2019.  However, I commend the initiative of the Parliamentary Budget Office in commissioning the ESRI to examine the expansion of the capacity of the SWITCH model to include effective scrutiny of the gender impact of budgetary measures in Ireland.  I note that ESRI informed the committee that a pilot project ESRI carried out for the Equality Authority and Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in 2014 looked at the gender impact of tax and benefit changes and showed how the SWITCH model could be extended to provide a gender impact assessment.  ESRI, of course, reported that working-age, lone parents who are predominantly female are significantly more exposed to changes in tax policy and benefits than other cohorts.  Dr. Claire Keane and Dr. Barra Roantree of ESRI presented to the committee last month and gave us a valuable insight into the work of ESRI&rsquo;s tax-benefit SWITCH model.  They showed how gender-based divisions of work and caring roles result in differences in incomes and benefits received and how differences in work and PRSI contribution histories can also deeply affect welfare payment rates and whether an individual even qualifies for a benefit in the first place.<\/p>  <p>  The committee report also highlights the Scottish Government&rsquo;s equality and budgetary advisory group and the Austrian system of performance budgeting, which allows priorities such as gender equality budgeting to be included.  Briefing paper No. 4 of the Parliamentary Budget Office, \"The Gender and Equality Budgeting Pilot in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2018\", has been also of great assistance to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  The Parliamentary Budget Office report shows that only just over &euro;1.8 million in total was spent on the six departmental programmes and that \"there is scope for building upon and enhancing the metrics and indicators employed in the pilot\".<\/p>  <p>  The Parliamentary Budget Office is also right to stress that gender budgeting should address specific and identifiable goals and that further development of this pilot is, of course, necessary.  Massive development of the pilot is required.  The Parliamentary Budget Office also stressed that high-level metrics provided within the pilots are not clearly linked to specific allocations at subhead level and that pilot goal, metrics and indicators are difficult to distinguish from pre-existing programme metrics.  If one looks at the programmes, one can see that is the case.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, the pilot programme includes laudable aims including increasing the number of female apprentices, increasing female participation at all levels of sport, achieving gender balance in scientific research teams, improved participation by women in the film industry and the media, and much more affordable childcare.<\/p><p>The critique of the Parliamentary Budget Office and our committee report clearly show, however, how much more rigorous analysis is needed for much more ambitious gender equality programmes in all Departments.<br\/><br\/>The Committee on Budgetary Oversight report quotes from the IMF that &quot;the Fund has recognized in recent years that one cannot separate the issues of economic growth and stability on the one hand and equality on the other&quot;.  The report also correctly quotes the study of the European Institute for Gender Equality which found in 2017 that greater gender equality across the EU could result in 10.5 million additional jobs by 2050 and an increase in GDP <i>per capita<\/i>of almost 10% by 2050, and that it could be a major economic instrument to address some of the demographic challenges facing Europe.  The OECD Deputy Secretary General, Ms Mari Kiviniemi, also quoted an OECD estimate that a 50% reduction in the gender gap in labour market participation would lead to a 6% increase in GDP by 2030.  To put it more simply, in the words of the song by Bobbie McGee, &quot;Bread and Roses&quot;, &quot;the rising of the women means the rising of the race&quot;.  I am sure the Acting Chairman knows that song.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800056#GGG01600","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539886500,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I am tired of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800057#HHH00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1539886500,"counter":505,"content":"<p>He probably sang it many times as he went marching and demonstrating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800057#HHH00300","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1539886500,"counter":506,"content":"<p>Waving the red flag.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800057#HHH00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1539886500,"counter":507,"content":"<p>With those caveats, I am delighted to support the recommendations of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.

In terms of gender organisation of the D&aacute;il, many of my women colleagues have young children and probably have a better place to be late on a Thursday evening than be here in the D&aacute;il to speak.  Had there been some more gender sensitivity with the time chosen, it might have been possible for many more of our valued women colleagues in the D&aacute;il to contribute to this debate and perhaps bring some flavour of personal knowledge to the debate.  The issue is quite personal to many women and potentially very important.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the debate.  That a discussion on an element of gender equality has taken place here is a step forward in the year of the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote.  Countess Markievicz said she devoted her life to trying to ensure that women got freedom and equality, particularly and obviously in Ireland.  She also joined causes with women throughout the world.  It is important for us to use the knowledge and learning gained by women around the world to pursue a broad objective of essentially creating a more inclusive society, which includes women as equals in what the society does and as equals in what Parliament proposes and disposes.<\/p>  <p>  The three previous speakers concentrated mainly on a technical discussion of gender budgeting.  Some of the language is challenging enough to understand.  It is technical language.  I would like us to use language that is available to all women and men regardless of their education levels.<\/p>  <p>  My professional background is in accounting.  I start with a basic accounting concept about accounts: what should accounts do?  A set of accounts or accounting reports should seek to give a true and fair view of what has happened, what the resources are used for, and in terms of current accounting, what the outcomes have been and whether those outcomes have been fair.  True and fair should be the objectives of gender budgeting.  It would tell us how resources are disbursed in terms of fairness between men, women and children and between different groups in society.  For example, people may need additional support from the State because they have a disability, whether they are men or women.  In economic and ethical terms, it is quite a useful concept to adopt as a fresh way of looking at budgetary arithmetic.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2019 contained a few standout things that indicated that gender budgeting did not get significant consideration.  For the third year in a row there has been no increase in child benefit.  As we know, child benefit is one of the social welfare payments which is paid directly to the caring parent, usually the mother.  For the third year in a row in this period of restoration following a very severe collapse of the economy, nothing has been done by either of the two big parties for women who, while not the only caregivers, are very often the principal caregivers for children in a family.  Child benefit is a very important payment, but the Government saw fit not to go near it.<\/p>  <p>  The domiciliary care allowance is paid usually to the caring parent in the case of a child who is assessed as having special needs.  For the third year in a row, nothing was done with that very important payment.  As Dr. Keane of the ESRI told the Committee on Budgetary Oversight some time ago, carers are largely women.  In about 70% of families in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance, which is a very significant proportion, one of the parents, usually the mother, goes on to be a full-time carer supported by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  These are just small things, and I would have liked to have seen gender analysis of those aspects of the budget.<\/p>  <p>  Other things stand out in our experience of society.  Multiple reports on housing by Government and NGOs show that many families experiencing homelessness comprise children with one parent caring on their own, with most of those families headed by women.  This is a very significant group experiencing serious difficulties with homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  Travellers, especially Traveller women and children, often experience very serious issues with income adequacy, access to education, employment and training.  If we were building the kind of true and fair view we would try to give of society, these are some of the areas that might be considered for inclusion in a gender budgeting statement.  I regret that the Minister, perhaps for technical reasons, could not find the time to include that in the budget.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, Senator Bacik, has brought a Bill through the Seanad on the gender pay gap.  That is very important legislation.<\/p><p>When that gender pay gap Bill comes before the D&aacute;il, I hope Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the other parties and Independents who are represented here will find it possible to address the gender pay gap and we can agree to go forward on a coherent basis.<\/p> <p> With regard to the various studies presented to the committee, in the time I have left I want to say that while the ESRI paper was very good, the SWITCH model is very old.  When I was Minister for Social Protection, a lot of money was given to the ESRI to improve the model but it is still not good enough to present us with the sufficiently detailed picture that we want in terms of people accepting the gender budgeting report.  Some consideration will have to be given by the Minister for Finance to funding the ESRI to improve the SWITCH model so the data examination that is referenced in a whole series of papers as being essential to good quality gender budgeting can be carried out because it cannot be currently.  I can observe, as can everybody else here, when there are more men than women in a room, as there are here now.  I can observe, when a delegation comes in from the Department of Finance, that they are all male.  This tells me something about the role of women in this country and in this Parliament.  The SWITCH model is very important.  I ask the Minister of State to tell the senior Minister that it is important there is investment in this because it will yield good results.<\/p> <p> There are very simple examples around gender-type investments.  For example, do we want to lower speeds in estates so women with small children in buggies can safely let the children out to play and the risk of accident is reduced?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800057#HHH00600","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539887100,"counter":510,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800058#JJJ00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1539887100,"counter":511,"content":"<p>That is not only very important to families but it has a huge value to society.

I agree with Deputy Burton that some of it is quite technical, necessarily so when it comes down to trying to disaggregate information to see how budgets and budgetary allocations impact on women, on different genders, on different groups, such as people with disability, ethnic groups, Travellers, or on any sector of society, given there are obviously different social and economic groups in society.  Why is it important to do that?  Probably the best case for why we need to do it was set out in the book, <i>The Spirit Level<\/i>, written a number of years ago, where the authors gathered a lot of evidence to show that societies where there is greater equality do better at every single level imaginable.  Societies where there are greater levels of equality have better community and social relations, better mental health, better physical health, longer life expectancy, less obesity, less violence, less imprisonment and better economic growth.

I appreciate that.  Fair play to him.  What we just saw was extremely disrespectful.<\/p>  <p>  Equality is good for our society.  Obviously, gender equality is critical in so far as 50% of the world's population suffer systematic discrimination and oppression and are disproportionately impacted by poverty, war and all of the injustices and inequalities that exist in our world, given these disproportionately impact on women.  If women do not have equality, our entire society suffers.  It is imperative for the good of all that we have real equality for women, as part of a fight for greater equality in society generally, because we will live in a better world and have a better future if we achieve that.<\/p>  <p>  The way budgeting has been done to date is frustrating because it does not seem to have any particular objective at all, and it is only with this discussion that we are beginning to address that.  For example, I do not know, going into any budget, what exactly the point is of the budget.  There does not seem to be any particular point other than to play by certain fiscal rules or to balance books just for the sake of it, or for a thing called economic growth, the benefits of which are a little difficult to ascertain when we live in a country which has the highest levels of economic growth in Europe, yet has a massive housing crisis, a massive health crisis, cannot deal with climate change and has an education system in serious trouble, as our universities tumble down the international rankings and we have the most overcrowded classrooms in the Western world.  It makes one wonder what exactly is the connection between the Moses and prophets of economic growth and the actual quality of life of our citizens.  Equality budgeting focuses on that and says there should be a point to a budget, and that point should be to have a better society, which means a more equal society, and to address inequalities.  One of the biggest inequalities of them all is gender inequality, so it is critical we go down this road.  Senator Alice-Mary Higgins has been commended and I should add my voice to that commendation for her efforts in bringing this issue forward.<\/p>  <p>  What if we had these kinds of impact assessments on the consequences of gender inequality and other forms of inequality in our society over the last ten years?<\/p><p>I do not know if things would have been different, but we certainly would have had greater evidence to argue against some of what happened.  It is deeply ironic that the Deputy who has just left was the Minister for Social Protection when precisely the most savage attacks on women in Irish society took place, in particular in the 2012 budget.  This is from the ESRI, not just us.  We said it at the time the attacks were launched, in particular the attacks on single parents with the cuts to child benefit, the income disregard for single mothers, rent allowance, with disastrous consequences, and the capital housing budgets.  One can go through the list.  There were cuts to jobseeker's allowance for young people under 26 years of age.  All of this happened in 2012.  The ESRI has confirmed with the application of the newly adapted SWITCH model, which takes into account gender impacts, that single mothers suffered the worst while working mothers in couples with children were hit the second worst.  These savage attacks had a huge impact on our society generally, increasing poverty and deprivation, and the worst victims were single parents and mothers generally.  Where is some acknowledgement of the damage that was done?  There might have been an argument about it having to be done, which I would not accept, but at least some acknowledgement of the damage done to some of the most vulnerable women by those who implemented those attacks at the time would be welcome.<\/p> <p> It is disappointing that the Government did not take on the recommendation for a gender impact statement in the budget.  We need to have that.  It is something that can be done in a simplified way.  This is where we have to think about it.  We must consider how to make it simple and digestible for people to understand the impacts on different groups.  To some extent, it is already done at the back of the budget book where examples are given of the social and economic impact of different budgetary measures.  For example, one sees the impact on a public sector worker earning the average industrial wage.  The example is also given of the impact on a self-employed person in the private sector who earns a particular income.  We need to have various metrics covering the different impacts of certain budgetary measures and to put those together in a digestible form to allow people to understand the effects on different groups, including women, about whom we are speaking today, but also persons with disabilities who constitute another group on whom the impact of budgetary measures is something we desperately need to quantify.  People with disabilities are another group who suffered quite savagely as a result of the austerity cuts of the past seven or eight years.<\/p> <p> I conclude on that and within my time as the Acting Chairman, Deputy Durkan, will be glad to know.  I congratulate those who produced the report.  I hope the Government is taking this stuff on board and will take it seriously.  It will benefit all of us.  It will benefit women and groups who suffer inequality and oppression.  It will benefit our entire society and make for a better future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800058#JJJ02000","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539887700,"counter":530,"content":"<p>By way of introduction to the debate and notwithstanding the fact that many people say self praise is no praise, I note as a relatively new member of the House and as the newest member of the Budgetary Oversight Committee how commendable are its staff and members in respect of the work they do.  The potential of the committee to look at budgetary and legislative suggestions and ideas excites me a great deal.  I encourage Members to put forward such suggestions and ideas to the committee.<\/p><p>The report on gender budgeting is to be commended.  The late and great Kofi Annan once said:<\/p><blockquote>Gender equality is more than a goal in itself.  It is a precondition for meeting the challenge of reducing poverty, promoting sustainable development and building good governance.<\/blockquote><p>Supporting the report on gender budgeting before the House this evening would be a step towards building a foundation block or cornerstone for the Oireachtas into the future.  It would ensure that the good governance referred to by Kofi Annan would happen.  Members of the Oireachtas must have an awareness and full understanding of the potential positive and negative impacts of budgetary measures on both females and males.  While some good work has been done and there have been some achievements, the House and the Government must implement the real, realisable and concrete proposals outlined in the committee's report on gender budgeting.  The committee believes that an equality budget statement, as referenced by Deputy Lahart, must be read by the Minister for Finance in conjunction with his Budget Statement.  That is paramount to the gender budgeting process.  Such a statement must set out the broad and ambitious strategic equality indicators.  The committee's report further recommends that the research and analysis carried out by the parliamentary oversight office should be heeded and acted on by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The report also recommends that the six Departments which piloted the initial programme should be allowed to further analyse their operations in order to enhance the work carried out to date.<\/p><p>Borrowing the slogan &quot;Much done and more to do&quot;, it is true that if gender budgets were succeeding in the House, issues of gender inequality would not be raised so continuously here.  Issues like affordable child care would have been long addressed and would not have led to women leaving the labour force due to lack of adequate and affordable child-care services.  If we were succeeding, the clear gender imbalance in appointments to State boards would not still exist.  Participation and investment in female sport would not be the poor relation.  The lack of focus until recently on STEM projects in education for girls would, I trust, have demonstrated the lack of parity of esteem for that sex when it comes to brain power in the fields of science, technology, engineering and maths.  As a former teacher, the imbalance in the number of male and female teachers, in particular at primary school level, worries me as I believe children, especially younger children, require the involvement of both sexes.  While that might not appear to be a gender-equality issue, it needs to be addressed as part of this process.<\/p><p>I do not want to rabbit on about all of the issues, but they are not exhaustive.  Many Members have referred this evening to the identification of anomalies in the tax system, social welfare and pension entitlements.  The PRSI system, for instance, has treated women unfairly and been regrettable, insensitive and lacking in budget proofing.  Recognition of the need for gender budgeting would go a long way towards dealing with this unfair discrimination and these unfair disadvantages.  The report recommends bringing together two sets of knowledge and expertise, namely gender equality expertise and public finance management, which would be a positive step.  I draw the attention of the House to the enshrining of gender budgeting in Austria's constitution.<\/p><p>If initiated in this country, this would bring real accountability to good gender equality governance.<\/p> <p> I highlight to the D&aacute;il a number of challenges in this report, for example, the lack of data broken down by gender, the need for cultural changes, both by us as politicians and equally by our civil servants, also recognising, most importantly, that the current budget process is not gender neutral.<\/p> <p> Like others on the committee, I commend its Chairman, Deputy Brophy, and its Vice Chairman beside me, Deputy Lahart, Miriam Plunkett, Catherine McCarthy, the staff of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the National Women's Council of Ireland, the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Disability Federation of Ireland, not to mention the ESRI, who, together with much advice from other budgetary oversight committees on the issue, went way beyond the call of duty.  I support this report and, like others, commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800059#KKK00200","speaker":"1332","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539888300,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the presence of the Deputies who stayed for the duration of the debate.  No one in the House should have to apologise for being male or female.  It is regrettable that when the issue of gender is discussed, whether in this forum or elsewhere, we almost drift into having to apologise for being male rather than advocating, which is our role, for the position of men and women, women and men.  I do not view myself as a Deputy for men or as a male Deputy.  I am a Deputy and I take my responsibilities in this regard very seriously, as I am sure do the other Deputies.<\/p><p>I know Deputy Burton is not present now, but reference was made a while ago to the timing of the debate, which is regrettable because it was certainly worthy of a greater level of scrutiny, consideration and debate in the House.  Deputy Burton said many female Deputies are probably at home with their families.  That is fine, but the rest of us have families too, and credit must go to those of us who have been here this evening to provide our input into this.<\/p><p>Deputy Burton referred to the budget of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  It is worth putting on the record that the weekly rate payable to families in receipt of social welfare payments for a qualified child has increased by &euro;2.20 per week for children under 12 and by &euro;5.20 per week for children aged 12 and over.  There will also be a &euro;20 increase to the income disregard for one-parent families on the jobseeker's transitional payment, which was not referred to.  The back to school clothing and footwear allowance is being increased by &euro;25 per child, up to &euro;150 for those aged four to 11 and &euro;275 for those aged 12 to 22.  There is also an allocation of &euro;146 million for emergency accommodation.  In addition, there is in excess of &euro;1.5 billion in the 2019 budget for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and the introduction of the affordable childcare scheme continues.  In addition, the income thresholds and multiple child deduction under the new scheme are to be adjusted to approve supports for additional parents who qualify.  It is not fair, therefore, to say that the budget that has been introduced under confidence and supply does not have a family element to it or that it does not have regard to the importance and centrality of children in society.  That is not the case.<\/p><p>I compliment Deputy Lahart, in his role as Vice Chairman, on the report.  I know the Chairman is not here but I congratulate both Deputies for their level of engagement.  It is fair to say that in recent years there have been a number of reforms led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the first instance, not only in the area of budgetary layout and engagement with the committee but in a great many other areas.  We are on target to have the number of women on our State boards at around the 40% mark.  Many of these elements of reform are very positive and I think they are improving the position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>gender equality.  While Deputies Broughan and Boyd Barrett may differ with the Government on an awful lot of our economic philosophy, I agree with them that there is no difference between all our wishes that we might see a greater level of engagement with the committee in terms of oversight, scrutiny and pre-budgetary appraisal.  We must also ensure we are able as a Government and an Oireachtas to reach out to the greatest number of people we can, male and female, through our expenditure, our tax regime and our governance.<\/p><p>I entirely agree with some of the points Deputy Breathnach made about education.  I was a primary school teacher myself and I know that many of my former contemporaries are female, but there are a growing number of males.  A continual impetus needs to be placed on this to ensure a greater number of younger men going into that profession.  In a previous Department I suggested and attempted to introduce a mechanism to improve the position of women in sport.  This has not advanced, which is very regrettable because we need to see a greater number of leadership roles for women, not just in politics but in areas into which Government expenditure reaches.  This is not the case at present.  An opportunity was missed but it continues to exist.<\/p><p>As for the overall context of the recommendations of the report, in the brief amount of time I have left I would like, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to comment on some of them, such as an equality budgeting statement alongside the budget statement, to which all speakers referred.  The approach taken to the equality budget is anchored in the existing performance budgeting and is part of a whole-year budgetary approach.  It is not just a matter, therefore, of the day itself.  I know there is a lot of focus on the day itself, even though the budget is nowadays out nearly three or four weeks in advance in many cases.  Many elements that are crucial to good equality or gender budgeting are equally good for budgeting itself and policy formulation as a whole.  This is the case for clear, multidimensional budgetary impact analysis and for evaluation frameworks that feed directly into the policy and budget cycle.  I think it was Deputy Boyd Barrett who said we are able to produce tables showing how the budget impacts people in different cohorts and economic strata.  As we get more and more information from the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and Education and Skills, and as the committee continues its work, we will organically see the reach of the budget into what it is we want to try to achieve, which is to ensure that the boat is lifted for males and females.<\/p><p>The reporting of relevant targets and indicators aims to enhance the transparency surrounding the progress made through achieving equality objectives.  The work on equality budgeting will continue to complement existing structures which consider the impacts of budgetary measures such as the SWITCH model and social impact assessments.  Work is also under way to address the data issues.  A representative from the Central Statistics Office sits on the advisory group and work has begun to map priorities from strategies such as the national strategy for women and girls onto gender equality and budgeting.<\/p><p>The Department officials have taken note of the issues that have been raised.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is very anxious to continue the dialogue with the members of the committee.  I compliment the committee on the work it has done on this element and, more broadly, on the production of the budget.  I hope we move away from the set-piece day to having a greater level of input from Members of the Oireachtas, who ultimately have the responsibility for voting through the budget under its different headings.<\/p><p>I will finish where I started.  It is noteworthy that four of the Deputies who spoke are still here.  None of us should have to apologise for being male, no more than anyone should have to apologise for being female.<\/p><p>I think an awful lot of progress is being made.  The work the committee has done in that regard is very welcome.  On behalf of the Government, I thank the committee for the work it has done.  I look forward to its continued engagement in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800060#LLL00200","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539888900,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I thank my colleagues on the Committee on Budgetary Oversight for their contributions.  I would like to emphasise a few of the points that have been made.  I ask the Minister of State to remind the Minister that he has not responded to the committee's report.  The committee looks forward to his response and to that of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  I note what the Minister of State said about the organic nature of budgeting when he was responding to what I said in my opening remarks about the Committee on Budgetary Oversight's disappointment regarding the Minister's failure to include an equality budgeting statement in his Budget Statement.  The Minister has committed to doing this in 2020.  The Minister of State spoke about the amount of work that is going on in the background as part of the efforts to deal with gender budgeting issues within each Department.  I suggest that this would have made it even more incumbent on the Minister to include a more comprehensive gender budgeting statement in the budget 2019 presentation, even as a gesture.  The Minister has not responded to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to respond to Deputy Burton's remark about \"technical language\".  I do not want to labour the issue.  My colleagues have made the point.  As I stated earlier, when Deputy Burton was serving as a female Minister for Social Protection in 2012, she, either wittingly or unwittingly, introduced measures in pensions legislation that were particularly gender-biased and had a disproportionately significant penalising effect on women than on men, although some men were penalised by the measures in question.<\/p>  <p>  I call on the Minister to initiate a report into the economic role of women in Irish society, as recommended by the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  It is really important for the committee's message in this regard to be delivered.  We have garnered some experience from the Scottish Parliament in this area.<\/p>  <p>  As this is our first opportunity to debate the Committee on Budgetary Oversight's report with the Minister of State, I would like to raise a few general issues with him.  My colleagues on the committee would not forgive me if I failed to do so.  I am not talking about individual measures in the budget.  One of the criticisms levelled at politicians and office holders during and after the economic crash was that advices from eminent organisations and individuals were not heeded in advance of the crash, or certainly in the lead-up to the height of the crash.  Between April and September, various eminent witnesses came before the committee.  The chairman of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council appeared on a number of occasions.  We heard from stakeholders from the ESRI and many other bodies.  It was clear as long ago as April that certain key budgetary themes were emerging, including Ireland's vulnerability in the area of corporation tax, the importance of taking some steps in the area of carbon tax because of our climate change obligations - the equalisation of diesel and petrol measures was one such step - and the need to consider Brexit budget measures.  All of those themes were fudged in the budget.  They were not dealt with in any kind of significant way.  Some of them, including carbon tax measures, were put off for another year.  These issues were highlighted again and again at meetings of the committee.<\/p>  <p>  I have referred to Ireland's vulnerability in the area of corporation tax.  It is important that we do not continue to depend on this tax.  We must remember the consequences of our over-dependence on it previously.  Significant steps were not taken in respect of this tax.  Equally, the Minister and the Government have not come back to the committee with concrete proposals for how the rainy-day fund will be used.  Will it be used as a counter-cyclical tool, as a contingency fund or as an economic buffer?<\/p>  <p>  We have been given some indication that the Minister for Finance will meet the Minister for Health three or four times a year to try to keep tabs on the health budget, but aside from that the overrun in that budget has not been mentioned.  The committee has not received details of, or information on, any particular structure to be used by the Minister or the Department as part of their efforts to control spending in the Department of Health.  Successive Ministers for Health have failed to control health spending over a period of 20 years.<\/p>  <p>  The corporation tax windfall in advance of budget 2019 is particularly important.  I have not run my concerns in this regard by the members of the committee, but I know they will share them.  The Minister was good enough to come before us on a number of occasions.  The corporation tax windfall in advance of budget 2019 was entirely predictable because it arose from a technical accounting change.  We know that such a windfall will not occur again.  The committee is concerned that the discovery of this windfall at such a late hour in the budgetary cycle meant that the committee did not have an opportunity to scrutinise the windfall figures or interrogate the manner in which the windfall will be utilised on behalf of society or the economy.<\/p>  <p>  I would not be forgiven if I had not made these supplementary points now that the opportunity has arisen.  The Minister of State might inform the Minister and his officials that we do not intend to let any of these issues go between now and Christmas.  We are very exercised about them.  Each of them is very important.  There is no point in having a committee such as ours, which meets regularly up to a week or a fortnight before the budget, if it cannot make any input or engage in any oversight when approximately &euro;1 billion is discovered the night before the budget.<\/p>  <p>  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight is committed to its work and will continue to make progress with, promote and monitor the integration of gender-budgeting and other gender equality measures into the annual budgetary process.  The committee hopes that by having the tools available to analyse the impact of various budgetary options in the future, it can try to avoid policy decisions which have an adverse impact on women and other people on the margins of society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800061#MMM00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539888900,"counter":535,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539888900,"counter":536,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 8.50 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 23 October 2018.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
