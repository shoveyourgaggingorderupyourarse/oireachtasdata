No apologies have been received.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and he is attending remotely.<\/p> <p>  As we return to participate in committee meetings in person, I ask members and all in attendance to exercise personal responsibility and to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and others attending and to adopt good hygiene practices.  Those in attendance should always maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after meetings.  Masks should be worn at all times during meetings except when speaking.  I ask for co-operation with the guidelines.<\/p> <p>  Members participating remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.<\/p> <p>  The business before us today is as follows: minutes; accounts and statements; correspondence; work programme; and any other business.  Before we proceed, I propose that we reserve 20 minutes at the end of the meeting to go into private session to deal with sensitive correspondence and housekeeping matters.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The first business is the minutes of the meetings of the 16, 21 and 23 September.  They have been circulated to members.  Do members wish to raise any matters in relation to the minutes?  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.

This matter has been to and fro between the organisation and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform over a number of years.  At one point - and this is why they recognised a debtor - they were going to recover the payments from the staff but then it was determined after industrial relations negotiations that it would not be recovered.

We held over a number of items from last week and will address those first.<\/p> <p>  The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged matters for discussion is B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The first item is No. 751 from Mr. Maurice Buckley, chairman of the OPW, dated 4 August 2021, providing information requested by the committee regarding the ongoing discussions between the OPW and the landlord of Miesian Plaza which is now the headquarters of the Department of Health.  It concerns the OPW's failure to address the mismeasurement of floor space in the contract for the lease of Miesian Plaza, which was flagged by the Comptroller and Auditor General and is expected to cost the taxpayer about &euro;10 million during the lifetime of the lease.  The OPW has been in negotiations with the landlord since 2018.  Previous correspondence from the OPW, No. 667B, stated that a meeting took place on 3 June, but no further information was supplied other than to say that both parties are committed to continuing the process.  <\/p> <p>  We agreed to request the agenda of the meeting referred to in the correspondence, the minutes and details of the matters discussed, including the outcome of the meeting, and the agenda for the next meeting and when it is scheduled to take place.  In response, the OPW stated that it is intended to meet the landlord again in August and the only matter for discussion was \"The resolution of the measurements issue\", but that the discussions are sensitive and all meetings are held on a confidential basis and without prejudice.  The OPW states that it will keep the committee informed of progress and we requested quarterly updates on this matter in a report on our engagement with the OPW.  It is proposed to note and flag that correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputies Imelda Munster and Catherine Murphy flagged this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021092800002#C00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1632817800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.

Measurements and pounds, shillings and pence.  I thank the Deputies.<\/p> <p>  No. 753 from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 30 July, encloses the minute of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in response to the committee's report on the examination of the 2019 appropriation accounts of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister responds to the recommendations in all of the committee's reports.  In this case, we made five recommendations, two of which were accepted, one of which was partly accepted and two of which were not accepted.<\/p><p>Those accepted relate to a breakdown of individual taxes within the excise duty category in Revenue&rsquo;s accounts, the temporary wage subsidy scheme and tackling bogus self-employment.<\/p><p> The first recommendation not accepted concerns a voluntary PAYE system agreed by Revenue and courier firms in March 1997, and this committee&rsquo;s request for an independent investigation into the financial and sectoral implications of that agreement.  Revenue states that the matter was discussed by the Committee of Public Accounts in 2000, that Revenue does not have the powers to set up and commission an independent investigation and there is no legal basis for it to do so.<\/p><p> The second concerns a 2019 EU Commission inspection report on the control strategy for customs values and repayments.  We requested a copy of the report and Revenue&rsquo;s reply.  Revenue states that the audit has not been completed and that it does not have a timeframe for its completion.  I suggest that we follow this up to request a copy of the material requested once the audit is completed and that we note and publish this correspondence.  Is it agreed that we will follow up on looking for the audit report and that we will publish the correspondence?  Agreed.  I have flagged up this item for discussion, as did Deputies Catherine Murphy, Carthy and Munster.  We call for a report on that in one of the five recommendations made.  Basically, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is saying that it does not have the power to set up such an investigation.  Some could take this as a refusal.  The amount of money being lost is an important issue.  That sector has exploded with online shopping and fast food delivery and so on over the past decade.  There could be a very big loss there for the public purse.  I suggest that we will write back to them and ask them what they can commission.  I certainly would not be happy, as the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, to have a situation where there are potentially tens of millions of euro, or more, that should be going into the PRSI pension fund and which the State and the taxpayer is losing out on.  I suggest that we would do that.  I will now bring in the other Deputies who also had flagged this very important issue for the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021092800002#C01000","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632817800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>It is indeed and it is not just the State that would be the big loser here.  It also affects the individual employees when they come to require pensions and welfare payments.  There is a very different status.  We saw this very clearly with the case of RT&Eacute;.  It is a potential loss but it is also very precarious employment.<\/p> <p>  I believe that social welfare or social protection is another avenue here.  I could be wrong but if I remember correctly, I read recently that they declined to do a piece of work on this.  This is an area we should look at because it really is there, where the determination in the scope section occurs, that is the origin of the issue.  We should certainly consider that avenue as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021092800002#D00200","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1632817800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I fully support the Chairman's proposal.  We may have given Revenue an avenue out by being prescriptive in terms of requesting that they commission an independent investigation.  I am very disappointed, however, that Revenue has said that it does not have the powers to set up such a commission and that there is no legal basis for them to do so.  They are not offering a proposal to do anything.  As has been rightly said, this has potentially serious long-term implications for workers' social protection entitlements.  In the short term, there is also a very different obligation on an employer with employees, as opposed to an employer with people who are defined as being self-employed in the context of day-to-day entitlements for employees such as sick leave, the protections that are in place and even the requirements with regard to the minimum wage.<\/p><p>This is a hugely important issue and it is going to become more acute over the coming period.  I therefore agree with the Chairman's proposal that we write back to Revenue asking what precisely it intends to do to carry out an analysis of the level of revenue that has been lost to the State, the number of workers impacted and the financial cost and implications for said workers.  It is crucially important that Revenue assess that.  This is a decision it made as a result of a social welfare appeal hearing many years ago.  It must not be dropped because there are potential knock-on implications for workers in many other sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021092800002#D00300","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632817800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Following on from what Deputy Carthy said, I support the Chairman's proposal.<\/p> <p>  On recommendation No. 2, I understand the Comptroller and Auditor General will do a special report on Covid procurement.

It is actually quite a good piece of work.  There are lessons to be learned there in relation to procurement, so I would not propose doing additional work at this stage on PPE procurement.<\/p> <p>  On the report I will be publishing on Thursday, a number of chapters in it deal with the expenditure as a result of Covid-19 but it is more to do with schemes than with procurement.

It goes on.  That is positive in that we recommended a minimum of 4,000 visits per annum across all employment sectors.  It is welcome that Revenue has concurred with us on doing that.

CHI provided information to the committee in February regarding non-compliant procurement and we then wrote to CHI on 29 April requesting answers to four questions.  The first was requesting further details and the rationale for expenditure of &euro;121,000 on the <i>chi.jobs<\/i>website and &euro;83,000 on public relations.<\/p><p>The second question was whether consideration was given to obtaining public relations, PR, expertise from within the public service.  The third question was what is the proportion of PR expenditure used for preparing CHI staff for appearances before Oireachtas committees.  CHI stated that it is a small proportion but did not provide a figure.  Lastly, we sought an information note regarding job retention across the three children's hospital sites.

Irish Water springs to mind where one has statutory bodies that have no competitors spending tens of thousands of euro, and in some cases hundreds of thousands of euro, on PR exercises.<\/p> <p>  I see that Children's Health Ireland has referenced a public information campaign, which was rolled out in an integrated manner and launched by the CHI at the Connolly Hospital.  All of that is very laudable but at some point there needs to be an analysis done on whether there is a better streamlined mechanism of arranging and managing PR because if every statutory body, Government Department and semi-State spends huge sums on public relations then there must be an argument for a more efficient way of doing things.

At this stage the caseload looks manageable, which is useful.

I propose to note and publish the aforementioned correspondence and hopefully the evaluation that is under way will shed some further light on the matter.<\/p><p>No. 782B is from<b><\/b>Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, dated 11 August 2021 providing information requested by the committee relating to the national broadband plan, NBP.  The Secretary General sets out progress on the project and states that &quot;Momentum is building on the project and as of 30 July over 12,000 premises are passed and available for connection; this compares to the 4,000 referenced in my letter of 7 July.&quot;  According to the correspondence, a further 8,000 premises have been passed and are ready for connection, although not connected yet.  Information in also provided on the use of existing infrastructure.<\/p><p>Regarding penalty clauses, the correspondence sets out the nature of the contract and its provisions for dealing with delays.  In terms of unprecedented events such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the contractor can seek additional time to meet contract milestones and, in those circumstances, no penalties apply.  In other circumstances, the contract provides that penalty provisions relating to delays to delivery of the network apply to any delays that occur from the end of contract year two, which will be 1 February 2022.  Should the contractor miss milestones from that date, penalties will apply for the duration of the build period.  Therefore, no penalties are applicable to the current delays.  It is proposed that we note and publish this correspondence. Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>Last week, we agreed to engage with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on 14 October and we will request an up-to-date briefing on the contract in advance of that meeting.  I am flagging this correspondence because this is a major issue given the size of the capital project involved.  While the response sets out that the Department can withhold payment, it does not set out penalties as they were described to me and to others in the D&aacute;il Chamber prior to the contract being signed.  In the section of the correspondence that refers to penalty clauses in the contract, the Secretary General writes that subsidies will only be released on achievement of the contract milestones.  In other words, the contractor will only get paid for the work that is done but the clear commitment at that time, as I recall it and which is on the record of the D&aacute;il, was that there would actually be specific penalties.<\/p><p>In his reply on that section he went on to state that the contract makes provisions for dealing with delays in the delivery of the network arising from unprecedented events such as Covid-19 and that NBI can seek additional time and no penalties would apply.  He said the penalty provisions relating to delays in the delivery of the network are applicable with respect to any delays that occur from the end of year 2 of the contract.  There should not have been a big delay because work on telecommunications were operational throughout the Covid period, as I recall.  I am open to correction on this from other committee members.  There was no suspension of work on communications works during that period.  The first paragraph of his reply dealing with the penalty clauses in the contract is of concern to me. <\/p><p> In his reply he said reporting on costs and revenues to the Department would subsequently be released only on achievement of the contract milestones which are verified through an independent certification process.  This means that NBI is only paid a subsidy when the milestones have been met and verified.  There is clearly no penalty.  That was confirmed by the Minister in the D&aacute;il.  NBI will come before the committee on 14 October and it is essential that we raise these matters with it.  This process could drag on for a considerable period of time.  Deputy Murphy wished to raise this as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021092800002#H00500","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632817800,"counter":57,"content":"<p>In the main we will deal with that in some detail when we have NBI in front of us.

Essentially, it was to keep this on track.  During Covid-19 the need became even more obvious.  If people are going to relocate to work remotely it is all the more important that there is an availability of broadband throughout the country.  Nobody disputed that this project was required.  The concern was that it was going to cost a lot of money and there was a question mark over the capability of the people who were awarded the contract to deliver on it.<\/p> <p>  I take some issue with what has been said by the Secretary General.  The figure quoted was 4,000 and it was stated it should be 12,000.  It was supposed to be 20,000.  What were the milestones?  It is an improvement on 4,000, but if NBI does not meet the target will there be slippage in terms of an accelerated programme?

Yes, we should raise it with the Department.  As I recall, Mr. Griffin was not there at the time, but I raised it at the time with the officials and the Minister.  There is no obligation on Eir to go 1 m further than it has gone.  It has the rich pickings.  The Deputy will recall that there were three interested parties up until that day, and after that date two of the other interested parties - one of which was the ESB - pulled out.  That is why.  We should raise it with them on the day that they are in, but unfortunately that was the deal set at the time.  It looked good because 150,000 premises were going to be captured, but the problem is that this allowed that part of the network to be captured and made it difficult to get by, with no obligation to go any further than that.  This made the rest of the contract so unattractive that the other two bidders pulled out.  This is what actually happened with it.  The Deputy is right that this is a serious issue, and we will raise it with them on the day they are before the committee.

I very much appreciate Senator Lombard taking the Chair and facilitating this opportunity to bring the veterinary practice (amendment) Bill 2021 before the joint committee.  I also acknowledge all the help I got in getting to this stage, especially from the members of Veterinary Ireland, who I have met on a number of occasions in recent years.<\/p> <p>  The reason I brought forward this amendment to legislation is because of growing concern among the public and veterinarians about the impact of corporate ownership on veterinary practices going forward.  Over the last number of years, corporations have started to buy veterinary practices in this country.  Prior to 2016, the Veterinary Council&rsquo;s view was that the ownership of a veterinary practice had to be by a vet.  They then changed their interpretation of the legislation and allowed corporates to buy veterinary practices.  After some objections were raised, they decided they would have a consultation process with stakeholders to re-examine the interpretation of the legislation.  They also made appearances in front of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the last D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>  There was serious unease as to whether their interpretation was correct and also regarding the impact this would have on veterinary practices and customers.  When they were in front of the committee in the last D&aacute;il, Senator Lombard and Senator Paul Daly were members of the committee, as was the then Deputy, Willie Penrose.  With Mr. Penrose&rsquo;s legalistic mind, he was very strenuous in his questioning of the Veterinary Council.  After a number of meetings with Veterinary Ireland, it was decided that an amendment to the legislation was needed.<\/p> <p>  In other jurisdictions where corporate ownership has become the norm, the level of service to urban and rural customers has decreased, while costs have increased.  In Derry recently, the first practice in Northern Ireland went into corporate ownership and we have seen that the first casualty was the 24-hour service that was heretofore available to farmers.<\/p> <p>  Over a long number of years, vets have provided a renowned and exemplary service in rural Ireland.  Urban dwellers have also had a very good service available at a reasonable cost.  We have seen in other jurisdictions, particularly the UK, that corporate ownership has resulted in a lower level of service and a higher cost to the customer, with an impact on animal welfare.  When it becomes uneconomical to bring out a vet on a late-night call, obviously, animal welfare considerations will come into play.<\/p> <p>  In recent days, and it is ironic that it coincides with this meeting of the committee, we have seen a number of articles regarding the difficulty in attracting vets into large animal practices.  Corporate ownership will make this more difficult as young vets will not be able to see a realistic path of career progression, which is a major issue.  Indeed, this is proving to be the deciding factor among many vets choosing not to enter private practice, which is having a significant impact on the availability of vets for large and small animal practices.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of this amendment to the legislation is to insist that the Veterinary Council implement, as they did heretofore, that only vets can own a veterinary practice.  This is the only means through which the Veterinary Council can regulate the practice of veterinary medicine in the interests of public health and animal health and welfare.  That is the most important point I can make to the committee today.  If the Veterinary Council is to regulate, this amendment is the only thing that can allow that to happen.  This is extremely important on public health grounds and for animal health and welfare.  I am fully convinced this will be of significant benefit and attractiveness to veterinary practitioners and will ensure the delivery of a good service to their customers at a reasonable price.  It will also ensure public health and animal health and welfare are kept under strict regulation by the Veterinary Council.<\/p> <p>  That is why I am bringing forward this amendment today.  I know my colleagues in Veterinary Ireland want to make a number of minor amendments to the wording of the Bill.  With the permission of the Vice Chairman, I will ask Mr. Murphy to go through those wording changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092800002#A00500","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cahill.  There are a couple of very small technical amendments that we feel would strengthen the Bill as presented.  The first is on page 4 of the Bill.  It is an amendment to section 113 of the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 and relates to section 7(c) of the Bill.<\/p><p>Section 7(c) states: &quot;in subsections (5), (7), and (8), &ldquo;by the substitution of registered person for eligible veterinary practitioner&rdquo;.  This has been phrased the wrong way around.  This should say &ldquo;by substitution of eligible veterinary practitioner for registered person&rdquo;, in each place that it occurs.  This is just a drafting issue.  <br\/><br\/>Section 9B (3) states: &ldquo;If more than one person carries out the practice of veterinary medicine at a premises and a question arises as to who is the registered person&rdquo;.  We suggest that should read &ldquo;who is the eligible veterinary practitioner&rdquo;.  It was omitted to change &ldquo;registered person&rdquo; to &ldquo;eligible veterinary practitioner&rdquo;.<br\/><br\/>Section 139, subsection (1) states: <\/p><blockquote>\tA veterinary practice, operating from registered veterinary premises, shall be wholly owned by veterinary practitioners (registered under Part 4) who practice veterinary medicine from said premises, and certificates of suitability for those premises shall only be sought, obtained and retained in the name of an eligible veterinary practitioner (as defined in section 138) .   <\/blockquote><p>That might benefit from an additional line to make it clear that it is the responsibility of the Veterinary Council of Ireland to ensure that that situation happens.  A line that could go in there would be along the lines of: &ldquo;it is the responsibility of the Veterinary Council of Ireland to take all measures necessary to ensure that the conditions of this subsection are complied with&rdquo;.  This is so that we do not simply have an Act on the Statute Book, but so that the Veterinary Council of Ireland actively enforces it.  To repeat: &quot;it is the responsibility of Veterinary Council of Ireland to take all measures necessary to ensure that the conditions of this subsection are complied with&quot;.  <br\/><br\/>We felt that the Bill could benefit from clarifying the last sentence under section 139(4).  Subsection (4) states: &quot;For the purposes of this section, exemptions from the requirements for total veterinary ownership and eligible veterinary practitioner status shall be granted to registered animal charities and veterinary teaching institutions.&quot;  We thought this sentence would benefit from a definition of &quot;registered animal charities and veterinary teaching institutions&quot;.  We therefore suggest an amendment, after where it says, &ldquo;shall be granted to&rdquo;.  Instead of &ldquo;registered animal charities and veterinary teaching institutions&rdquo;, we would suggest &ldquo;shall be granted to one: an institution providing an approved programme of education to enable the person to be registered under Part 4, in other words, to be registered as a vet, or two: a charitable organisation that exclusively provides subsidised veterinary services to the public on a charitable basis&rdquo;.  In this subsection, &quot;charitable organisation&quot; has the meaning given to it by section 2 of the Charities Act 2009.  This is to avoid a loophole whereby somebody's lay corporate bodies could claim to be charities or trusts, and that we define what we mean by &ldquo;animal charity&rdquo;.  <br\/><br\/>These are the only amendments or suggestions we had, Chair. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092800002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Finbarr Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Mr. Murphy might send a copy of that, so that we could take note of all of those suggestions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092800002#B00200","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":122,"content":"<p>Yes, absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Finbarr Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Matt Carthy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092800002#B00400","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach.  I must say that it is much fairer that I am let in first, as the usual Chair usually keeps me until the end.<\/p><p>I thank Deputy Cahill in the first instance for bringing this legislation to the D&aacute;il.  I commend him on ensuring it has gotten this far.  I said when we were dealing with it in Private Members' time in the D&aacute;il that this is one of the few situations where we have an opportunity as legislators to address a problem before it becomes a big problem.  That is welcome.  I presume we will have an opportunity to hear from voices that might have concerns as well.  While instinctively I think that the debate in the D&aacute;il would indicate that there is cross-party support for this legislation, we want to ensure that the legislation is fit for purpose.  <\/p><p>Part of the problem has been that when this type of corporate ownership model begins to take effect, it takes quite a number of years before it is seen to have a profound impact.  In Britain, for example, in 1999 there was virtually 0% ownership by great corporates.  By 2009, that increased to 10%.  Then, in the subsequent decade, it increased to 50%.  It can clearly be, therefore, a slow burner, but can end up having a profound impact.  Do we have any sense yet as to what the trajectory would likely be?  Where would the pressure be felt first and most acutely?  Deputy Cahill has talked about the issue of 24-7 care.  This was a particular concern in Donegal, where we see a glimpse of what this type of ownership model would mean. <\/p><p>My second question relates to where there are, or could be, what we might call &quot;corporates&quot;.  However, in some instances, vets might own multiple practices and they are currently in place.  What would the impact of this legislation be on them?  Is there an ability to provide a timeframe to resolve any anomalies that might be there?  <\/p><p>I have a political question for Deputy Cahill.  When we are dealing with the concept of other veterinary medicines, legislation and particularly issues with regard to licensed traders.  We want to find a resolution to that particular issue, where licensed traders were not able to dispense their products.  We saw an instance where this legislation was not passed.  Does the Deputy have a sense of the compounded impact of all that, in terms of the services that are currently in place in rural communities, <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>being what we could end up with? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092800002#B00500","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":125,"content":"<p>First, I will talk about corporates, as regards the practices that have required in the country up to this stage.  There have targeted small animal practices in large urban centres, as well as specialist practices that would be lucrative, whether it is in the equine sector, or whatever they have targeted.  They have been targeting the intensive farming areas where there would be a large concentration of fairly large herds, especially in the dairy sector.  That is where corporates have purchase practices in 26 counties at the moment.  There has been a significant number of purchases in the last 12 to 18 months.  This legislation is therefore pertinent.  It is essential that we get it onto the Statute Book.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Carthy had a question about the number of vets in a practice in group ownership.  I will let one of the witnesses answer that question.  However, I think that is catered for and that it will not be an issue within this legislation.  The Deputy mentioned the availability of animal medicines going forward.  We will discuss the legislation on that in the committee next week.  We may get to a scenario where there is restrictive availability of veterinary medicines.  If corporates had the control of sales, we would see the profit margins and the cost to the end-user increase dramatically.  The farmer&rsquo;s relationship with his or her local vet gives farmers a bargaining tool in the cost of medicines.  However, if he or she argues prices with a corporate, he or she will have no bargaining power whatsoever.  Hopefully we will get a better solution to that.  As I said, we will get a briefing that committee next week on that.  Hopefully that scenario will not arise, but I fully accept the Deputy&rsquo;s point.  If veterinary medicines and distribution are solely under control of veterinary practices, corporate ownership would add greatly to the cost.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Murphy or Mr. Neary might have a comment on the group ownership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092800002#B00600","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I was talking about this with Mr. Murphy in the car on the way over.

I assure the committee that there has been a significant increase in the number of practices that have been bought, not in the past year or 18 months, but just since we last looked in on the D&aacute;il during Second Stage of this Bill.  I imagine that this legislation being pending is leading to a rush to buy practices.  There is probably a feeling out there that this legislation has not been taken seriously, but as it goes through Stages, word is getting out that it might get through.  There was a belief that it would go nowhere.  The fact that people can see it solidifying into something that might become an Act has led to an acceleration to get in ahead of that cut-off point.  People have moved.  I am sure it is happening in west Cork.  We are aware of another practice that has gone in County Galway, not the city of Galway.  We are aware of other practices undergoing the very late stages of due diligence processes.  We are a smaller market than England.  Some 10% of practices in England is a large number.  We have a population the same size as greater Manchester.

It is no secret that I was a member of the previous committee, which held numerous hearings on this issue.  As a party colleague of Deputy Cahill, I have been with him every step of the way in bringing this Bill to where it is today.  It will be no surprise to anyone that, for obvious reasons, I will not start knocking it at this eleventh hour.  That said, blind loyalty or friendship would not influence me in making what I believe was the right decision.  What does influence me is the fact that I am a small farmer in a rural area that is sandwiched between three half-decent-sized urban areas in Tullamore, Mullingar and Athlone.  I am right in the centre of that triangle and my vets are based in Tullamore.  Since the low-hanging, but most high-yielding fruit for the corporates is the small animal business, they will probably be looking at towns.  I have seen what has happened in Donegal, for example.  Were that to happen in Tullamore, my cat and dog would have a service but my cow that needed a caesarean section at an ungodly hour would not.  That is why I rode in with Deputy Cahill to get this Bill to its current stage.  I compliment him on the amount of work he has done in bringing it this far.<\/p> <p>  They say that what is seldom is wonderful.  It is not often that Deputy Carthy and I agree wholeheartedly on issues at this committee or elsewhere, but we do today.  In terms of where the Deputy was coming from, I wish to ask Mr. Neary further questions because I do not know whether the answers got lost in the explanation.  A certificate of suitability in respect of premises is granted by the Veterinary Council of Ireland.  The Bill specifically states that a veterinary practitioner would have to get that certificate.  Mr. Neary mentioned that transactions had already happened and that, unfortunately in my opinion, corporate veterinary practices were already up and running.  How would they be fixed for their certificates of suitability under this legislation?  This will not apply retrospectively.  While we may question what services they are providing to meet our requirements, could they find themselves in limbo and their clientele be caught out if we changed the law now?  I wish to tease this matter out more.  I do not see it as a major issue, but it could create problems down the line.  This is the stage of the game where we need to look into these matters.<\/p> <p>  My next question for Mr. Neary or Mr. Murphy does not relate directly to the Bill, but to its inception.  Has there been any change in focus by the Veterinary Council of Ireland since we last met?  I do not believe we met in this room, but next door.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland did not seem to have an issue with this.  Former Deputy Penrose, who is as shrewd a legal eagle as one would meet on any day's walk, had serious concerns about even the motivation for some of the decisions that the Veterinary Council of Ireland had been making.  From Veterinary Ireland's dealings with the Veterinary Council of Ireland, has there been any change?<\/p> <p>  For the record, what the witnesses have explained to us I have also been told by others.  Today, I met a group that concentrates on small animals.  I can see where it was coming from, but I will solely represent my electorate.  The food production side of agriculture is our largest indigenous industry.  Every corporate is commercially driven, and that involves cherry-picking the low-hanging fruit, that is, the small animal.  We hear stories about such corporates having side businesses in pet insurance and the commercial sale of drugs and so on.  As Deputy Carthy mentioned, the veterinary medications issue is also before us.  Deputy Cahill stated that departmental officials will be before us on that next week.  A perfect storm is developing, though.  If we allow all of our small veterinary practices to be taken over by large corporate outlets, their commercial business model will be the sale of veterinary medicines.  That will wipe out not only all small rural vets and the services that farmers get, but also licensed merchants.  This Bill has a major role to play in consolidating, strengthening and securing veterinary services, which are necessary for agricultural communities in rural Ireland.  Small animal veterinary practices are equally needed, but one should not exist at the expense of the other.<\/p><p>In the interests of animal welfare they all can and will work collectively.<br\/><br\/>Will the witnesses comment on the article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, as mentioned by Deputy Cahill?  While it may not be related to the Bill, is there anything that could be done, perhaps not in this Bill but in any other sphere, to change the situation or solve the problem that has been highlighted in the media around the lack of vets?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092800002#C02400","speaker":"1651","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":152,"content":"<p>With regard to the Veterinary Council of Ireland, has it improved or in any way mellowed? \"No\" would be the answer.  We got original legal opinion that it acted outside its powers, that the Veterinary Practice Act was silent on ownership and that the council acted outside of its powers.  I refer the Senator back to former Deputy Penrose when he questioned the council representatives.  He pointed out to them that if there were any changes to be made in the ownership of practice or declarations, it was a function of the Oireachtas to so do.  Since then the Veterinary Council of Ireland has held a series of reviews and put the four codes of conduct under review, which means they remain active.  It does not mean the codes are cancelled until the review is held.  They remain active.  The council then had a review that revealed the public, veterinary surgeons, and every organisation it asked was against the move.  Then the council went back and reinforced the exact position it took in December 2017, probably even more blatantly, stating that as long as acts of veterinary medicine were carried out by vets, then the rest was okay.  The council has strengthened on this position, even though it has been pointed out that it has gone in the wrong direction and is acting outside of its powers.<\/p> <p>  On the certificate of suitability, COS, in the present scenario, where lay people own practices, be it corporate or private, a private person can get a practice certificate of suitability.  In the current corporate structure that person is to govern the following: the medicines, the services, what is and is not done, what drugs he or she can and cannot use, how he or she uses the medicines and what temperatures they are stored at, the radiation protection for employees, disposal of remains, disposal of bottles and so on.  A certificate of suitability holder in those practices is certifying he or she will run the practice and, under the certificate of suitability, is also certifying he or she will provide 24-hour service.  He or she has no control over that practice and may not even be the practice manager.  The clinical director and the certificate of suitability holder is not the practice manager.  The practice manager in all of the practices we are aware of is a layperson.  The certificate of suitability holder has no control over those matters.<\/p> <p>  Veterinary Ireland would always have advised its members that they are hanging themselves out to dry from a certification point of view if they become certificate of suitability holder.  They are however, caught between a rock and a hard place because they are getting a large amount of money for the practice and are being maintained as clinical director for maybe one, four or five years, or whatever.  They sign the certificate but they are signing what they cannot honour because they do not own the practice.  This is why we were adamant in our contribution to the new Bill that the certificate of suitability holder must have some ownership of the practice.  He or she cannot be an employee of somebody who directs him or her what to do.  In that case, a layperson is dictating what the certificate of suitability holder does rather than the certificate of suitability holder doing it.<\/p> <p>  This is a long answer to the Deputy's question.  We would always have contended that the certificate of suitability is signed by somebody who does not have any control of the practice and this is not a situation we should ever have got into.  I do not know how it is going to be solved.  I still believe the council is operating outside the law. Its level of involvement in the practice of veterinary medicine, in the offering of service, and in the distribution of drugs is one of the main areas in which we are hung up at the moment.  There is one health system where vets and doctors restrict drugs.  We have situation at the moment where laypeople can buy drugs, which is illegal.  You cannot buy drugs.  Only a pharmacist, a certificate of suitability holder or a wholesaler can receive drugs from a manufacturer.  Only a vet can prescribe them and only he or she can fill the prescription from his or her stock of drugs, or a pharmacist can fill it.  This is not what is happening.  Whatever about the giving out of drugs, the layperson should not be able to buy drugs.  In a situation where the drugs are bought in a COS holder's name and paid for by the company, the legal question is who owns those drugs.

To us, this whole scenario is illegal.<\/p> <p>  What are you to do, however, with the certificate of suitability holders who are there and the ownership issue?  I do not believe the ownership structure that persists, where it is 100% owned by laypeople, should come in, but it is nothing to do with this legislation, which is the point I am making.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have sat on their hands and allowed this to happen.  This could have been stopped after two practices.

They investigated the situation and they found that the ownership structure and the share structure of the business was 50.1% for the veterinary practitioner and 49.9% for the company.  In other words, it was a majority shareholding for the vets.  On deeper examination, however, 99% of the revenue was going to the small shareholders.

I was not a member of the previous committee.  I speak as somebody who is concerned from a peninsula in a very remote part where vets are already scarce.  If they are allowed to go ahead with corporate companies running the show, I cannot see them basing themselves in places like Bantry, Castletownbere or Cahersiveen, but rather close to centres of big population, such as Cork city or nearby towns such as Bandon or Mallow.  It might be possible to take a cat or a dog 50 or 60 miles to see a vet about an issue, but it is not possible to load up a cow that is calving out on the Mizen Peninsula, Castletownbere, the Sheep's Head Peninsula or wherever.  That is not a practical option.  Remote parts of Ireland suffer under the existing system.  <\/p><p> If these big corporations are swallowing up all these veterinary practices, which Mr. Murphy says the regulations do not allow, why does the Veterinary Council of Ireland or the Department not take action?  In many instances, if a farmer does something wrong with regard to cattle or his land, they are very quick to pounce and wave the big stick.  There is a legal aspect to this.  If these corporations have broken the regulations and are not compliant with the law as exists under the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, is there any mechanism that can be used to put the handbrake on them acting so quickly, particularly knowing that this legislation is going through?

The experience in the UK is that the lay corporates tend to regionalise the service, particularly the out-of-hours service.  That will certainly not suit the dairy or beef industry in Ireland.  In the dairy sector, the calving season is so concentrated in Ireland that having one practice doing out-of-hours service or an entire region will not work.  I share the Senator's concern over rural and remote areas.  This will have a major impact throughout the country because of the nature of veterinary practice in Ireland and the experience of the lay corporates in concentrating on the more profitable aspects and letting go the elements of the service that are not as profitable.  <\/p> <p>  Vets are obliged to provide a 24-hour service, but that is under the code of professional conduct from the Veterinary Council of Ireland and not under the principal Veterinary Practice Act.  If the corporates are involved, unfortunately the Veterinary Council of Ireland cannot regulate them.  If the lay owner, the corporate, decides it will not provide an out-of-hours service, the council has no way to enforce the issue and ensure the 24-hour service is maintained.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding manpower, it is difficult to attract vets into large animal mixed practice at present for many reasons.  Small animal work is much more profitable with less requirement to be on call.  The Department is recruiting vets to cover certification requirements as a result of Brexit, which is taking vets out of practice into Department roles.  It is making it more difficult for existing practices to attract new vets.  Those issues have come together.  <\/p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly asked if we could do anything to help with the crisis in getting vets to enter large animal practice.  Enacting this Bill is one of the most important steps to prevent the problem becoming much more serious and to prevent the lay corporates from providing the services.<\/p> <p>  I am sure we could do other things with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine such as looking at the on-call arrangements and getting better co-operation between practices, larger partnerships and having vets co-operating better together.  In remote areas we could incentivise the out-of-hours service, as is done for other professions, including in general practice.  That may be necessary in certain peninsulas and remote areas.  One of the findings of a Veterinary Ireland survey was that in order to be able to retain vets, they need to be paid properly and have a reasonable work-life balance, which is partly achieved by having a better on-call rota.  We need to work jointly with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to address those concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092800002#E00150","nonspeaker":"Mr. Finbarr Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":160,"content":"<p>If these regulations are wrong, is there any means of enforcement?

For the ten years after 2005, the veterinary council interpreted the legislation in a certain way.  In 2015 or 2016, it changed its interpretation to allow corporates to buy veterinary practices.  Why that happened was the focus of committee meetings during the previous D&aacute;il.  The council had a consultation process on the matter.  My understanding, as a layperson and not a legal person, is that the Department's view is that it is the role of the veterinary council to interpret and implement the legislation.  The purpose of this amending legislation is to ensure that the veterinary council interprets the legislation in such a way as to mean that corporates cannot purchase practices.  As I said, that was how it had been between 2005 to 2015 or 2016.  There was a change in the interpretation at that time.  The Oireachtas committee of the previous D&aacute;il had three meetings that focused on that matter.  There was strenuous questioning of the veterinary council.  We have discussed the issue with various officials in the Department.  The view of the Department is that it is the Veterinary Council of Ireland's role to interpret and implement the legislation as it sees fit.  This amendment is to ensure that the legislation is implemented in such a manner as to ensure that veterinary practices stay in the ownership of veterinarians only.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked why should we try to fix something that is not broken.  That is exactly the situation.  We have an exemplary veterinary service in the Twenty-six Counties.  As I said in my opening statement, we saw what happened in Derry when a corporate bought a practice.  The level of service dropped straight away.  We want to try to ensure that we maintain the level of service we have.  We have a tremendous 24-hour service at a reasonable cost to both urban and rural consumers.  We want to try to preserve that and that is the intention of this amending legislation.<\/p> <p>  I earlier made a point around attracting vets into large animal practices.  It is becoming an issue in certain parts of the country because vets are becoming very scarce.  If we can show the possibility for career progression in large animal practices, that will help to secure vets for those practices, going forward.  I cannot answer for the Veterinary Council of Ireland as to why the interpretation changed, but it is a matter of fact that it did change around 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092800002#F00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":168,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked if there is a shortage of vets.

However, we hear that large animal practices are finding it difficult to attract vets.  As I mentioned earlier, vets tend to opt for the small animal side of the industry.  We have an increasing workload in veterinary practice, with more pets and small animals as a result of Covid.  As I mentioned, the Department is taking vets out of private practice into certification roles as a result of Brexit.

I thank Deputy Cahill and the team for bringing forward this Bill, of which we are fully supportive.  I have concerns because I come from a peninsula in west Cork.  We have got incredible service down the years that has perhaps spoiled us.  Many of these veterinary surgeons have progressed in age, like us all, and I am worried.  Have our guests looked at any model as part of this document to set up something like a SouthDoc system?  We were badly spoiled because the veterinary surgeons have always given 100% down our way, to the point that it was often said the veterinary service was better than the doctor's service.  It was nearly better if a person fell on the ground to ring the local vet because you might never get the doctor.  The bottom line is that some of these surgeons are becoming elderly.  I have been speaking to them and they are out day and night.  One vet told me recently that he had a night off because he finished at 11.30 p.m.  He was back working again the next morning.  Is any kind of system being thought about, going forward, so that vets might have something like a doctor's system whereby one vet would be on duty in an area?<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, when many younger vets are training, they are thinking about dogs and cats when there are an awful lot of cows that need calving and sick animals on farms that need treatment.

The corporates are cherry-picking the really good practices in the dense area of small animal treatment.  I assure the committee that they will be moving into the dense large animal areas next.  By the time we get to them, they will have picked up a considerable amount of the lucrative practices and clients.<\/p> <p>  The other aspect of the matter is that these corporates are paying six to 14 times more for practices than was heretofore the cost when practices were traded among professionals themselves.  What does that do to the future and to the young vets of the profession?  As Deputy Cahill alluded to earlier, those young vets will work for the rest of their lives for &euro;25,000 to &euro;40,000 a year while their peers in factories and working in Supermacs are earning more money than them.  That is only going to lead to an exodus from the profession.  That is the reality.  As Deputy Cahill also pointed out, there is absolutely no career progression whatsoever.  There is no way out of that.  Those young vets will never have enough money to access a mortgage for a house.  There will not be a practice left for them to buy or, if there is, it will be uneconomical because all the economical ones will have been bought by corporates.  That is the point I would make to the previous speaker's comments.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Michael Collins, we have no wish to take veterinary services away from the veterinary model, of which I am very proud, towards the medical model, which is regional.  I have travelled over and back to England on a regular basis and I have experienced the regionality of large animal practice in the United States.  The vets there are covering areas of 80 to 100 miles and can only guarantee they will get to a case within three hours.  If you pull a calf from a cow, rupture an artery and are left holding it with your fingers for three hours waiting for a vet, your cow will die.  That is an animal welfare issue.<\/p> <p>  I operated all my life as a single-man practice.  I had a list of six vets around me to whom I could pick up the phone if I was in the factory or was on a new job and could not get to another job.  One of those vets would turn up instead.  There is tremendous solidarity between vets because it is a difficult life.  We do not want to see our veterinary service going from local to regional.  I would be all for the amalgamation and organisation of night services on a local town basis, within a radius of, say, 20 km.<\/p><p>We would not want the out-of-hours service to be regionalised to the extent taking place in medicine, where someone has to be triaged by a nurse for two or three hours before he or she even hears that he or she will get a doctor.  The previous speaker made a very valid point when he asked why we interfered with a service that was so good prior to December 2017.  Why did we practically take apart something that was so good?  We have a tremendous veterinary service in this country.  You could not ask for a better service.  We have always provided a service in an emergency within half an hour.  I do not know why we are trying to undo all that.  It is being done with no political interference to stop it happening.

I thank the committee for the opportunity to address to it today.<br\/><br\/>My main areas of expertise are environmental governance and investor state dispute settlement, ISDS.  My opening remarks will focus on my concerns about the ECT and the obstacles it potentially poses to Government action on climate change.  My remarks are premised on the notion that if we are going to keep within 1.5&deg;C to 2&deg;C of warming, as is the ambition of the Paris Agreement, governments will have to take measures to keep a certain portion of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground.  Increasingly, there is an understanding that demand-side policies such as carbon pricing are not moving us towards net-zero emissions quickly enough.  As representatives from Costa Rica and Denmark, which are both leading the new Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance noted, we need to cut with both hands of the scissors, addressing demand and supply simultaneously.<br\/><br\/>In 2015, two researchers, Christophe McGlade and Paul Ekins, estimated that to meet the 2&deg;C temperature goal, which is the upper end of the Paris Agreement temperature range and is now generally considered too high, we would have to leave 82% of known coal reserves, 49% of gas reserves and 33% of oil reserves in the ground.  These numbers were very recently updated for a 1.5&deg;C goal in an article in <i>Nature<\/i>by Welsby <i>et al<\/i>.  The amount that needs to be left on the ground rises to 89% for coal, 59% for gas and 58% for oil.  How does this relate to the ECT?<br\/><br\/>  My concern is that government measures that have direct impacts on foreign investors in the fossil fuel sector, such as measures to limit the extraction, transportation and combustion of coal, oil and gas, are very likely to be challenged in ISDS cases.  One contemporary example is the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline, a project would have transported oil from the Canadian tar sands to the United States.  It was cancelled by President Biden earlier this year and is now the subject of an ISDS case, with the company seeking $15 billion in compensation.  This may seem to be a very large sum for compensation for a pipeline that has not been built.  However, it is important to note that under the ECT and other investment treaties, investors can seek not only compensation for their sunk costs but also for so-called lost future profits.  For example, when Italy banned offshore oil off its coastline, the UK company Rockhopper launched an ISDS case under the ECT.  The company is reportedly claiming damages of $200 million to $300 million which is many times more than what it had spent on its project prior to the ban.<br\/><br\/>There are many problems with the lost future profits model of compensation.  Leaving aside the question of whether fossil fuel companies should be compensated when governments strand their assets, there are practical difficulties for calculating the amount that is owed.  Oil prices, for example, are highly volatile and predicting what the value of reserves going to be next year, let alone in 20 or 30 years into the future, is far from straightforward.  There is also an important question about whether investment arbitrators are going to factor in how government actions to combat climate change will impact the price of oil and other fossil fuels.  Thus far, they have awarded compensation with the assumption that prices and profits will continue to rise indefinitely.<br\/><br\/>Bringing this all back to how it could impact climate governance, there are two main issues that I would like to discuss.  The first is what is known as regulatory chill.  This is the idea that governments, when threatened with an ISDS case, will reverse course or at least delay action because they are concerned about the cost of defending their policy in arbitration and the possibility of having to pay an investor a large award.  Importantly, due to the nature of climate change as a global issue regulatory chill can also occur across borders.  For example, a government can look at what is happening in the Netherlands, where the government is being sued over a phase-out of coal power, and decide that a rapid phase-out of coal could result in it facing similar ISDS cases.  The government may then decide to wait and see what the outcome of an ISDS case is before developing legislation.  This is exactly what occurred in the area of tobacco labelling in New Zealand.  The government saw that Phillip Morris had brought a very large claim against Australia for mandating plain packaging of cigarettes and decided to delay the introduction of similar legislation.  We cannot afford these kinds of delays in the climate policy realm.<br\/><br\/>The second concern I have is that when governments follow through with fossil fuel phase-out policies they will end up compensating investors more than they otherwise would have either because they are forced to do so by an arbitral tribunal or because they are negotiating with investors under the shadow of ISDS.  There have been some speculation that concerns about ISDS influenced the very large compensation package that a Germany provided to coal investors in its phase-out plan.  When compensation is higher, we have a diversion of public money to fossil fuel investors that should have been spent on ensuring a clean and just energy transition for everyone.

I am here to talk about data centres.  There are 70 data centres operating in Ireland, which is an increase of 25% compared with 2020.  Most of these are concentrated around Dublin, which has become the largest data centre hub in Europe and which accounted for 25% of the overall European industry market share at the end of 2018, with the nearest competitor, London, recording a market share of 24%.  The 70 operational data centres have connection agreements for more than 1,800 MW, with up to 2,000 MW of additional requests received by EirGrid.  Approximately 1,000 MW of this has been received within the past year.  Over the past four years, there has been an annual increase in demand usage of around 600 GW from data centres alone, which is equivalent to the addition of 140,000 households to the power system each year.  An average data centre with a load of 60 MW would be comparable with the usage of a large town or small city such as Kilkenny.<\/p> <p>  Data centres currently account for 11% of grid capacity, but EirGrid estimates that this will be 28% by 2030 on the basis of existing connections.  If all proposed data centre projects were connected, this figure could be as high as 70% of grid capacity by 2030.  This is compared with 2% of electricity consumed by data centres worldwide.<\/p> <p>  Data centres are currently responsible for 1.58% of Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions.  Data centres are reliant on the national electricity grid, which remains largely powered by fossil fuels.  The major component of this is gas, which represented more than half of electricity generation last year.  As well as this, data centres require their own installed power generation or energy storage capacity as back-up.  This back-up generation tends to be gas-fired.  Natural gas is a fossil fuel and contributes to Ireland&rsquo;s emissions.  Over 2020, data centres saw a 27% increase in gas demand.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is committed to achieving 70% renewable electricity by 2030.  Even at this early stage, however, that looks overly ambitious.  As the main source of this renewable energy, which is onshore and offshore wind, is intermittent, there will likely be a need to have other sources of energy generation available.  In the short to medium term, that is likely to be natural gas.  Achieving ambitious emissions and renewables targets by 2030 will undoubtedly be far more difficult with the addition of more data centres to the grid.<\/p> <p>  Data centres also require large quantities of water.  The average data centre uses a lower estimate of 500,000 litres per day.  This figure has the potential to rise to 5 million l per day, although this is rare - for example, during the recent heatwave in the summer of 2021.  This is particularly significant in light of the weak security of water supplies in parts of the country, particularly the greater Dublin region.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, Ireland faces more immediate challenges relating to security of energy supply.  Two amber alerts have been issued this month alone and we have yet to enter the winter season.  As energy supplies, particularly those relating to natural gas, are limited or in high demand, prices have increased.  Recent estimates suggest an increase in the average household electricity and gas bill of &euro;400 this winter.  While the drivers of these current energy shortages and price increases may be contingent on quite specific conditions, there is no doubt the energy demands of data centres exacerbate the problem and will continue to do so if they are allowed to develop further.<\/p> <p>  In this context, serious concerns about the energy demands of data centres have been raised by EirGrid and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  One proposal by the CRU is for a moratorium on the development of any new data centres in Ireland.  There are also two Bills going forward to the D&aacute;il in the coming weeks calling for such a moratorium, one from Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith of People Before Profit and one from Deputy Jennifer Whitmore of the Social Democrats.  Ireland would not be the first country to do this.  Singapore introduced a moratorium on data centres two years ago.  Similarly placed as a tech and digital hub, with ambitious climate and renewable energy targets, the Singapore Government took the decision in 2019.  The Singapore Government states that the moratorium will be lifted when renewable energy capacity and-or data storage technologies develop enough to reduce emissions and the energy burden they represent.  In 2014, according to the most recent figures available, data centres represented 7% of Singapore&rsquo;s grid capacity compared with the projected 28% by 2030 in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  From these figures, it is evident that Ireland shoulders more than a fair share of the energy and water burden of global digital activities.  What is less evident is what this concentration of data centres contributes in terms of long-term employment or regional economic development.  At this stage, the prospects of energy insecurity, and even brownouts or blackouts, may carry greater reputational and economic damage than a moratorium on data centre development.  Further down the line, there is also the reputational damage and potential financial penalties if Ireland fails to meet its 2030 climate and renewable energy targets.<\/p> <p>  There is an important wider context to this debate which also needs to be considered.  Ireland is committed to a just transition under the Paris Agreement on climate.  This means that the Irish State must ensure the fair distribution of costs and benefits associated with large-scale decarbonisation efforts.  In a context where households are facing increasing energy bills and carbon taxes, the continued granting of planning permission to energy-intensive data centres is already being perceived as an unfair distribution of costs and benefits.  Objections to onshore wind farms, for example, have been articulated in terms of the perceived benefit of these projects to energy companies and large-end users, that is, tech companies, rather than to the public or action on climate.  As more attention focuses on data centres and their energy and water usage, it may be harder to gain the support of the Irish population for decarbonisation efforts.  There is a danger that the public will perceive climate action as serving the interests of a few, with the burden carried by the majority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Bresnihan"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it on energy security, LNG and data centres.  I am assistant professor in sustainable energy and hydrogen technology at the School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering in Dublin City University and a Science Foundation Ireland MaREI Research Centre-funded investigator.  I am a World Energy Council FEL alumnus, chair of Hydrogen Ireland Association, academic adviser to Hydrogen Mobility Ireland and hydrogen task force expert to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.<\/p> <p>  Fossil fuels dominate Ireland&rsquo;s energy system and yet, today, as we emerge from Covid-19, impacted by geopolitical forces and seeing energy prices fluctuate, our reliance on fossil fuels is not diminishing, although it must.  We know unequivocally the damage fossil fuels are doing to our planet, our environment and our island, supported by the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report on climate change.  Our nation and society have seen the benefits of electrification since the Shannon scheme and the rural electrification scheme in the 1920s and 1940s.  Electrification, interconnection, efficiency, heat pumps and battery-electric vehicles are key pillars to decarbonisation, low energy prices and social cohesion, but electricity only accounts for 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy system and 60% of electricity is reliant on fossil fuels.  The other 80%, which includes most heating and transport, is difficult to decarbonise and difficult, expensive and slow to fully electrify.<\/p> <p>  Pathways to decarbonisation require not just electrons but also molecules working together.  Therefore, hydrogen is a key component to decarbonising.  It sector-couples renewable energy with heat, transport and industry, key strategic points presented in the EU&rsquo;s decarbonisation plans, as well as the UK&rsquo;s recently released hydrogen strategy.  At this moment, many EU countries and countries worldwide are beginning to embrace hydrogen, rolling out heavy transport, co-firing gas turbines, decarbonising industries, developing ships to move hydrogen by sea and developing platforms to produce hydrogen offshore, while also preparing the groundwork for global hydrogen hubs and long-term energy storage.  Ireland must follow this lead.  We must produce green hydrogen at a useful scale and deploy it in suitable mature applications, such as heavy transport, industry and even data centre power generation or back-up.  We must test and build confidence by deploying hydrogen in satellite gas grids and co-firing, scaling it up in the 2020s to be in a position in the 2030s to build the infrastructure and the electricity grid for seasonal balancing.<\/p> <p>  DCU has modelled the required storage needed to balance out a 100% renewable energy system.  The number is between 6 terawatt hours, TWh, and 10 TWh, well beyond battery technology but feasible for hydrogen.<\/p><p>Ireland is not a fossil fuel-rich country.  In 2021, we do not want or need to be.  We have vast natural, sustainable resources to support tremendous renewable energy deployment, specifically wind.  We have an opportunity to build out renewables and ensure their ability to provide energy security for Ireland.  Hydrogen can enable this.  Ireland can even become a green hydrogen exporter in place of a fossil fuel-LNG importer. <\/p><p> In Ireland we need to accelerate hydrogen deployment.  The impetus should not only be for indigenous energy.  It is not about independence but energy security, creating jobs and enterprise and copper-fastening our climate objectives by ensuring a cost effective just transition.<\/p><p> This summer, Science Foundation Ireland and 25 industry partners have come together to fund a project called HyLIGHT, that I lead.  HyLIGHT has an advisory group comprising 30 partners representing organisations, associations and government representatives from the North and South of the island.  The aim is to effectively scrutinise the role for hydrogen in decarbonising Ireland's energy system.  Excitingly, many of the industry partners want to develop hydrogen in Ireland sooner rather than later.<\/p><p> We stand on the precipice of a new economy.  Thousands of jobs that do not exist today will emerge from the development of a hydrogen economy, particularly as many understand it to be necessary in order to fully decarbonise our energy system, working hand in hand and even supporting our clean, secure electricity supply.  We are in a climate emergency.  That fact was declared by Ireland in 2019.  This emergency requires us to act and decarbonise 100% of our system.  Green, Irish hydrogen can enable this.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for allowing me this time and opportunity to speak.

The sum total of their contributions vividly illustrates the long-term opportunity Ireland has and the short-term difficulties it has to overcome.<\/p> <p>  What is the best location for date centres from a European perspective?  The need for data centres is clear, but we are trying to deliver them in an environmentally effective way.  Some argue that Ireland is well located for that.  As Dr. Carton stated, we have substantial long-term opportunities to build at scale in renewables and producing hydrogen but in the short term we have some tightness.  I am interested to hear from Dr. Carton and others about the best way to design a path to this.  Dr. Bresnihan said there could be a reaction against large-scale wind farms.  On the hand other, if we are to fulfil the ambition relating to hydrogen to which he referred, we will have to deliver at scale.  I am trying to understand the pathway to do this effectively.  In an ideal world, we would have no fossil fuel reliance.  Until we have either storage or hydrogen production, however, I presume we are somewhat dependent on specially designed gas to be available when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in another matter a couple of speakers touched on.  What role ought carbon pricing play in the future?  The Government has committed to increasing it progressively.  Others question that but I struggle to see how we can deliver our ambitions without carbon prices rising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#C00300","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":209,"content":"<p>It is clear that we need to do a couple of things in parallel.  The first thing to do regarding data centres, given the number of them locating here, is to manage the situation.  A fair share of data centres is not a bad idea.  We have a good climate for data centres, at a consistent temperature across the seasons.  We have to think socially in terms of the requirement for data centres and managing and deleting our data.  There is concern about what is housed in data centres and the reason they exist.  We have to manage that with so many connected devices coming on line over the next decade and beyond.<\/p> <p>  At the moment, we have a huge reliance on natural gas.  At times, 60% or above of our electricity system and the majority of our heating system and industrial applications run on natural gas.  That will be with us for the next decade but we need to set the foundations to move away from that.  We cannot have that situation in 15 or 20 years' time.  It is about moving the dial so we understand our reliance and move towards medium-term change.  Those developments must occur now.<\/p> <p>  In the short term, there is no hydrogen available and no market.  We see this with renewable offshore wind energy as well.  The build-out of that will take a number of years to get the scale of offshore wind for our energy system.  Hydrogen could come in parallel with that.  The key is getting many things in parallel, managing our energy use and the location of energy loads on our system and building resilience and planning for offshore wind, electro-fuels and hydrogen to work hand in hand with our future energy system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. James Carton"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I think there was a question for Dr. Bresnihan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#C00500","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I am not sure what the question was for me, but I can respond on the more general point that was made.  It is important that we do not fall into the trap one can trace in climate negotiations going back to the early 1990s.  That is the idea you can put off action now in the belief that in the future there will be technologies or economic or social transformations that will clean up the mess.  At the heart of the idea around data centres is that at some point in the near-, medium- or long-term future, Ireland will have a large renewable energy capacity which will fulfil the energy needs of the data centre industry.  That is dangerous and unrealistic.  The target for offshore wind is 5 GW by 2030, but Wind Energy Ireland recently produced a report in which and then held a conference at which it indicated that it is not at all confident that this will be possible.  Without that large-scale wind energy, we will not have large-scale green hydrogen.<\/p> <p>  As to where action can be taken, it is important to think about where there is expanding demand.  Data centres with new and constantly increasing applications make a huge drawdown on our energy system.<\/p><p>It is within the committee's power to say we are not going to increase that drawdown and we will not give any more planning permissions.  It is much simpler.  Maybe at some point in the future, similar to what the Singapore Government has said, when we have that capacity and those technologies, we can then rethink our approach to data centres.  That is my response to that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Bresnihan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I will take up what Dr. Bresnihan said about the moratorium.

Are we effectively saying \"no\" to something that may be of long-term benefit to us?  We all recognise the pressures and constraints on our grid.  I have listened to what EirGrid has to say and it certainly does not paint the pessimistic position the witnesses have.  It is talking about 20% by 2030 as opposed to what was alluded to, which is the potential for up to 70% of the demand being required by data centres.

These things are not easy and it is not as if they can be easily solved, but it is about Dr. Carton's point on whether we accept unquestioningly that data demand and data usage will expand exponentially and ineluctably forever.  Do we accept that point or do we think about data like we think about single use plastic, oil or emissions?  There have been strong environmental and public awareness campaigns that have shifted views away from this idea that oil can continue to be taken out of the ground and burned.  That has taken time; it has taken 20 or 30 years.  I can see something similar needing to happen, or possibly happening, around data.  It is the same kind of thing, which is that our consumption of data is not natural and inevitable.  Our consumption of data is very much linked to the business models and activities of online platforms such as Netflix, Twitter and Instagram.  Those business models are geared towards us consuming more data.  The same kinds of points can be made about plastics companies, chemical companies and petroleum companies.  That is a bigger point but it is a very important one to make.<\/p> <p>  On whether it is up to Ireland since this is a global issue, you could flip say that and say that Ireland could become a leader.  There is talk about Ireland not being a laggard and that we have fallen behind, at least in Europe.  If we did something about data centres and made a point about their energy consumption, particularly as it relates to carbon emissions, it could be a way of saying Ireland is taking a lead and a responsibility.  That could be the message that goes out.  It is a more positive way of pitching that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Bresnihan"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I will take issue with that.

That is what I would like to see us do.

That will require greater capture and storage of data.  The digitising of economies will effectively decarbonise to a much greater extent because it removes the necessity for transportation and much more.  There was a gap, to some extent, in the presentation in respect of the benefits associated with the storage of data and the enabling of the digital economy, which is in itself positive from an environmental perspective.

I will ask Dr. Tienhaara about the figures she quoted in terms of keeping within the Paris Agreement targets, which mean leaving 89% of coal, 59% of gas and 58% of oil in the ground.  The strategy and policy in Ireland are to switch towards greener renewable energy but also to have an element of back-up for the next couple of decades, using gas in particular.  Is it possible to stay within the target of leaving those amounts of fuels in the ground but also use them as a back-up?  On ISDS cases, Dr. Tienhaara referenced many claims but how many of them have been successful?  What is her view on the position in Ireland whereby we have strongly stated that Irish law will supersede international law in those cases?<\/p> <p>  For Dr. Bresnihan, I will pick up from where Senator Dooley left off.  At the moment, 11% of grid capacity to supply data centres is too much and 28% by 2030 will be too much.  These are targets we have to seek to reduce but, surely, quoting a figure of 70% grid capacity, which is 42% above EirGrid's estimate of what it will be, seems to suit a moratorium agenda?  I am surprised to see that because I do not believe it will be the case.  I want to cover that issue again because, as we said, 28% is too much but to say it is 70% is an overstatement, to say the least.  <\/p> <p>  If the policy adopted by this country is to continue to grant applications for data centres, surely we should have a conversation around mitigation measures and planning conditions.  I agree we cannot continue on the trajectory we are on at the moment in approving applications, but we are a centre of IT excellence and data centres are part of that IT environment.  For the purposes of this conversation, let us assume we will continue to grant permissions for data centres.  In that context, what kind of mitigation measures can we look at?  Can we look at water harvesting?<\/p><p>Dr. Bresnihan mentioned the water figures.  Can we look at district heating to be used by communities?  Can we look at procuring renewable energy and using the huge financial power?<\/p><p> I have one final question for Dr. Carton.

I will focus mainly on the ISDS part because that is my area of expertise but I will say that it is widely accepted that gas is not the bridging fuel it has been claimed to be.  Depending on the source of the gas, it can actually be worse for climate outcomes than coal.  If it is fracked, large amounts of methane can be leaked.  I would say that it really depends on what the focus is.  If one is focusing on economic growth and not worrying about demand for energy, one will probably keep replying on gas.  I applaud the comments about also trying to think about ways to decrease demand on the grid, especially if there are things that are not essential for a just transition, such as data centres.  That is not my area of expertise but I wanted to say that I agree with some of the comments that have been made about trying to reduce demand in addition to greening supply.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the number of successful cases.  Most of the climate cases are very new.  Some of the ones that are relevant have been going on for a very long time but still have not finished.  There is a case in Quebec where Canada was sued for a ban on gas fracking.  That case has been going on for a decade.  There are some particular reasons it has taken so long but these cases just do take a long time.  I cannot point the committee to the success rates for fossil fuel companies on climate-specific cases.  There is widespread use of ISDS for a variety of different issues of public interest and there are high success rates generally for investors.  It is also important to note that states can only not lose; they cannot win.  These cases are only brought by investors.  The system is unbalanced so, on the whole, it only benefits the investors.  No benefits come out of the process for states, in actual fact.  The original premise was that it would help countries to attract investment but that has been debunked in the literature.  Of course, for countries such as Ireland that have excellent court systems, there is no need for ISDS to exist.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy made comments about the supersession of Irish law.  There have been interesting developments recently with the Energy Charter Treaty, in particular.  The European Court of Justice ruled that intra-EU disputes, that is, cases brought by European investors against European states, are not legal under European rules.  The problem is that the decision about intra-European disputes was made a few years ago and arbitrators have been generally ignoring the ruling.  There is already discussion about how they can get around the judgment by having the seat of arbitration outside the EU.  That means the award could be enforced against Ireland in a court outside Ireland.  Where the seat of arbitration is outside the EU, an investor could go to the court and ask it to seize the assets that Ireland has in the country in order to pay a reward.  It is great that Ireland has made a strong statement that Irish jurisdiction supersedes these arbitration panels, but that is not accepted by those panels so Ireland is not going to be able to completely avoid any repercussions from these types of disputes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kyla Tienhaara"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I will speak about the figures.

It is not only about whether Ireland can meet the energy and electricity demands.  There is another question about the benefits that data centres bring.  I understand that Ireland is a digital hub.  Our foreign direct investment has, since the 1980s, been based around the tech, manufacturing, digital and software sectors.  However, in terms of long-term employment and regional development, it is not clear, beyond construction, what data centres bring.  Intel recently made an announcement that there might be concerns over energy security with the expansion of its plant.  There is a major anchor industry in the tech sector that provides many jobs.  In the broader scheme of things, we should consider this from a cost-benefit point of view.  There are questions about brownouts and blackouts, and the kind of damage they can do in terms of reputation and attracting industries to provide jobs and long-term investment.  That is the point I am raising.<\/p> <p>  I also agree with the point about mitigation.  The case in Singapore was about putting a pause on the development of data centres so that adequate, realistic mitigation strategies, including renewable energy, district heating and all sorts of other things, could be put in place to make sure that data centre development was more sustainable.  That would be the line I would take.  The idea is not to stop them forever but to have a moratorium to give enough space for there to be adequate research into the costs and benefits of data centres and into the kinds of technologies and infrastructures that could be developed with the tech industry.  It is important that the tech industry takes more responsibility for these challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Bresnihan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I think the Deputy's question was asking in which countries in Europe these projects using hydrogen are located.  There are a number of those countries.  We did a study with the World Energy Council in 2018 and 2019.  We found 120-odd hydrogen projects, about 70% of which were coming from renewable sources.  Since then, there has been an updated report on 250 projects in total, so there have been an additional number of projects.  Many of them are developed at reasonable scale.<\/p> <p>  Closer to home, there is a wind farm in the North of Ireland producing hydrogen from a wind farm.  That hydrogen is then trucked to the Belfast hydrogen buses.  That is currently working.  In Mayo, planning permission has been granted for an electrolyser on a wind-solar park.  In Dublin, there are three hydrogen double-deck Bus &Eacute;ireann buses on the roads.  That hydrogen is certified green by the west Dublin BOC site.  There is a mix in how hydrogen is produced depending on what country or region we are talking about.  Hydrogen can be produced with renewables.  Switzerland produces much of its hydrogen for approximately 500 trucks from hydro energy because that is what it has.  In Germany, the hydrogen is produced through solar and wind energy.

I wish to focus on the issue of data centres.  I absolutely agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that we cannot continue on the trajectory that we are on in relation to data centre permissions.  We need to put mitigation measures in place.  That is precisely why the Social Democrats are bringing forward a motion tomorrow calling for a moratorium on the granting of permissions for data centres.  We want to give the Government the space to rethink how we plan for data centres.  Currently, no information is available in respect of jobs.  The Department for Enterprise, Trade and Employment does not collect that information.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications does not know how many data centres are out there and does not collection that information, including the conditions imposed on them and how much energy they use.  There is an obvious information gap in the oversight of the Government in relation to the issue.  The moratorium is the best way of addressing that.  It will allow for proper planning to take place, and for conditions to be placed on data centres to ensure that mitigation measures are in place.<\/p> <p>  There is one argument that keeps coming back to me, which I believe Deputy Bruton raised.  According to the argument, Ireland is best-placed to have data centres located here, and a moratorium on permissions is very much a type NIMBYism, in that we are not taking responsibility for having data centres located here.  What does Dr. Bresnihan think is the fair share when it comes to data centres?  Have we hit the tipping point?  Is there any other country in the world that has the number of data centres that we have and the resultant energy demand from those data centres?  He mentioned the 28% figure, and potential figure of 70% of electricity usage.  That is the reality.  That is the trajectory we are on through granting those permissions.  Is there any other country that has as many data centres as we do?<\/p> <p>  Another issue that we are facing is the idea that the consumption of data is resource-neutral and there is no impact on resources from it.  The reality is that that is not correct.  There is water resource usage and energy usage, albeit fossil fuel usage, currently.  Even the use of renewable energy will have impact on resources.  There could potentially be biodiversity impacts.  There are also amenity and construction impacts.  How do we move from the current mindset where we hear people say that data are free from constraints and we should be able to use as much as we want?  How do we move from that to a place where people acknowledge, and are aware of, the costs of that consumption?  Also, do we need to move towards the introduction of a data centre levy?  Could that be one of the solutions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#F00300","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":229,"content":"<p>In answer to the first question on whether there are other countries with more data centres, I guess it depends on how you break it down.  At the opening of that statement, I had in mind that Dublin is the data centre hub for Europe.  It has 25% of the overall European industry market share, according to Host in Ireland, which is the industry representative group for data centres.  That figure is from 2018, so it is outdated.  However, my understanding is that the percentage can only have increased between 2018 and now because of the number of new data centres that have been built.  My answer to the Deputy's question would be that there is a reason Dublin and Ireland are understood as the data centre hub because we have the most <i>per capita<\/i>.  I do not know how the Deputy wants it broken down.  Perhaps the most salient figure would be in relation to our energy supply.  I do not know exactly how to break it down, but there are more data centres here than anywhere in terms of it being a small country.<br\/><br\/>In terms of what would be a fair share of date centres and storage services, it is a difficult question.  Deputy Bruton made the point about us reaching a point where we have large-scale, off-shore energy, including wind energy, in particular, wave energy and green hydrogen.  If they were built out to the extent that the projections have said there is potential energy, and if it was done in a sustainable way, there could be more data centres here.  I do not see why not.  That is what it really boils down to.  However, the point at which we will have that much renewable generation is quite a far bit down the line.  Currently, the market share of data centres that we have is not fair and not sustainable.<br\/><br\/>On the Deputy's question about how we get people to know about the resourcing-intensive nature of data, it is a tricky one.  It is really difficult.  I made the point earlier that it took so long for there to be awareness and public concern around emissions.  Data, in a way, are even more intangible.  They are more out of our immediate experience, whereas issues like plastic pollution or other kinds of physical pollution are easier to mobilise people around or raise concern.  The only point I can make is that it would be about greater public education.  It would be about the role that environmental NGOs and schools play.  Certainly, when I teach in college, students are always startled to learn that their use of Twitter and so on has this effect.  <br\/><br\/>One other thing that is interesting about data is that there are lots of debates around the role of tech industries in society and the economy, whether it is around security, surveillance or tax.  There is another debate, which is gaining more prominence, around the environmental footprint and impact of tech.  The more those kinds of conversations are linked up, the better.  These things are related and perhaps we should be joining up the dots a bit more.  That might be helpful.  It is a very big question, but education is definitely needed in multiple ways and forums.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Bresnihan"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":230,"content":"<p>On my final question in relation to the data centre levy, is that something we should be considering?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#F00500","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>It is not something that I have particularly thought about, but yes.

I have a few specific questions.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the levy and the tax, ultimately, the end user of the data service would be paying for that.  Therefore, I would have a concern there around a tax for which ordinary people will end up footing the bill.  However, social responsibility comes into it.  Both Dr. Bresnihan and Dr. Carton have spoken about that social element and the need to educate the public in relation to the use of data.  I think there has been some conflation here in referring to plastics and the overconsumption of plastics.  As an environmentalist, it is important to point out that it is something very different from data.  Plastics are made from fossil fuels.  Ultimately, they do not break down, so they have a cost at both ends, whereas it seems to me that the real issue around data centres is where the energy for those centres is coming from, and whether we can keep pace with the energy demand.<\/p> <p>  I ask for the witnesses' views on the following matters.<\/p><p>In an ideal world, we could ensure the energy was renewable, and perhaps we could look at some of the other concerns around water, as mentioned by Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan, such as rainwater harvesting.  We should be doing that on a grand scale across the island anyway.  If we address those issues, the concerns would not be there to the same extent.<\/p><p> I am from the west of Ireland and I know Senator Dooley and Deputy Leddin are from there as well.  What we have is a difficulty with people not wanting to produce energy in the west because of the lack of population.  We must look at bringing in industry that can promote and support energy in order to serve the wider population.  Is there a place for that and how is it envisaged that this can be achieved?  Yesterday, Bord na M&oacute;na announced an energy park for the midlands.  It is a co-location of renewable energy with business.  I presume that business will comprise heavy energy users in order to do exactly as I have described and ensure energy can be created on the basis that there is a consumer in business and it can be distributed to the wider community as well.<\/p><p> I have had a concern for a long time around trade deals and negotiations, particularly from the European Union perspective and trade deals being a European competency.  Much of the early negotiations for trade deals happen before they are discussed by MEPs or come before the European Parliament for decision.  Does Dr. Tienhaara have any thoughts about how we can change that to be more transparent?  To be fair, anything that comes before an investor-state dispute settlement process is based on the terms of the individual contract and trade deals.  There is not a widespread ability to make determinations outside those contracts.  The wording in the trade deals is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#F00700","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":234,"content":"<p>There were a few points and I do not know if I will get to all of them.  The first concerned an analogy with single-use plastics.  As mentioned, plastic is made from fossil fuels but data are currently made from fossil fuels, for the most part, in that the energy used in those centres comes from fossil fuels.  Data could be made from energy generated from sources other than fossil fuels, although one could say the same about plastic.  There is much effort to make plastic from biodegradable materials but for the most part it is still a byproduct of the petrochemical industry.  The analogy is fine but it is harder to conceive because data does not seem material but instead is like information on the screen.  If we understood the concept as fundamentally as we do fossil fuels, and where it is produced from fossil fuels, perhaps it would bring a shift in how people think about data and its environmental costs.<\/p> <p>  There was a second point about regional development in data centres.  This is where most of my work has been in the past year or two.  That is certainly one of the proposals put forward by EirGrid and CRU because of the concentration of data centres in Dublin, which is causing a security of supply issue.  If the data centres were moved to other parts of the country, where they could be closer to generation and there would not be the same demand on the grid, it would work from an energy or electricity perspective in terms of security of supply.  As has been mentioned, it might also help spread the development.  There is no doubt there may be benefits, although it all depends on how these things are done.<\/p> <p>  This goes back to the point about the benefits of data centres and the kinds of jobs or localised development they provide beyond construction.  As an example, I have done some work in Killala, where efforts are under way by Mayo County Council to bring a data centre to the site where Asahi used to be.  Asahi was a Japanese company that came to Ireland in the 1970s and at the time that was one of the largest investments by a Japanese company overseas.  It was in Killala in north Mayo for maybe 30 years and left in the 1990s, after 25 years.  It provided many jobs and transformed that area.  That site has basically been empty of industry since the mid-1990s.  Data centres are seen as a kind of possible replacement but even in talking to people involved with those plans, they recognise there will not really be many jobs beyond construction.  These matters are complicated but there is a sense that because data centres are large industrial installations and infrastructure, there is not much else possible.  We will not get a company like Asahi to locate in Killala again.  There is a sense that we are grasping at this but will this really bring the kinds of employment opportunities and long-term employment in these places that has been promised?  I am not sure.<\/p> <p>  It could happen if those centres were associated with some energy projects, such as biomass or biogas.  There are many ways they could be developed, as per Deputy Christy O'Sullivan's point.  Again, it comes down to trying to plan such measures and ensuring there are requirements or elements added to the data centre development to ensure they are good for these areas.  It is not a given that they would be.  The Bord na M&oacute;na project can also be seen in the post-industrial context.  It is by no means sure that it will create the jobs that Bord na M&oacute;na once had.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Bresnihan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the question.  I completely agree on the point about transparency and it is very disturbing that these deals are essentially made behind closed doors.  The issue with transparency is not just that policymakers and the public do not know what is going on but that some people are invited to the room early on who influence the outcomes.  There is pressure put on by industry groups to have certain provisions, including investor-state dispute settlement.  I understand there are certain problems in the EU context with that extra layer but this is a problem across the board with all trade agreement negotiations.  Some efforts are being made in some places to have special committees, for example, that can see documents early on and which try to give expert input.  The problem is these committees are usually skewed towards industry and not so much from the perspective of public interest groups around the environment, health and so forth.<\/p> <p>  Increasing transparency in these deals is definitely important.  The point was also made about the provisions in these deals defining how case outcomes occur but I would quibble with that a bit.  There has been effort to reform investment provisions in recent years.  We are seeing that arbitrators are finding ways to get around this and lawyers are finding creative ways to ignore these provisions.  There was a very recent case concerning a mining company.  Despite the fact there was an explicit exception for environmental provisions, this did not mean the states did not still have to compensate the investors.<\/p> <p>  These tribunals have far too much power to be able to interpret these matters in the way they see fit.  It is really based more on ideology than the actual terms in agreements.  I see transparency having value but ultimately the reform effort appears worthwhile.  This goes back to the point that these treaties have no public benefit nor do they do anything of value for the public.  There is no reason for the public to have to accept the risks associated with them.<\/p> <p>  Very briefly I can step out of my investor-state dispute settlement role and put on my global development studies professor hat in order to comment on the more general discussion ongoing about renewable energy.  I plead for everyone to think not only about how clean renewable energy is within Ireland but the impact that it has on other countries, where earth minerals and so forth are extracted, sometimes under really horrible conditions that have human rights or environmental implications.  I definitely want everyone to move to 100% renewable energy.<\/p><p>We also have to think about ways to reduce our energy usage.

There are conditions for offsetting and generation; do they work well elsewhere and is there potential in this?

They are pushing for a co-ordinated exit for the European Union.  I would advocate that Ireland join in that push.  The one complicating factor with treaties such as the ECT is that they have a sunset or survival clause.  Basically, this means that if a country unilaterally exits the treaty, it will still apply to that country for 20 years.  That is a problem Italy is having to deal with; it exited the treaty and it is still having to deal with these cases.  The way to get around that is for a co-ordinated exit that involves a neutralisation of the sunset clause.  As many countries as possible should get involved.  The European Union is the largest part of the ECT so a European Union exit where they all agree to nullify the sunset clause would eliminate a substantial percentage of possible ISDS cases under the treaty.  That seems to be the clearest path forward.  Modernisation talks are taking place this week but so far they have not produced anything.  They are taking a long time.  Going back to the original point, there is no real need to keep the treaty because it is not providing any benefit.

The other part of it would be renewable energy and getting data centres to build renewable energy developments.  Those schemes, not just in Ireland but also in places like Denmark, have tended to be relatively small.  They are like pilot schemes and one could cynically say they are just greenwashing because they get a lot of attention but the extent to which they or renewable energy investments offset or account for the huge energy demands of data centres is minimal.<\/p> <p>  There are technical solutions.  One part of it is where the emphasis lies and who is responsible.

As Dr. Bresnihan said, there are a lot of small projects with UPS systems which are more sustainable such as batteries and even small deployments of green hydrogen.

The data piece struck me.  We have focused a lot on energy production but to drill down into the question on demand, the fact is that all data are not the same, as we know.  We know from the general data protection regulation, GDPR, that different kinds of data are treated differently.  We know there is currently an artificial intelligence, AI, regulation moving through the European system about what algorithmic uses might be legitimate or otherwise.  It is worth noting that training algorithms has measurable costs equivalent to numerous transatlantic flights.  There are certain uses of data.  I worry sometimes when we say that we want the connectivity, public services and all the other great uses for data because part of the drilling down is not only around the energy usage but is also around drilling down on the demand side and into what are efficient uses of data and what are redundant uses of data simply to maximise profit.  The mining of cryptocurrency would be an example of the latter.  Is that something anyone can afford in terms of energy anywhere in the world?<\/p> <p>  I am sympathetic to the idea of a moratorium until we put in place a clear picture of the regulations we are going to have around responsible data usage.  What prioritisation will we have if we have energy crunches and how will that apply to particular data usages?

My position was that while there have been some modifications and so-called improvements to the language in CETA compared to other treaties, there are still loopholes there.  The creativity of investment lawyers cannot be overestimated.  There is still risk attached to CETA in that respect.  It also addresses investment courts versus the investor-State <i>ad hoc<\/i>tribunals.

It only allows investors and no one else to bring cases.  <br\/><br\/>I absolutely want to comment on the Senator's broader question about developing countries.  I have long been arguing that investor-State dispute settlement is the biggest problem in developing countries because they lack the capacity to respond to these types of cases and are, therefore, more likely to be chilled and to be more likely to backtrack on their proposed plans.  In the early 2000s, I looked at cases in places such as Indonesia, which had plans to ban open-pit mining.  It held off and reversed course because of threats it would be sued.  We hope we will be able to get people in the developed world to care about cases relating to climate in the developing world because we need everyone, everywhere to be acting.  Last year, I did a report with the Institute for Environment and Development in the UK where we mapped the coal plants in the world that need to be phased out in order for us to keep within the 1.5&deg;C goal in the Paris Agreement.<\/p><p>It is no surprise that a large majority of them are in the global south.  They are in countries such as Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia.  Since these plants are relatively new and further behind on coal transition, there is a lot of value still in them.  Therefore, there is great potential for awards if a country is going to phase out coal power in the near future, as we want.  To give an example of the sort of hypocrisy associated with countries having to pay awards against them, Pakistan has had an award against it of almost $5 billion in respect of a mine that was never actually built, thus bringing up the lost future profit issue.  Almost at the exact same time, Pakistan was being offered a $6 billion loan from the IMF.  We are talking about the international community loaning a country a huge amount of money and then saying it actually needs to pay it all back to an investor.  This is a huge contradiction within global economic governance, and it has serious implications when talking about battling climate change at global level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kyla Tienhaara","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I am aware that three-hour committee meetings are imminent.

It is not too often that people ask me about blank cheques but I am happy to discuss the matter.  On Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan's comment on what is going on, there are many developments in green hydrogen in Ireland and across the world but if we continue at our current pace in Ireland, we will probably have solutions and infrastructure ready for 2060 or 2070.  That is way too late.<\/p> <p>  On the HyLIGHT project, through research across MaREI, NUIG, UCD and DCU and research by our colleagues in the North, we are doing a lot of the groundwork to pull the strands together.  Effectively, however, there is a stepping process.  We need to get the industry, regulators and infrastructure, in addition to the likes of the ESB and EirGrid, up to date on the technology and capability.  These are mature in other countries but we need to learn about them here.<\/p> <p>  One recommendation from a Hydrogen Mobility Ireland report, certainly on vehicles and heavy-duty transport, which would be the focus, is to have supports similar to those for battery electric vehicles.  This should be kicked off sooner rather than later.  An interesting point on that is that it ends up being the resident tenant, as we call it in shopping centre terms, to allow other applications to grow.  One of the applications, which we could discuss in respect of data centres, involves co-firing green hydrogen in backup open-cycle gas turbines.  The infrastructure is available and has been paid for.  The systems have lives of 15 to 20 years, or longer.  We do not want to be burning natural gas in 20 to 30 years; we want to be burning something cleaner.  We need to build up the capability.  What I note from the industry is that the technology for and capacity to produce hydrogen at a relatively large scale are probably issues concerning the planning regime.  I am referring to a planning application and to infrastructure deployment.  It will be within this decade, or within the next five or six years.<\/p> <p>  What is missing from policy is a focus on creating and supporting demand, be it through fuelling stations for heavy transport, auctions, decarbonising or moratoriums.  If backup power has to be 100% green and it is open as to how it is produced &ndash; it could be biomethane, hydrogen or whatever factories want &ndash; the market can solidify on the best solution and timeframe.  Hydrogen power probably needs Government support, moratorium support, in the initial stages but it is less than what we have asked for in respect of battery electric vehicles since they were launched in the mid-2010s.<\/p> <p>  Demand and achieving it are important.  It is a question of starting off slowly and speeding up quickly.  As I said in my opening statement, we can have a huge amount of experience under our belts by 2030 and build out vast resources in the 2030s so as not to have this happening in the 2070s.  I will be well retired by then.

The question was interesting in respect of what Deputy Cronin called \"social cohesion\".  I agree with her.  That is why I referred in my opening statement to the different dynamics that will be at play, whereby there will be increasing energy costs and carbon taxes affecting consumers, people in their homes.  In addition to opposition to these, there will be opposition to developments such as wind farms and energy infrastructure, whether that involves data centres or upgraded grid.  Whether it is offshore or onshore, grid and physical infrastructure will be built.<\/p><p>The more there is an understanding that this kind of transition is happening to benefit, for example, tech companies and other large end users rather than citizens, the more that could be a recipe for trouble.  We have seen that elsewhere with things like the <i>gilets jaunes<\/i>movement and the big protest about carbon taxes in Peru.  Even in Ireland, one could say that there was something similar with water charges.  That is the kind of flip side.  Just transition gets a great deal of air time but the flip side of that is the concept of &quot;eco-austerity&quot; that has been coined in the past number of years.  The latter is this idea of transition where the burden of the is placed on the poorest, most vulnerable and so on.  That is the bigger picture.  It is important to bear that in mind in decisions relating to data centre development.<br\/><br\/>Another point was made about a debate on wider issues and more systemic things.  That is a very significant point but one thing that has come up in our conversation so far is the exponential growth of data and its consumption.  I would be very hesitant in trying to talk about individual behavioural responsibility, namely, the idea of being on Netflix or whatever a bit less.  It is important to recognise that the need for data centres is driven by a business model which is about driving more data consumption.  The comparison that I often give to students - I teach a class in geography - on waste is that in the 50s and 60s there were many advertisements that one would see from plastics companies which were about encouraging housewives to use more disposable plastic because it would make their lives easier, they would not have to wash things up and could just throw it away.  These are advertisements that now seem appalling and are hard to imagine, but it is the idea of disposability, of getting people to use more, which is exactly what is built into everything, from lights to Netflix.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Bresnihan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I am going to have to cut across Dr. Breshihan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#L00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":258,"content":"<p>That is just the broader point on the disposability of data - fast data, one might call it - which it is important to raise..<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Bresnihan"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":259,"content":"<p>My apologies for cutting across Dr. Bresnihan.

My first point, building on what Dr. Bresnihan was talking about, is on getting the buy-in from the population and obtaining a cost-benefit analysis in respect of these data centres.  There is a KPMG report which states that 60% to 80% of the capital costs of data centres can be written off against taxes.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, was not able to say how much has actually been lost to the taxpayer as a result of these write-offs.  If one takes the &euro;7 billion that is being invested by the data industry in Ireland, this could be up to &euro;5 billion that taxpayers have been denied by these data centres.  If one also looks at the public service obligation, PSO, and how it is levied, it means that households are disproportionately subsidising data centres.  This is because the PSO is levied on peak demand.  We know that data centres do not use much peak demand but have a steady demand.  It is very important that we have the necessary conversations in respect of cost-benefit analysis and how much those data centres are costing us for the jobs we get in return.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to debunk the industry-led report.  That report was funded by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, but it was an industry trade group which stated that Ireland&rsquo;s climate was not the primary reason we have data centres here.  We have a favourable climate, but the relevant tax incentives are a factor.<\/p> <p>  Moving then on to the energy security question, which is what we were also asked to look at today, my fear is that if we continue to allow the data centres to expand without having the moratorium, it will make the argument for building LNG terminals - in respect of which there are two planning applications at present - stronger because we have this energy demand coming from the data centres and, as a result, we need to have energy security.  Am I correct in stating, Dr. Tienhaara, that if planning permission is given for those two terminals, they will be covered by the ECT and all of its provisions - prior to any reform of the energy charter - they will be protected under the very old ISDS model and that this will be the case for a period of 20 years?  This is a chicken-and-egg question in that are the data centres leading the demand for the LNG terminals.  Will what I have outlined mean that we will be left exposed to ISDS compensation claims if we want to phase out those terminals?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#L00500","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boylan and call, first, on Dr. Bresnihan to answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#L00600","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":262,"content":"<p>Is that the question on whether the expansion of data centres would become an encouragement or facilitator for the LNG terminals?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Bresnihan"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":263,"content":"<p>Yes, it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#L00800","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":264,"content":"<p>That seems plausible.

I should also note that an investor does even not have to wait until the terminal is built.  If the terminal it built was phased out, that would also be covered by the ECT.  Many of these investor-state disputes are launched even before something is actually built, depending on how far along they are in the process of developing a project.  The Keystone XL pipeline, for example, does not come under the ECT.  Rather, it comes under the provisions of very similar North American Free Trade Agreement.  That pipeline has not been built.  The company was still in the process of getting all the permits and so forth, but it can still bring a case and it can be not only in respect of the money that was sunk into the investment up until that point, it can also relate to the profits that it expected to make over the duration of the infrastructure being in place.

The figures we have heard today regarding data centres are very stark, as are those relating to the fossil fuel industry. I will start with a question for Dr. Tienhaara.  Our Government recently banned offshore exploration for fossil fuels and we have a ban on fracking.  Does Dr. Tienhaara think it contradictory that the Government would encourage the importation of LNG and, in light of the number of planning applications that are in train, would be looking at the possibility of establishing LNG terminals?  Does she think it is time for this type of activity to be banned?<\/p> <p>  I thank Senator Boylan for connecting the ban between LNG terminals and data centres because that is very much what the Solidarity-People Before Profit Bill would do if it is passed on Thursday.  The Bill in question is about banning both fossil fuel infrastructure and the proliferation of data centres.<\/p><p>That does not mean we should shut down existing data centres, of which there are more than 70 in the country; it means we should stop the development of more.  I honestly believe this is linked to the question of LNG terminals.  If 59% of gas reserves remain in the ground and if we take account of full-cycle emissions from the production of the gas to its distribution, would it be consistent to ban the import of LNG?  That is if we are banning offshore exploration for gas and oil and onshore exploration for fracked gas.<\/p><p> I have a question for Dr. Bresnihan.  An interesting question arose earlier as to what data centres are used for and the type of business model they represent.  It is clear the business model used by companies building these data centres, and who mostly use them, is about mining data in order to advertise, sell and develop business around what can be sold to a population.  This goes back to the point made by Dr. Tienhaara about reducing the amount of energy we use.  We must make stark decisions because we are in a climate emergency.<\/p><p> Dr. Bresnihan indicated that Ireland shoulders more than its fair share of the energy and water burden of global digital activities and that the prospects of energy insecurity may carry greater reputational and economic damage than a moratorium on data centre development.  Will he expand on that, particularly as there is a cohort of Deputies and Senators who believe we are damaging ourselves by not expanding the data industry?  Dr. Bresnihan is making the opposite argument.  There is also the question of just transition and how this affects communities, which perceive that they are bearing the burden because data centre activity eats into our electricity supply.<\/p><p> I have a final question for Dr. Tienhaara.  There must be an answer to all of this.  She mentioned the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance demand, which is that we address both demand and supply simultaneously.  I agree with her.  The severity of the climate crisis dictates that we need the State to intervene directly on the question of supply.  In other words, there should be state-led, controlled and delivered renewable energy power companies.  We have did that before with the ESB in the 1930s and 1940s and we could absolutely do it again.  If there is time, will Dr. Tienhaara comment on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#L01700","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I ask the witnesses to be as brief as possible, given that there are just six or seven minutes remaining.

In speaking about reputational damage, I was referring quite specifically to the recent news about Intel's expansion.  There was a discussion about whether it would invest in a bigger expansion of its plant in Leixlip, and whether this came down to a question of energy security.  It is not clear whether it is but it is interesting that the matter was raised.  If there are brownouts or blackouts this winter, it would not look great if Ireland wanted to attract data centres or other kinds of industries.<\/p> <p>  The other aspect of reputational damage relates to climate and energy commitments.  There is the question of words versus actions.  The figures are really stark.  Ireland is known as a hub for these data centres.  It is also becoming known, both among the public in Ireland and outside the country, that there are contradictions in the data centre expansion, energy security and climate obligations.  If we continue down this path in the hope there might be some sort of technological solution - that does not look likely - it will cause more reputational damage.  It will not just be about inward investment but generally about Ireland's commitment to such matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Bresnihan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the questions.  I applaud Ireland on going as far as ruling out offshore exploration for oil and gas and fracking onshore.  That is much more than my country has done.  However, I agree that building out infrastructure for importing gas is somewhat inconsistent with this approach, particularly if we look at the energy costs required to compress gas for transport as is the case with LNG.  It seems very inconsistent.  I also worry about the lock-in effect of that infrastructure.  As I have noted, such infrastructure is built for a long period and this makes it harder to transition, particularly when we add in elements such as the ECT, which helps reinforce that kind of lock-in.<\/p> <p>  On the question of how to address demand and supply, there are interesting proposals from the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance.  There is an academic and activist proposal for a fossil non-proliferation treaty.  There are interesting efforts in this regard.  I tend to agree that the state needs to lead and there are increasing calls for the energy sector to be nationalised and have more public companies providing energy.  I bring this back to the threat that any time a company is nationalised or we take public control of any aspect of the private sector, and not just the energy sector, there is a risk of being sued under these investment treaties.

The main bottleneck for the industry today to investing in offshore wind energy coupled with hydrogen or onshore wind energy coupled with hydrogen is demand.  This means that the demand that is fossil fuels today needs to turn to something greener sooner rather than later.  DCU carried out a survey of a number of haulage companies which, between them, have 300 trucks.  The survey found that more than 70% see hydrogen as a key element in connection with electric vehicles, but hydrogen has the range and logistical benefits.  That initial small demand is really important, but, coupled with that demand, we need support from the Government.  Certainly, the Government's hydrogen strategy needs to be published sooner rather than later in order to give clarity to the industry as to where to invest and what sectors will change.  Again, data centres are an opportune application and can use green hydrogen as a shift from wind, onshore and offshore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. James Carton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":282,"content":"<p>The figures are all provided by EirGrid.

On a given day in winter, the peak demand in Ireland is 5,500 MW, and 3,800 MW of 5,500 MW is about 70% of demand.  This would be by 2030.

It seems to me that that is very much related to a peak demand scenario rather than the average demand scenario, and I think that if you look at the EirGrid projections, based on the average demand scenario, you are looking at 28% of power by 2030 that would be used by data centres.  We will have representatives of EirGrid before us next week and we will put that question to them.  It is critically important that we are accurate in the numbers we speak about.<\/p> <p>  I heard an interesting discussion earlier today.  We are hearing caution - I will not say pessimism - on the one hand, and I am hearing ambition and optimism, on the other.  It is appropriate that those be the bounds of our conversation.  I view the world perhaps through an optimistic lens.  We have vast opportunity in Ireland to build out green energy infrastructure quickly.  Our challenge is to do that as quickly as possible.  In the past few years, we have started to see that a quicker decarbonisation of our energy systems - of our whole economy, actually - is quite possible, and what we see now as possible we did not see as such until quite recently.<\/p> <p>  I wish to pick up on a point Dr. Bresnihan made about Wind Energy Ireland.  Wind Energy Ireland had its conference during the week and is certainly doing what it is meant to be doing, which is pushing the Government as much as it can to develop its sector.  Wind Energy Ireland produced an excellent report called Endgame in the past few months, which shows that it is with the 30% demand from data centres scenario, which is the high scenario, that we could get well beyond 70% and even beyond 80% renewable electricity by 2030.  We should be ambitious and optimistic and work with the likes of Wind Energy Ireland to get to where we need to get to.  I am very heartened to hear Dr. Carton's comments and his vision for green hydrogen in Ireland and that Ireland would be a global energy hub.  I think we will be exporting clean energy around the world in the decades to come, and that is a very positive vision that we should all hold on to.<\/p> <p>  I have questions for Dr. Tienhaara.  We do not have time, unfortunately, to go into them.  Her contributions today were excellent and we value them very much.  I will not put any questions simply because we are well over time at this point, but I thank all the witnesses who have appeared before us today.  It really was an excellent discussion.  I thank members as well.  I think we have advanced the level of debate on this subject.  With respect to questions about moratoriums, we have heard today that this is a very nuanced situation and that there are real technical challenges in what we are trying to do.  We are world leaders in this area and, to my mind, that question of a moratorium needs to be looked at very closely.  In a nuanced technological situation, it seems to me that a moratorium might be a sledgehammer-to-crack-a-nut approach.  This is very much an operations issue with the likes of EirGrid, which is a world leader, and I think we should listen to them and trust them in their abilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092800002#N00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1632783600,"counter":284,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 2.38 p.m. until 12 noon on Tuesday, 5 October 2021.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence","time":1632783600,"counter":285},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>Th\u00e1inig an Comhchoiste le ch\u00e9ile ag 12:30<\/p><p>The Joint Committee met at 12:30<\/p><p>COMHALTA\u00cd A BH\u00cd I L\u00c1THAIR \/ MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Cathal Berry, Gerard P.

I welcome Mr. Andrew Anderson, executive director; Ms Michelle Foley, memorial project co-ordinator; Mr. Hassan Ali Faiz, Afghanistan human rights defender; and Ms Olive Moore, deputy director.  We very much look forward to hearing from them on their work, particularly in recent times.  We are looking forward to an update from Mr. Faiz, with particular reference to the very challenging situation across Afghanistan.  I want to particularly welcome our guests to an in-person meeting.  We have not had one for quite a while.  In that regard, they are most welcome, although they will have noticed that we are not back to full normality as yet.  However, we would hope that as the term progresses, we can return to having members and guests at our meetings in person.  It is appropriate that in one of our earliest meetings of this Oireachtas term we will have the opportunity to hear from the witnesses on their priorities, challenges and work.<\/p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that first we will hear the witnesses' opening statements.  I understand we will be treated to a short video presentation on human rights defenders in Colombia, before going into a question and answer session with members of the committee.  As we are quite time-limited due to Covid restrictions, I ask witnesses to be conscious of time constraints when initially addressing us.  Following the opening statements, we will have a discussion of questions and answers with members.  I remind the members of the need to be concise with questions in order to allow all members an opportunity to put their questions and our guests and witnesses to respond comprehensively to questions.<\/p> <p>   I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that we should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of any person or entity.  Therefore, if any statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  I know that any such direction will be immediately complied with.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make that person identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in the meeting if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for joining us.

As the Chairman stated, it is a real pleasure to be at an in-person meeting after so long.  We have submitted to the committee a briefing document.  I will not read all of it because I do not think that would be helpful.  However, I will begin by reading some words from one of the human rights defenders we work with, Claudelice Santos, who is an environmental defender in Brazil.  She said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThey cut down one, two trees, but a thousand, five thousand other trees will appear.  This is how we will be able to make the world a place with hope, with people seeing the future with hopeful eyes and not afraid to lose their life for the chainsaw of greed and malice of those who do not agree with the idea that the environment is life and that those who defend it also deserve to live. <\/blockquote> <p>As members know, we live in a time with human rights challenges and very difficult contexts around the world.<\/p><p>One of the ways we can make a difference is by supporting those people working at the local level who are making a practical difference to advance and defend human rights.  Unfortunately, those people, those human rights defenders, HRDs, who work peacefully for the rights of others and to defend the most vulnerable, are also those who are the most targeted in many countries.<\/p><p> This year, we have awarded 641 emergency protection grants already, and that is almost the same number as we managed in the whole of last year, so the level of practical support we are providing to human rights defenders at risk continues to rise.  That &euro;1.8 million has been delivered to defenders in 89 countries and 108 of those grants have recently been awarded to defenders in Afghanistan, which is clearly one of the biggest crises we are facing.  We have also been giving big levels of support to human rights defenders in Nicaragua, Belarus, Turkey and Colombia.<\/p><p> I take the opportunity to publicly thank the Irish Government for its ongoing support, both in terms of the political priority it has given to the protection of human rights defenders at the UN, in other international fora and in the EU, and also bilaterally with a number of governments.  There is also the key support we have had from Irish Aid, which has been a supporter of Front Line Defenders since our beginnings almost exactly 20 years ago, in 2001.<\/p><p> We want to raise three key issues with the committee this morning.  There is a growing trend, unfortunately, of killings of human rights defenders around the world.  My colleague, Michelle Foley, who runs our memorial project, will speak about that.  We will talk about imprisoned defenders and we will speak briefly about Afghanistan, before passing over to Hassan Ali Faiz.  I will pass over to Ms Foley to talk about the horrific trend in terms of the killing of human rights defenders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021092800002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Anderson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting us to appear.  The HRD memorial project is a joint project initiated and co-ordinated by Front Line Defenders, working together with international NGOs, including Amnesty International and Global Witness, as well as local partners in the countries where targeted killings of human rights defenders are the most prolific.  The project has been actively tracking and verifying the killing of defenders since 2016 and, just last year, we recorded the killing of at least 331 human rights defenders in 25 different countries.  The most at-risk groups are those working on land, environmental or indigenous people&rsquo;s rights, which make up 69% of the overall figure.  The subgroup of defenders working specifically on indigenous people's rights accounted for 26% of killings, which is particularly egregious given indigenous peoples are estimated to make up just 6% of the world's population.  While killings took place in 25 different countries last year, the vast majority took place in just seven, namely, Colombia, the Philippines, Honduras, Mexico, Afghanistan, Brazil and Guatemala.<\/p> <p>  There is no denying that it is the figures from Colombia that are particularly in need of urgent action.  Our partners in Colombia, El Programa Somos Defensores, gathered and verified the instances of the killing of 199 human rights defenders because of their peaceful work last year.  This figure accounts for well over 50% of the global figure.  In consultation with defenders on the ground, we have conducted an extensive analysis of the context which is allowing these killings to take place and we have shared this with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Department.  Ireland, as a long-standing supporter of the Colombian peace process, is in a unique position to address these issues.  As it currently holds a seat at the UN Security Council, it is both opportune and timely for Ireland to champion peace-building, human rights defenders and security in Colombia as a key priority area for the Security Council during its membership term.<\/p> <p>  It is my pleasure to introduce a short video from Diana S&aacute;nchez of la Asociaci&oacute;n Minga, who will speak on why Colombian human rights defenders are being killed at such a high rate, the impending elections in May, the expected rise in violence and what countries like Ireland can do through the UN Security Council framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021092800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle Foley"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1632783600,"counter":292,"content":"<p>The joint committee watched an audiovisual presentation.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Foley.

As regards long-term imprisonment, it is interesting to note that Ms Mary Lawlor, our former executive director and now UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, is currently preparing to submit to the UN a report on the long-term imprisonment of human rights defenders.  That is an issue that we have been seised of for quite some time.  One of the challenges in some of these cases is that after the person has gone through initial detention and trial, there is little sustained attention because there are very few developments in the case.  That is one of the reasons why we are trying to shine a light on some of those cases.<\/p> <p>  We have a personal commitment to this issue because Abdulhadi al-Khawaga, a human rights defender from Bahrain who worked with Front Line Defenders for three years up to 2011, has now been in prison in Bahrain for just over ten years.  He recently celebrated his 60th birthday and his tenth anniversary in prison in Bahrain.  Abdulhadi worked with us to support human rights defenders across the Middle East and north Africa, but stepped down from Front Line Defenders because he became engaged with the movement for democracy and human rights associated with the Arab Spring events in February 2011.  He was detained and brutally tortured, requiring surgery to reconstruct his jaw, and subjected to an unfair trial before a military court.  He was officially sentenced on charges of terrorism and overthrowing the state by armed force.  Not a shred of evidence with any credibility has ever been presented against him on those charges.  He is a prisoner of conscience adopted by Amnesty International.  From prison, he continues to be an advocate for human rights and a peaceful resolution of the situation in Bahrain.  We recommend his case to the committee and ask that it seek to redouble efforts to call for his release.<\/p> <p>  In the course of setting up this session, we spoke to the committee about the case of Fr. Stan Swamy, a Jesuit priest who died a few months ago in India having been detained for nine months at 84 years of age and denied proper medical treatment.  We are continuing to work on the case of Fr. Stan but it is important to highlight that 15 other human rights defenders arrested in connection with the same legal case are currently being held in India without trial on spurious charges.  We encourage the committee to consider that issue and perhaps recommend that the Department of Foreign Affairs follow up on it.<\/p> <p>  Turning to Afghanistan, we are lucky to have with us Mr. Hassan Ali Faiz, who will share his thoughts on his experience of being forced to leave the country and of coming to Ireland.  Before he does so, I note that we have had fantastic co-operation from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Front Line Defenders had access to approximately 50 visa waivers for human rights defenders at risk.  Of those people, 14 are now in Ireland, while 23 others are in transit.  That makes a real life-saving difference to some of those people who were at most extreme risk.  The co-operation, particularly from Mr. Gerry Cunningham and others in the Department, not just in providing the visas, but also following up, being in touch with airline staff and border guards etc., and accompanying the human rights defenders on their journeys, has been phenomenal.  We really appreciate the support and engagement of the Department on that issue.<\/p> <p>  Front Line Defenders has also been trying to help facilitate the relocation of other people from Kabul.  In the past ten days, we have been able to get 168 human rights defenders who had visas for onward travel out to Islamabad.  It is a fragile process, but we hope to have a third flight with people on it this week.  The key issue in that regard is visas.  We have been able to get some people out if they have onward visas for travel to a third country such as Ireland, Chile, Portugal or Canada.  We have managed to secure visas for all of those countries.  However, if a person does not have a visa, there is currently no way out of the country.  Indeed, some of the people who were able to get across the land border to Pakistan were turned back.  Our third ask of the committee is to recommend to the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Government more generally to consider increasing the number of visas available for those human rights defenders who are most at risk.<\/p> <p>  We continue to work with people who are in extremely difficult situations.  I was speaking to a female human rights defender at the weekend.  She is in hiding in Kabul as we speak.  She went back to Afghanistan a week before the fall of Kabul because she was trying to help family members get out of the country.  Many people have displayed that kind of selflessness and remained in Afghanistan to look after family members or colleagues.  Some of the ten people for whom we have Irish visas but who have not yet left remain in the country because they are trying to look after their colleagues and family members who they have not yet been able to get out of Afghanistan.  We hope that more of them will get out this week.<\/p> <p>  The support we have had from the Government on this issue has been fantastic but the support we have received from other European Governments has been quite depressing.<\/p><p>We have been disappointed in the European Union's response to the issue of human rights defenders in the country, particularly given that the EU and many European countries supported human rights projects and organisations in Afghanistan over the past 20 years.  The EU has provided some funding to support human rights defenders but has been very limited in what it has been able to do in terms of co-ordinating the evacuation of people at high risk and the provision of visas.  That is primarily an issue for the member states but they have, for the most part, not been helpful in terms of the provision of visas for human rights defenders at risk, with a few notable exceptions, including Ireland.<\/p><p> I will stop there and give an opportunity to others.  It is probably more important for the committee to hear from Mr. Hassan Ali Faiz about the current situation in Afghanistan, the level of need and his own experience of the perilous journey to be here with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021092800002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Anderson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":298,"content":"<p>Members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, representatives of civil society organisations, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted and honoured to be here to inform you about human rights and the situation of human rights defenders in Afghanistan.  To begin, I express my gratitude to Front Line Defenders for its unwavering support in safeguarding human rights defenders during the recent crisis in Afghanistan.  Several human rights defenders were evacuated to safer locations, sparing their lives, which were in grave danger.  Front Line Defenders once again proved to be practically on the front lines, providing robust and timely protection to human rights defenders.<\/p> <p>  I also thank the Irish Government for its kind commitment to granting visas to me, my wife and our child, as well as all other Afghan human rights defenders, through the Irish refugee protection programme.  I applaud the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs for enabling the safe passage of human rights defenders through diplomacy as well as assisting some human rights defenders practically to ensure their smooth entry into Ireland.  I experienced that in Frankfurt.  The people from the consulate accompanied us to the airport and one of them talked to the people in Germany and convinced them that we had been granted valid visas.  That help was fantastic and I appreciate it. <\/p> <p>  The collaboration between Front Line Defenders and the Irish Government yielded notable results.  It gave Front Line Defenders prominence among other human rights organisations in Europe.  The Irish Government, despite its limited military and economic involvement in Afghanistan, was a pioneer in harbouring human rights defenders and journalists, the most abandoned groups.  No one really cared for activists and journalists whose lives were at grave risk compared to those on the lists for evacuation of different countries.  Countries that supported human rights programmes in Afghanistan and exposed human rights defenders through their work left them behind and did absolutely nothing to save their lives when they were in grave danger.  Unfortunately, by withdrawing militarily, some of these countries also withdrew from their moral obligations.  Leaving human rights activists at the mercy of terrorists cast doubt on the good intentions of those who supported human rights work in Afghanistan.  It not only enraged Afghan human rights defenders and raised questions about the motivation behind human rights efforts, but it will also have ramifications for human rights programmes around the world.  What would be the takeaway for human rights defenders in eastern Europe, south and southeast Asia and Latin America who are fighting under repressive regimes?  Will they have faith in the governments that support their human rights initiatives?  Will they not fear being abandoned in their home countries if the political situation becomes tense?  <\/p> <p>  I have not worked with the Irish Government or Irish-funded projects, but I have been supported to resettle in Ireland.  That shows the long-standing commitment of the Government of Ireland to the great cause of human rights.  I implemented projects for over a decade that were funded by some European countries but, at the end of the day, unfortunately, they left us behind without asking whether we were safe in that country.  That did not only disappoint me, but it also disappointed many other human rights defenders in Afghanistan.  I have not implemented projects for the Americans but the transport plan of the US Government allowed us to fly to Doha and from there to Ramstein in Germany.<\/p> <p>  What the Irish Government did during the current Afghan crisis to protect human rights defenders and journalists rekindled faith and belief in the great cause of human rights.  It revived hope in human rights defenders that they are not alone and that there are still friends out there who will recognise their noble work when they feel helpless and hopeless.  Many human rights defenders I spoke with expressed regret that they had worked for human rights rather than for an embassy or international troops when Kabul was on the verge of collapse and no one cared about them.  I am stressing the point that civil society activists were very disappointed because they were left behind by those with whom they had worked.  They were left at the mercy of the terrorist groups.<\/p> <p>  Now, as the Taliban tightens its grip on the country as a whole, horrifying allegations of human rights atrocities are emerging on social media.  I have heard of these atrocities from friends who are still in Afghanistan.  Millions of girls who used to go to school are no longer able to pursue their ambitions for the future.  Girls schools have been shut down.  Women who demonstrated for their rights in several cities soon after the fall of the government were brutally silenced.  Journalists who covered the protests were detained and subjected to horrific torture.  Despite the Taliban's pledge of general amnesty, there is adequate evidence of the crimes they have committed.<\/p> <p>  The Taliban has just announced that the harsh Sharia rule, which allows for the execution of individuals accused of theft and the amputation of their hands and feet, will soon be reinstated.  The group is forcibly displacing thousands of members of ethnic and religious minorities.  I have heard that more than 3,000 families from the Hazara community were ordered to leave the homes in which they have been living for decades.  Their agricultural lands have been confiscated and redistributed to their fellow Pashtun Sunni Muslims.  The Taliban is almost exclusively Pashtun ethnic and Sunni hardliners, whereas the Hazara ethnic minority is Shia Muslim.<\/p> <p>  Following the Taliban's capture of the Panjshir Valley, which committee members may have heard about on the news, there have been unsubstantiated reports of mass executions, forced displacement and extortion.  Until two weeks ago, the valley was the anti-Taliban movement's last stronghold.  The Tajik ethnic group, the Taliban's arch-rival, led the movement.  No humanitarian aid was permitted into the valley and no journalists were allowed to enter.  Residents of the valley who dared to leave were beaten up.  Their phones were searched to ensure that no information, photographs or videos of the crimes in the valley were leaked.<\/p> <p>  The Taliban, which is made up of criminals, has no regard for human life and dignity, which are the foundations of human rights.  They have demonstrated that in practice.  Extrajudicial killings, torture, persecution of minorities and political dissidents, humiliation of women, extortion and expropriation of land and property will no longer be isolated incidents but will become the norm.<\/p> <p>  Just a few days ago, the Taliban killed four people in Herat province and hanged their bodies in the city squares.  The Taliban claimed that those killed were kidnappers, but no one knows whether that is true or how they were killed because there are no checks and balances in place.  The civic space in Afghanistan has almost completely closed.  Over 150 media outlets have been shut down and more than 300 non-governmental organisations have been asked to quit their work.<\/p><p>Journalists were beaten up, arrested, detained and warned to discontinue their work.  Human rights defenders and media workers, particularly female activists, have been the Taliban's favourite targets.  Those who demonstrated for their rights and freedoms were harshly repressed.  Some protesters were detained and severely beaten, and there are unconfirmed reports of enforced disappearances in various cities across the country.  Activists and journalists are frequently insulted and humiliated.<\/p><p> What aggravates the situation is the enabling environment for other terrorist groups such as ISIS and other criminals who have disguised themselves as Taliban, making life a living hell for activists and journalists.  There have been unconfirmed reports of activists being arrested and detained on false charges of holding secular ideologies or spreading secularism.  Non-Pashtun ethnic activists are even more vulnerable to targeted attacks because the Taliban are largely belonging to the Pashtun ethnic group.<\/p><p> Women were categorically barred from civil, political and economic activities.  All of the women-owned businesses were shut down. Female employees of government and private businesses were told not to come to work.  Some days ago, a Taliban official stated that women are not permitted to work in municipalities and they are only permitted to clean women's toilets.  Human rights organisations have been closed down.  Neither their male nor female employees go to work.  The homes of some human rights defenders have been searched, and the Taliban group's intelligence is keeping a close eye on them.  A growing number of human rights defenders are seeking protection and assistance from the Afghanistan human rights defenders committee.  I am a current member of the committee.  All offices of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, the only national human rights institution established under the Paris Principles, were closed.  Their assets, including vehicles, computers and property were confiscated.  Taliban soldiers have taken over their offices.<\/p><p> The international community claims that tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from Afghanistan, but the proportion of human rights defenders evacuated is negligible because hundreds of human rights defenders remain there.  What complicates matters is that many human rights defenders do not have valid passports.  The national identity card database and the passport offices are now under Taliban control, so renewing or applying for a new passport is very difficult for human rights defenders.  Most importantly, when hiring employees, NGOs must provide the Ministry of Economy in Afghanistan with their personal information because salary tax will be deducted from their pay.  The Taliban have complete access to the Ministry of Economy's database, from which they will very well be able to obtain information on all NGO employees.<\/p><p> Last but not least, the rising level of unemployment as a result of many former government employees losing their jobs and many NGOs being forced to abandon their work in Afghanistan, combined with future uncertainty, has contributed to an increase in criminal cases across the country.  With the regime's international isolation, there is a growing fear of acute poverty in the near future.  The difficult days under the Taliban are, unfortunately, looming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021092800002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hassan Ali Faiz","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Faiz for that stark and rather horrific presentation.

I acknowledge the words of appreciation of Mr. Faiz with regard to the Irish Government's involvement in the response.<\/p> <p>  Members will be aware, as are our guests, that the Department of Foreign Affairs is working closely with Departments of Justice and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, as well as with a number of NGOs, to ensure that they are in a position to provide the visa waivers, selecting a number of human rights defenders and particularly those who have been judged to be at high risk.  Of a list of 49 persons, 15 cases have been prioritised by Front Line Defenders, some 14 have arrived in Ireland and a further six are due to arrive shortly via the Netherlands.  I wish to assure our witnesses, as Mr. Anderson has sought at the outset and as Mr. Faiz has acknowledged, that the Departments, the Government as a whole and the appropriate embassies will continue to work closely with Front Line Defenders to find solutions for the remaining group.  In this regard, Mr. Faiz's first-hand knowledge is most important in the context of those wishing to seek safe haven and shelter in Ireland.  I understand there are approximately 15 people currently in Pakistan, together with remaining individuals in Afghanistan.  This committee would be very pleased to convey Mr. Faiz's first-hand report directly to the office of the Minister, this afternoon or tomorrow, to ensure that we can continue to assist where possible.  Mr. Faiz referred to visas at the outset.  One of our committee members, Deputy Stanton, is a former Minister of State at the Department of Justice.  He is an experienced hand in the issue of visas and visa waivers.  I know that he has listened attentively to the presentation. I will now call on Deputy Stanton, then we will proceed to Senator Craughwell and Deputy Berry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021092800002#E00400","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I welcome our guests and thank them for their presence, their contribution and their work.  When the Chairman and I were with the Department of Justice, we lived through the situation that obtained in Syria, which I often described as hell on earth.  We now have another situation developing in Afghanistan which is the same if not worse.  Horrific events are being reported.  This morning I listened to Christina Lamb on \"Today with Claire Byrne\".  Ms Lamb spoke about the people of Afghanistan as being particularly gentle and generous, and at the same time they are being subjected to this terrible abuse.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Anderson said something that struck me about reports across the world that democracy is in decline, and that the year 2020 was the 15th consecutive year of long-term global democratic decline.  Is that Mr. Anderson's experience?  Ireland is on the UN Security Council and we punch way above our weight in many places.  What can we do about it?<\/p> <p>  Today is United Nations International Day for Universal Access to Information.  Mr. Faiz spoke of journalists being persecuted, jailed and deprived of freedoms and liberty in Afghanistan.  Will Mr. Anderson comment on that?  We have seen reports across the globe where under certain regimes and in certain countries journalists are targeted because they are the people who get out the information and hold governments to account by telling everybody else what is going on.<\/p><p>Very often, journalists are one of the first points of contact for oppression when a regime takes power that is not democratic.  <\/p><p> The issue of long-term imprisonment is, again, a major worry.  There are more and more reports of people across the world being imprisoned without trial, cause or due process and who are just being left in prison.  Does any of the witnesses have up-to-date numbers on how many people across the world are in that position at the moment, especially front-line defenders?  I welcome the recognition that we in Ireland have been to the forefront in Europe and, possibly, the world in providing assistance and support.  For a very small country, we are doing what we can.  I know the people of Ireland want us to do what we can. <\/p><p> It is harrowing to hear what is going on.  I sense we are only hearing some of it.  What is happening in the Panjshir Valley has been alluded to, as has the total closedown of information.  I am interested in that situation because I have watched it carefully and Mr. Faiz told us that all information has been shut down, so God knows what has happened there.  I thank the Chair.

It is not easy to come in and tell the stories they had to tell.  I will deal first with Afghanistan.  There are a couple of issues with it.  One is that we have had many statements from sources like the UN Security Council expressing concern for women and girls.  These are words.  Words mean nothing, at the end of the day.  There are thousands of young girls who started to experience education for the first time in their lives and that has now been taken away.  That is a matter of grave concern to me.  I ask Hassan, if he will forgive me for using his first name, what else we can do apart from use words.  The countries with troops stationed in Afghanistan ran out of the place in such a panic they left armaments and infrastructure behind them and left women and girls, in particular, to the mercy of the Taliban who clearly have no regard whatever for females.  What practical steps should the UN Security Council take when it comes to the plight of women and girls?<\/p> <p>  During the final hours of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, a young lady who had been working in a particular public area - I do not want to say where because there are always people watching what we say here and I do not want to expose her - who was deeply concerned.  She had assisted a foreign force or government as a worker and wanted to get out of the country.  She latched onto me via my social media account because she thought I was a United States Senator.  I had an engagement with her for a few days.  I have not heard anything in recent weeks.  Her concern was that she had all the credentials allowing her to be withdrawn from Afghanistan for her own safety.  She claimed, and I have nothing to prove or disprove this but I have to put it out here, the Taliban was actively involved in forging documents to get its members out of the country and into western democracies.  If that is true, it is a serious security issue for every country that has accepted Afghanis.  I am interested in Mr. Faiz's views on that.  Is it likely that this has happened?  If so, does he have any ideas on how we might try to rectify what went wrong there? <\/p> <p>  Does Mr. Faiz see a role for UN troops in Afghanistan?  Could we, for example, set up enclaves under UN flags to allow girls to return to education?  One doctor contacted me and told me she was not allowed to practise without a male member of her family being with her at all times.  Apart from anything else, I cannot understand how she would be able to interact with a woman if she has to have a male member of her family with her all the time.  That is a matter of grave concern to me.<\/p> <p>  The story Ms Foley and Mr. Anderson told of Colombia is in stark contrast to the official story from that country.  The video was quite telling.  I agree with the Chairman - I know he will rapidly follow up on what he said - that we should get the ambassador before the committee fairly quickly to put these facts before her because they are frightening.  Since Colombia has come out of a period of internal turmoil, terrorism, etc., have former terrorists integrated into the official Government of Colombia?  Is there then a loose wing that has remained outside the Colombian Government and is still behaving as terrorists in the region?  Are some members of the official government side, for all intents and purposes, acting without control and could they also be regarded as terrorists?  <\/p> <p>  As a country emerges into a peace process, it is very difficult to get everybody on board all of the time.  Is that an issue?  Is it the case that the likes of Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC, are still actively recruiting combatants in the region?  If so, what is the impact of that?  With respect to the long-term prison referenced by Mr. Anderson, what can I say?  The stories about the priests, an 84-year-old man who has been in prison for nine months and a 60-year-old man who has been in prison for ten years, are horrendous.  I support the Chairman's view on the matter and I am sure the committee will do everything it can when contacting the Department on it.  I thank the witnesses for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021092800002#F00300","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I thank our contributors for their time and contributions.  I do not think anybody could have seen the recent events, particularly in Afghanistan, that have played out in the media as being anything other than horrendously disturbing.  I firmly hold the opinion that what we see in the media is the very tip of the iceberg of what is actually happening in countries.  Even outside Afghanistan, what we see in the media does not tell the true story or give the full picture of what is transpiring on the ground.<\/p> <p>  How are human rights defenders in Afghanistan coping?  How are they doing?  On their day-to-day operations in the country, how do Front Line Defenders judge their safety and ability to continue to perform their role, which is vital in many respects?  I will ask a very difficult question.  In places such as Afghanistan where there has been a marked increase in oppressive action, including brutality in many cases, against human rights defenders, realistically, how long can they remain active on the ground?  Is a predetermined level set at which it is deemed to be no longer safe for these people to physically remain in that environment?  If such a level is set, how close are we to reaching it at the moment?  How many more risks are they willing and able to take before they need to seek outside support and are removed from the area? <\/p> <p>  I echo the sentiments expressed by the Chairperson on Colombia.  An invitation needs to be issued as soon as possible to the Colombian ambassador to return to the committee to address what was shown in the video.

Broadly, the forces of democracy and human rights are under pressure in more places than ever before.  Populist authoritarianism is growing.  We are seeing an undermining of democracy and the rule of law in parts of Europe as well as across Africa, Latin America and Asia.  It is important to understand it is not all one-way traffic.  Many people are engaged in the struggle for human rights and democracy on the ground.  There have been positive steps in Zambia and Malawi recently, where elections saw a transfer of power and authoritarian leaders left power.<\/p> <p>  A couple of years ago, there was the transition in Sudan.  There was the worrying news of an attempted coup over recent days and the transition there is still very fragile.  Nevertheless, one aspect that links Zambia, Malawi and Sudan is the important role of civil society.  It was local people mobilising on the ground to push for free and fair elections in Zambia and Malawi that ensured that happened in a peaceful way.  It was local civil society mobilised in Sudan that put pressure for the overthrow of a corrupt dictatorship.  Although the current transitional arrangements are not ideal, they at least offer a peaceful path forward.  It is important the Security Council and others remain seized of the need to support that transition in Sudan.<\/p> <p>  There is probably more bad news than good news out there, but we should recognise that nearly everywhere there is progress it is contested space.  Where we are seeing progress, it is because of the actions of people working in local communities in a peaceful way through civil society organisations.  Whether they call themselves human rights defenders might vary in different contexts but, broadly speaking, supporting local people working peacefully to advance human rights and democracy is, we believe, the way to continue to make a difference.  Even in those countries going in the wrong direction, it is being able to continue to support those people who are continuing to work that offers some hope for the future in those countries.<\/p> <p>  As for journalists, it is true they are often the canaries in the coalmine, the first ones to be silenced in many places, together with other human rights defenders.  We have seen that, for example, most recently in Belarus.  One of our partner organisations is Reporters without Borders and we continue to work with it and others to try to support journalists at risk.  Some of the people we have helped to get out of Afghanistan have been journalists.  Mr. Faiz might comment on circumstances in that country and what we can do.  I reiterate we have had a big focus in recent weeks, and will do for the next while, on helping people to get out, but we are also providing support to those who are going to remain inside.<\/p> <p>  One of the very impressive aspects of the actions of human rights defenders throughout the world is that - putting North Korea and Eritrea to one side - there is almost no country where there are not people working to advance human rights and democracy.  In China, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Afghanistan, people are continuing to work.  One of the challenges in Afghanistan relates to the fact that many people were outspoken and high profile and they are extremely vulnerable at the moment.  There will continue to be people who try to work in a more low-key way.  There are people trying to keep open some of the refuges that were in operation for women and victims of domestic violence.  It will be very difficult to do that and the space to do it has been narrowed greatly, but there will continue to be people who try to work inside the country.  One of our objectives, working together with people such as Mr. Faiz who have been able to get out, will be to try to find safe ways to continue to support people who are working inside the country as well as helping those who need to get out to do so.<\/p> <p>  As for our priorities, given the role of Ireland on the UN Security Council, we think it should reiterate the recommendation to call an Arria formula meeting at the council.  It is an opportunity to bring in the voices of human rights defenders from Colombia such as that of Diana, whom we heard so eloquently from earlier.  We think that is really important, not only because the issues they are raising in regard to the failure to implement key parts of the peace agreement in the context of the protection of human rights defenders are important but also because it sends a strong message to the Colombian authorities, when those human rights defenders are engaged with, that these people are of real importance to the international community and the Security Council.  It sends a message, I hope, that more needs to be done in respect of their protection.<\/p> <p>  Second, we encourage the committee to recommend that the Irish Government do more to follow up on certain cases.  That of Abdul-Hadi al-Khawaja in Bahrain is one the Government has raised in the past, but we are keen for Ireland and the EU to do more.  Eamon Gilmore, as EU special representative, has taken up his case but it is important to encourage the EU, as well as the UK Government, to push forward on that case as well as those of other human rights defenders such as Fr. Stan Swamey in India.<\/p> <p>  Our third priority in respect of Afghanistan in the immediate future is the provision of additional visas for human rights defenders at risk.  Ireland is a relatively small country in the global scheme of things and we recognise there is not an unlimited supply of such documents, but we have made a specific request to the Department of Foreign Affairs for an additional 50 visas and we think that would make a very important difference in helping some of those who are most at risk.  If Ireland could encourage more action at the EU level too, that would be of great value as well.<\/p> <p>  I will now pass over to my colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021092800002#G00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Anderson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I echo what Mr. Anderson said about journalists and human rights defenders.  There are still people on the ground who are working on human rights but they definitely cannot work the way they did previously.  One good aspect is that we have social media.  Whatever journalists cannot say through their official media, they can post on social media.  We need the Afghans who are deeply involved to use social media to provide this information.  I had a meeting with a few Geneva-based human rights organisations and they asked whether I would continue my work.  I responded that my work has just started.  There was some room to manoeuvre to work with the previous government but there is none to work with the current regime.  What I should do, therefore, is gather information and be a voice for human rights defenders in Europe.  People in the West would not be able to get that information from the media but we can provide it because we have people there on the ground who can pass us that information, which we can give to others who can lobby and advocate for the cause of human rights and give people a real picture.<\/p><p> One of the questions was about what the UN could do practically that was not just words.  The UN still has open hands and there is much that it could do.  An important thing is not to recognise the regime.  I understand that international isolation like that will put a great deal of economic pressure on the population.  I have heard that approximately 17 children have died of malnutrition in one of the provinces of Afghanistan.  I know that international isolation will have economic repercussions for the public but I believe that death with dignity is much better than living under that sort of repressive regime that has no regard for human life, human dignity or women's rights.  I propose that the Irish Government not recognise the regime.  Ultimately, the regime will fall to its knees under such pressure.  I know, as I am from that community and country.  I know that, under such pressure, the regime will surrender to what the world wants of it.  When the US showed it was serious about how the Taliban should not attack US soldiers, the Taliban did not attack any for 18 months.  The US told the Taliban that, if it attacked, the US would attack it in return.  Something that Ireland can do now is to not recognise the regime.<\/p><p> As to whether Taliban members will board planes and land in Europe or the US, I have that concern as well.  I have not met anyone who has said he or she is a member of the Taliban or something, but I have heard a great many sympathising with the Taliban.  I met them in Doha when I was in the camp and while I was in the camp in Ramstein, Germany.  That was unbelievable to me because they were still praising the people they were escaping.  One of the bad things with the American evacuation in particular was that more than 90% of those the US evacuated were from the ruling ethnic group and the Taliban is from the same ethnic group.  The over 90% of people who were evacuated from that one ethnic group sympathise with the Taliban.  That is why I am proposing, not to Ireland, but to Europe and America, that they be as careful as possible with the people they are bringing in.  I am afraid that it will create a headache for Ireland as well.  No one told me that he or she was a member of the Taliban or a relative of one, but I saw people sympathising with the group.  It was very unfortunate.<\/p><p> The Senator is correct.  In many cases, women cannot go anywhere without a male family member as a companion.  At the beginning, the Taliban wanted to show a positive picture to the public in order to say it had changed.  Now that the Taliban is holding its grip on the country, it is showing its real face to the world, and that is one that has no regard for equality or human rights.  It was just a few days ago that the Taliban stated it would reinstate Sharia rule, under which it will execute people and cut off hands, feet and fingertips.  It is thinking about bringing back that sort of brutal law.  The Taliban cannot be trusted.  It is a liar.  It has lied to everyone in the international community.  The committee might have heard of the Doha negotiation.  At every step, the Taliban has lied to the international community and others.  The international community should be as cautious about and strict towards the regime as possible.  I repeat that the international community should not recognise this brutal regime.<\/p><p> Regarding UN troops, if the UN is serious about women's rights and human rights, sending in troops could still work, but I do not know whether the international community would be supportive of that.  For the past 20 years, billions of dollars have been spent in Afghanistan.  That is the claim, at least, although those billions of dollars did not bring many changes to the lives of ordinary Afghans.  Something that no one can deny is that thousands of international troops died in Afghanistan.  It was an investment of blood and money.  For the past 20 years, they brought in the best equipment and equipped and trained 350,000 soldiers.  How could those troops not withstand fewer than 50,000 terrorists?  Can committee members believe that?  How could a country with that sort of equipment and that many soldiers fall to this terrorist group within a matter of days?  I could not have imagined it.  I was there before the fall of Kabul.  I never thought that the then regime would fall to this terrorist group, given all the equipment and the very well trained army, but it happened.  Ultimately, there was no regime because it could not resist the Taliban.  It had major international support, but I am not sure whether there would be that sort of investment again in a UN force of troops.  I do not know whether it is feasible.  The international community is frustrated with Afghanistan.  It is tired of the country.  I do not see a possibility of UN troops being in the country, at least any time soon.  If there is, though, I would be happy.<\/p><p> A question was asked about whether there was still room to work.  There is, but we cannot work the way we did previously.  We cannot work under the direct title \"human rights\".  While we were coming here today, I spoke about changing the strategy.  In the foreground, perhaps people could work with a focus on humanitarian activities or aid delivery services but in the background they would pursue their own human rights activities.  This would need a very smart strategy, though, so that the regime would not detect what people were really doing.  One strategy could involve people providing aid delivery services in the foreground.  Economically, the country is in a bad situation, so the regime would allow people their humanitarian activities, including aid delivery services.  Behind the schemes, people could then pursue their previous work.  There could be other strategies as well.<\/p><p> Afghanistan is not safe for human rights defenders.  The regime is slowly gathering intelligence and training its intelligence services.  It has a staunch supporter in the Pakistani Government, which is training the Taliban in how to keep an eye on human rights defenders and journalists.  Unfortunately, the country is not safe, but there is still room in which people can work and for them to get information out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021092800002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hassan Ali Faiz","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":312,"content":"<p>In your opening comment, you mentioned that the Taliban comprised almost exclusively ethnic Pashtun with some hardline Sunni forces.

Except the Hazaras, who are predominantly Shia Muslims, the rest are Sunni Muslims.  The Taliban are almost exclusively from the Pashtun ethnic group.

Concerning the neo-paramilitaries in the rural departments, even the human rights defenders on the ground do not have a clear understanding of the make-up of the groups.  One of our asks of Ireland at the UN Security Council is to call for the formation of a group of experts to look at neo-paramilitarism on the ground.  The Colombian Government often resorts to rhetoric that puts all the focus on drug-trafficking and neo-paramilitary groups and does not look at the responsibility of the Colombian state.  Ultimately, the state is responsible for human rights defenders and their lives.  If we keep passing the blame onto this neo-paramilitary group, it distracts from the fact 199 human rights defenders were killed last year and the Colombian Government is not doing enough to protect them.  There are many mechanisms in place but the political will to make them function properly is not there, as human rights defenders on the ground tell us.  There is a special investigations unit and there are lots of different programmes, and they keep creating more programmes, but they are not implemented effectively so they are not having any effect for defenders who are working on the implementation of the peace process.<br\/><br\/>We will be five years into the implementation process come November and it is defenders at the forefront of implementing it in rural departments who are most at risk.

There is narco-trafficking and paramilitary groups but when the special investigations unit looks at the crimes, it tackles the material authors of the crime and not the intellectual authors.  It keeps happening and is getting worse.  With elections to come in May 2022, the violence is already escalating in the departments.  There are 16 seats, called <i>curules de paz<\/i>, allocated in the peace agreement for victims of the conflict.  As people vie for these seats in the Senate, there will be more violence.

I remember meeting with an EU delegation when I was in Kabul in 2007 and 2008.  They were developing programmes to support human rights defenders who were at risk.  We have continued to co-operate with the EU over the years.  Up to a couple of years ago, it ran a specific programme for the protection of human rights defenders.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, in the weeks leading up to the collapse of Kabul, the EU decided that it was going to stop being directly in touch with human rights defenders inside the country and that it wanted to have NGO partners from the international level who would provide their support to human rights defenders.  We were caught a little bit in a difficult context.  We are the lead partner in the EU human rights defenders mechanism, which is a 12-NGO consortium that implements EU projects to support human rights defenders.  We felt, in consultation with Afghan defenders, that we should agree to co-operate with the EU on providing funding to human rights defenders at risk.  We had significant misgivings about doing this because this funding was being passed on as part of the EU withdrawal.  Instead of managing the funding itself and being in direct contact with Afghan human rights defenders, the EU wanted to give the money to us to provide support to those Afghan defenders.  This was fine on the financial side, but it involved the EU removing itself from being in direct day-to-day contact with defenders.  The EU could see what direction things were going in and did not want to be responsible for helping people with whom it had been working for a decade or more, in some cases, to find a place of safety.<\/p><p> Of course, the EU is in a difficult place because it does not have visas.  It relies on member states to provide visas to help those at most extreme risk.  Our frustration was that the political leadership to address that and to co-ordinate with member states to ensure some kind of orderly and co-ordinated support, particularly for those working on EU-funded projects, did not exist.  In addition to the excellent co-operation with Ireland, we have spent a lot of time in the past couple of months chasing around trying to find other EU member states that would be willing to provide visas for people who had been working on EU-funded projects, among other things.  It is very frustrating that there has not been more co-ordination at least from the side of the EU, even if it does not have the power to give visas, and that there was a bit of disengagement at the moment when the crisis was most acute.  This is not to say that we have not had good co-operation.  We have had good co-operation with Eamon Gilmore's office and with other bits of the EU.  If we are talking about the delegation in Kabul and the role of the external action service, however, we are not very impressed with how it managed things over the past few months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021092800002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Anderson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I again ask the committee to communicate the issue of not recognising the Taliban regime to other countries because this regime is in no way acceptable to any Afghan.

I have not implemented any US project on human rights this year.  There was only one.  Finally, I was able to board a US aeroplane and finally ended up here in Ireland.

However, there are still risks and members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and every second seat has been removed or is spaced to facilitate social distancing.  I ask members to note that, to observe those positions, to try to maintain social distancing when entering and leaving the meeting and to use masks at all times, except when speaking.

The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts of the Leinster House campus is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts.  The witnesses may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter, should they wish, for further guidance.  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings should be given.  If I need to give directions to any member or witness on parliamentary practice, I ask that they abide by that direction.  They should neither criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.<\/p> <p>  The group will open with Dr. Soares, whom I invite to make his opening statement.

I am the director of the Centre for Cross Border Studies and convener of the <i>ad hoc<\/i>group and, as the Chair pointed out, I am joined by representatives from three of the other organisations involved in the group's work: Dr. Aoife N&iacute; Lochlainn, Brexit policy officer of the Irish Environmental Network; Ms Tara Farrell, CEO of Longford Women&rsquo;s Link; and Mr. Chris Quinn, director of the Northern Ireland Youth Forum.<br\/><br\/>Joining together a range of organisations from Northern Ireland and Ireland, the <i>ad hoc<\/i>group was established in May 2020 to act as a prime contact for purposes of meaningful consultation between cross-Border civil society and regional, national and EU bodies, on matters relevant to co-operation between Northern Ireland and Ireland, and between the island of Ireland and Great Britain.  Organisations participating in the <i>ad hoc<\/i>group are on the front line of the study, promotion, support and delivery of North-South and-or east-west co-operation initiatives across a broad spectrum of areas of interest and have decades of accumulated experience.  They are organisations that see North-South and east-west co-operation, as well as wider international co-operation, as being essential to the ongoing peace and reconciliation process on the island of Ireland and to equitable and sustainable socio-economic development.<br\/><br\/>The primary objective of the <i>ad hoc<\/i>group is to secure the continued means to co-operate within and between these islands thereby ensuring that agreements, policies or legislation developed or enacted by relevant regional, devolved and national governments and the European Union, are conducive to the maintenance of the conditions necessary for co-operation within and between the island of Ireland and Great Britain.  In the first instance, in light of the protocol on Ireland-Northern Ireland, the <i>ad hoc<\/i>group and organisations involved in its work have been engaging with relevant decision makers, including the European Commission's task force for relations with the United Kingdom, the withdrawal agreement joint committee, representatives of the Governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland, the Northern Ireland Executive and the specialised committee on the protocol on Ireland-Northern Ireland.  The <i>ad hoc<\/i>group is committed to working with others to safeguard co-operation and good relations within and between these islands, and looks forward to doing so with those who are currently making decisions that will affect the future landscape for co-operation and the maintenance of relations between our peoples.  The <i>ad hoc<\/i>group believes that in order for all interested parties, including the Irish Government, to properly monitor the impact of the implementation of the protocol on the conditions from North-South co-operation, there needs to be sustained and effective engagement with those who are intimately involved in such cooperation.<br\/><br\/>The Ad-Hoc Group for North-South and East-West Cooperation, which brings together a range of organisations with decades of accumulated experience in North-South and east-west co-operation and relations, represents an invaluable asset in this regard, and calls on all parties to continue and deepen their engagement with the <i>ad hoc<\/i>group, including through the bodies established under the protocol.  Such engagement with the <i>ad hoc<\/i>group will ensure that organisations from the Republic of Ireland can offer their own perspectives on the extent to which they are able to engage in co-operation.  It is our belief that no serious monitoring of the impact of the implementation of the protocol on the conditions for North-South co-operation or on their east-west relations, can take place without hearing directly from those involved in such co-operation who are based in the Republic of Ireland.

We could not agree more about aspects of the Good Friday Agreement that have not been implemented.  In recent years, because of the UK's withdrawal from the EU, the lead-up to that and during the negotiations, a light has been shone on the absence of structures for engagement with civic society.  The Senator mentioned the Civic Forum for Northern Ireland.  That was replaced by a six-member advisory group, which was mentioned again in the New Decade, New Approach agreement.  We still have to see what exactly is happening with that.  I suggest that a six-person advisory panel is not a substitute for the Civic Forum for Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I agree about shining a light on the absence of an all-Ireland consultative forum, which was suggested in the Good Friday Agreement and reiterated in the St. Andrews Agreement.  There was a call on the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that it came about.  We have yet to see that happen.  The Senator asked whether the our group fills some of those gaps.  I would not necessarily say that we would fill it.  We cannot presume to speak for other groups but we are organisations that are intimately involved in North-South co-operation and in conversations on a North-South basis between a whole range of organisations with all sorts of areas of interest.  We are having those conversations in the absence of any structured mechanism to facilitate them.  We also engage with other civic society groups.  We have a meeting this afternoon with another group of civic society organisations in Northern Ireland to discuss some proposals relating to structured mechanisms for engagement with civic society.  We are coming together and those proposals have been developed Katy Hayward of Queen's University.<\/p> <p>  Regarding what we would like the committee to do, for my part, one thing that we are really conscious of, as mentioned in my introductory statement, is the implementation of the protocol.  Article 11 states that the protocol should ensure \"the necessary conditions for North-South cooperation\".  I urge the committee to assist and support us in our cause in any of those conversations about whether those conditions are being maintained.  Organisations based in the Republic of Ireland need to be seated around the table.  You cannot talk about North-South co-operation and whether conditions are being maintained by simply speaking to organisations at one end of that, which would be Northern Ireland groups in that case.<\/p><p>It has to be all of us together involved in that co-operation.  I would urge the committee to support us in ensuring those conversations involve both sides of North-South co-operation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021092800002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anthony Soares","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I am the chief executive of Longford Women's Link, which is a social enterprise.  We provide services to approximately 1,200 women and children annually in a wide range of areas.  We also engage in widespread regional and national advocacy.  I am a member of the board of Irish Rural Link and the chair of AONTAS, the national adult learning organisation.  We have been engaged in cross-Border all-island work primarily through the Centre for Cross Border Studies but we also have other projects in recent years.  We believe that working at a grassroots level is absolutely critical if we are to see meaningful co-operation and community development alongside an empowered civic society on these islands.  Initiatives we have been involved in include the Ad-Hoc Group for North-South and East-West Cooperation since last year and previously the New Common Charter initiative which is driven by the Centre for Cross Border Studies.  That is an initiative to empower civic society across these islands, North-South and east-west.  We have individual projects, including one on pushing boundaries with women's tech in Belfast which examines the role of women in non-traditional spaces.  We have a pilot project with the Northern Ireland Rural Women's Network supported through the reconciliation fund called From Grassroots to Government which is about advocacy and women finding their voices.  AONTAS, of which I am chair, has a new initiative called the Network for Adult Learning Across Borders, NALAB, which is an umbrella partnership of leading organisations in the field of adult and community education.  That gives a flavour of the kind of work we have been involved in.<\/p> <p>  As Dr. Soares says, what we really need is the committee's support around the implementation of the protocol in Article 11 and for us, amidst all the work we are doing, it is critical that there are proper functioning mechanisms and structures for engagement that include organisations from the South like ourselves as well as the North.  Otherwise we are not going to see meaningful engagement or the true spirit of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement replicated.  The questions we ask of our elected representatives is why those structures are not either functioning or in place.  We also have to look at the long-term outcomes and impacts on communities.  Looking at the last 18 months, civil society organisations have been to the fore of the Covid crisis.  Most of our services were designated as essential.  The question we ask is if we are deemed as essential during the Covid crisis and were relied upon to ensure that supports were delivered to communities, surely we are also essential in this context.<\/p> <p>  We are engaging in this work with our counterparts in the North because we believe in it.  We believe in the value of the work and we believe in the need to uphold the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement in its totality.  Obviously there are funding supports in place, such as the reconciliation fund, and they are very welcome but it is not just about the financial resources, it is about the impact that our work has and the energy that is required to maintain it without the proper structures that we can then feed into when we are looking at the impact of what it is we are doing.  Obviously, dialogue is very important, that is what we are engaged in, but what is the longer term impact of our work?  We cannot maintain this on our own.  We need the structures.  I am concerned that many civil society organisations will not be in a position to continue working in isolation on their own initiative.  I hope that the committee might also share some of these concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021092800002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Farrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I am the Brexit policy officer with the Irish Environmental Network, the environmental pillar.

Obviously, Ireland is a single biogeographic unit.  We have the same issues and challenges around climate change and biodiversity on both sides of the Border.  In 2019, we co-operated to produce a report on identifying the main risks to environmental integrity on the island of Ireland posed by the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  Obviously, the main risks identified were regulatory divergence.  Now since the finalisation of the trade and co-operation agreement between the EU and the UK and the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland some of these risks have been partially mitigated.  However, we are in the very early days of post-agreement to address our shared environmental issues such as climate and biodiversity.  We need to co-operate cross-Border but for that co-operation to be effective and practical we need shared policies, standards, aims and objectives.  It is not clear how strong the protection against divergence on environmental standards in the trade and co-operation agreement will be into the future and the strength of protection afforded by non-regression of standards and rebalancing mechanisms on future divergence has been criticised and critiqued by quite a number of UK environmental and social policy advocacy organisations.<\/p> <p>  What we see with the trade and co-operation agreement and the protocol is the extent to which what is agreed is focused on trade.  Obviously, environmental impacts go beyond trade.  Therefore, what are the solutions?  Our report in 2019 highlighted the potential for the Good Friday bodies, in particular the North-South Ministerial Council, to work on advancing environmental shared policy and practical co-operation and also to provide a forum for discussion on policy and regulation.  However, even at the best of times it has to be said that these Good Friday bodies are quite impenetrable to most of civil society.  They are essentially engaged in highly diplomatic processes and NGOs such as ourselves have very few routes for engagement on the matters under discussion.  Dr. Soares has spoken about the need for engagement with civic society on both sides of the Border to ensure co-operation can not only be maintained but also thrive.  Currently, on the environment, it is very hard to see where the avenues for engagement with NGOs are, particularly, as Ms Farrell mentioned, those NGOs south of the Border.  We need structures for engagement.  The question on the all-island consultative forum is a very good example.  A consultation forum which would provide an opportunity for citizens and NGOs to discuss environmental co-operation across the island is the sort of undertaking we need in order to see any real all-island change or progress on the environment.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee.

The question asked was what do we want members of this committee to do and how can we make more safe co-operation happen.  I can inform the committee that the youth forum has just received some funding from the Department of Foreign Affairs to set up a North-South youth forum.  This is something for which we have worked for 13 years.  It was very much based on the architecture of the Good Friday Agreement.  Part of that lobby involved a lobby for a Northern Ireland youth assembly, which has just been established this year under the speaker of the house in Northern Ireland.  We are very much pushing towards making that a sustainable and a very youth-led body.  The North-South youth forum is a big project of ours at the moment.

Incidentally, I am the rapporteur for a cross-Border education initiative looking at student mobility and opportunities across the island.

If so, how might young people have an input?<\/p> <p>  I ask Ms Farrell the same question.  I am familiar with Longford Women&rsquo;s Link and the brilliant work it does.  I know the challenges arising from the pilot project and other projects on which the group does great work.

The questions they asked are right up our street as a youth forum.  Young people have been talking about North-South co-operation for quite some time.  As I said, our lobby has been going on for 13 years.  The other ask I was going to come to was about young people having an opportunity to engage directly with decision makers like this committee.  In the North, we have a political champions group that meets young people regularly and is part of the architecture of the North-South Youth Forum.  We would like to set up something similar and perhaps have the opportunity to bring young people to this committee.  That would be a solid ask.<\/p> <p>  There are two pieces of research I can refer to in the context of the protocol.  One took place in May, as we approached the centenary of partition and the establishment of Northern Ireland, and the other is our Looking Beyond Borders research which asks young people's views on legacy matters, Covid-19 and contemporary issues.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, young people are talking to us about the big societal issues.  They are talking about Covid-19, poverty, housing, educational underachievement and discrimination.  That is not to say that the constitutional question is not important.  It still is important. However, young people are very focused on overcoming these big issues that we are facing across the island of Ireland.  They are talking a lot about having a space to talk about legacy matters.  They want to have a part in a conversation about a potential Border poll and they have expressed their frustration about not having a say on Brexit.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the protocol, our latest survey suggests, according to the statistics that I am seeing in front of me, that the big issues for young people are around human rights and climate change.  Some 42% of respondents to our latest survey talked about human rights being the number one issue.  Only 7% of young people who responded talked about Brexit being the big issue for them.  This survey is live at the moment.  Many young people are saying that they do not really understand the protocol or care too much for it.  The bigger issues for young people are discussions relating to identity, culture and their role in society, particularly Protestant or unionist working class young males and where their role is in society right now.  The latter are a group we very seldom hear from.  My hope is that forums like ours, the North-South Youth Forum, or a civic forum, can very much help to engage people who feel disenfranchised.

I thank Deputy Conway-Walsh for her kind remarks about Longford Women's Link.  She has been a great supporter of our work over the years, particularly on women in political life.  Her question is quite timely because we recently contributed to a piece of work with Dr. Joanna McMinn from Ulster University, funded through the reconciliation fund, around women's views on the constitutional future of Northern Ireland and Ireland.  We have had some very interesting conversations.  I brought together two groups of women from Longford and Roscommon and the conversations we wish to have are on the things that matter to all of us, namely, health, housing, education and well-being, and the future for our young people on these islands.  That is what took up the main conversation.  We have seen some very good outcomes from the citizens' assemblies here regarding a number of different issues.  It would be a fantastic start to have those structures, in order to have somewhere to feed these reports into.  There are a lot of conversations happening in women's groups around, for example, the impact of Covid, the impact of Brexit, the protocol and people looking for clear and accurate information but the communication flows are not always great.<\/p><p>The media has its own angle on various aspects of this.

These include health, education and domestic violence, which has exploded in the last 18 months and is a real concern for many families and communities.

It is essential that people have dialogue about co-operation.  One thing that I would stress is that we as community organisations, both North and South, are involved in trying to engage with all sorts of bodies and with decision makers within the Commission, the UK Government, a specialised committee, a joint committee, the Northern Ireland Executive, the Irish Government, particularly through the Department of Foreign Affairs, and the North-South Ministerial Council.  We at the Centre for Cross Border Studies are fortunate because we can use some of our core funding to undertake all of these numerous engagements.  They are engagements to ensure that we maintain the necessary conditions for North-South co-operation and also east-west co-operation and relations.  Many other organisations are not resourced to do that.  They are involved in numerous engagements.  There is a question of resources.  They are engaging in these conversations, which are taking them away from what they are funded to do, which is normally delivery of essential services and essential work.<\/p> <p>  I stress that conversations are great and we must keep dialogue going continually as part of the peace and reconciliation process, but there is significant frustration.  The conversation must lead to action and we must see joint action, with us working as a civic society group with political leaders and representatives, so that we can see these issues being progressed.  If we cannot see concrete action being undertaken and progress being made, then it leads to frustration and community organisations starting to withdraw.  That is a significant risk to North-South co-operation.  We are starting to see some indications from organisations of pressure they face and the changing circumstances they see in the political landscape of both North-South and east-west co-operation.<\/p><p>They are starting to feel the pressures to focus on the work within their own jurisdiction due to the enormous amount of energy that is needed for it and the lack of resources.  If the political conditions are not conducive to or encouraging of co-operation or if community organisations are not asked to be involved in these types of co-operations, there will be a risk of people going back to those days when we turned our backs on one another.

Does the group see itself as an information gathering organisation and if so, what is the feedback at present in regard to it?  Given some of the comments today, has the group's level of engagement diminished in any way since the introduction of the protocol?  What is the current status in that regard?

Mr. Quinn's organisation could have a good standing in regard to that sort of work, provided it is representative of all sectors of society.

If we are going to get along on this island, organisations such as hers will be fundamental to that .  Co-operation needs to continue at all levels, and from the bottom up in particular.

The Centre for Cross Border Studies's third quarterly survey on conditions for North-South and east-west co-operation.  The first quarterly survey was carried out in March.  It focused on civic society organisations and local authorities on the island of Ireland and their views on their ability to co-operate on a North-South and-or east-west basis following the end of the transition period and the beginning of the implementation of the protocol on Ireland-Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In the context of co-operation, what comes up time and again is the fact that it is about the political conditions.  This brings me to a very important point.  Article 11 of the protocol refers to maintaining the necessary conditions but that does not necessarily imply an understanding of what we see has been the conditions necessary for co-operation.  For us, these include the political conditions, the social conditions - that is, communities themselves and their support for North-South and-or east-west co-operation - and the material conditions, namely, the access that we have to goods and to people in order to undertake that co-operation, and the regulatory context which provide the framework.  The feedback we received from the quarterly survey is that people are concerned about the deteriorating political conditions for co-operation.<\/p> <p>  On information gathering and sharing, our group is really important in terms of the conversations we are able to have as organisations that are involved in co-operation on a North-South and-or east-west basis.  We are constantly exchanging information, raising issues, trying to find solutions and that is what forms our engagement with decision makers, including the joint committee, the Commission, the UK Government's Cabinet Office, etc.  That is really important to us.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about feedback from organisations in Northern Ireland.  The Centre for Cross Border Studies is based in the great city of Armagh.  We are a Northern Ireland organisation, although, obviously, we work on an all-island basis.  We have received a lot of feedback on the impact of the protocol on flows of trade.  In the context of co-operation, however, it is about the sense organisations have regarding the kind of support they have.  Do they feel as if they have the backing of politicians, the political leaders, in one or various jurisdictions in terms of them engaging in that co-operation?  I will hand over to Mr. Quinn who has been very sensible and used the technology to raise his hand.<\/p><p>I will go through the questions as logically as possible.  I sit on many groups such as this and am invited to speak to secretaries of state and with the Northern Ireland Office, NIO, and with the Department of Foreign Affairs, DFA, and the message is the same every time.  Civic society groups are frustrated that we are not part of the conversation.  The fact that the protocol has become a political football is very unhelpful.  As seen on the news today, unionism has issued its own position on it.  While we should not ignore unionist and loyalist concerns around the protocol, it is important that we work together to find a solution.  I am interested in hearing, through the North-South youth forum and other such vehicles, what the issues are which affect young people in the south of Ireland.  What are the issues affecting businesses across the island of Ireland?  What is the solution here?  How can we in civic society be engaged in the conversation to bring solutions?<\/p><p> In terms of risks, we saw violence on the streets in April of this year.  Seeing more of that is a fear of many here.  There is a real need to create safe spaces for people and from my perspective, young people, to have a conversation around the difficult issues.  We should not ignore the issues relating to identity and the constitutional question of a potential border poll.  We need to have those conversations, otherwise the risk of discontent and disconnection will continue to simmer.  <\/p><p> In terms of engagement, I think my colleagues would agree this has not really changed since the protocol.  I am proud to be part of a very strong and vibrant voluntary sector which works both locally and on a North-South and east-west basis.  That will still be there but there is much work to be done to promote understanding and education on what the protocol is.  My opinion, and this is not the opinion of the youth forum, is that we need to educate young people and people in general about the need for some kind of mechanism.  I do not know that everyone understands that with Brexit, there has to be some sort of protocol or agreement.  When I talk to people on the ground, and young people in particular, there is a lack of understanding on what is a very complex issue.  My call is very clear, and is about creating those safe spaces and investing in things like the all island women's forum and North-South youth forum, pushing towards an all-island civic forum.  It is important that members of civic society have a say in how those structures are set up and that they are sustained. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021092800002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anthony Soares","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>In answer to the question on what is the impact of the protocol on the work of our membership on our cross-border work, quite simply, and Dr. Soares has spoken about this, but it cannot be repeated often enough, with the protocol and the trade and co-operation agreement, TCA, there are now multiple committees involved in governance of the post-Brexit regulatory environment and this has led to huge fragmentation for advocacy.  It is very difficult to understand the impact, especially in the Republic of Ireland, and to follow the work of these committees let alone to engage with them.

It has been very interesting.  They talk in their paper about the political conditions and the social conditions for full North-South and east-west engagement.  Necessarily, the North-South bodies are more numerous as there are more obvious practical and logistical areas of co-operation, but particularly in the context of the sense of loss that some are feeling, that can sometimes be misinterpreted or even distorted as being an imbalance.  The witnesses said they have further meetings with colleagues today.  Are there any additional structures, or perhaps a refreshing or re-presentation of east-west structures, to address that perception that North-South is more adequately provided for?  Although it might go beyond their remit, are there additional mechanisms that the witnesses think would be helpful for addressing that perceived democratic deficit in terms of opportunities for people politically in the North and the South, but particularly in the North, where there are no MEPs, in order to feed into decision-making at an EU level?<\/p> <p>  I was struck by Dr. N&iacute; Lochlainn's point about the already complex architecture of governance arrangements that have sprung up from the protocol and the difficulty for organisations in navigating them.  I am glad I am not the only one who is becoming a bit bothered by all of the structures that are there, without potentially creating more.  Of course, there are more needs.<\/p> <p>  My last question is about engagement with the Executive, with the UK Government and with the European Commission.  The witnesses referenced at section 3.4 of their position paper a lack of detail, particularly in terms of how the UK will discharge its responsibilities.  Perhaps I am picking it up incorrectly but is there a bit of a difference in interpretation?  The witnesses might expand on the point that is made in section 3.4.  I suppose I will begin with Dr. Soares but any of the witnesses can pick up on those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021092800002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Hanna"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":379,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I will combine some of them..  On the perceived imbalance between North-South and east-west structures, Ms Farrell's opening remarks mentioned an initiative which the Centre for Cross Border Studies managed but it was not our creation.  It was a creation of civic society organisations North and South and involving civic society organisations in Scotland, England and Wales which developed the new common charter for co-operation within and between these islands.  There is a willingness there.  People already co-operate on an east-west basis between the island of Ireland and Great Britain so it is not just Northern Ireland civic organisations, it is organisations based in the South.  We work with and are in constant dialogue with our counterparts in Great Britain.  That new common charter was a kind of expression of that.  It is almost an expression of the gap.  In terms of governance and administration, there is the British-Irish Council that brings together the administrations of the devolved administrations, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Irish and UK Governments, but there is no equivalent for civic society.  There is a gap there and the new common charter was pointing towards that.  One challenge that has been mentioned is the trade and co-operation agreement and the mechanisms set up with the various committees and the intricate network or mechanisms under that which, as Dr. N&iacute; Lochlainn pointed out, add another layer of complication for civic society organisations which have to track them all.  If you are working on environmental concerns, you really do need to pay serious attention to all those committees and see how that is panning out.  However, it also presents an opportunity.  Within the trade and co-operation agreement there is a civic society forum that brings together the domestic advisory group for the UK and the European Union.  There is an opportunity to redress the east-west balance within that domestic advisory group that the UK would set up to link the island of Ireland, and particularly Northern Ireland in this case, and Great Britain.  However, it also points to another concern and complication.  In co-operation, whether North-South or east-west, we have to avoid that the mechanisms under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, TCA, do not speak to the mechanisms set up under the protocol because what happens under the TCA will have an impact on the operation of the protocol.  The two things have to communicate with each other.  There has to be a bridge there somewhere that we are channelling information across those two very important agreements.<\/p> <p>  Yes, there are challenges around the democratic deficit but there are solutions.  There are mechanisms there that the existing institutions could provide us with some of those channels.  The North South Ministerial Council continues to have under its remit an EU dimension.  In it, the Northern Ireland Executive meets with the Irish Government and may discuss EU policy and try to influence that development of EU policy.  On Northern Ireland, we continue to have an office of the Executive in Brussels.  We need to really reinvigorate that.  Northern Ireland has to keep an eye on what is happening in the Commission and try to be on top of the policy that is being developed.  It is not necessarily about keeping an eye on the possible draw-down of EU funds, it has to be a bit more proactive looking at the development of policy.  It is also about engaging with the Irish Government's representation in Brussels as well.   That is another communication aspect.  There is a possibility of a democratic deficit but another way to address that is to ensure that the civic society engagement that was set up under the Good Friday Agreement is properly established in a proper Northern Ireland civic forum and an all-island consultative forum.  Perhaps that could then be developed to create some all-island civic forum too.<\/p><p>The position paper on engagement with the UK Government, the Commission and the Northern Ireland Executive, and how the UK will discharge its responsibilities, was perhaps published in 2020.  I cannot recall.  I recognise that both the UK Government and European Commission have been trying to engage with civic society.  We had visits by Vice-President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi on his own.  We also had visits by Lord Frost on his own.  We have also had joint visits, as co-chairs of the joint committee, engaging with civic society organisations.<br\/><br\/>To properly address that potential democratic deficit, we have to make that engagement more structured because at present, it is the beginning of a good effort but it is <i>ad hoc<\/i>, like our group.  We are called to a meeting, people express their views and then we do not actually know what happens, then another meeting is called three months later.  A serious issue here is transparency.  For this to work properly, we need to have agendas and minutes, and people knowing who is at the meetings.  Even organisations that might not be at the table should at least know who will be at the table and they can communicate their views to those organisations.  We need to work on a proper structure for civic engagement to properly address that potential democratic deficit.  I will hand over to my colleagues now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021092800002#O00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anthony Soares","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":382,"content":"<p>In support of Dr. Soares's points, we have felt, having been involved in the New Common Charter process since 2015, that there has been no other space for grassroots organisations to engage in that level of dialogue on such a sustained basis.

We need a clear roadmap with deadlines and pathways of engagement.  As Dr. Soares said, we have been at various different meetings.

Regarding a focus for solutions, as the committee has heard, much of our work is <i>ad hoc<\/i>.  I am trying to keep an organisation afloat during a pandemic and a global economic downturn, when unfortunately the Department of Education in Northern Ireland has ripped an axe through the voluntary youth sector and many organisations underneath it.

PEACE has been kind to our sector and our organisation, and to me personally.  It has kept me in a job for many years.  The problem with PEACE funding, as one will hear often, is the bureaucracy that comes with it.  If the committee has any influence around the tables it is at, I ask it to ensure that PEACE PLUS enables us to do more for sustained North-South, east-west co-operation.  If at all possible, could it look at the level of bureaucracy?  The paperwork that comes with these things often takes away from doing the face-to-face work that is so important.

How difficult are things becoming in that regard?  <\/p> <p>  Does Dr. Soares want to take the opportunity to put on record some of his concerns about EEA nationals in terms of the implications of the electronic travel authorisation, ETA, scheme that the UK Government envisages in terms of its Nationality and Borders Bill and what it may be contemplating in terms of the common travel area?  What are the potential risks arising from what was said by the Home Office in recent weeks and the fact that there are a few issues up in the air?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021092800002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Farry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I will comment first and then I will hand over to my colleagues.<br\/><br\/>I thank Dr. Farry for his questions.  The North-South mapping exercise is an issue.  At the time, following its undertaking, one of the things that we noted was the following about the technical notes that were produced by both the UK Government and the European Commission, which essentially were almost the same technical note that accompanied the eventual publication of the mapping exercise on North-South co-operation.  Both technical notes pointed out that the exercise may not have captured informal, local community level co-operation on a North-South basis.  This is one of the reasons that the <i>ad hoc<\/i>group is also really important because most of the co-operation that we undertake takes place at an informal, local community level.  We are very keen, as we monitor the conditions for North-South co-operation and whether they have been maintained, that we capture all of that co-operation and not necessarily just the 142 areas of North-South co-operation that were included in the mapping exercise, which essentially looked at the regulatory underpinnings and the extent to which EU regulations supported those areas of co-operation.<br\/><br\/>For many of us who are involved in the North-South and east-west co-operation it is not the technicalities and regulations that keep us alive but the vigour, heart and passion that keeps us doing what we do.  However, it is important that we do not dismiss that and include, as we look at the conditions for North-South co-operation, that we pay close attention to that.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the question on whether we should have an audit and a refreshing, that is one of the purposes of the <i>ad hoc<\/i>group.  We can provide that evidence to those who are responsible for the monitoring, and Article 11 of the protocol, and give direct evidence in terms of how our co-operation is progressing, following the implementation of the protocol as it proceeds.<\/p><p> On the issue of EEA nationals employed or engaged in cross-border work or activities, we knew this would arise when the UK decided to withdraw from the European Union.  We talked about it and it has come about.  I refer to the whole issue of uncertainty.  If it happens that someone who is not a UK citizen or an Irish citizen is involved in cross-border work, there is uncertainty as to whether that employment is secure.  From the employers' perspective &ndash; we are particularly worried about this because of the various issues employers are dealing with - cross-border employers may become more reluctant to employ cross-border workers.  There are various issues around that, not only in terms of citizenship but also in terms of taxation issues.  In particular, as we move towards more remote working, especially for those resident in the Republic of Ireland and employed by an Northern Ireland employer, what are the implications in terms of their tax liability if they are engaged in remote working?  We must be aware of that and work to ensure it does not become an obstacle to employers employing cross-border workers in the future.<\/p><p> Regarding the issues of electronic travel authorisation and the changes to some of the documentary requirements for intra-CTA travel for citizens who do not have Irish or UK nationality, which will come into effect on 1 October, as members are probably aware, we were fortunate in that the policy team in the Home Office responsible for the common travel area engaged with us to talk us through some of those changes and their implications.  The Home Office CTA team was very clear there will be no changes to travel across the land Border here and that some of the policies were already in existence.  However, we pointed out to the team that even if we are talking about the continuation of existing policies, it has to understand that the context has completely changed.  Brexit has completely changed the position and created all sorts of uncertainties.  Any alterations to intra-CTA travel must be handled very carefully.  These issues are adding an extra dimension of uncertainty, particularly with regard to the potential implications for those who are not UK or Irish citizens with respect to their travel between the island of Ireland and Great Britain.  We must be very careful in how we handle any of those changes coming into effect on 1 October.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021092800002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anthony Soares","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Soares.

In case he has to disappear in the next few minutes, I will deal with some of those issues quickly.  As for Covid and the supports thereon, in addition to Covid public health restrictions and how they were implemented on either side of the Border, these are common issues.  We work with European partners in border regions across Europe.  They face the same issues in terms of the timing of the imposition of public health restrictions on either side of a border, the lifting of public health restrictions, the different types of supports made available to their citizens and how that affects cross-border workers.  These are common issues that have been felt to varying degrees across European Union borders.  We have seen this at first hand with our own Border.  It is highlighted to us especially through our flagship Border People project in respect of which we are grateful for the support of various stakeholders, including the North-South Ministerial Council's joint secretariat.  We have seen this at first hand with citizens who live at borders or have to cross our Border for work or other purposes.  They are the people who always fall between the cracks and have to deal with the differentials in timing and supports.  Sometimes it is a minefield and they have to scramble around for the correct information.  In that regard, our Border People project tries to signpost the correct direction.<\/p> <p>  On the taxation issue, I am sure the members are aware of the work of the Cross-Border Workers Coalition.  It has been highlighting the taxation issue, which had existed previously and is not a new issue.  It is simply that the onset of Covid and the changes to how we work, including the move to remote working, have focused a light on that particular issue.  The Cross-Border Workers Coalition is doing great work.  It has been engaging with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in trying to address this issue and seeing what the impacts of resolving that issue would be.<\/p><p>We would support them in that and we would encourage all sides to find a solution.

It is obviously a huge one and young people have talked a lot about how their rights have been impacted from a North-South perspective.  Based on some of the conversations we have had, one of the good things is young people are becoming more accustomed to the language of rights and they have talked about human rights as a key priority area.  On Covid-19, a massive number of young people felt that it impacted on their right to have a say, and that is both North and South.  They felt left out of the discussion.  They felt that their mental health had deteriorated significantly throughout the pandemic and that the issues around access to information were big.<\/p> <p>  In terms of cross-Border issues, young people talk a lot about healthcare, education and transport as well as economic disadvantage.<\/p> <p>  I am glad that Ms Gildernew brought up the bill of rights as well.

In the North, you have universal credit and welfare reform issues and rising poverty, and across the island of Ireland we are seeing issues around housing and homelessness rocketing.

In terms of PEACE PLUS, I note, speaking here as a director of the Centre for Cross Border Studies, that we responded to both public consultations around the development of PEACE PLUS and highlighted our own priorities around that, which, obviously, given the nature of our organisation, would focus on the ability of organisations to undertake cross-Border projects.  We also highlighted the need for people-to-people projects.  There has to be a real balance between those larger projects and the funding that goes to larger organisations, as well as funding going down to grassroots organisations to enable them to do the great cross-Border work that they do, which is both people-to-people in nature and invaluable.  I am hopeful that the PEACE PLUS programme, once it hits the ground, will enable us to do that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of obstacles to finalising that in terms of signing off on the PEACE PLUS programme, I would really hope that nobody puts obstacles in front of that because it is absolutely crucial to a whole range of organisations, North and South.  It is also a vehicle because of the way that this new PEACE PLUS programme has been structured.  It can also bring partners outside of the immediate eligible area.  It is not only for the six Border counties on the southern side.  It can involve partners from as far away as Cork.  It can also involve partners from Great Britain.  It can involve partners from elsewhere.  There is the ability to do so.  I really stress that we do not need political obstacles in front of signing off something that is of immense value to civic society organisations and other organisations across the island of Ireland.  I will leave it at that and maybe hand over to Dr. N&iacute; Lochlainn, if that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021092800002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anthony Soares"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Soares.

We really welcome that environment and climate will receive quite a bit of funding in the next round.  However, a large proportion of that will go on infrastructural expenditure such as transport.  What we are arguing is that nature and biodiversity deserves a much larger piece of the pie essentially and we would hope to see, when the programme is finally signed off, that biodiversity, nature and the marine would see a larger share of the funding.  I would be very hopeful that our membership groups in the Border area will be in a position to apply for PEACE PLUS funding for cross-Border environmental projects.

It is not that the sound necessarily carries but it can interfere with the recording and broadcast at times.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of this meeting is to have an engagement with a number of stakeholders, all of whom had made written submissions to assist the committee in its consideration of courts and courthouses.  All witnesses are appearing virtually before the committee from locations outside the Leinster House precincts.  I can see our guests logging on and coming up on screen.  They are all very welcome.<\/p><p>I wish to formally welcome to the meeting Mr. Darren Lehane SC, and Ms Mema Byrne, barrister at law, as representatives of the Council of the Bar of Ireland; Mr. Kieran Kenny, chairperson, and Ms Dympna Kenny, general manager, from Victim Support at Court; Dr. Aideen Hartney, director and Ms Susan Kennefick, senior policy and public affairs adviser from the National Disability Authority; Ms Angela Denning, CEO, and Mr. John Cleere, assistant secretary, from the Courts Service; Ms Nicola Matthews, senior architect, from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage; and finally, Mr. Gerry McDonagh from the Department of Justice, who is joining is in an observer capacity today, in accordance with the Standing Order we agreed to at the last meeting.<br\/><br\/>I welcome all the witnesses.  I must declare an interest or connection to one of the witnesses, namely, Mr. Darren Lehane SC, who had not so much the privilege but the dubious distinction of being my master when I trained at the Bar.  I am therefore well acquainted with him.  Any gaps in my knowledge are entirely my own and certainly are not the fault of the tutor but rather, are of the pupil.  I wish to acknowledge that and to thank him for his assistance throughout same.  <br\/><br\/>I ask the witnesses to unmute their devices when they are contributing and to mute them when they are not to minimise interference and manage the sound.  Can all the witnesses hear me?  Yes; good.  I also ask witnesses to be aware that mobile phone signals can interfere with the sound system, even if the phones are not making noise.<br\/><br\/>The following should be noted in relation to parliamentary privilege.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a manner as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses, in particular those attending remotely from a place outside of the Leinster House campus, they should be aware there are some additional limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present in the complex.  I do not think any witnesses are participating from a jurisdiction outside the State today.  Members are similarly advised of the same procedure as regards privilege.  We are meeting in a hybrid mode today, with some members and witnesses attending remotely and others attending in person.  Unfortunately, members who are not physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex will not be able to participate.  They can observe but cannot speak at the meeting because they do not satisfy the constitutional requirements to benefit from parliamentary privilege of being present on the Leinster House campus.<br\/><br\/>Finally, I remind members that the discussion today has a particular agenda, theme and tone.  I therefore ask members and indeed witnesses to adhere to that as much as is practical and possible throughout the discussion because time is somewhat limited, although we do have two hours for our deliberations.  The provisions on Standing Orders in relation to matters which may be <i>sub judice<\/i>place an onus on members to avoid comment on any matters which may be subject to proceedings, live or otherwise.  We will not stray into any matters that are the subject of current litigation in the course of the meeting.<br\/><br\/>The format of the meeting is that each organisation will be granted five minutes to make an opening statement.  That can be shared between witnesses or one representative can speak on behalf of each organisation.  We have a rota system in place on the committee.  Each member is allocated seven minutes for the first round, including both the questions and responses.  It is up to the members as to how they use their time during the engagement, whether it is a seven-minute monologue or a rat-a-tat seven minutes full of questions and answers.  I will move on after seven minutes has been allotted to each member.  If there is time at the end, there will be a second round of five minutes per member for secondary supplementary questions.<br\/><br\/>I will call on the witnesses in the following order, namely, Ms Byrne of the Bar of Ireland, Ms Kenny of Victims Support at Court, Dr. Hartney of the National Disability Authority and finally, Ms Denning of the Courts Service.  Each witness has five minutes to make their opening remarks.  I invite Ms Byrne to present to the committee.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092800002#A00400","speaker":"1583","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":419,"content":"<p>The Council of the Bar of Ireland welcomes the opportunity to address members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice in relation to the topic of courts and courthouses.  Committee members have already received our written submission.  Therefore, I intend to briefly summarise some of the salient points made in our submission.<\/p> <p>  The council considers that there are two broad issues to be addressed.  First, the physical infrastructure of courthouses and second, the requisite IT upgrades required to facilitate remote and hybrid hearings.  Notwithstanding significant improvements to many courthouses in recent decades, it remains the position that all those who use courthouses, and in particular, litigants, are faced with wholly unsuitable and inconsistent court facilities, where in some instances even basic needs are not met.  A lack of adequate consultation rooms and of separate waiting areas in court venues have a direct impact on the manner in which proceedings are conducted.  The lack of appropriate facilities significantly increases stress and anxiety, which can result in volatility and, on occasion, violence in the course of litigation.  A modern and efficient courts infrastructure will undoubtedly improve the experience of court users and the management of litigation.  The council supports the Courts Service in its endeavours to bring new technology and modern ways of working to the administration of justice in order that it operates to the highest standard for everyone, from vulnerable court users, witnesses and litigants to judges and legal professionals.  <\/p> <p>  Much work was done to ensure the safety of all court users during the pandemic.  While the introduction of remote hearings has greatly assisted stakeholders, there are significant aspects of litigation that are negatively impacted by remote hearings rather than in-person hearings.  It is the council&rsquo;s view that in-person hearings are essential for the majority of cases.  It is imperative that the physical infrastructure is not overlooked or neglected due to the reduced number of in-person hearings due to the pandemic.  It must be considered that not every person involved in litigation owns the technology or has access to appropriate facilities or has the capability, due to vulnerability or otherwise, to conduct a remote hearing.  Access to local courts must be facilitated in a manner which can meet the reasonable needs of all citizens.  Our written submission sets out further detail on some of our concerns regarding the physical infrastructure of courthouses.  We do not intend to address each and every one of those issues in this opening statement but rather note that they include ascertaining whether there are sufficient number of courthouses in a given district or circuit, which requires an analysis of the geographical location of courthouses; ensuring that every courthouse has adequate facilities for users, including bathroom facilities and consultation rooms; ensuring that the provision of supports and facilities extend to all users of the court, including those with a disability; and ensuring that acoustics generally are central to any courtroom adaption or redesign in order that all parties to proceedings can be adequately heard.<\/p><p>While physical access to courthouses and to hearings is imperative, it is likely that some form of remote hearings will continue in the future.  As a result, consideration must be given to how those who have no access to or can least afford the technology required to participate in a remote hearing can be facilitated.<\/p><p> All courts should have adequate broadband and Wi-Fi to support remote hearings together with hearing rooms or pods so that participants with inadequate facilities of their own may use such a room or pod to participate in the hearing.  At present, not all courthouses have adequate broadband.  This matter urgently requires action.  There is a lack of facilities in courthouses at present to allow persons with no personal devices and-or physical space to participate in remote hearings.  This matter requires urgent action as it may deny litigants and accused persons their right to effectively participate in proceedings.<\/p><p> Those who are accessing a court remotely require the ability to hear and see anyone that may not be in a position to participate remotely and who may be addressing the court.  This will require a significant upgrade in technology for many courthouses, which at present do not have such technology.  Our written submission contains more detail on the technology required at appendix 1.<\/p><p> There needs to be a more streamlined approach to ensuring e-briefs are before the court.  Many courts are not equipped to hear remote applications and-or remote evidence.  Investment in screens and other such equipment is important as they would be used beyond the pandemic for the presentation of paperless evidence.  It is the council&rsquo;s view that there should be uniformity across the country in respect of the facilities to conduct remote hearings.  Mr. Lehane and I are happy to address any questions that members of the committee may have arising from our submissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mema Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Byrne.

In the statement I am about to deliver, we summarise the key items recommended to the committee regarding courts and courthouses.  These are outlined in more detail in our written submission.<\/p> <p>  V-SAC is the only voluntary service in Ireland that specialises in court accompaniment for victims of all types of crime.  Our service currently operates in the Dublin, eastern and south-eastern courts.  V-SAC has an agreed strategy, which includes expanding its service nationwide over the next two to three years.  It is V-SAC's mission to provide a safe and supportive environment for victims of all types of crime, their families and prosecution witnesses when they attend court.<\/p> <p>  V-SAC acknowledges the great work being undertaken by the Courts Service in managing and maintaining the court buildings and the facilities within them.  Our recommendations are based on our staff and volunteers' experience working within the criminal courts where our service operates.  The facilities in the Criminal Courts of Justice, Parkgate Street, Dublin, are of a high standard and should be used as the benchmark for all courts within the State when considering any renovations or updating of facilities for victims of crime and-or those involved in criminal proceedings.  This means no matter what court a criminal case is due to be heard in, all involved in those proceedings are afforded the same level of service and standard of facilities when attending court.<\/p> <p>  To address the backlog of court cases, V-SAC recommends the following actions.  The first is to review the court legal terms and give consideration for staggering court closures, particularly during August and September.  The second is to review the sittings for Circuit Courts in the regional courts as some only sit for a number of weeks during the court term.  The third is to consider facilitating more Central Criminal Court trials in the regional courts, which would alleviate some of the pressure in the Criminal Courts of Justice.  The fourth is to consider non-court venues to hold proceedings, for example, Croke Park, or other suitable venues.<\/p> <p>  Some positive changes have been introduced because of the restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of Covid-19.  For example, the staggering of court lists throughout the day should continue when restrictions are lifted.  This would reduce the numbers of people attending at any one time and reduce the waiting times for all involved in the proceedings, especially the victims, as waiting around in the courthouse can add to anxiety levels.  V-SAC welcomes the increase in the use of technology within the courts, particularly for remote participation.  Where possible, this process could be used more extensively if courthouses are equipped to facilitate that.  V-SAC holds the view that every victim should be entitled to access our accompaniment service, regardless of what part of the country they live in.  We would be happy to discuss any of the recommendations set out in our submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Dympna Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Kenny.

The NDA was established in 2000 to provide independent and evidence-informed advice to the Minister on policy and practice relevant to the lives of persons with disabilities, and to operate a centre for excellence in universal design.  Universal design promotes the design of the built environment, products, services and ICT, so that they can be accessed, understood and used by everyone, regardless of age, size, ability or disability.  Our work includes research, advice, guidelines, codes of practice, and input to standards, and is also informed by the experiences and views of persons with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  Ireland ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, in 2018.  Many of the convention's articles are relevant to the remit of the Joint Committee on Justice, most notably Article 13, which obliges states parties to ensure effective access to justice for persons with disabilities on an equal basis with all others.  Other relevant articles include Article 5 on equality and non-discrimination, Article 9 on accessibility, and Article 12 on equal recognition before the law.<\/p> <p>  Article 4(3) obliges states parties to closely consult with and actively involve persons with disabilities in the development and implementation of legislation and policy relevant to the convention.  The NDA advises that this Joint Committee might consider to how it could engage with the voice and lived experience of persons with disabilities in its work, including through disabled persons organisations.<\/p> <p>  The National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2022, or NDIS, is the whole-of-Government approach to improving the lives of persons with disabilities, and is also the current vehicle for progressive realisation of the UNCRPD.  Our written submission outlines several NDIS actions that are relevant to the work of this committee, including Action 18B which obliges the Department of Justice and agencies to ensure all initiatives relevant to access to justice incorporate the needs of persons with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  Previous research points to the over-representation of persons with disabilities interacting with the Irish justice system, as both victims and perpetrators of crime.  However, the collection of data is fragmented and does not fully capture the reality of persons with disabilities engaging in court proceedings, or the wider justice system. We urge agencies to put in place a co-ordinated approach to collecting, disaggregating and sharing data, in order to inform future policymaking, in line with UNCRPD Article 31.<\/p> <p>  Realising the goals of the convention will require implementation of accommodations across the system that enable persons with disabilities to have access to justice on an equal basis with others.<\/p><p>Some of these accommodations will concern procedural matters within the justice journey and others will concern matters related to physical accessibility.  One of the key areas where procedural accommodations can be made is in upholding the rights of victims of crime to understand and to be understood in the context of criminal proceedings.  This includes provision for the use of an intermediary to facilitate communication with the individual giving evidence.  In an independent advice paper from 2020, the NDA set out how a standardised and regulated system could be put in place to support the provision of intermediaries to all persons with communications difficulties.  Many have disabilities from the earliest moment of engagement with the justice system, often in a Garda station, and onwards to court, as required.  The NDA is pleased to be contributing to the work being done by the Department of Justice to establish a pilot scheme of trained and accredited intermediaries.  <\/p><p> The Irish Sign Language Act 2017 obliges courts to do all that is reasonable to ensure that a person who chooses to communicate in Irish Sign Language, ISL, during court proceedings is accommodated to do so.  A report that we recently submitted concerning the operation of the Act found that, for the most part, criminal courts do provide ISL interpretation as needed, although improvements in the knowledge and awareness of the Judiciary would support more robust provision.  Civil courts, however, showed less preparation in respect of the commencement of the Act.  We look forward to the forthcoming amendment to section 7 of the Juries Act 1976 to ensure that deaf persons who need the services of a sign language interpreter will be able to undertake jury duty.  We also welcome the landmark inclusion of Patricia Heffernan as the first deaf member of a jury in September 2020.  <\/p><p> Existing legislation and strategies oblige all public bodies to ensure that their buildings, including courthouses, are physically accessible to all persons, including persons with disabilities.  Section 25 of the Disability Act 2005 requires public buildings to be compliant with Part M of the building regulations of 2010 by 1 January 2022.  These obligations extend to relevant courthouses.  Our review of this section of the Act in 2019, conducted with the Office of Public Works, OPW, highlighted poor awareness of these obligations across the public sector.  More modern courthouses are often more accessible-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092800002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aideen Hartney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I am sorry to cut off Dr. Hartney's flow, but I am conscious that we must move on with the meeting because of our tight timeline.

The Courts Service is responsible for the management and administration of the courts in Ireland.  The Courts Service has a unique role supporting the third branch of Government.  I report to a board, chaired by the Chief Justice, that is responsible for the determination of policy and for oversight of the implementation of that policy by me and my management team.  The Courts Service was established 21 years ago.  We inherited more than 240 court venues, many of which had fallen into serious disrepair.  The functions of the board of the Courts Service include the designation of court venues.  The Courts Services' building committee, which is a subcommittee of the board, has responsibility for the preparation and development of capital building and maintenance programmes and for establishing priorities in respect of the implementation of those programmes.<\/p> <p>  Our estate now comprises 103 courthouse venues, with 251 courtrooms.  Since its establishment, the Courts Service has invested more than &euro;500 million in courthouse buildings.  The maintenance of court premises is generally provided by the OPW on a reactive basis, but funded by the Courts Service.  Regular and planned maintenance of courthouse buildings on the scale required to keep the buildings in a good state of repair has not always been possible when limited funding was available.  A survey of conditions in 60 venues was done in 2019 and 2020 and found that 83% of the buildings that were inspected are protected structures, with an average time since being built of 162 years.  These findings set some of the context for our challenge.  <\/p> <p>  While we always have ambitions to provide enhanced services, there is a limit to what can be achieved with the available resources and what constitutes value for money for the Exchequer.  For instance, many of our District Court venues are only used once or twice a month because the court business of the districts does not require more sittings than currently provided.  The locations of courthouses are, in the main, legacy decisions associated with historical factors.  While these venues are extremely valuable to their locality, having these court buildings sitting idle for most of the year is not a good use of public resources.  Outside Dublin, there is generally no issue with the sufficiency of courtrooms.  In Dublin, in the short term, courtroom capacity will be a challenge that we expect will be alleviated by the development of a new and dedicated family law centre at Hammond Lane.  <\/p> <p>  Work remains to be done in some of our older stock of buildings to facilitate access to services for physically disabled people.  The question to be considered in retrofitting these venues is whether the usage of the building justifies the investment.  Increased use of technology and remote court sittings during the Covid-19 pandemic has eased some of the challenges associated with travel to court buildings for vulnerable users, including those with physical disabilities.  It is the policy and practice of the Courts Service that all newly-constructed and refurbished buildings should be fully accessible, provide for the needs of vulnerable witness and have dedicated victim support rooms.  This includes heritage buildings, which otherwise may be exempt in some respects.  The Courts Service values the historic significance of the many heritage buildings which it occupies nationwide.  Where facilities require improvement, it has always been the preference of the Courts Service to refurbish and to extend an existing courthouse so that it can remain in court use in the future.  Due to site or building constraints, however, it is not always possible to provide the full range of facilities on an existing site.  In such cases, it is the policy of the Courts Service to hand over the building concerned to the local authority for alternative community use.  <\/p> <p>  One of the pillars of reform in our modernisation programme is the provision of a modern estate and facilities, along with a rationalised estate, concentrating court sittings in fewer venues, the development of specialist centres and investment in modern facilities to support court users.  It is our ambition to reduce the requirement to attend courthouses and offices through the use of improved digital services designed to best serve users.  An estate strategy will be developed that will be underpinned by data.  These data will include demographics, case loads, distances between courthouse and travel times.  Future decisions about courthouses will be influenced by the national planning framework and spatial strategy and policy, and by policy on climate and the environment.  Given the age of our estate, it will be a significant challenge to meet environmental targets.  We have established a dedicated sustainability unit, which was recently expanded to face the challenge ahead.  <\/p> <p>  Our estate strategy will be guided by the family court Bill that aims to provide regional dedicated courts and by our experience during the pandemic.  For the last 18 months our aim was, and remains, to protect the health and well-being of employees, judges and court users while continuing to provide access to justice.  We succeeded in providing a safe environment through the use of a robust Covid-19 safety management programme, while quickly adapting and maximising the number of court cases that we could progress within the provisions of the public health guidelines.  Physical distancing requirements had an especially dramatic effect on our operating environment.  The Courts Service has provided in-person and remote facilities throughout the pandemic, with a particular focus on prioritising urgent business and those who are vulnerable, such as victims of domestic abuse.  We dramatically increased the use of video links to prisons and this has had a significant benefit across the justice system, as has the introduction of remote court sittings.  <\/p> <p>  To meet future challenges and demands for new means of providing access to justice, we have commenced a &euro;2.2 million investment in the installation of video technology to provide 103 video-enabled courtrooms by the end of the year.  Throughout the pandemic, part of our strategy was to manage footfall in court buildings while also ensuring that justice was administered in public.  Media outlets have been facilitated via priority access to the courtroom and the provision of links to observe remote court sittings without needing to leave their offices.  Court reporters have been the eyes and ears of the public in our courts. <\/p> <p>  Juries are always a priority group in the courts system, and we prioritised their accommodation before and during the pandemic.  We put arrangements in place, sometimes using external venues, to ensure that, to date, jurors have been kept safe - and they have told us that they felt safe - while providing their invaluable service to the State.  In summary, the aim of the Courts Service in the years to come is to provide just, user-centric, simplified and timely access to justice.  We intend to do this by maintaining the innovation and agility that we have demonstrated in the past 18 months, by collaborating with users and by keeping the needs and requirements of litigants at the centre of everything we do.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092800002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela Denning"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Denning.

I am based in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  We responded to the request that was made.  Our first point is that the sensitive adaptation of court buildings to allow them to continue to serve as courthouses should be the first consideration.<\/p><p>Alongside the impacts of climate change and the focus on the reuse of buildings, making these buildings redundant and moving an important civic function out of a town, usually to the periphery, can have a detrimental effect on a town centre's vitality.  It the decision is made that a courthouse cannot continue to fulfil its original function, we advocate the importance of it continuing in public use, such as a suitable community use.  There are many successful examples throughout the country of reused courthouses.  I will provide information to show work that has been carried out by the Courts Service with the OPW on adapting buildings and reusing them.<\/p><p> Part 4 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 gives primary responsibility to local authorities to identify and protect architectural heritage by including particular structures on their respective records of protected structures.  Many of our courts and courthouse buildings are included in the records of protected structures.  Such inclusion places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of the buildings as well as giving planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them.  The architectural conservation officers in local authorities can provide advice and support on the conservation and reuse of historic buildings.<\/p><p> With regard to the wider thinking on reuse and adaptation, there are key points worthy of consideration.  The collection of courthouses and courts represents an important built heritage legacy as many of the buildings were designed by eminent architects of the day, employing the best of traditional craftsmanship skills and using high-quality materials.  The buildings are often among the core buildings in Irish towns and cities and reflect the evolution of the legislative system in Ireland and the impact they have had on society.  The buildings encapsulate an important primary social record.  The abandonment of court buildings and courts removes an important function and a point of social interaction in town centres and this should be considered.  Any decision to abandon these buildings should be carefully considered in this context by suitably qualified conservation architects and should be based on an assessment of the significance of the site, the condition of the building fabric and its potential for repair, upgrade and need.<\/p><p> With the impacts of climate change becoming pronounced, the use of historic buildings is no longer just a cultural heritage issue but also one of mitigation based on the well-considered reuse and adaptation of existing cultural resources due to their embodied energy, craftsmanship and materials.  Many examples of good practice can be drawn on that show how high-quality design may be considered in the context of historic buildings and their sites, which will unlock their potential and sustain their long-term use.  I will provide the list of Ireland's courthouses in the Irish architectural archive that shows the range of them we have.  The Courts Service database shows new, old, adapted and extended court buildings.  I thank the committee and I am happy to answer questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092800002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Nicola Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their very informative opening statements.  I have a number of questions and I will focus on the contributions of Ms Denning and Ms Matthews.  I will take off my Chair's hat for this interaction and be a little parochial.  Ms Denning spoke about courthouses in other countries.  I was quite interested, and it was probably also of interest to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, to hear her say certain buildings are left idle for large parts of the year.  This is true.  My concern is that other buildings are the opposite.  They are at overcapacity.  I am thinking about Naas Courthouse which is local to me.  In recent years, the courthouse in Kilcock has closed.  The courthouse in Newbridge was burned to the ground, allegedly by an aggrieved defendant.  It is long gone.  The courthouse in Athy works two Thursdays a month.  It is not very often.  Naas Courthouse serves a population of most of County Kildare and west Wicklow.  According to the most recent statistics, in 2019 it served 17,000 cases and this does not include interlocutory motions.  This makes it the fourth busiest district in the country after Limerick, Cork and Dublin.  Limerick, Cork and Dublin all have more than one judge.  I am given to understand they have a wider choice of venues and a number of courthouses.  Put simply, the district is under severe pressure with the volume coming through a single judge and a single courthouse, bar Athy which is used twice a month.  This single courthouse has no car parking.  It has a common entrance for witnesses, defendants, practitioners, the judge, garda&iacute;, accused parties and all the rest.  The whole spectrum of family, criminal and civil cases is heard there.  The Circuit Court sits there in parallel with the District Court.  On occasion, the High Court has sat there when it is on circuit.  The Circuit Court and District Court sit most weeks in the year at the venue.  It is under severe pressure.  I understand there are some plans to expand it.  It is desperately needed.  Perhaps we might take this question first and Ms Denning will answer it.  I will then have further questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092800002#E00200","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":434,"content":"<p>Naas Courthouse was built in approximately 1807.  It has four courtrooms.  Two of them are technology courts.  The court sits there 14 days in the month.  It has two cells.  There has been significant population growth in north Kildare.  Our plans certainly are to provide a new or refurbished courthouse in Naas.  It is included in our plans in the national development plan but no specific funding for Naas has been provided yet for the project.  It is not possible to provide the full range of facilities we would wish to provide in a modern courthouse on the current site due to its constrained nature.  The options open to us are to extend the site, and there is a site available at the back of the courthouse, or to provide a new courthouse somewhere else in the town.  We have consulted with Kildare County Council's director of services, planning and strategic development.  The council's preference, as is ours, is to keep the courthouse in the town centre location.  We are actively engaging with site vendors at present so I would rather not say any more at this point in time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092800002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela Denning"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":435,"content":"<p>That is understood and I thank Ms Denning.

It is an impressive building and it dominates the landscape on the main street.  There are certain retail and hospitality benefits to having that activity on the street.  I agree with keeping it in the centre of the town.<\/p> <p>  There is a common theme that some of our courthouses are perhaps less well served than others.  The District Court is the workhouse of the court facilities and processes a large number of cases.  The committee approved Estimates for the Department to enhance courthouses during Covid and put in place Covid protections.  Ahead of today's meeting I took some soundings from practitioners and people who frequent the courts to see what issues had arisen.  Tallaght Courthouse was mentioned.  Several things were said to me.  One is that the bar room is locked and not available to practitioners.  Even during lockdown people have to robe or go in and go out or stand on the steps to have consultations and speak with each other.  Wi-Fi is not turned on or not activated.  At any event, it is not available to practitioners.  I know of at least one barrister who was exposed to Covid on the premises despite all of the protections the committee signed off on to prevent this from happening.  I can pass on the details if it is of interest.  That court in particular came up in a few stories that were recounted.  As I said, I took some soundings ahead of today's meeting and the feedback was not good, particularly in the context of Covid where additional supports had been given.  I do not know whether Ms Denning wants to respond to this.  It is something we can pick up offline if she would prefer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092800002#E00400","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I can respond to some aspects of it  I will have to check out others.  We took a risk-based approach to Covid.  From the outset, we put a very robust risk management programme in place.  We had recently recruited a health and safety officer and, God love him, his first job was to put our risk assessment in place.  Every courthouse in the country was risk assessed.  Every courthouse in the country had a maximum capacity of 2 m social distancing applied to it.  We hired personnel to stand at the doors of courthouses to make sure capacity was not exceeded.  We put glass screens in place.  We asked everybody to wear masks.  Extra cleaning was arranged.  New arrangements were put in place where necessary.<\/p><p>Regarding Tallaght in particular, I can only assume that the bar room was risk assessed and deemed as unsuitable for more than one or two persons and that was the reason it was locked.  I will investigate about the Wi-Fi and revert to you, Chairman.<\/p><p> To my knowledge, the HSE has not contacted us and notified us of any case of Covid transmission on Courts Service premises throughout the year and a half.  To our knowledge, we have not had an outbreak in a courthouse.

With all due respect, I did hope to see a lot more concrete proposals and insights into people.  When I think of courts services and engagement with users of the court, I do not only think of victims and witnesses, which seemed to be a common theme throughout the submissions.  Users are a much wider group than that.  There are families, for example.  There was no mention of gender, mental health, invisible disabilities or autism.  The geographical location is just one part of access to justice.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in getting an insight from the Courts Service and the Bar Council.  The Bar Council is inputting into what the courts look like and access to particular rooms.  Does the Bar Council have an impact assessment of the people who require its services and what their needs are?  What does the Bar Council bring to the table as people who have a real input into what the Courts Service or courthouses look like?  Is its focus mainly about its members or the practitioners or does it take into account the disabilities and invisible disabilities of people that require those members' services?  I ask the Bar Council to speak to that and perhaps the Courts Service could speak to both the vision for people in general and everything from language, gender, culture, inaccessible legal language for people with invisible disabilities and their ability to take instruction.  For example, what do you put through the machine at the entrance, in terms of the airport-style security and the fear that comes with that?<\/p> <p>  They are some of the issues I would like to have seen addressed but perhaps that is for a different session with the groups that use the service regularly.

The opening statement was geared at the questions I have been asked to respond to by way of submission earlier in the year.  At the early stages of the modernisation programme, we prioritised what I call ordinary users of the Courts Service.  This week, for example, we launched our just-a-minute, JAM, card initiative jointly with the Probation Service, the Department of Justice, the Dublin Coroners Court and the Prison Service.  People who have a learning difficulty or something like that can show their card.  Some 75% of our staff have trained in recent weeks on this initiative to help people who might be a little daunted by coming to court.<\/p> <p>  In our budget submission, I asked for a dedicated person for our website to work on plain English.  We have done a lot of work on our website in the past year.  We have 3 million hits on the website every year and it is a difficult choice because a lot of legal practitioners use it every day and they are looking for specific legal information.  We also have a large number of ordinary members of the public or people who might be summoned to court for something, and if it is their first time going to court, plain English is very important for them.  That is something we intend to look at next year.<\/p> <p>  We recently did a proof of concept in one of the buildings here in Dublin, and if it is successful, we will roll it out in other locations.  We went around and filmed the premises and there are points where people can tap a mobile phone on entering and it tells them where to go next.  Another option is to do a visit of the courthouse beforehand with little videos showing what the judge does, what the registrar does and so on.  That can help to make it a little less daunting for people who are coming to court for the first time.  If we expand it further, it will be possible for people to see the courtroom they will be in on a particular day, which might help people orientate themselves a bit.<\/p> <p>  The use of remote courts does help some people.  In the Far East, they say remote is a leveller.  Nobody is dressed up in a particular way and all you can see are people's heads on a screen, which levels the playing ground somewhat for people.  Our vision up to 2030 is all about ordinary court users, and if we keep them at the centre of everything, then all the other parts of the jigsaw puzzle should fit into place very well.<\/p> <p>  Justice is also blind.  One of the ladies on the top of the Four Courts has a blindfold.  We do not distinguish between different types of court users in terms of gender, race or anything like that.  Everybody is treated equally, as they should be.  That is the way our strategy for the next ten years is geared: that we treat everybody equally, but that we try to improve everything for everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092800002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela Denning"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":443,"content":"<p>Before I move to the Bar Council, perhaps Ms Denning could refer to the site at Hammond Lane and the fact the Children's Court is not going to go ahead on the site.

In the written and oral submission, it submitted the legacy that 20 years ago, when the Courts Service was established, it had more than 240 venues.  It now has 103, with 251 courtrooms.  The built infrastructure is extraordinarily important but surely the number one priority of the Courts Service is the administration of justice in as positive, open, fair and accessible a way as possible.  Accessibility is absolutely essential and there should be security so that victims do not have to sit or come into contact with alleged perpetrators.  There is also the question of general comfort.<\/p> <p>  Has the Courts Service determined the optimum number of courthouses and their position across the country?

We have never built a dedicated family court building before.

It is about ensuring the building we build meets the needs of the people who will use it.<\/p> <p>  Some of the design features people will see in Hammond Lane will be different from those in a traditional courthouse.  For family law cases, we are told by practitioners that fewer consultation rooms are needed, so there will be more consultation space in order that people can have a quiet chat and take instructions quickly without necessarily going into consultation rooms.  There will also be some breakout spaces - family law cases are very emotive - where people can go outside and get a break.

I thank Deputy Costello for making the universal design point for me.  It is crucial.  When we talk about access to courthouses, it is easy to think only about wheelchair access and the small number of people who that might affect.  However, if a universal design approach is taken, it benefits all users of the premises.  They can be people with families and buggies or members of the older community.  A universal design approach will also help to meet some of the sustainable development goals, which is important.  That also links in with the location of the courthouse because a city centre or town centre location also facilitates access to public transport.  That is also very important not only for users with disabilities but all potential users.  I wholeheartedly agree with the point Deputy Costello made.  In order to achieve equal treatment for all, sometimes a little bit extra needs to be done for some groups.  We would very much advise that.<\/p> <p>  I was going to make a point on data because somebody asked how many people with disabilities or mental health difficulties are accessing the various services.

Based on my experience of hearings conducted during the pandemic, I believe I was very fortunate that I participated in several lengthy hearings that were held online, including through the software provided through the Courts Service &ndash; the Pexip software.  One hearing was held via a private operator whose use the court facilitated.  One party paid for it.  My comment on this flows from the fact that one party paid for it.  It is rather unfair in a system of justice, which is supposed to treat all equally, that certain categories of cases can proceed faster than others based on the ability of parties involved in the litigation to fund a particular platform to the exclusion of other kinds of cases.<\/p> <p>  On the litigation experience, the Bar always takes it from the point of view not of the members as such but ultimately of the clients whom its members represent.  We are very conscious at the Bar that litigation is, in ordinary times, a very stressful experience.  A point was made earlier about court infrastructure.  We would always want to avoid a system whereby people say that since everything can be done online, there is no need to invest in physical infrastructure.  We do not want to have circumstances in which clients are forced to have consultations with their lawyers around corners outside office buildings or court buildings at what are some of the most stressful times in their lives.  This applies not only in family law cases but also in others.  Therefore, it is important that the facilities be provided.<\/p> <p>  I do not believe we should lose sight of the fact that, during Covid, notwithstanding the efforts of the Courts Service, Bar Council and Law Society, a lot of litigation ground to a halt and could not proceed.  It was possible to deal with urgent matters but many matters that were not classified as urgent by the Courts Service, Judiciary or various professions did not go ahead.  They were still urgent to the individual litigants.  They have to get their cases heard as quickly as possible.  That is my experience of litigation.<\/p> <p>  On a point that follows from this, on the question of vulnerable witnesses, which we were asked about earlier, the Bar Council is very conscious of the need to take account of the fact that people are vulnerable before they step into a courtroom.  Everybody is vulnerable in a courtroom but there are those who are vulnerable before they enter.  The Bar Council has always, or at least in recent years, provided training to its members in the form of advanced advocacy courses on how to handle vulnerable witnesses.  We are also very conscious of the recommendations made in the O'Malley report.<\/p> <p>  To sum up, I had a positive experience of online hearings in which I was involved but I am conscious that they were in a particular area of law.  The online forum is not suitable in many other areas of law.  The recent recalibration of the listing system by the Courts Service shows that with many aspects of the law, there will be a reversion to physical hearings.  It is trying to say that justice needs to be seen to be done.  People need to be present sometimes to see that it is done when it is impacting on them.

When there are fewer people around, victims are less anxious.  Particularly in the District Court, only people involved in the cases were allowed in.  This alleviated some of the stress for victims coming into court.<\/p> <p>  Remote participation, whereby the victim did not have to travel to court, or where the defendant was brought in through video link such that he or she was not physically in the same room as the victim, worked in favour of the victim.  Staggering the court lists has really worked.  Prior to Covid, a victim could have gone in at 10 a.m. for the 10.30 a.m. list but might not have been heard until after lunch.  Now the victims are brought in only at certain times, be it 11.30 a.m., 12 noon or even after lunch.  This means less waiting for them, which helps with their anxiety levels.<\/p> <p>  During Covid, we provided telephone support when the courts were physically closed.  We also provided video support whereby we talked to the victims, as we are doing now.  We have learned from that.  With the permission the Courts Service, part of our service is to provide a pre-trial visit whereby we show the victim an empty courtroom.  We are able to do this by video link.  That was for people who may have had to self-isolate and could not travel.  It meant they were getting to see the inside of the courtroom.  I was glad to hear from Ms Angela Denning of the Courts Service about having the 360&deg; video view of the courts.  We engaged with the Courts Service to suggest this so that victims, no matter what court they were to attend, would be able to go online and see its interior.

It has been a very interesting conversation.  Many of the issues I wished to raise have been covered but there are a couple of small points I wish to clarify regarding victim support, where it is at and how well it is provided for, particularly in courts in various parts of the country.  One of the things members hear regularly is that many victims of crime feel lost in the process.  They do not know where to go or what is happening.  There may be a garda with whom they have a relationship present in the courtroom who will give them a little advice regarding what is happening, what will happen next and when that will take place, such as advising that it will be a couple of hours before anything happens.  It is sometimes the case that victims are just hanging around the courtroom and they feel lost and out of it while the process is happening.  There needs to be a greater emphasis on ensuring that there is support and liaison for victims and an appropriate quiet space to which the victims can go to ensure they are looked after, particularly in more serious cases involving abuse or other issues that are difficult for people.  That is one of the things which seems to be missing from many courtrooms.  It needs to be prioritised and put in place.<\/p> <p>  An issue that links into that is that it is sometimes the case that victims are in the same room or use the same entrances and exits as the accused or those accompanying the accused.  That creates all sorts of tension.  An effort needs to be made to see how that can be managed better.  In some cases, there is only one entrance that can be used.  If that is the case, admission to the building should be staggered.  From the point of view of the Courts Service, what further efforts can be made to resolve this issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092800002#K00700","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I will deal with the questions in the order asked.  We work closely with victim support, the Garda and the Office of the DPP to provide assistance for victims of crime, particularly in the context of more stressful crimes.  We have a liaison officer in place in each courthouse.  Their phone numbers and so on are shared with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, in order that we can prepare in advance.  In all of our modern buildings, we provide dedicated victim suites.  In the newer courthouses, such as the Criminal Courts of Justice and the courthouses in Limerick and Cork and so on, the dedicated crime buildings all have dedicated victim support suites.  In the older buildings, if we know when the victim in a sexual assault case or something like that is coming to court, we reserve a consultation room so that he or she has somewhere quiet to go.  The Deputy is correct that the staggering of lists has assisted in the context of lower level crimes, particularly at District Court level, as that there is less waiting around.  Those lower-level cases are still very stressful for those involved but the staggering of lists has helped.<\/p> <p>  When we renovate a courthouse or erect a new building, we try to provide separate entrances because we are aware of the difference they make.  It avoids the potential for flashpoints outside the building.  In a way, Covid has helped in that regard because the supporters who sometimes accompany accused persons to court are not admitted now and that means the courthouse itself is quieter.  Only those who are necessary for the trial, such as witnesses, the accused, garda&iacute; and so on, are admitted to the courthouse and there tends not to be the large groups of supporters who sometimes accompany accused persons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092800002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela Denning"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":509,"content":"<p>Supports is often offered through certain procedural accommodations such as the use of an intermediary.  Dr. Hartney mentioned this already but I will elaborate on it.  The Criminal Evidence Act allows for several special measures to be invoked if a person giving evidence has need of them.  One such measure is the use of an intermediary.  That has been invoked infrequently and very much on an <i>ad hoc <\/i>basis, but the NDA has carried out a piece of work on intermediaries.  An intermediary is a professional with a certain set of communication skills who carries out an interview with the person in question at the earliest possible step in that person's first interaction with the criminal justice system.  That often takes place in a Garda station.  This follows the person through the entire journey.  The intermediary meets the person and assesses his or her communication difficulties.  Those difficulties may result from a disability, age or other factors.  The intermediary then prepares a report on the needs of the person and how best to communicate with him or her in order to get the best evidence out of the person.  The Criminal Evidence Act only allows for this measure in the case of a victim or witness giving evidence.  The NDA believes that intermediaries should be available to everyone engaging with the criminal justice system, and at the earliest possible point rather than just in court.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092800002#K00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Susan Kennefick"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":510,"content":"<p>On the issue of support for victims, we are aware there are gaps.

That is an important point well made.<\/p> <p>  I will move to the second round because all members who wished to get in on the first round have now had an opportunity to do so.  A couple of members have indicated they wish to put supplementary questions, as do I.  We generally allocate five minutes for the follow-up round.  Our meeting is due to conclude at 5.30 p.m. sharp and we are on course for that.  There are two speakers indicating and I will close the meeting after that, unless someone else indicates beforehand.<\/p> <p>  My question is probably for Ms Denning but anyone in a position to take it can do so.  A few others made the point that the pandemic brought some benefits where court management is concerned.  The prisoner location was one that was mentioned.  I forget who made the point earlier but it was a very valid one, namely, one of the prior frustrations of anyone attending court, be they a practitioner, witness, defendant or plaintiff, is the difficulty of waiting around to find out at what time a matter might be heard.  During Covid we have had, possibly for the first time, staggered lists so that a slot might be given between midday and 1 p.m., between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m., between 2.30 p.m. and 3.30 p.m., or whenever it might be.  That gives an awful lot more clarity and, dare I say, productivity, to all involved because a day or half a day is not spent waiting only to find out at the last minute a matter has been adjourned.  I stress the management of lists is a very positive thing.<\/p> <p>  On a related note, there is the use of remote call-overs and some motions being taken remotely.  I suppose there is a hybrid model emerging now, no different to how we do it in the Oireachtas, whereby there is accommodation for some matters being taken in person and some being taken in a hybrid sense.  Again, it strikes me that might be very practical, not to mention environmentally friendly, but also family-friendly.  There are many benefits to the remote access model and it would seem to make sense.<\/p> <p>  Related to those two points, are the staggered lists and the hybrid model with remote call-overs and motions where possible going to continue?  The flipside of that coin is whether it is envisaged that social distancing will no longer be required in courtrooms.  When will our courtrooms return to \"normal\"?  Will the new normal be the continuation of the hybrid model?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092800002#L00800","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":519,"content":"<p>I will start at the end.  I heard Professor Philip Nolan on the radio last Thursday at lunchtime.  He said that at the moment, the highest risk is indoors in a crowded setting with people you do not know.  Currently, social distancing is 2 m and we have all our courtrooms measured to 2 m and that sets the maximum capacity.  If that is reduced, we have all our courts assessed at 1.5 m and 1 m so we can instantly change the sign on the door and we will know how many extra people can be allowed in.  Social distancing has had a huge knock-on effect on the operation of the courts.<\/p> <p>  That said, one of the benefits has been the reduction in the waiting-around time.  I should not call it this but it is almost a social contract because if you have a staggered list and you have last-minute adjournments, the judge is sitting idle for perhaps an hour, or half a day, or whatever it might be.  There is that unwritten contract there with all the parties that people do as much pre-trial work as possible so as to maximise the benefit out of the court day and I hope that would stay.  We have seen a very successful experiment as well with appointments for our public offices.  Previously people just came in and queued up for the office with longer queues.  We recently launched an online appointments system and that has been very successful.  There are almost 1,000 appointments in Dolphin House, which is the District Court family law building in Dublin, in a month.  Again, it is just to reduce that tension and the waiting around.  Some people do not queue well.  By the time you have that done, perhaps you are not in the humour to give your evidence or whatever it might be.<\/p> <p>  I hope to see staggered lists remain.  I hope to see video link remain.  I hope to see some level of remote remain.  It is very useful for the administrative stuff like call-overs, short matters and matters on affidavit.  Then perhaps the actual hearings can be dealt with in person where possible, or with hybrid means.  We have seen many hybrid cases.  This started with overseas witnesses.  We brought the technology in to take evidence from people overseas.  I see an increased demand from the likes of medical experts who do not want to leave the hospital and prefer to dial in to give their evidence before going back to their day jobs.  I see the future being a mix.  That is why we have done the video and the remote court expansion to allow for remote evidence to be given where the judge deems it appropriate and where it suits the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092800002#L00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela Denning"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":520,"content":"<p>Excellent.

We sought them in Tralee.  We thought we had a venue in Tralee but it transpired we could not use the technology that was required in the venue, which was the only venue.  We assessed several venues in the town.  What happens in October may change jury sessions for next term, but jurors have been summoned for Limerick for the Tralee sessions for the five weeks and no jurors have been summoned for Tralee.

They had to travel even for call-overs, and it should have been unnecessary for defendants to have to be present at those.  I believe Wicklow trials may have been held in Trim at one stage or perhaps in Drogheda as well.  It is quite a trek across two or three counties in the eastern circuit to get there.

The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is happy to attend the meeting today to discuss the proposed revision of the eIDAS regulation.<\/p> <p>  I am Mair&eacute;ad McCabe, principal officer leading the telecommunications policy and regulation division of the Department.  Joining me are my colleagues, Ms Catherine McDonald, assistant principal, working in the same division, and Mr. Rory Hinchy, staff engineer of the office of the chief technical officer.<\/p> <p>  The primary policy focus of our division in the Department is on the telecommunications sector.  While the eIDAS regulation is not a telecommunications issue, the EU Telecommunications and Information Society Working Party is currently considering this proposal at European level and this Department is leading discussions in the negotiation.  It is expected that the negotiating period will be approximately one year from June of this year.<\/p> <p>  Our main area of interest in the Department is the oversight of the trust services element of the proposal and we are taking expert inputs from the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO, on the e-identification, eID, aspects of the revision.  Inputs from the Department of Justice and the Data Protection Commissioner will also be needed in respect of GDPR and data protection aspects, and other Departments and bodies will be consulted as necessary.<\/p> <p>  The working party, having held an initial discussion with the European Commission earlier in the summer, is now engaged in ongoing detailed discussions on the proposed revision.  This is currently at a very early stage and involvement of a range of stakeholders will be required as we move towards finalising agreement.  Planning for implementation, particularly in and around the toolbox which is to be established, will require at national level significant cross-departmental inputs.<\/p> <p>  Having been fully in force since July 2016, the regulation is now facing a revision, and the intention is that putting new rules in place will pave the way for more successful application of secure digital identities into the future.<\/p> <p>  The new proposal provides a framework for a European digital identity which will be available to all EU citizens, residents and businesses in the EU.  The EU aims to introduce a more harmonised approach to digital identification rather than the current divergent approaches in place across the various member states.  Citizens will be able to prove their identity and share electronic documents from their European digital identity wallets, which will be accessible from their phone or other devices.  They will be able to access online services with their national digital identification, which will be recognised throughout Europe.  Very large online platforms will also be required to accept the use of European digital identity wallets upon request of the user.<\/p> <p>  For the main proposed revisions to the regulation, the significant changes include: mandatory provision by EU states of digital wallets; improvements to management of remote signature; establishment of a common toolbox for European digital identity; harmonisation with other relevant pieces of EU legislation; adaptation to the much-changed digital landscape since 2014 - the time of the original regulation; and the proposal also foresees four new qualified trust services to meet market demand.<\/p> <p>  With regard to ensuring the security of the eIDAS regulation, the regulation requires notification regarding cases of security incidents.  The supervisory body must currently provide the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, with a summary of notifications of breach of security and loss of integrity received from trust service providers.<\/p> <p>  While it is the intention of the European Commission that security aspects of the regulation be replaced with rules and procedures under the EU network and information security directive, NIS II Directive, that directive, as the committee will be aware, is currently under active negotiation at EU level.  Accordingly, whatever alignment is necessary will only emerge once that legislative file has progressed to an advanced level.<\/p> <p>  As to trust services in Ireland, there are two qualified trust service providers established here.  One provides qualified time stamp services and the other provides qualified electronic signature and electronic seal services.  This small market has the potential to grow and is not a hindrance to the development of digital services in Ireland.<\/p><p>Customers can purchase trust service products, such as an e-signature, from any trust service provider in any member state in the EU.  If they want a product that is a qualified and therefore a trustworthy product, then they get it from a qualified trust service provider.<\/p><p> In terms of implementation of the 2014 eIDAS regulation in Ireland and formal appointment of a supervisory body for trust services, Article 17 of the regulation requires member states to designate a supervisory body to regulate trust service providers within its jurisdiction.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications has approved the designation of ComReg as the supervisory body under, and for the purposes of, the 2014 regulation.  Work is now under way now to progress this designation, including considering the practicalities of formal designation, the legislation necessary to amend ComReg&rsquo;s statutory functions, either primary or secondary, the provision of appropriate enforcement powers and an appropriate funding mechanism.  The Department will engage extensively with ComReg and other stakeholders, as appropriate, with a view to designation as soon as possible.<\/p><p> It should be noted that the fact that a supervisory body has yet to be designated in Ireland under the 2014 regulation does not mean that trust services are not available in Ireland.  Such services exist and an oversight mechanism was put in place in 2010, provided for under the Electronic Commerce Act 2000.  This is operated by the office of the chief technology officer in the Department.  However, formalising the designation under the 2014 regulation now requires a much more comprehensive regulatory regime to be put in place for ComReg, which includes enforcement powers and will necessitate the development of the requisite level of expertise in the body being nominated as supervisor.  The regulation sets out certain tasks for the supervisory body, requiring it to supervise trust service providers; investigate breaches of the regulation and take enforcement action as appropriate to remedy such breaches; co-operate with supervisory bodies in other member states; and report annually to the European Commission and ENISA on activities and breaches.<\/p><p> An integral part of the role of the supervisory body is to grant and withdraw qualified status to trust service providers.  The term \"qualified\" is used for those service providers which can prove that the services provided by them fulfil the requirements laid down in the eIDAS regulation.  It does this based on the results of audits of trust service providers conducted either by itself or by a conformity assessment body.<\/p><p> As regards the main changes proposed in trust services in the revised regulation, while the proposal is ambitious in terms of the digital wallet, the changes proposed to the trust services element are generally less so.  In response to the dynamics of the markets and to technological developments, it is proposed to expand the current eIDAS list of trust services with the introduction of four new additional services, including the provision of electronic attestations of attributes, electronic archiving services, electronic ledgers and the management of remote electronic signature and seal creation devices.  The introduction of a trust service framework for the electronic attestations of attributes is significant and will be fundamental to the introduction of a digital wallet.<\/p><p> The other main changes to the trust service provisions of the 2014 regulation include proposing to align the cybersecurity risk management obligations with those in the NIS 2 directive, permitting the Commission to introduce implementing Acts to set out the conditions applicable to trust services established in third countries, a suggestion that the tasks of supervisory bodies could be supplemented by the Commission using implementing Acts, and a requirement on providers of web browsers to facilitate the use of qualified certificates for website authentication.  Initial views are supportive of the regulation.<\/p><p> We are happy to take questions on the proposal and to hear the views of members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092800002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mair&eacute;ad McCabe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":547,"content":"<p>I am the Government chief information officer, based in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I thank the Chairman and committee members for the invitation to meet them today to discuss the European Commission&rsquo;s draft legislative proposal for the European digital identity framework.  I am joined by my colleague from the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, Mr. Declan Hickey.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, one of my responsibilities as Government Chief Information Officer is to take forward the soon to be replaced public service ICT and eGovernment strategies and elements of the Civil Service reform 2030 programme.  Another responsibility of my office is to work with our equivalent offices across the EU and EEA in shaping European Commission technical programmes and initiatives and to support Departments and representatives where they are involved in related policy or legislative discussions.<\/p><p>The European digital identity framework is one such project.  My colleague, Declan Hickey, and I are both involved in technical meetings related to this initiative and we have also been assisting our colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications with their contributions.  On that basis, I would like to take my few minutes to brief the committee on the technical aspects of this programme.<\/p><p> As the committee will be aware, the Next Generation EU recovery package, which is worth &euro;750 billion, was established to complement and support each country&rsquo;s own national response to the crisis, and to provide the means to invest in the transformation to a more green and digital economy.  The EU Digital Compass then sets out the EU&rsquo;s vision for a digital future in a way in which, the EU claims, will also support it in meeting objectives in the European Green Deal, thus helping Europe to reach its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030.  It cites the use of video-conferencing to help reduce flight emissions and digital technologies to help create a greener approach to agriculture, energy use in buildings and more sustainable city planning.<\/p><p> The EU Digital Compass uses the four points of the compass to identify the main goals to reach over the next decade.  These are as follows: first, a digitally skilled population and highly skilled digital professionals; second, secure and substantial digital infrastructures; third, digital transformation of businesses; and, fourth, digitisation of public sectors.  The EU has stated that the successful delivery of the Digital Compass will require an increased focus from governments on better digital services and better interoperability across all levels of government and across public services.  Equally important, they argue, is the concept of a trusted, user-controlled identity, one which allows citizens to control their own online interactions and presence and make full use of online services throughout the EU, while preserving their privacy.<\/p><p> It is this ambition which has led to the EU re-thinking and revising its plans and ambitions for an EU digital identity.  Electronic identities, eIDs, or digital identities and related infrastructure are foundational for digital transformation and to enable delivery of services for citizens and businesses.  A functional self-sovereign digital eID, which puts citizens in control of their own data and privacy, would be a big step towards transforming a wide range of public services.  It is generally recognised by the UN, OECD and EU, among others, that government sponsored digital identities can protect the most vulnerable by ensuring that citizens are protected from personation and receive their entitlements accurately and in full.  As the World Bank pointed out: &ldquo;Robust and inclusive identification systems are crucial for development, as enshrined in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 16.9, which mandates countries to provide &ldquo;legal identity for all, including birth registration.&rdquo;\"  For individuals, proof of legal identity is necessary to access rights, entitlements, and services.  For governments, modern identification systems allow for more efficient and transparent administration and service delivery, faster and more responsive services, and increased security.<\/p><p> The August 2021 G20 Digital Ministers&rsquo; declaration acknowledged the growing importance of digital identity, especially where &ldquo;easily usable, reliable, secure, trusted, and portable&rdquo;, in providing citizens and businesses with a safe and privacy-compliant access to digital services.  The declaration also referenced the potential of digital identity in humanitarian and emergency scenarios and its potential contribution in the attainment of the aforementioned United Nations Sustainable Development Goal, Target 16.9: &ldquo;to provide legal identity for all&rdquo;.<\/p><p> The EU eIDAS regulation set out to harmonise the mutual recognition of electronic IDs and trust services in Europe.  While approximately half of the member states notified their eIDs for the purpose of mutual recognition across borders, others, including Ireland, were more hesitant, being concerned about the outdated concept behind the architecture and the practicalities of how it would work on a day-to-day basis.  The concerns of this group were proven justified when a review of the eIDAS regulation by the Commission highlighted the need to improve upon the regulation, both with regard to trust services and eID.<\/p><p>In particular, the evaluation highlighted several specific challenges with the eID approach, including weak implementation, low uptake by citizens, difficulties in interoperability, limitations to cross-border utilisation, lack of convenience, complexity of the notification process and the limitation of the service to the public sector only.  The Commission admitted that only about 60% of the EU population in 14 member states was able to use its national eID cross border and only 14% of key public service providers across all member states allow cross-border authentication with an e-identity system.  The number of successful cross-border authentications per year was also very small, although it is on the increase.<br\/><br\/>The evaluation concluded that a framework for European digital identity was required that both acknowledged and addressed the implementation challenges associated with existing digital identity legislation and, equally, would help deliver a workable and popular self-sovereign identity solution for citizens.  On 20 September, in her state of the Union address, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tEvery time an App or website asks us to create a new digital identity or to easily log on via a big platform, we have no idea what happens to our data in reality.  That is why the Commission will propose a secure European e-identity.  One that we trust and that any citizen can use anywhere in Europe to do anything from paying your taxes to renting a bicycle.  A technology where we can control ourselves what data is used and how. <\/blockquote><p>The ambitions for this European e-identity include that it will be actively used across Europe; will be available to any EU citizen, resident or business in the EU that wants to use it; will be used for public and private sector transactions; will include credentials; will be operated via digital wallets available on mobile phone apps and other devices; and will give full control to users to choose which aspects of their identity, data and certificates they share with third parties and keep track of such sharing.<br\/><br\/>The new proposal for a new European digital identity framework was published on 3 June 2021.  The proposal consists of a regulation amending Regulation (EU) No 910\/2014 as regards establishing a framework for a European digital identity, an annexe to the regulation and a recommendation on a common Union toolbox for a co-ordinated approach towards a European digital identity framework.<br\/><br\/>From an OGCIO point of view, while we have an interest in the development of the legislation, our main focus will be aligning with any technical solution - much as we did recently with the digital Covid certificate.  At this stage, while the Commission seems to have a good understanding of timescales and the required resource commitments - about 60 full-time equivalents and &euro;30.8 million estimated for the implementation of the proposal between 2022 and 2027 - the detail on the actual technical approach is thus far limited.<br\/><br\/>The early draft of the regulation states that the financing will support costs linked to maintaining, developing, hosting, operating and supporting the eID and trust services building blocks and it may also support grants for connecting services to the European digital identity wallet ecosystem and the development of standards and technical specifications.  The regulation states that the underpinning technologies should be developed towards the highest level of security, user convenience and wide usability.  It states the ambition that all European digital identity wallets should allow users to electronically identify and authenticate online and offline across borders for accessing a wide range of public and private services and also serve the institutional needs of public administrations, international organisations and the Union's institutions, bodies, offices and agencies.  Achieving this while making the app a viable alternative to commercial equivalents and one that will encourage substantial uptake will be challenging.  The process should be helped by one of the early deliverables, namely, a toolbox for a European digital identity framework.  This is planned to include a comprehensive technical architecture and reference framework, a set of common standards and technical references and a set of guidelines and descriptions of best practices.<br\/><br\/>The technical work regarding technical architecture, references and standards by member states and the Commission has not yet commenced but will start shortly.<\/p><p>In summary, this is an important initiative and aligns well with the discussions we have been having in Ireland with respect to increased use of digital wallets and credentials.

I thank both of the contributors.  I read their opening statements last night and again this morning.  There is a lot in them.  They are quite technical.  I do not think I have ever had anybody talk to me about this kind of stuff when I was canvassing a local or general election for a candidate.  At the same time, it is important that we are aware of what is being progressed.  I note that we can have a political opinion on it but, at this stage, it does not look for any kind of ratification by Parliament.<\/p> <p>  I thank both contributors for their opening statements.  I have a few questions on them.  I am looking at the European digital strategy about cutting fuel emissions and allowing more video conferencing.  There is a certain irony in the fact that members have to be on the campus to have this meeting and that we cannot do it remotely.  This is the exact kind of thing that should be able to do.  I appreciate that there are constitutional questions involving that however, over time we should try to make sure that people can work remotely as much as they choose if they are able to do the job appropriately. <\/p> <p>  First, I have a few questions to Mr. Lowry.  Is there any scope for this to be applied to things like the European Health Insurance Card, EHIC, or even in proving one&rsquo;s identity on platforms such as Facebook or Twitter?  We talk about anonymous accounts, bullying, and so on.  I know this is a little away from the basic premise of this.  Could it be applied so that one has to show one's identity to establish a Facebook or other social media accounts, to eliminate the trolling elements and the anonymous bullying that goes on online?  <\/p> <p>  On the cost and the financing, does that come out of the Central Fund or can Revenue charge for services?  Is that part of the scheme?  From an individual&rsquo;s point of view, a digital wallet may be of benefit.  However, if that were to be done, what would its benefit be to an ordinary member of the public, or to any of us, our family members or friends?  Could we open bank accounts in other countries?  Obviously, the digital Covid certificate is working very well.  What else can we do with this?  What is envisaged that can be done with the eID technology, if we all had these digital wallets? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092800002#H00700","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":557,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his questions.  I will try to answer them all.  First, this at a conceptual stage.  As the Senator picked up, it is hard for the public at this moment in time to get an understanding of the benefits of this.  However, what members of the public do understand, because they are using the technology, is the concept of downloading a Ryanair or Aer Lingus boarding pass, and putting it on their Apple, Android, or whatever other phone wallet.  This is broadly similar to that.  In fact, one of the things that the Commission believes is that they have given too much control over this ecosystem to the commercial sector, and not enough control to governments.<\/p><p>I am sure the commercial sector would debate that, but it is certainly one of the things about which people are thinking.<\/p><p> In terms of how one gets benefits out of it, Senator Horkan has given a really good example of how the Commission should be taking this forward, which is the European health insurance card.  It would be very easy for people to carry one on a device, like a phone, and simply have fewer things to carry.  That is certainly part of it, but also the Commission talks about other things, such as, for example, if you wanted to hire a car in, let us say, France, that you could have your driving licence and insurance documentation on your phone as well.  These are documents we carry all the time and we do not have to make a specific point of remembering them because we think we might hire a car for a day while we are on holidays.<\/p><p> In terms of other benefits, Senator Horkan has given a really strong benefit of one of the cross-border dimensions to this, which is opening a bank account.  I remember a couple of years ago I was giving a lecture at Trinity College.  It was to a master's class in digital marketing.  I was asked a question by a young Frenchman who had got a job in Microsoft.  He said that when he came over to Ireland, he could not rent an apartment because he did not have a bank account.  He could not open a bank account here because he did not have an address in Ireland.  That is a case in point whereby his identity could be verified by his own nation, France, and it would make life a lot easier for him.  This is the European concept of the free movement of people.  Senator Horkan has hit on one of the real potential areas for selling this concept to the public.<\/p><p> The final matter that was raised relates to social media.  Of course, this is a completely different debate about whether a government should do this.  Senator Horkan's question was whether it would be technically possible.  The answer is that it absolutely would be.  In fact, one of the things that the President was hinting at in her speech was that often if we go onto a new website it will encourage us to sign up to it using our existing Google, Facebook or Microsoft credentials, if we have those.  What they get out of that is they know which websites we are going to and they get a greater understanding about us.  The idea is that this European approach would mean that we would control that data and that privacy rather than the commercial entity which is giving us the capability of doing that.  We could turn that around the other way and use our European identity to verify ourselves to open social media accounts and so on, but that in itself would require different legislation and a debate about the protection of people online versus the privacy of people who want to go online.  I will leave that to experts like Senator Horkan rather than comment on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092800002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Lowry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I would not regard myself as an expert at all.  As the Chief Information Officer, Mr. Lowry, is definitely the expert over me on that kind of thing.  The Facebooks of this world are under pressure to not allow anonymous accounts.  They are also under pressure to prevent fake news being put out there as if it is real.  There will be a large appetite on the part of lots of people, including criminals and others, who would like to have an anonymous existence and, perhaps, operate out of other jurisdictions.  There is an appetite for us to be able to know who is behind what goes up there and the people who are making the comments.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious of time so I will ask my final question.  The committee has discussed the cyberattack on the HSE.  In terms of the security of the data, would it be held by each nation or in a big European cloud somewhere?  I know it is all in the cloud anyway, but who minds it and how is it protected?  We all use online banking, mobile phone data and lots of tools that present a risk.  Has anyone been looking at the security aspect of it?  Has there been much exploration of that in this particular revision of the regulation, given the access to the identities of 300 million or 400 million people that would be seen as being as verifiable as a passport?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092800002#J00200","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":560,"content":"<p>The Commission understands the problem and it has committed to looking at various options for making sure that its security and usability are enhanced.<\/p><p>To take something like the digital Covid certificate, for example, what happens is that each nation owns its own data and it holds only sufficient data to meet GDPR.  There is then an interoperability system that enables any digital Covid certificate to be read in France, Germany or another part of Europe.  We could go that way, whereby nations would still control their own data and use standards for interoperability.<\/p><p> One of the strengths of the digital wallet is that it goes a bit further because it allows individuals to carry their own identity with them, and to use it themselves.  In other words, a government would provide the credentials.  For example, we would provide a digital driving licence credential but we would not actually know why that was used, or that the person had gone to France and hired a car, or whatever.  That gives more privacy to the individual.  When the term \"digital sovereignty\" or \"private sovereignty\" is used, that is what it means, namely, the person is in control of his or her own data.  This architectural landscape will be designed following consultation with all parties to try to get a balance between maximum security, maximum usability and maximum privacy for the individual.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092800002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Lowry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":562,"content":"<p>Could this ever replace the paper passport or could this facilitate a digital, online, on-the-phone type of passport in the longer term?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092800002#K00200","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":563,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

The next year is going to be a very important year for the legislation because work will continue on two fronts.  First, the legislation itself will be further developed and consulted upon, and our colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications will focus very much on that.  Our main focus will be on this idea of a common toolbox.  The target is that it will be signed off by September 2022, so we have just less than a year to complete the work.<\/p> <p>  I think it will be a long and arduous road.  The reason I think that is that, as I said in my opening statement, some countries have put a big investment into implementing the eIDAS initiative while others held back a little bit.  In regard to those countries that proceeded, eIDAS was largely built on the concept of chip and PIN, and those of us who are using online banking will remember our little card reader and how, in order to transfer money, we had to put our debit cards into the card reader, put in codes and so on.  That costs a lot to implement.  I know that, for example, in Hungary every citizen owns a chip and PIN reader because of the eIDAS legislation.<\/p><p>They are going to want to try to ensure what they have achieved so far coexists with where the new model is going.  To try to get a technical approach that embraces all these is going to be difficult.  Other countries, like ourselves and Austria, believed from the outset that this should have been developed using mobile phone technology.  However,even then the challenge is going to be great because first of all there is the question of whether we are going to focus this on the main players, that is, the Android operating system for phones, which is Google-oriented, and then of course the Apple operating system as well.  Europe is a little reticent to do that because it is giving the two American giants a big say in how the European digital passport will work, so all that must be negotiated.<\/p><p> Finally, the whole point of this is to be inclusive.  Some of the difficulty with apps, as members are probably aware, is around people with older phones, less advanced phones or the newer Chinese phones which are emerging and are cheaper but do not meet the same standards.  How we actually get apps that work in the same way in every single phone is going to be a big challenge.  It might well be we will look at different models for how we do this, to make it easier.  For example, the digital Covid certificate is very light-touch.  All the processing is done by states in their own infrastructure and what the user gets out of it is simply a credential which is easily read by any phone with a camera on it.  It may well be we will look at options like that as well, but all of that is still to be decided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092800002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Lowry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":569,"content":"<p>Returning to the cost, which Senator Horkan asked about, who will bear it?

That money might include some grant to the member states to do some work on their end.  For example, the digital Covid certificate had a small grant to cover some of the cost states committed to it, but not all of it.  One of the other options available to us is to use things like Connecting Europe Facility, CEF, funding.  We have used that for a number of things.<\/p> <p>  The underlying premise that an individual can carry his or her own credentials on his or her phone should he or she choose to do that is a very good one and something we have been starting to explore in Ireland as well.  I hope some of the investment we might set aside to that in the State will also cover what happens at a European level.  For example, if we said to the public that rather than having to remember to carry your driver licence every time you are driving in your car, would you also like a version to have on your phone which garda&iacute; would accept if they stopped you, many people would say they would.  Often when going to the gym or somewhere like that, I would not have my jacket and would not have my driver licence with me, but you always seem to have your phone with you wherever you go.  There are examples where the people will be very supportive of this.  Certainly, there is a consortium within Ireland made up of insurance companies, banking, An Post and various others, which thinks this is a really powerful tool and could be used in many ways.  Those organisations will be very keen to see Government sponsor this and make it happen.  During Covid we have all gotten used to just touching a screen with our card and having it scanned.  Many people now simply carry their card on their phone.  Many people are very comfortable with where this technology is going and the opportunities offered.<\/p><p>I think that in Ireland we would be doing much of that anyway regardless of what was happening in Europe.  Obviously, the events in Europe will strengthen our determination to move forward as quickly as we can on this. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092800002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Lowry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":572,"content":"<p>That is good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092800002#M00200","speaker":"1517"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":573,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in has the next slot of between six and seven minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092800002#M00300","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the witnesses.

If I can use the recent digital Covid certificate, because obviously we had a couple of good conversations about that at the time, what we did there was we went to the Data Protection Commissioner and set out a potential proposal that basically was built on a privacy first basis.  In that solution the data that is made available for the purpose of travel is different from the data that is made available for the purpose of indoor dining, for example, because it is all very privacy-oriented so we could design this in a very similar way.<\/p> <p>  What will drive this is how the public want to see it developed as well because, in Ireland, we use this concept for digital Government services where it is not just user-centric - in other words, a group of civil servants deciding what is in the users' interest.  It is user-driven - in other words, we meet the users, ask them what they want and we let that drive the solution.  What we will certainly be presenting in terms of our input into the EU discussions is what the Irish people tell us they want.  The features of the contact tracing app were all chosen by the public.  That was the way the Irish public wanted the app to be designed so the Irish app differs slightly from other European apps.<\/p> <p>  I would like to see us develop our own concept of a digital wallet that is driven by the Irish people but meets European standards and guidelines, and then introduce a degree of inter-operability.  In other words, if someone chooses to download their driver licence in the future, and their private sector insurance certificate, because they want to hire a car both of those can be read and understood in France, Germany, Spain or wherever they might want to hire a car.  I suspect that is the way we will go.

This is the system that is used in Scandinavia, the Netherlands and a few of the forward-thinking European countries, which is very appealing because it supports what you might do on the phone.  In terms of how the digital postbox will work as it becomes more established if, for example, the RSA makes the driving licence available in the digital postbox you can get it transferred there.  That digital postbox is entirely personal, it is safe because it is in the cloud and it would be accessed using a MyGovID account.  A person could choose to download a credential from a personal digital postbox to his or her phone for a specific purpose.  In terms of what we might also do - we have received some feedback on this which the public might be interested in hearing - a person will be able to choose to get his or her motor insurance certificate from, say, Aviva in a version that can be also stored in a his or her digital postbox, but it would mean the insurance provider would not know anything on that digital postbox other than what the person is required by law to reveal to it.  There are obligations with regard to a driving record and so on about which a person must tell his or her insurance company, but it would not know anything more than it is entitled to know through the basis of insuring his or her car.  As such, the person is controlling the access to his or her data and also the privacy of his or her data.  In the case of a phone change, the person can delete everything from the old phone but the information is still safe in the digital postbox and it can be downloaded onto the new phone.  That is one model in terms of how we see this might work.  We are interested in the Commission's views, and those of member states, on how they might see it working.  I am sure we can come up with something that is workable on a pan-European basis.  That is really important.  One of the things that frustrates people when they travel is that the rules are different in every country.

As much of what is proposed in the text is at quite a high level, with not a lot of detail supporting it, there are many questions.

It will be challenging to marry the legislative discussion that is happening on one train track with the background technical discussions.

How does this proposal differ from the digital Covid certificate, DCC?  Could I say that the digital Covid certificate is almost a pilot project of what they are proposing?  It is a European wide project.  The data held under the digital Covid certificate is retained by the host nation or the individual country.  How will this differ from the digital Covid certificate and is the DCC the model?<\/p> <p>  One of the main concerns of the Data Protection Commissioner with the public services card back in 2019 was whether the private sector would be able to get access to data.  What is being proposed here would have infinite data on individuals that they can use across the European Union.  Knowledge is king, and the controls over it.  How will this not be abused?  The whole issue comes under cybersecurity.  As I understand it , the subsidiarity point effectively supersedes the rights under various EU treaties for an individual state with regard to control of its affairs.  The questions concern the digital Covid certificate versus what is being proposed here, the whole area of access to data and who will own the data, and can it be open to abuse.  Perhaps Mr. Lowry will flesh this out.  Reference is made to banking facilities.  Has the Central Bank been consulted on this particular communications directive?  I am trying to get the point where I am happy that it does not breach subsidiarity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092800002#Q00400","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":597,"content":"<p>The digital Covid certificate is probably a template for how interoperability can work across the EU and the EEA member states.  The digital Covid certificate itself is what we would call a \"credential\".  In other words, it is a proof given by the Government of Ireland that an individual who is resident in Ireland, has received two vaccinations, or has recovered from Covid, or has successfully had a negative test, either a PCR test or whatever it happens to be.  This is what we call a credential.  In the same way that a person's driver's licence is proof that he or she has passed the driver test and has not driven such a way that it has been taken back for a regulatory breach of driving rules.  In much the same way in the private sector, a car insurance certificate is proof that a person has been through the process of insuring his or her car, which means that should the person have an accident and is at fault then the other driver is protected.  We call all of these things credentials.  The digital wallet seeks to find a way to safely collect all of these credentials together and can use them in a way where the individual has full choice and full control.<\/p><p>That is important.  When this idea of individual sovereignty or self-sovereignty is talked about, it means you control what happens to your data.  That is obviously compliant with the GDPR and it is how we have always understood data works.  If I decide to go and get health insurance I would have to reveal information about my health to that provider because it is entitled to know it for the purposes of how it insures me and how much it will cost.  That is what the GDPR call proportionality and specificity.  The insurer does not need to know other information about me, such as my bank details and so on but obviously if I took out a car loan it would be entitled to know some of that information, and so on.  The purpose of this is to ensure that for every transaction I wish to complete, parties involved in that transaction, whether it be a public service or a private one, only see the information relevant and pertinent to that transaction.  If I no longer require that transaction with them, they no longer see that information about me.  Those are really the underlying GDPR principles that have to be applied in this model.  If they are not successfully applied in this model then the European data protection commissioners will insist they revise the model until it is acceptable.<\/p><p> I have not read the input into this session from our Data Protection Commissioner but I suspect that is broadly what it said because it can see how it works.  However, it will be ensuring all principles of GDPR will be adhered to right through the process.  Mainly, those are that as an individual I can participate in this, entirely through my own choice, and I can cease to participate in this through my own choice and my data will be removed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092800002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Lowry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I will come back on that.

We are seeing it in Ireland with our own electronic identity, where it is only used for public services but people are asking why they cannot use it for banking or things of their choice.  That is reasonable.  We are moving into the next iteration of the digital world, which is the individual understanding it better and wanting control of it, and wanting to see what a company does with a person's data, such as an airline when a person books a flight online.  People might ask if the airline is doing something that it is not entitled to.  GDPR and all of these things are all layers of the same underlying principle, which is that no one should know anything about a person unless entitled to for the purpose of that transaction and the individual should always have control over what those transactions are, when they stop, and when data are deleted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092800002#U00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Lowry"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I agree.

It has been a most informative morning.  We are in the process of trying to put together our cybersecurity network in Ireland.  We have an abysmal system in place with an acting director in place and no director appointed..  We are in a pretty sorry state for a country that hosts some of the largest information technology companies in the world.  Are we putting the cart before the horse by talking about digital wallets when we are not in a position to guarantee those data will be safe?  The Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, told us last week that every Minister's telephone was encrypted and yet a Minister's telephone was in someway compromised.  We are not 100% how, but it was compromised.  I am excited by what Mr. Lowry is talking about.  I have been in information technology for most of my working life.  We are talking about a huge step forward and we can all agree the benefits are incredible.  However, the architecture of the entire infrastructure will be vitally important.  We cannot have a single server or location managing all these data.<\/p><p>Data is going to have to be distributed.  You can imagine what would happen if I had to rely on my medical records, for example, being available through this information system.  If I was in Spain, for example, and there was a power outage or something like that in Dublin, then I could find myself in serious trouble.<\/p><p> With the best will in the world, the sharing of data across different sectors, particularly the public service, is an issue.  One of my colleagues has mentioned travelling to Spain and opening a bank account there.  We have seen how successful the Criminal Assets Bureau has been at identifying people who are in receipt of social welfare and who are driving around in Bentley cars.  Those cars were repossessed to the benefit of the State.  Can we rest assured that this type of data would not be shared across Departments?  I refer, for example, to the Department of Social Protection sharing data with the Revenue Commissioners?  While I see huge benefits in being able to share such information, the rights of citizens have to be put first.<\/p><p> It was stated that most countries in Europe have a citizen's identity card.  A digital identity would subvent the identity card or allow us to have digital IDs on our telephones.  Will the latter give rise to a constitutional issue for Ireland?<\/p><p> Finally, I am sure that serious legislation will be required to get this scheme up and running.  It is a really exciting step forward and will provide citizens with a huge amount of flexibility as regards their data.  Do the witnesses agree that the scheme poses serious loopholes and risks?  Most of my questions are for Mr. Lowry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092800002#V01000","speaker":"1645","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632783600,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his questions.  On the first question, you could argue that this is putting the cart before the horse.  As the Senator will know, with any good idea, you need to get an understanding of what the potential is for the idea in order to start to get robust questions about it, which is what he has just given me.  What the Commission has tried to do in the statements and communications it put out is to get people to understand what it is trying to achieve and then to hear user concerns in order to shape the regulation.  I have absolutely no doubt that in due course the European data protection commissioners will take a detailed look into what is planned and will comment in a very detailed way on any modifications that would be required.  That relates the Senator's second question on how the scheme will be designed.<\/p> <p>  The one thing that this scheme will not do is create a huge bucket in which every single public and private piece of information about us will be held and can be disclosed to anybody who is interested.  That is what it will not do.  I think it will be a distributed data model.  We are used to that, conceptually in any event, because in Ireland, for example, our driving data is with the Road Safety Authority, our tax data is with Revenue, our welfare data is with the Department of Social Protection and so on.  Any data that is shared in Ireland must be underpinned by a data-sharing agreement that has to be written in line with the GDPR.  Under the new process, there is a data protection officer in each public service body who must basically confirm that he or she is satisfied with GDPR compliance before it is allowed to proceed.  I know from the digital Covid certificate that we had to go through reviews by the data protection officer in the HSE, the data protection officer in the Department of Health and our own data protection officer in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform before we could even go to the Data Protection Commission to get its views on the way forward.  So I think that we have a very robust data governance system in Ireland.  We will absolutely uphold that as we introduce this initiative or any other initiative.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the actual broader sharing of data, the key point is the idea of individual sovereignty.  I understand that if I want to buy a car, I may need a driving licence.<\/p><p>I may need them to know that I am legally entitled to drive that car.  They may need to know that I have proper insurance and so on.  All of that requires data sharing.  We were used to doing it by simply bringing along forms.  This might be a way in which it can be done more conveniently, for example, on the day when one is supposed to be picking up keys or whatever that happens to be.  We need to make sure that people are not retaining data for longer than they need to.  If a person moves from one insurance company to another, the previous insurance company cannot keep the same levels of detail and so on.  We need to protect that.<\/p><p> On the constitutional issue around the citizen's identity card, the one thing that underpins the MyGovID at the moment is that it is not mandatory.  It is a choice by people who want to receive their public services online.  Obviously, where that happens the State has an obligation to protect all of its citizens by making sure that personation is not taking place.  The State has designed a process that enables this to happen but it is not a mandatory process.  If a person wants to carry out the old manual process then he or she is very much entitled to do so.  We are seeing, however, that more and more people want the digital process because it is simply so much faster.  I do not see any compromise with the Constitution.  It will not be mandatory and people do not have to opt in.  It is entirely their own choice.  They can opt in for a period of time and then opt out again.  Again, that is entirely of their own choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092800002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Lowry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lowry.  Today we have spoken a lot about the use of the digital Covid certificate.  It is only anecdotal, and I have nothing to back it up, but after the majority of the population registered for the Covid vaccination we suddenly saw a spike in scam calls to mobile phones and so on.  I have always wondered whether there was a correlation.  Has any research being carried out into that area?  It is rather peculiar.  Either these criminals were all people who had nothing to do during Covid and exchanged their outside criminal activities for inside criminal activities, or else something else went crazy.  During that period we started to get these scam calls.<\/p> <p>  The great thing about the public service is that my PPS number allows me to access every public service and I can immediately be recognised.  I can see how this could develop in time and how a person's PPS number could tie all of the services together.  It is the one solid number that identifies the person.  <\/p> <p>  On the personation issue, even with the best will in the world it can happen.  Reference was made to social media here.  I have been impersonated on social media and I believe that most public representatives have at some stage or other.  Anything that will secure that element is something we want.<\/p> <p>  On the voluntary aspect of opting in or opting out, to a certain degree we are being pushed into a situation from a digital perspective where we really have to opt in.  It is becoming more and more difficult to deal with human beings in a bank, for example.  Even now when I go into my local branch across the road on Grafton Street there are more machines than people to talk to.  The opt in will slowly become mandatory.  The Department constantly talks about how comfortable we are with mobile technology and with digital technology.  That is a good thing but it is also a bad thing insofar as this comfort has put it into a situation where we no longer question things.  Back in the good old days when I was teaching IT I used to say that for every keystroke one makes on a computer somebody somewhere is watching it.  This is one of the crucial aspects we are going to have to look at as we move into this digital wallet: who is watching who, and can we guarantee that when I get on my mobile phone I am not going to be scammed with every keystroke I make?<\/p> <p>  I do not see a subsidiarity issue with this.

Could private or public facilities, operators, institutions or businesses insist on the use of a European digital wallet in order for people to perform transactions with them?  That moves into the area in which the Data Protection Commissioner in Ireland had issues.  The fundamental issue is that people should not be barred from accessing services if they do not have a public services card.  How does one deal with that in a European context?  Could private operators and state institutions insist on the use of a digital wallet in order for people to carry out any form of transactions with them?

Some of the writings and analysis carried out by the media on the whole concept of the European digital wallet have stated that there is an element of tension or a catch-22 situation.  Private sector organisations will not invest in supporting the European digital wallet if there is not going to be uptake.  They will want assurances from the Commission that the public want to and, indeed, will use it.  I do not envisage the regulation will require that if a person wants to hire A car, he or she can only do that using an EU digital wallet.  That would be difficult to implement because no two smartphones are the same.  It is a big step to assume that, for example, we could write an app called the EU digital wallet, make it available to everyone with a phone, and that it would be used successfully.  We will have to come up with alternatives and offer people choice.  I suspect that is where the legislation will end up.  As I said earlier, it is early days, but people are right to be concerned and that  needs to be represented in the discussions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092800002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Lowry"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":639,"content":"<p>I will now flip the other side of the coin.

By extension, they can choose to carry their physical card into a shop and use contactless payment or the phone equivalent as the shop will accept either form because the technology enables them to do that.  This will progress using choice.  If a person keeps his or her credit card on their EU digital wallet - the intention is to enable that - and wishes to proffer that in a shop, I do not think it will cause problems for the shop because, at the end of the day, credit transactions are underpinned by the infrastructure already in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021092800002#Y00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Lowry"},{"type":"speech","time":1632783600,"counter":641,"content":"<p>Do members wish to come in briefly?

The British were aghast at the concept of it.  It was said it would bring down the government.  There is a touch of that about some of this and how possible it is.  On balance, having listened to the last two hours there is a lot of potential for it to go well but it requires buy-in.  Everyone said we would not do chip and pin and now all we see are people tapping cards and phones.  People are not carrying cash even though only a couple of years ago when I, along with the Chairman, was a member of the finance committee the chief executive of Bank of Ireland said at the time that Irish people like cash and want to have cash in their pocket.  Now most businesses tell me they are taking in a fraction of the amount of cash compared to pre-pandemic times.<\/p> <p>  The public service card was voluntary but mandatory.  It was voluntary if one wanted to have one but it was mandatory if one wanted to get social welfare benefits.  There were certain aspects to it.  There is always a fine line when it comes to data sharing.  I benefited from being on the finance committee where we discussed such legislation in the last term.  Equally, there are issues with freedom of information and GDPR.  There are a lot of conflicts going on.

I anticipate that just like metro and lots of other things it can be delayed.  The roll-out of the digital Covid cert was very rapid.  When will we see this?  Is there an appetite right across the EU, including the Commission and member states, to say that this is positive and to get a verifiable EID so that people can have their driving licences and passports, open a bank account, get car insurance and properly prove their identity while also having protections in place to ensure that people in Revenue do not know about people's health data and the people in the health system do not know about people's Revenue data and so on?
