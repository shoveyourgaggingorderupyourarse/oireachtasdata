What occurred was presented by the parent of the original pupil as a 50% reduction in SNA support.  There are times when allocation, presentation and perception can mean different things to different people.  As far as the school in question was concerned, the SNA support was capable of being shared by two people.

I commend all schools that have used the grant to help to build book rental schemes during the years.  Their efforts mean that the high cost of school books is being significantly reduced for parents.  At my request, the National Parents Council surveyed its members for their views on currently operating book rental schemes.  Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools.  Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe book rental schemes help with the cost of educating a child.

Those parents who had no access whatsoever to book rental schemes needed more support for a variety of reasons.

I will leave the issue of uniforms to one side for now because we are dealing with the issue of books today.<\/p><p>I wanted every child in every school to have access to a book rental scheme because that was what parents wanted and, in many cases, needed.  I had the choice of spreading a very small amount of money - &euro;5 million a year - over three years to try to close the gap for more than 25% of the schools in question - based on the Deputy's figures, one could call it 20% - to make sure every parent could send his or her child to school and be faced with a bill of &euro;40 to access a book rental scheme, as distinct from having to buy books.  It was a difficult choice, but I made it in the interests of fairness for parents and pupils in these schools.  Upfront in a way it was necessary to ignore some schools &ndash; they were not all well resourced schools or parents, but they had developed schemes owing to leadership from the principal and board of management.  If we have extra resources, we will go back to the more recently established book rental schemes.  Three years ago and for all of the time the Deputy&rsquo;s predecessors were Ministers for education, we had no information on what schools, if any, had a book rental scheme.  We now know what we are dealing with and we are trying to have a level playing pitch.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100008#F00400","speaker":"1035","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390315200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>The Minister has a very reductionist view of finding information.

Because of the universality of the different systems under which one can use iPads or different types of tablet which are compatible in terms of receiving information - this was not the case in the past when, for example, one had Betamax and VHS platforms for video - there is an argument at post-primary level for electronic storage of much of the material that young students are using, with extraordinary savings.  As a non-professional educationalist, my own view is that young infants from two, three and four years of age, and those up to the age of ten, should feel the texture of a book and the printed word in reading and writing, and the physical holding of it.  It is about more than merely getting information.  It is about getting used to the format in which much information will remain<i> in situ<\/i> for the rest of their lives, even though they will be highly engaged in digital learning as well.  That is why the book rental scheme at primary school level is so important.  I will deal with the issues Deputy Daly raised and about which I answered the other Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100017#P00200","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Springboard Programme","time":1390318800,"counter":133,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100017#P00250"},{"type":"question","time":1390318800,"counter":134,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[2317\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100017#P00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"in recognition of the over 15,000 educational places provided by Springboard, if a new round of Springboard courses will be introduced in 2014; when a call for expressions of interest among course providers will be made; and if the criteria governing eligibility will be reviewed to assist, for example, persons on long-term social welfare schemes such as invalidity pension, to avail of the opportunity provided by Springboard.

With change in any organisation, whether private or public, the reforms must be done in partnership, not in conflict.  I note the way the Minister went about this from the first day he announced the new junior certificate reform.  He announced it without consultation and, indeed, he deviated from the recommendation given to him by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  The Minister made his own call on it and he did it without consultation.  He stated that one could go along with it and that was the way it was going.  I later heard him describe the decision not to do common assessment under the State Examination Commission and to have teachers correct the junior certificate instead as a personal political project.  That is not what reform is supposed to be about.  It is little wonder the Minister finds himself in a situation, a little more than six months before this reform is due to kick in in classrooms, in which the two main teaching unions of professionals who are supposed to deliver this curriculum have stated they will not co-operate with him.  The Minister lost their faith a long time ago.

One of the blockages to implementing the desired reform was the cost and complexities associated with a new form of assessment for a State examination.  It was a major cost factor.  I took the decision, on the advice of officials in the Department and others, that in this day and age we do not need a State examination for young people at the age of 15 because we do not want them to leave school at the age of 15.  Once upon a time we had the primary school certificate, which was a State examination for 12 year olds - and in some cases 11 year olds - and that was the only State certificate they were ever going to get in the education system because, sadly, many of them did leave school.

Seven such commitments have been set out in the reports published to date.  In such cases, the Government will continue to work to find alternate and innovative ways to deliver the underlying objectives of such commitments.  For example, in its first year the Government signalled that the Exchequer investment was not available to make progress on the Dublin Institute of Technology's campus development at Grangegorman.  However, the announcement in 2012 of the &euro;2.25 billion job-rich stimulus package provided an opportunity to revisit this.

At six years of age, the child had a tumour which caused life-long visual impairment.  The child had a medical card but a month or two before Christmas, unbelievably, it was taken away.  That decision has been appealed.  A number of Deputies, including the Minister for Health, would have received a heart-rending e-mail from a family that is extraordinarily distressed, in health terms, with a very sick young baby and a parent with health issues too.  The parent had fought to retain his child's card and managed to do so.  He did not realise that his own card was under review because the expiry date is some years away.  One can imagine his shock when, on going into the local pharmacy, he discovered from the pharmacist that he had lost his medical card.

Up and down the country people with long-term illnesses have lost their medical cards and are continuing to lose them.  Ask any GP in the country and he or she will tell you that when patients attend, it is the GP who has to tell them that their cards have been withdrawn having looked up the patient files on their computers.  What is going on is a shambles.  It is unbelievably cruel to families and I do not know how the Taoiseach can stand over it.  I have spent the last nine months in this House asking the Taoiseach questions about discretionary medical cards and about the behaviour of the authorities and the Department of Health but I have heard denial after denial.  Despite what we heard before Christmas, I am shocked to see that it still going on.  This random process through which medical cards are being taken from people is still going on.  It is a scandal.

In other words, there has been no change in the criteria for medical card eligibility.  There are more cards issued now than ever before and money has been included in this year's budget for further new cards.  Deputy Martin raised the case of a young boy with a tumour whose medical card was taken away and frankly, I do not understand that either, so let us find out about it.  Deputy Martin raised medical card cases here before, as did Deputy Adams and I brought them to the attention of the people who deal with medical cards.  Some cards were approved, as was correct, while others were not, for reasons that were explained.<\/p><p>  One change that was made before Christmas is that when a person's card is coming up for review, he or she will now receive three months' notice.  In that context, I do not understand how, in the case mentioned by the Deputy, the person was informed by his or her pharmacist that his medical card was withdrawn.

Does the Taoiseach agree that three years into its term, the Government's commitments on transparency and openness have been blown out of the water, coincidentally by the creation of the monster that is Irish Water and by how it has conducted itself?   Does the Taoiseach agree, in the matter of Irish Water and the scandalous amount of taxpayers' funds that have been allocated to slush-fund-loving consultancies, which have made a fortune on the backs of the Irish taxpayer for decades, that instead of transparency, his Government has given the people opaqueness and instead of openness, it has given a continuation of secrecy?  Is that the reality of what we face?  Would the Taoiseach agree that his fine words and his supposed aspirations of three years ago have drowned in the re-emergence of crony capitalism in this State, particularly in the way that private consultancies are able to continue to have transfused to them tens of millions of euro of taxpayers' funds, the detail of which we know nothing about?

We were blocked out of the international markets.  We had no name, no standing, no credibility, could not borrow money, were in hock up to our necks and had quarterly visits from the troika.  Even Deputy Higgins should be glad that we exited the bailout programme in December, the first eurozone country to do so.<\/p><p>Even he should give some recognition to the fact that yesterday five-year moneys were cheaper than those of Great Britain, for the first time in so many years, and very close to American levels.  Even Deputy Higgins should understand that the decision by the rating agency Moody's last week has implications in terms of our international standing and attractiveness for further continued investment from sovereign wealth funds that were prohibited from considering Ireland for investment because we did not have adequate rating from the major rating agencies.  Even he should understand that the unemployment rate has dropped consistently for 18 months and currently stands at 12.4% as of December 2013.  Deputy Higgins may or may not accept the fact that the figures show that 58,000 new jobs were created last year and that the trend is moving in the right direction.<\/p><p> When Deputy Higgins speaks of transparency, he should recognise that Irish Water &ndash; Uisce &Eacute;ireann &ndash; has been in before the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, dealing with matters to do with the environment and finance, and will continue to do so as necessary.  I understand that at the Committee of Public Accounts the chief executive gave a long, detailed and exhaustive presentation on the service being delivered by expert agencies.<\/p><p> Deputy Higgins should be aware that the closed treasure chest that has been there for so long in respect of section 38 and 39 entities is now being opened by the Government in terms of full transparency as to what went on.  The current nauseating controversy surrounding the CRC will be beneficial in the future for charities all over the country because the Government has responded.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will appoint a regulator - I hope this will be before the end of February - and a board will be set up to implement the Act properly.  Charities that are properly endorsed and produce annual accounts that are published on their websites and by the regulator will have the endorsement of being charities that can and should be supported.  In that sense we continue to recognise the importance of the service provided by the personnel who work in the CRC to the patrons who use its services and the many people who contribute to that worthy cause.<\/p><p> I called to the CRC last week on a purely private visit.  The young professional staff to whom I spoke are devastated by what happened.  The Committee of Public Accounts and all the members thereon have been diligent in the hours they have spent there.

A range of additional services are listed in the programme for Government in elderly care and acute hospitals.  That is a very serious statement from the CEO.  It is the first time I have heard a CEO being so emphatic in that regard.  It has also been confirmed that the Taoiseach and his Cabinet colleagues amended the HSE service plan to try to cover up the fact.  Such interference in the plan that was presented to Cabinet is also a first.  The language was changed because the members of Cabinet did not like what it said about the incapacity to fulfil promises and provide the services that were required.  The Taoiseach owes it to people, including all those involved in the health service, to list what services will not be provided.  What area of the programme for Government will not be provided for this year and what services will not be provided?  The people legally responsible for delivering services said they could provide a list of what they cannot do that is required.  Why is the Government hiding the information?  They cannot provide the list to us.

A medical card for people with disabilities is far more comprehensive than anything a GP card could ever give.  The Government must be aware of that and not try to pull a con trick in terms of reducing everything to GP-only cards for everyone.  We have given the Taoiseach details of lots of individual cases.  That is not the issue.  The policy the Government is pursuing is cruel and shameful and it is hurting the sickest people.  People at the front line cannot believe what the Government is up to.  They cannot comprehend why the Government would visit such cruelty on people by taking cards from deserving cases on the grounds of medical need such as chronic illness.

I have to say he is as consistent as the waves on the Irish Sea; he keeps rolling in with the same argument on cronyism and capitalism.  However, the job and mandate given to the Government is to sort out the public finances and get the country back to work.  The economy is moving in the right direction, but we still have many challenges ahead, the greatest of which will be to continue to be competitive, extract costs from the way we deliver services for the people and, thereby, create jobs for those at home.  That is the fundamental mandate given to us by the people.  In that sense, we will continue, through the programme for Government, to deliver on the remaining commitments on the work under way.

The democratic revolution, with a new openness and transparency, was central to the programme, as well as the Taoiseach&rsquo;s speech when he was nominated for office.  Last week we had the debacle over Irish Water, with the gross, obscene pay-out to private consultants, as well as the high salaries of its executives, and with the obscenity ongoing in the Central Remedial Clinic, with cronies of the former Fianna F&aacute;il Government and the Bertie Ahern Drumcondra Mafia.  Can the Taoiseach, with a straight face, forgive the public for thinking the commitment to transparency and accountability has actually turned into a turf war between the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Mafias of cronies fighting over the spoils, while ordinary people are hammered by cuts, unemployment and poverty?  They are struggling, while there is a feeding frenzy among the pigs at the trough of public moneys.  Much of this has to do with the persistence of quangos and corporate subsidiaries such as Irish Water and other semi-State bodies which are at one remove from government responsibility and accountability.  The Taoiseach is doing nothing about this.  In fact, he is doing the opposite by continuing to set up these quangos from which we cannot get accurate information on what is going on in their areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100024#W00700","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1390323000,"counter":326,"content":"<p>There are other questions coming up, some of which have been tabled by the Deputy, but there will not be enough time to deal with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100024#W00800","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1390323000,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I will be brief.

I could take the Taoiseach through the commitments as other Teachta&iacute; have done, pointing out where he has torn them up.  However, what is more important is the vision of the programme.  What are its core values?<\/p><p>  I believe citizens have fundamental rights - the right to a wraparound health service, to a home, to a clean environment, to a job, as well as a real republic of this century.  I also believe one should not be a lesser citizen because one has disabilities.  Whatever about the Government&rsquo;s intentions, however, the fact is that if one has a disability, one is not really a citizen.  On Friday, by chance, I met two families, both with children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome who had been denied medical cards.  One of them was a three year old girl, Lillie.  She still cannot walk, talk, swallow or eat solids.  She is prone, as children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome are, to sickness, but she has no medical card.  This week the mother of a very good friend of mine, Donnacha Rynne, a wonderful young man with profound disabilities from Miltown Malbay, had a letter in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, decrying the fact that her son could not get a wheelchair, while someone in the CRC ripped off the charity of other citizens.  This should not just be about dealing with individual cases but about changing the system.  The programme for Government states, &ldquo;We will pin down accountability for results at every level of public service - from Ministers down - with clear consequences for success and failure&rdquo;.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann is a case in point.  We tried for 18 months to get answers to questions on how this project was being put together but did not get any.  It is not just about a series of commitments but about what sort of Ireland, state, island, republic we want to see.  In the Government&rsquo;s three years in office there has been clear evidence that the Ireland coming from this programme will be nothing like that envisioned in the 1916 Proclamation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100024#W01000","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1390323600,"counter":329,"content":"<p>What I wish to see is a Republic where citizens can be proud to hold citizenship, where the economy is well run, where services are provided for those who need them and where, when a health issue arises, people have access to treatment based on their requirements, as distinct from what they have in their pockets.  I wish to see a country in which there is opportunity for young people and, as I have stated many times, that proves to be the best country in the world in which to do business, the best country in which to raise a family and the best country in which to grow old with a sense of dignity and respect.  Given the economic situation the Government inherited, it is not possible to do this overnight, so that is what I want from government.  The mandate given to me and to the Government, comprising these two parties of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, is to sort out the public finances, run them properly and put the country back to work.  This means the Deputy also has an involvement in this, with any constructive suggestions he has to make about employment opportunities, internships, apprenticeships and attractiveness as a location for investment.  However, the Deputy's general theory is to be opposed to all things pertaining to Europe.  He wanted it to go away with its money when we were deeply in debt, which would have led to a very different situation.  Deputy Adams should note I do not agree that because a person has a disability he or she is deemed to be a non-citizen.  The Deputy, together with every taxpayer in the country and the Exchequer, provides substantial moneys to a range of organisations to provide services for persons with a range of disabilities.  Everyone accepts this.  The situation has now arisen whereby in the case of the Central Remedial Clinic, the Committee of Public Accounts, the watchdog for the public, has been obliged to involve itself for hours on end and was given a litany of facts that were not the truth before Christmas in respect of certain matters.  That is a committee during its job in the interests of the public, and this will apply to all charities in order that they can prove they are in compliance with what is good public policy.<\/p><p>  I listened to some of the presentation given by the chief executive of Irish Water in which he gave an exhaustive, comprehensive and detailed account of the expenditure and the services received for that expenditure in the setting up of a major public utility.

This issue has been going on for a very long time.  The Government has a stated policy objective to end homelessness by the end of 2016, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is dealing with this.  Clearly, the four Dublin local authorities operate as a single region, with Dublin City Council acting as the leading authority, as this provides a more strategic approach when addressing homelessness.  A lot of money has been paid out in this regard over the past few years.  I understand the Minister of State has set up a high-level task force comprising Mark Kennedy of Mazars, Sylda Langford, a former civil servant, and Tony Fahey of UCD.  That group has met representatives of the State and the non-governmental sector on an ongoing basis since its appointment and it sent its first report to the Minister of State on 19 December last.  I might state that I recently saw a picture of a man in the newspaper who was described as having been homeless for ten years.  How can this be?

There are 45 parliamentary questions tabled on this subject.  Therefore, in the light of previous representations, I have decided to take questions in two groups and on a thematic basis to allow for a more structured debate on the issues raised by Deputies.  This group deals primarily with engagement with Prime Minister Cameron, the Northern Ireland Executive and various meetings, including the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council.  Questions relating to the Haass talks will be dealt with together in the next group.  There are 20 questions in this group.<\/p><p>  I attended a very constructive plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in Armagh on 8 November chaired by First Minister Robinson and Deputy First Minister McGuinness.  The programme for Government includes a commitment to work for greater cross-Border economic co-operation to accelerate the process of recovery and the creation of jobs on the island.  The other members of the Government and I avail of all opportunities, including meetings within the framework of the North-South Ministerial Council, to have constructive engagement with Northern Ministers on matters of mutual economic interest, advance initiatives designed to boost economic activity on the island and seek practical co-operation in providing services.<\/p><p>  At the last plenary meeting in November 2013 we had an open and productive discussion about a number of issues that were important to people on all parts of the island.  We also discussed youth employment and how we could work together to tackle this issue, which is of vital importance to both jurisdictions.  Regarding the St. Andrew's Agreement review, we agreed that Ministers would examine priorities at sectoral meetings, especially as they might affect economic recovery, job creation, the best use of public funds and the most effective delivery of public services.  This was further discussed at a North-South Ministerial Council institutional meeting earlier this month.  We discussed the fiscal and economic challenges facing both jurisdictions and the opportunities for more practical co-operation.  We are keen to ensure a preliminary package of new priorities will be ready for consideration at the next meeting in June this year.  I would like to see further co-operation that would help to create more employment and boost exports and economic activity.  I have in mind, for example, opportunities to develop synergies in increasing our joint draw down of innovation funding under Horizon 2020.  There would also be merit in examining the potential to develop cross-Border clusters of economic activity.  Before the plenary meeting, I addressed a joint sport and reconciliation conference in Armagh together with the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and the T&aacute;naiste.  I endorsed the collaboration between the three sports organisations, the GAA, the IRFU and the IFA, to tackle racism, sectarianism and division.<\/p><p>  While in Armagh, I also took the opportunity to meet the CEOs of the North-South Implementation Bodies to discuss their work programmes and also to get their views on growing their respective areas of activity.  I also had the opportunity to meet briefly the SDLP leader, Dr. Alasdair McDonnell, on the margins of the SDLP annual conference.  On 10 November I attended the Sunday Remembrance Day wreath laying ceremony at the cenotaph in Enniskillen.  I went to pay my respects to all of the war dead who had given their lives in the world wars.  In advance of the wreath laying ceremony at the cenotaph I met briefly members of the South East Fermanagh Federation and Minister Arlene Foster in the Clinton Centre.  I attended the service of remembrance in St. McCartin's Cathedral.  After the service I met Dean Kenneth Hall and Canon Peter O'Reilly, together with members of the Church of Ireland Vestry and members of the local parish council.  I commend Dean Hall and Canon O'Reilly and all of the people of Enniskillen for their collective work and leadership in fostering cross-community relations and also in maintaining the dignity and importance of Remembrance Day.  I also met members of the Royal British Legion and their families in the Legion Hall.<\/p><p>  I attended the 21st British-Irish Council summit hosted by the Jersey Chief Minister in Jersey on 15 November.  We had a very productive discussion on economic issues and addressed the topics of creative industries and youth employment, which are important issues across all of our administrations.  We had a short video presentation on Jersey's advance to work scheme, which provides young people with approximately three months work experience and employment training, supported by a mentor.  We also exchanged views and examined progress on the various policy initiatives and programmes aimed at helping young people into employment in each member administration and reviewed the latest relevant statistics.  By way of follow up to the summit meeting, all British-Irish Council work sectors have been asked to consider the issue of generating employment opportunities for young people in their work programmes and report on the matter at the next British-Irish Council summit in Guernsey in June 2014.<\/p><p>  On my Department's plans for promoting greater co-operation between Britain and the Republic of Ireland in addressing policy concerns at meetings of EU Heads of Government, our two countries have shared common membership of the European Union for almost 40 years.  As partners in the European Union, we are firm supporters of the Single Market and continue to work together to encourage an outward-facing European Union which promotes growth and job creation.  We share a desire to reduce the burden of regulation, particularly on small and medium enterprises, and believe the Single Market should, in particular, take advantage of digital opportunities, reflecting the growing importance of online commerce and trade, opening up services markets and establishing a genuine, efficient and effective internal market in energy.  We also share a commitment to build a robust, dynamic and competitive financial services sector across the European Union that provides vital support for citizens and businesses and creates sustainable employment.  During Ireland's Presidency of the European Union in the first half of 2013 we worked closely across the range of EU dossiers.  We will continue to consult each other on key EU policy issues.  Since the publication of the joint statement, British-Irish Relations &ndash; the Next Decade, by Prime Minister Cameron and I in March 2012 we have been making good progress in driving closer co-operation between Britain and Ireland.  A joint British-Irish economic study, Evaluating the value of the economic relationship between the United Kingdom and Ireland, was published in July 2013 and helped to inform areas for closer co-operation.<\/p><p>  Two plenary meetings of Secretaries General and Permanent Secretaries have taken place to date - in November 2012 in London and in September 2013 in Dublin.  These meetings provide a platform to consider progress to date and map out future work.  Both the Prime Minister and I are committed to meeting together at annual summits to review and oversee progress in the broad areas outlined in the joint statement.  I expect our next review will take place in March.<\/p><p>  On 9 October I had an informal meeting with former US President Bill Clinton when he visited Dublin to attend an event organised by Philanthropy Ireland.  The President is a very good friend of Ireland and remains keenly interested in our progress.  Our meeting was a useful opportunity to thank him again for his ongoing support for and interest in Ireland.  As Deputies are aware, he has been a major influence on the Northern Ireland peace process during the years and we discussed the current situation in Northern Ireland, including the talks chaired by Richard Haass.<\/p><p>  On 19 December 2013 Prime Minister Cameron and I visited the war graves in Flanders to commemorate and honour all those Irish and British soldiers who had died in the First World War.  During the visit the Prime Minister and I laid wreaths at the Irish Peace Park in Messines and at Menin Gate.  We visited Tyne Cot and paid our respects at the war graves of the 36th (Ulster) Division, the 16th (Irish) Division and the 10th (Irish) Division, as well as visiting the lone grave of Willie Redmond.  Following that visit I attended the European Council meeting in Brussels.<\/p><p>  I warmly welcome the official confirmation that President Higgins will pay a state visit to the United Kingdom this year.  This is a further demonstration of the warm and positive relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  The state visit in April, following on the very successful visit to Ireland by Queen Elizabeth in 2011, will be a wonderful opportunity to deepen the relationship.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, is examining the Smithwick report with a view to making a submission to the Government in the coming weeks.  He has already had preliminary discussions with the Garda Commissioner.  He has met his Northern Ireland counterpart, David Forde, as well as the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI and the report was one of the items on the agenda.  On 4 December the T&aacute;naiste informed the House that he agreed that the Government would make time available to have the Smithwick report discussed in the House.  Perhaps that occasion might also be used for a wider debate on Northern Ireland, should the party Whips so wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100026#Y02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1390324800,"counter":378,"content":"<p>Just six minutes and 40 seconds remain for this business and four Deputies have questions.

He made a commitment to doing this twice and I would like to see that debate take place.  There is a huge amount happening in the North and there is a huge amount the Government could be doing, but it is not doing it.  The attitude here among Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party is condescending and patronising towards the parties in the North.  I want to see the parties here organised in the North and want to see them knitted into the life of society there.  I particularly want to see the Government here facing up to the British Government in ensuring it fulfils its obligations under international treaties.  We cannot expect the Unionist leaders who want to dilute, diminish, slow down and protect change to embrace new dispensations when the British Government is not doing so.<\/p><p>  I will limit my remarks to say to the Taoiseach that we need a full debate on these issues.  The Taoiseach needs to organise some way - on a monthly or some other basis - that we can come in here and give time to deal with nine questions in detail.  There is no way I can deal with my nine questions in the time I have been allocated here.  I will not deal with the substance of my questions now, but simply ask the Taoiseach to set aside not just sufficient time for a debate, but to provide a systematic way of discussing these hugely important questions.  The Taoiseach has said we should not take the peace for granted and we should not.

The crystallisation of this was the failure to go ahead with the Narrow Water bridge project.  I find it incomprehensible that the Taoiseach, along with the British Prime Minister and the Northern Ireland Executive, did not make this happen.  The project had the support of communities on both sides of the Border.  If that was ten or 20 years ago, we would have given our right arm to have that level of commitment from all sides and traditions.  Apart from its socioeconomic value, which was proven in the value for money study, the project's importance in terms of bridging communities from different traditions would have been immense.  <\/p><p>  European funding had been allocated for the project, but there was a failure of political will to make it happen.

In 2014, the year commemorating the 100th anniversary of the launch of the nightmare of the First World War, has the Taoiseach any plans to apologise for the baleful crime of the Irish Parliamentary Party and its leadership in whipping up support for the World War atrocities and being responsible for tens of thousands of youth from this country participating and dying in the process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100027#Z00800","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1390324800,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I endorse the call for a debate on the North because there are many issues and we need some kind of regular space to discuss these.<\/p><p>  While we all want to see greater levels of all-Ireland co-operation and common work North and South, there are worrying signs that we are co-operating or echoing one another in the wrong areas.  Last week, in the Royal Victoria Hospital there was a trolley crisis, with 46 people on trolleys.  People before Profit representatives in Belfast tell me that is as a direct result of the closure of the city hospital.  This parallels what is happening here, with the resurgence in the trolley crisis because, as a doctor from St. Vincent's said recently, of the closure of the 24 hour accident and emergency facility in Loughlinstown.  This is a worrying sign of us co-operating and adopting common policies in the wrong areas and of applying austerity and cutbacks in a way that is detrimental to public services.

I met the people on both sides and the bridge would be a tangible benefit.  The project is not dead.  We must revive it, but it will be a different bridge when it is built.<\/p><p>  I attended the ceremonies at Flanders - at the peace park - put together by Paddy Harte and Glen Barr.  It was a privilege to be there and the ceremony was both nostalgic and emotional.  Seeing an officer of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann giving advice to the British Prime Minister in respect of the location for wreath laying and the protocol to be followed was symbolic of a new era of the relationship between both our countries, following on the attendance of the Queen of England and former Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann many years ago, on the first occasion where those two formidable women met.  We also visited the Menin Gate Memorial at Messines.<\/p><p>It is a powerful statement when the local guide shows one of the names of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers who were blown up or shot and never recovered and whose place of final rest is unknown.  There are more than 51,000 names, many from this city and country.  The Irish Parliamentary Party had very particular view about associating itself with the Great War, the war to end all wars, in the context of the Home Rule Bill.  Everybody made up their own minds, either for King and country or for the freedom of small nations.

It covered the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP; economic and social policy; Economic and Monetary Union; migration; enlargement and energy issues.  We also addressed some of the main foreign policy issues, including the situation in Syria and the Central African Republic, the eastern partnership and the WTO.  Overall, the conclusions of the European Council ran to 50 paragraphs and provided strategic orientations on current positions and thinking.  It is fair to say our focus related to banking union, the completion of EMU and the Common Security and Defence Policy.  Discussion on many of the other important issues was, on this occasion, relatively straightforward, as there were no major decisions to be taken.<\/p><p>  Under the agenda item on Economic and Monetary Union we considered banking union, partnerships for growth, jobs and competitiveness and the social dimension.  Deputies will not be surprised that banking union was a top priority for Ireland.  The Minister for Finance and his ministerial colleagues in Europe had been working very intensively on the outstanding issues in recent weeks and, as Deputies will be aware, succeeded in reaching an agreement on 18 December which was then endorsed by the European Council.  This included final agreement on the deposit guarantee scheme directive and the bank recovery and resolution directive, both of which significantly strengthened financial stability within the European banking system.  Agreement was also reached on a Council general approach for the single resolution mechanism, which will create a single body to apply the bank recovery and resolution tool kit to euro area banks and the banks of participating non-euro area member states.<\/p><p>On this basis the Greek Presidency has now been given a mandate to reach an overall agreement on the single resolution mechanism with the European Parliament.  Negotiations have commenced.<\/p><p> The single resolution mechanism, once in place, will allow for the establishment of a pan-European resolution authority which will be called the single resolution board, with the power to restructure and wind down failing banks.  The board will have access to a single resolution fund, the principle for which is established in the regulation.  The fund will be paid for by contributions from the EU banking sector and has a target level of approximately &euro;55 billion to &euro;60 billion.  The rules for the use of and contributions to the fund are also set out in the regulation.  In order to allow for the gradual mutualisation of funds at national level into the single resolution fund, member states committed to negotiating an intergovernmental agreement by 1 March.  Negotiations commenced at a meeting on 9 January.  Finance Ministers, on 18 December, also adopted a statement on the design of a backstop to the single resolution fund.  A sufficient common backstop, both in the transition phase and in the steady phase, is essential for the single resolution mechanism to be credible.  This will be the subject of further negotiations.<\/p><p> Overall, the general approach reached on the single resolution mechanism was an important step in completing the banking union project.  Although the deal is not perfect, an accommodation was reached and this is progress.  The important point for me is that the agreement reached will protect taxpayers in cases where banks need to be resolved.  This is in welcome contrast to what happened in Ireland where taxpayers were required to shoulder the costs of failed banks.  The fundamental objective remains to break the link between the sovereign and the banking sector as agreed by heads of state and governments of the euro area in June 2012.<\/p><p> I also welcome the fact that the European Council fulfilled its objective of securing political agreement on the single resolution mechanism by the end of the year.  This was important for confidence, including from a markets perspective.  There is more work ahead, but the agreement shows that when we put our minds to it, European leaders can find compromises and deliver on promises, and some on time.  We will now work constructively with the European Parliament to ensure agreement is reached before parliamentarians switch their focus to the European elections later this year.<\/p><p> I also point out at this stage that the agreement reached at the Eurogroup meeting of 20 June 2013 on the main features of the ESM's direct bank recapitalisation instrument has not changed.  From an Irish perspective, it was important that this agreement noted that, &quot;The potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement&quot;.  It is clear that there is still a lot of negotiation to be done on this aspect of the facility but the agreement now in place keeps the possibility to apply to the ESM for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks open for us should we wish to avail of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100030#CC03200","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390327200,"counter":508,"content":"<p>What does that last phrase mean, &quot;should we wish to avail of it&quot;?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100031#DD00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1390327200,"counter":509,"content":"<p>Should we wish to avail of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100031#DD00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1390327200,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I thought that was Government policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100031#DD00400","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1390327200,"counter":511,"content":"<p>It is our policy.

These were previously known as \"contractual arrangements\".  It was my view that it would be premature to take any decisions on these proposals until they had been considered and teased out in much more detail.  Most of my colleagues shared this view.  As a result it was agreed that work should be taken forward and the proposals revisited in October next.<\/p><p>  Competitiveness, of course, remains an important issue and Ireland will support efforts to improve competitiveness in any way we can.  Some member states see the proposed partnerships in this light.  We need to be sure, however, that we adopt the best approach.<\/p><p>  Building on the commitments made by the European Council in June, under the Irish Presidency, to strengthen the social dimension of the EMU, the European Council also reaffirmed the importance of employment and social developments within the European Semester.  In this context, I welcome the new scoreboard of employment and social indicators which will complement and build on existing tools within the European Semester without entailing automatic consequences or triggering binding sanctions.  Ireland has consistently supported the development of such a scoreboard as an analytical tool to detect emerging divergences and negative developments that are relevant to EMU and that require urgent collective attention and action.<\/p><p>  For the first time in five years the European Council also discussed the Common Security and Defence Policy known as CSDP.  The first working session of our meeting was devoted to this topic.  In reflecting on this, it is important to remember that during that period, the global context has changed significantly.  The European Union and its member states are being called on to assume greater responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security, especially in support of the United Nations which has the primary role in that regard, and this is against the background of tightening budgets.<\/p><p>  Ireland believes that the CSDP needs to be reinvigorated and improved to enhance the European Union's capacity to act in support of the United Nations.  While we look to protect the social and economic well-being of our own citizens, we cannot be immune to the threats faced by vulnerable men, women and children in fragile states and in conflict zones and those suffering from natural and man-made disasters across the globe.  The European Union and its member states can bring a comprehensive approach to the promotion of international peace and stability through a unique combination of civilian, diplomatic, economic, development, justice, security and defence instruments.<\/p><p>  Currently, the European Union is conducting 17 missions across three continents.  Thirteen of these are civilian missions and four are UN-approved military missions.  Ireland contributes to three of the military operations and is proud that an Irishman holds the post of mission commander of one of them.<\/p><p>  Discussions at the European Council addressed three areas: increasing the effectiveness of the CSDP, the development and provision of capabilities to support CSDP, and improving the ability of EU industry to provide these capabilities.  The conclusions which we agreed represent a strong political commitment by Heads of State and Government to strengthen CSDP.  In order to achieve this objective, we endorsed a number of practical improvements to the CSDP aimed at speeding up the deployment of civilian missions and our capacity for peacekeeping and crisis management in conflict situations, including in battlegroups.<\/p><p>  New security challenges also need to be addressed and, in that context, we agreed to focus on developing strategies in the area of cyber security and maritime security during 2014.  These are two key Irish priorities.  We agreed that work should also continue on developing synergies between CSDP and freedom, security and justice, and in the area of border security and energy security.<\/p><p>  For the European Union to continue to play an effective and credible role as a security provider in its neighbourhood and in the wider world, it must ensure that it has the necessary capabilities to undertake these tasks.  Troops on operations, including our own Defence Forces engaged on UN mandated operations, require effective force protection and defensive equipment.  To that end, the European Council emphasised the central role of member states and the European Defence Agency in developing capabilities in areas such as air-to-air refuelling, remotely piloted air systems, satellite communications and cyber defence.<\/p><p>  The European Council also acknowledged the ongoing role of European industry in the provision of capabilities in support of CSDP and endorsed proposals to increase efficiencies in the delivery of capabilities by European industry.  A roadmap aimed at implementing the commitments contained in the European Council conclusions will be produced this year.<\/p><p>  The Council conclusions also re-emphasise the European Union's commitment to working in close collaboration with its global, transatlantic and regional partners, such as the United Nations, NATO and the African Union.  Co-operation with the United Nations is a point which I emphasised in the meeting and which I am glad to see reflected in the conclusions.  On this point, let me emphasise that I believe the work undertaken at the European Council is entirely consistent with Ireland's policy of military neutrality and does not threaten the guarantees given under the Lisbon protocols.  The conclusions are set in the context of the development of the Common Security and Defence Policy and, indeed, the Lisbon treaty provisions are referenced in the conclusions.<\/p><p>  Let me say a word about economic and social policy.  The December Council concluded the preliminary phase of European Semester 2014 by welcoming the Annual Growth Survey and the Alert Mechanism Report presented by the Commission on 13 November.  The main message is that the biggest challenge facing Europe's economy lies in sustaining a fragile recovery.<\/p><p>  This is the fourth European Semester cycle, the third under the enhanced governance arrangements introduced by the six-pack, and the first under the further enhancements introduced by the two-pack.  Ireland will fully participate in the European Semester this year following the successful completion of our EU-IMF programme.<\/p><p>  The December Council set direction for further work.  The Spring Council will offer guidance to member states on the preparation and submission in mid-April of their national reform platforms.  As I stated previously, I support strongly the continued emphasis on the five main priorities set by the Annual Growth Survey.<\/p><p>These are pursuing differentiated, growth-friendly fiscal consolidation; restoring lending to the economy; promoting growth and competitiveness for today and tomorrow; tackling unemployment and the social consequences of the crisis; and modernising public administration.  It is an emphasis that is reflected strongly in the clear direction we have set at national level, including through the interlocking Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work strategies.  It is an emphasis we must ensure remains strong at European level, continuing to build from the successful Irish Presidency programme in the first half of last year.<\/p><p> It is in this context that the December European Council also took stock of progress under the Compact for Growth and Jobs agreed in June 2012.  This included reviewing preparations for the youth employment initiative fully operational from the beginning of 2014.  Ireland, as one of the countries hardest hit by the crisis, will benefit from this new fund.  The first phase of our own Youth Guarantee implementation plan, developed in conjunction with the OECD, was finalised by the Government in December.  The broad outline has been submitted to the Commission.<\/p><p> The Council also took stock of progress in mobilising the enhanced lending capacity of the European Investment Bank on foot of the &euro;10 billion increase in its capital base.  This has already supported a 38% increase in its 2013 lending volumes, to &euro;62 billion.  As I said before the December meeting, there were almost &euro;1.2 billion worth of EIB project signatures and loan approvals in Ireland in 2013 last year.  This represents an increase of just over one fifth on 2012 levels, which were in turn up more than four fifths on the previous year.  We continue to see room for stronger EIB support, including in the area of SME access finance, and this will remain a top priority for us in the time ahead.<\/p><p> The European Council also had a short discussion on taxation, which is important for Ireland.  Leaders reiterated their support for the OECD's project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting or BEPS as it has become known.  Ireland supports the BEPS project as these issues cannot be tackled by countries acting on their own.<\/p><p> We also support the automatic exchange of information between tax authorities and we welcome the reference to early agreement on the directive on administrative co-operation in the conclusions as important.   Additionally, the European Council noted the Lithuanian Presidency &quot;end of term&quot; report on tax issues and welcomed the Commission's initiative to establish an expert group on taxation of the digital economy.   We will be continuing to participate actively in the ongoing work here.<\/p><p> As I noted, the European Council had a very large agenda.  In addition to the discussions I outlined, we also looked at enlargement and some foreign policy issues , and the Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, will touch on these later. <\/p><p> I wish to say a few words on migration and energy.  Following on from previous discussions at the European Council and the Justice and Home Affairs Council in the wake of the major tragedy off the coast of Lampedusa - where more than 300 migrants lost their life after their vessel sank - the Council considered a Commission communication on the work of the Task Force for the Mediterranean.  The task force was established in October in response to the Lampedusa disaster.  The Council welcomed the Commission communication outlining a series of operational actions aimed at addressing the problem.  It is now a question of implementation, and in this regard there is general recognition of the need to prioritise EU co-operation with countries of origin and transit with the aim of averting hazardous sea voyages to the EU's Mediterranean borders.  Ireland participated in the task force.<\/p><p> The European Council also took stock of progress made by the TTE (Energy) Council in regard to guidelines agreed at the May 2013 European Council on energy matters.  These guidelines identified the importance of completing the internal energy market by 2014 and of the external dimension of EU energy policy.  Tomorrow, 22 January, the Commission will adopt a package of measures, including the communication on 2030 framework, a communication on energy prices, a legislative proposal on ETS structural measures, a communication on industrial policy, and the communication on unconventional oil and gas.  We will examine these measures closely in the run up to the March Council, which will focus, in particular, on the climate and energy framework. <b><\/b><\/p><p><b><\/b>This has provided the House with a good sense of the discussions and the range of them at the December European Council.  The next Council will take place on 20 and 21 March.  It will focus on energy and climate change as well as industrial policy and the European Semester.  I will of course brief the House in advance of the meeting. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100031#DD00900","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390327800,"counter":517,"content":"<p>December&rsquo;s meeting of the European Council produced no major breakthrough or even any significant news.  It involved a series of general discussions and the formal noting of decisions signalled long in advance.  In spite of this it was a very significant meeting.  It will be remembered as the summit where Europe&rsquo;s leaders effectively announced the end of any attempt to introduce radical reform in the face of the biggest economic and social crisis in the Union&rsquo;s history.<\/p><p>  Faced with an unprecedented challenge, the Taoiseach and his colleagues have agreed no more than incremental steps.  They have not agreed a credible long-term programme to return sustained growth to the eurozone or the European Union as a whole.  They have decided to be bystanders in the fundamental challenge of job creation, putting their faith in the mantra that deflating economies through universal austerity and market reforms will magic growth in a manner unprecedented in modern history.  <\/p><p>  For Ireland this has many implications, none of which is good.  While the Taoiseach maintains his priority of putting public relations first, he has refused to address the absence of any real growth strategy at European level.  No economist in the Union or in any country has increased their growth and employment predictions arising from the Council's agreements.  It has not happened here and it has not happened in any country.<\/p><p>  While the Taoiseach has told us on a number of occasions that everything is looking up for the European economy the evidence is that the eurozone is lagging dramatically behind other economies, including the United States and Britain, both of whom were hit as badly at the start of the crisis but are well ahead in terms of growth rates, employment creation and deficit reduction.  A restoration of confidence is important.  Everyone wants a broad and strong return to growth.  The problem is that every time the growth fails to materialise the hit to confidence is much more damaging.<\/p><p>  While the communiqu&eacute; repeatedly states that policies are working there was clearly also a decision to nod to the reality of the mountains of contradictory evidence.  Buried in the middle of the communique is the statement that the recovery is &quot;modest, uneven and fragile&quot;.  The president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, has gone even further, saying that he is extremely concerned about whether growth targets will be achieved and that he believes that deflation is a real risk.  While we have seen positive signs here and the Government is in full campaign mode to claim credit for everything, the situation is equally fragile.  A two-tiered recovery is the best that it can be described as. <\/p><p>  SMEs continue to find credit difficult to obtain, regional disparities are growing and the Government has missed every growth target it has set since taking up office.  In spite of these warnings what we got was another summit without the urgency or ambition required to address the serious flaws in the work of the Union and their deep impact on its citizens.  Leaders have declared themselves &quot;out ' the gap&quot; and are now mainly focused on finding ever more creative ways of exaggerating the impact of their decisions.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach has once again delivered a complacent report from a European summit.  He has fully subscribed to the new orthodoxy that everything is working and no major changes are required.  He has also signed up to an agreement which has explicitly ended any prospect that stimulus funding would be available through the Union or from most national budgets.  He has not referenced this but it is there in the final conclusions.  <\/p><p>  The length and depth of the crisis which has hit most of the eurozone was not caused by the absence of stronger controls of national budgets.  Even the principal architect of the euro, Jacques Delors, has said that the root cause of the crisis felt in Ireland and elsewhere is to be found in fundamental design flaws in the euro.  These involve the lack of a banking union, the limited mandate of the European Central Bank and the absence of central funds to help countries stimulate their economies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100032#EE00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1390327800,"counter":518,"content":"<p>They have all been addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100032#EE00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1390327800,"counter":519,"content":"<p>At the summit leaders signed off on the final elements of what is called a banking union but it is no such thing.  The toxic link between financial debt and sovereign debt has absolutely not been broken.  The Taoiseach confirmed that in his speech.  National interests have prevailed.  The core principle of sharing risk so that risk is minimised has been ignored.  There are pieces of progress, but nothing near the scale of what should have been agreed.<\/p><p>  The most important final agreement for a banking union, as described by the Taoiseach, will cover 128 banks in total.  Many banks which have the capacity to cause systematic problems will not be covered.  The proposed single supervisory mechanism will initially be more about co-ordination than common supervision, but the European Central Bank has the potential to push this further.  Ireland should join the European Central Bank in calling for the removal of any opportunity for governments to interfere in oversight matters that should be independent.  <\/p><p>  To break the link between sovereign and banking debt there must be no expectation that the State has an implicit guarantee to fund banks in trouble.<\/p><p>This requires the availability of a large backstop of funds because markets know that states will not allow their banking systems to collapse.  This will not be available.<\/p><p> The bank resolution fund to which the Taoiseach signed up will take ten years to build up and after a decade it will have &euro;55 billion available to it.  This has been estimated at only 0.2% of the total asset base of the covered banks.  The fund could realistically cover no more than one or two mid-sized European banks.  It is so small that the Commission is trying to stop it being used for as long as possible.  Ireland should not have agreed to this as a final deal.  At the very minimum, we should have put on the table the need for the funds available for safeguarding the banking system of the euro to be greater than 0.2% of the assets base.  In the two years a banking union has been debated the Government has refused to ever state publicly what it wants from the process.  There is no public record of any statement by the Taoiseach setting out what would be required to break the toxic link between banking and sovereign debt.  How can he claim to be happy with this deal?

However, there are others where there are alternative routes.  It is a major failing of the European Union&rsquo;s leaders that they have continued with a one-policy-fits-all approach.  This obliges even countries with significant flexibility to reject stimulus spending.  It ends the possibility of balances within the eurozone going both ways in order to benefit the whole.  The inability of the European Union to help states in trouble means it is focused primarily on control measures.<\/p><p>  Buried within the communiqu&eacute; issued after the summit is a very depressing confirmation that this failed policy is to be retained.  It was agreed by the Taoiseach that all solidarity measures should be funded within the existing budget and that the main route to growth was the reform of the labour market and trade.  I can understand how Fine Gael would sign up to such a restrictive view of the economy, but how this can be reconciled with the Labour Party&rsquo;s way, I have no idea.  No matter what the Taoiseach says, an EU policy which actively opposes a stimulus, pushes reduced spending and does not target regions most in need is not one for growth and job creation.  The failure to reform the European Union, make it more active and fit for the purpose in helping countries will be recorded by history as a failure of leadership by this generation of EU leaders.  December 2013 will be remembered as the time when the European Council ended its efforts to respond radically to the largest crisis in the history of the Union.  <\/p><p>  On defence, the citizens of Europe will be surprised to know that the bulk of the time at this summit was spent on defence matters rather than social and economic issues.  The carefully worded conclusions from the summit do not contain any overt challenge to the neutrality of Ireland and some other member states.  They do, however, contain no proper acknowledgement of this either.  There are two significant points of concern which Ireland should have mentioned, but it does not appear to have done so.  First, there are proposals to direct procurement and development activity into specific areas, in particular, unmanned drones and air-to-air refuelling.  This is not a peacekeeping focused agenda.  These are activities which have nothing to do with the type of activities that interest Ireland and other countries which have no interest in planning for participating in international conflicts.  It is an agenda tightly focused on the interests of major defence contractors who do business with states which maintain a conflict participation capacity.  Under no circumstance should Ireland support a direction of any common EU capacity to these areas.<\/p><p>  Second, there is the statement that the Commission will look for opportunities to target research funding from Horizon 2020 to defence-related areas.  This is absolutely unacceptable.  The research programme is already insufficient.  Through the efforts of our Commissioner, it has been targeted on major economic, social and health challenges facing Europe.  No redirection to drone development or other defence priorities should be countenanced.<\/p><p>  Before the summit the Taoiseach roared &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo; across the chamber when he was told that we did not trust Fine Gael&rsquo;s policy of wanting to move away from the United Nations and towards Europe in defence policy.  He should take the time to read his party&rsquo;s own policy published during his own leadership and also the informed leaks from the Minister for Defence, Deputy Alan Shatter, to the effect that the UN Security Council should not be part of the triple lock underpinning our neutrality.<\/p><p>  Much of the international coverage of the summit focused on revelations of American data collection and eavesdropping in Europe.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s reaction was disappointing.  It was not enough to say he hoped there was nothing with an impact on Ireland.  Equally, his refusal to ask the British Government for assurances that it did not intercept our communications during the Northern negotiations is a disgrace.  <\/p><p>  The summit adopted quite general conclusions on Ukraine.  I support High Commissioner Ashton in her refusal to accept the demands of the Russian and Ukrainian Governments.  There comes a point when the behaviour of certain governments can no longer allow it to be business as usual.  Both the Russian and Ukrainian Governments are members of the Council of Europe.<\/p><p>They have both signed the European charter of human rights and regularly deny basic rights to citizens.  The people being beaten on the streets of Kiev are there because they believe in democracy and human rights.  They are there because they see the European Union as their best hope for stability and development and it must stand with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100033#FF03000","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390329000,"counter":551,"content":"<p>Before the last summit I raised with the Taoiseach the scandal of US electronic eavesdropping on European allies, but he appeared not to know a thing about it, although it went on to dominate at least part of the Council meeting and certainly the news coverage.  He has not mentioned it in his report.  As he acknowledged, this was the first meeting since the Lisbon treaty to focus so heavily on security and defence issues, or as he termed it, \"Common Security and Defence Policy\".  Earlier today during questions he spoke about the Great War of 1914 to 1918 and his visit to Flanders.  It is very clear from the conclusions of that Council meeting that EU leaders are seeking to further militarise the European Union, with the aim of eventually creating an EU army allied to NATO.  Such an army would effectively be NATO without the North American countries and Turkey.  The function of such an army would appear to be the protection of interests of former European colonial powers, specifically former colonies.  How could any Irish Government, considering our history and experience, go along with this?  Did the Taoiseach object to any of this at the Council meeting?  No, he did not and in his remarks today he has indicated that he believes this work is entirely consistent with Ireland's policy of military neutrality.  I disagree.  Irish neutrality is a concept supported and valued by the vast majority of citizens of the State and it was a concept once supported by the Labour Party.  Unless seriously challenged, a continuation of the plans discussed at the EU summit will see increased spending on weapons and arms by EU member states, including this state.  At the time of the biggest economic recession the European Union has ever witnessed, the main idea contained in the Council conclusions is to increase spending on weapons and military technology.  Where is the sense in such a policy?  There is always money for the elite for armaments, but there is no increased spending on health care, social protection, economic and job stimuli or youth unemployment initiatives.<\/p><p>  To the surprise of many, the European Union won the Nobel Peace Prize, but how does that sit with an EU meeting which speaks about wanting more public money for weapons to be used in some of the poorest countries on the planet?  As we can see in today's headlines, what is happening in Syria is proving to be probably the worst humanitarian crisis the United nations has yet faced.  Horrific images are emerging from Syria of the suffering of its citizens, including children.  There is no military solution to conflicts such as this and what is required is an international focus to find a peaceful political solution.  The European Union has a role to play in this regard.  Was the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria discussed at the European Council meeting, with a mind to trying to advance a peaceful solution to the conflict?<\/p><p>  There have been attempts since last summer, led by the United States Administration, to broker peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.  In every pre-Council discussion I have attended here the issue of peace in the Middle East and the plight of the people in Palestine has been raised, but the Taoiseach has never once returned to inform us of how he raised it.  I presume, therefore, that he did not do so.  One week ago Israel announced the construction of 1,400 new settlements on occupied Palestinian land on the West Bank, which is in clear breach of international law.  As Fine Gael is the party of law and order, how can it stand by and let that happen.  The European Union carries out billions of euro in trade with the state of Israel every year; therefore, there is leverage, with a clear onus on the Union to make a stand against the Israeli Government's aggression and flouting of international law.  Given our history and peace process, one would think there was a duty and an obligation on the Government and the Taoiseach to raise such issues.  We must remember that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not equal and that there is a clear power imbalance.  Israel is a First World state with a nuclear arsenal, but the Palestinians are stateless and their lands are occupied.  Without international support and solidarity, they will continue to be oppressed and victimised.  If states such as Ireland do not raise these matters, how can we expect anybody else to do so?<\/p><p>  There were also several visitors from the European Union to this state in recent times.  There was a delegation of MEPs from the European Parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee which visited to review the role of the troika in our bailout programme and it met some of the social actors and politicians.  I hope it left in the knowledge that the troika was not a force for good and that the continued implementation of troika policies by the Government has had devastating social consequences for Irish citizens.  While the troika may have left, the mindset continues.  It is welcome that the delegation also inquired about the loss of key documents from the Department of Finance on the bailout.  I understand the European Ombudsman has taken action to compel the European Central Bank to release the letters it sent to the late Minister, Mr. Brian Lenihan, at the height of the banking crisis.  The Government is also sitting on some very important information that it refuses to share, including a report on the activities of Irish Nationwide Building Society that is greatly in the public interest.  The Taoiseach knows that Mr. Klaus Regling of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, has also been in the city, but he used his visit to pour cold water on the prospect of retrospective recapitalisation of Irish banks through the ESM.  I remind the Taoiseach that he famously stated retrospective recapitalisation of Irish banks was on the table after what he claimed was a &quot;game-changing&quot; summit in June 2012.  What is the story in that regard?<\/p><p>  The Euorpean Council also discussed the issue of European banking union.  My party has major concerns about the details of such a union because we are concerned that such a union - the devil is in the detail - could merely be another step towards a federalised European Union.  Several European politicians and senior statespersons have implied that this is the aim.  I do not believe the people want a banking union that gives power and authority to the European Union but none of the responsibilities.  A common resolution regime for future banking is important, but Irish citizens will still bear an unjust, unfair and unsustainable burden, while legacy bank debt, caused by the Government's bailing out of failed banks which must be carried by the public, has not been addressed.  Citizens deserve to hear from the Taoiseach about what he is doing to separate banking debt already incurred in the State from sovereign debt.  We want to hear about an adequate jobs stimulus, proper and appropriate investment in youth employment measures and how the Government has stood up for the State at the European Council instead of being compliant to bigger powers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100034#GG00200","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1390329000,"counter":552,"content":"<p>Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe is sharing time with Deputy Gerry Adams.

The conclusions even state the debate on EU military co-operation was preceded by a meeting with the NATO Secretary General, Anders Rasmussen, who welcomed the increased militarisation of the European Union which he said was beneficial to NATO.  The conclusions go on to state the European Union's Common Security and Defence Policy will continue to develop in full complementarity with NATO.  In order to help \"foster more systematic and long-term co-operation\", Baroness Ashton will bring forward a policy framework on defence issues by the end of 2014 \"in full coherence with existing NATO planning processes\".<\/p><p>This push to further militarise the European Union will create a NATO-lite that will speak, act and spend like NATO but not carry the name.  Did the Taoiseach participate in this debate and oppose any of these plans during the Council meeting?  It will be interesting to hear his response.<\/p><p> Various voices in the European Union have continued to point out how decreased military spending by member states is leaving the European Union vulnerable.  They do not adequately tell us where it is vulnerable or to whom.  Knowing this would be helpful to the rest of us.  We know that EU member states are already spending &euro;194 billion a year on weapons.  The real agenda seems to be increased military spending to fund arms manufacture in key EU member states.<\/p><p> A disturbing insight into the arms industry was given by the recent report that employees of the Greek Ministry of Defence and several representatives of German arms companies had been questioned by the magistrate's office in Athens.  The office found that three German companies had paid large bribes to sell arms to the Greek armed forces.  These multi-billion euro deals with German arms manufacturers played a major role in establishing Greece's position as the world's fifth largest arms procurer between 2005 and 2009.  These contracts helped to inflate Greece's debts and exacerbated and contributed in no small way to the Greek financial crisis.  They helped to push Greece into crisis, while massively increasing the profits of German arms manufacturers.  Greece now has formidable weapons for its armed forces, but it has bread queues in Athens for the first time since the Second World War.<\/p><p> Is this the type of European Union the Taoiseach wants to see?  Is it the type European leaders want to see?  I refer to a union in which public spending on health care, education and social protection is secondary to buying the latest weapons of mass destruction.  It is morally wrong to prioritise investment in the arms trade, particularly at a time when many young people and children across Europe are going to bed hungry.  Furthermore, it does not make any economic sense or in the long term.  All reports on the arms industry find that it is one of the worst economic sectors in which to invest to boost job creation and growth.  The high-yield sectors include infrastructure, health care, education and real job stimuli such as the robust and wide-ranging youth guarantee scheme.<\/p><p> Did the Council discuss the E3+3 interim agreement with Iran on its nuclear programme?  I did not hear the Taoiseach mention it.  It is welcome that an interim agreement has been struck and that EU Foreign Ministers agreed yesterday to lift some sanctions on Iran.  I hope progress can continue and that all sanctions will soon be lifted.  Iran, like all countries that have signed the NPT, has a right to develop nuclear energy projects for peaceful and civilian purposes.  However, I note with concern that some countries, particularly those that have nuclear weapons or access thereto, have tried to wreck this historic first step.  Did the Council discuss what would happen if the US Government bowed to minority voices in the US Congress and, perhaps in a fit of pique, ended this interim agreement?  Will the European Union continue its positive engagement with Iran in the event of the United States ending its participation in the talks?<\/p><p> Syria has been mentioned.  Were the crisis associated with the war in Syria and the Geneva 2 talks discussed?  I am aware that the meeting was held in December and that there have been many developments since.  I welcome the announcement that certain rebel factions have agreed to take part in the talks, but I was disappointed that Iran's invitation to the talks from the United Nations was rescinded, apparently after pressure from the United States.  If the United Nations wants these talks to evolve into a peace process and end the war, there is a need to work towards a mutual ceasefire between the rebels and the government, with talks with no pre-conditions, and an invitation to all involved parties directly involved, including key international partners.  I would like to believe the talks will include a discussion of the creation of a humanitarian corridor for all refugees caught in the crossfire while besieged in their refugee camps, particularly the 20,000 Palestinian refugees besieged in Yarmouk refugee camp.  They are starving, eating grass and weeds and experiencing one of the worst humanitarian crises international aid organisations have seen.  They need immediate and urgent support.  I raised the issue with the Iranian Foreign Minister when I was in Tehran last week and hope the Government will use its influence with EU partners to push influential countries on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100034#GG00400","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390329600,"counter":555,"content":"<p>Any reading of the communiqu&eacute; that followed the meeting of the Prime Ministers of the European Council and other Heads of State on 19 and 20 December 2013 indicates that it resembled in large part a meeting of militarists and armament industry executives.

It further states, \"The European Council calls on the Member States to deepen defence cooperation by improving the capacity to conduct missions and operations and by making full use of synergies in order to improve the development and availability of the required civilian and military capabilities, supported by a more integrated, sustainable, innovative and competitive European Defence Technological and Industrial Base\".  Reference is made to \"increasing the effectiveness, visibility and impact of CSDP; enhancing the development of capabilities and strengthening Europe's defence industry\".  Later it refers to a \"well-functioning defence market\".<\/p><p>  What does all of this mean in reality?  It means a major push to strengthen the armaments industry in the European Union.  What is the armaments industry?  It is an industry in which, obscenely, at least hundreds of scientists, engineers and designers do nothing but sit at desks designing weapons that can kill greater numbers of people over greater distances and inflict greater suffering on the intended targets.  Tens of thousands of industrial workers are obliged for their livelihoods to put their plans into effect, or create these monstrous weapons which will visit death and destruction on society, very often outside the European Union.  Despite all the fine talk in the treaties of the European Union and by its bureaucracy and political and economic elites about the Union being a zone of democracy, peace, solidarity and human rights, many of the biggest armaments merchants in the world are prominently located within the Union and assisted by governments and the bureaucracy of the Union in the same way as the US, Chinese and Russian weapons industries are supported by their ruling elites.<\/p><p>Further, what do we find?  We find that what are called \"remotely piloted aircraft systems\" are to be designed.  They should be called by their more commonly used name, drones.  In view of the horror inflicted on innocent civilians in Pakistan, where thousands have died as a result of the great democrat, Obama, sending unmanned or unpiloted drones to wreak havoc on them, does the Minister of State think that perhaps this is not an appropriate peace-loving strategy to adopt?  Remember what has happened in Pakistan, with civilians killed at wedding parties, funerals and so forth and with drones coming out of the sky and inflicting savage retribution and horror on innocent people - women, children and men.  One would have to ask, then, are these the actions of a peace- and solidarity-loving establishment?  The answer is \"No\".  What we have here is the building of an imperial power, and particularly since the enlargement of the European Union, this has been going on apace.  It is quite clear that the aim of the corporate elites and their political representatives, which are the major parties within the European Union, is to build a new capitalist bloc.  They think that with a population of 500 million they will have an industrial powerhouse and they want a military wing to go onto the world stage and vie with the other major capitalist blocs of the United States, Russia, India and China for markets, goods, services and raw materials.  That is really the agenda here.  The Taoiseach of a supposedly neutral State sits at an assembly where all of this is thrashed out and then comes in here and declares his allegiance to neutrality.  Meanwhile, Margaretta D'Arcy, who is 79 years old and very  ill, languishes in a jail in the Republic of Ireland, a supposedly neutral country, for what?  For trying to oppose the use of one of our major airports for military purposes by a major power.  It is quite incredible.  <\/p><p> It is capitalist competition and militarisation that has the world where it is, causing huge suffering to innocent people.  If we wanted to create a society in which the economy was for people's welfare and not profit, this is not the way we would go.  We would use the economy for the benefit of our people, not to create weapons of mass destruction; we would release the &euro;3 trillion of accumulated profits that are locked up by major corporations in banks to create employment for the 25 million unemployed and to create an entirely different society within the European Union.  That is how we would change the world.  That is how the world could be changed.  European capitalism will never do it but a socialist Europe could.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100035#HH00200","speaker":"954","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390330200,"counter":557,"content":"<p>Sometimes it is sad when one's predictions are dramatically confirmed.  The prediction made by those of us who opposed the Lisbon and Nice treaties and the Iraq war that Europe was moving towards becoming a corporate, militarised, imperial power - to use what some might consider the archaic language of the left - is dramatically confirmed by this European Council meeting.  There is a huge irony with regard to arguments that were used by Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party during debates on the Lisbon treaty.  They argued that we must support Europe because the European project will prevent a repeat of the horrors of the First and Second World Wars.  They said the European Union was a project of European co-operation, bringing peace to Europe and ensuring those horrors could never happen again.  Yes, I understand - the way to prevent the horrors that we saw in the First World War, when big powers sent millions of people out to slaughter one another so that those powers could control resources and colonies, repeated again in the Second World War, is to develop a European arms industry, to produce drones and weapons of mass destruction and to gear the European Union up for military actions outside its territory.  That is Orwellian doublethink if ever I saw it.  One reads in the communique that the Council \"laments\" the fact defence budgets in Europe are \"constrained\".  There are many things to lament in Europe and there are a hell of a lot of things that are constrained, including budgets for health, education and economic stimulation to provide employment for our young people.  Something that is not lamentable, however, is constrained defence budgets, particularly if the European Union is supposed to be about promoting peace and international solidarity.  We should be delighted and should be seeking to reduce the defence budgets further and to redeploy those resources into areas that actually improve the lives of ordinary citizens.  We should not be developing ever more sophisticated ways of killing people, but that is what the European arms industry is about.<\/p><p>  The latest fad among big Western powers and the European Union, in terms of sophisticated weapons to kill people, is the drone.  Tragically, the Irish Government has embraced the new European enthusiasm for drones.  These disgusting weapons are manless machines which wreak death and destruction at the push of a button by people on the other side of the world on innocent people in some of the poorest countries in the world, including Pakistan and Afghanistan.  One would not see it in a bad James Bond movie in which characters are dreamed up who are bent on world domination and who inflict untold horrors on ordinary people.  That is what these drones do and the Irish Government is now buying drones from Israel.  I would like the Minister of State to outline the extent to which Israel is involved in this new European drive towards greater militarisation and more co-operation with NATO.  It is unbelievable that we are buying drones from Israel, a country involved in systematic and ongoing violation of human rights, which has been condemned by just about every humanitarian organisation in the world for its use of vile weapons, including chemical weapons, against the Palestinian population.  The Irish Government is buying drones from Israel and the European Union is integrating Israel's military-industrial complex into the new European military-industrial complex to provide the base for creating a European army - to fight whom?<\/p><p>  Margaretta D'Arcy is an artist, a writer, a member of Aosd&aacute;na, a pensioner, a Parkinson's disease sufferer and a peace activist.  She has been protesting against the use of Shannon Airport to facilitate the illegal rendition programme of kidnapping and torture being conducted by the CIA.  She has opposed the use of the airport as a stop-off point for American planes on their way to bomb people in Afghanistan and, previously, in Iraq.  She is now languishing in jail, and meanwhile the Taoiseach swans off to the European Council and supports the militarisation of Europe.<\/p><p>Last week he was in the United Arab Emirates, hobnobbing with the brutal dictators of the gulf states, cementing trade deals with people who did not allow democracy, who cut off the heads of their political opponents and denied every basic human and civil right.  They are vile regimes.  We have also cemented new trade deals with the Chinese dictatorship.  That is what we now do - we consort with and celebrate our new arrangements with dictators - and we are supposed to applaud this, while a peace activist, writer and an artist languishes in jail because out of good conscience she said a neutral country should not participate in or in any way facilitate a military machine or a programme of kidnapping and torture, something that has been well documented by international human rights organisations, while we say nothing.<\/p><p> Is that the type of society we promote?  We do not even raise issues, as commented on by some members of the media when the Taoiseach was in the United Arab Emirates.  They asked why he had not raised the issue of human rights.  He was told it was not the time or place to do this; it was just business.  If business means ignoring human rights, dictatorships and regimes that use violence, we will not say a word and, in fact, will emulate them.  We will do the same in Europe, as Romano Prodi put it a number of years ago in a rare moment of honesty - to fight the resource wars of the 21st century, just like we had resource wars at the beginning of the 20th century and again between 1939 and 1945.  It is absolutely despicable.  The ordinary citizens of Europe pay the price, with 20 million unemployed, public services being decimated by cuts and austerity, while the corporate, military, industrial complex is protected by the powers that be, aided and abetted by the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100036#JJ00200","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390330800,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to obtain clarification on a couple of points made by the Taoiseach.  I sensed a lack of urgency at the summit on the jobs crisis, but perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, might enlighten me that the opposite was the case.  When the currency seemed to be under threat and financial institutions seemed to be on the brink of collapse, various crisis meetings were held and an effort was made to resolve the issue, albeit too slowly.  We have a crisis of equal magnitude in terms of unemployment across the European Union, with a particular impact in this country, but I do not get the sense in the discussions that have taken place that the same sense of urgency applies to the crisis.  Will the Minister of State enlighten me on whether I missed something in what the Taoiseach said that might indicate some sense of urgency not just among the other leaders but even within the Irish delegation?<\/p><p>  My second question is related to the first.  It concerns how we deal with the shortage of credit, in particular for the small and medium enterprise, SME, sector.  The Minister of State will recall that, as part of the programme for Government, the Government indicated the establishment of a strategic investment bank.  In recent times that has been watered down to a strategic investment fund, but there is no sign of it emerging in any real way.  We are now a couple of years further on and the sector most likely to resolve the unemployment crisis is clearly the SME sector which is starved of cash to maintain existing business or invest in new opportunities now emerging.  In spite of this, there is no sign of the crisis being reflected at Council level or by the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100037#KK00200","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1390330800,"counter":560,"content":"<p>Will the Minister of State take questions on foreign affairs issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100037#KK00300","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1390330800,"counter":561,"content":"<p>Yes.

Has the Government come forward with ideas to enable the Foreign Affairs Council to address the matter?<\/p><p>  I mentioned the interim agreement on nuclear energy involving a reduction in sanctions on Iran.  One of the issues that came up with the Iranians was that in the past three years the amount of drugs coming through Afghanistan had quadrupled.  Did any discussion take place on the matter?  The Iranians are interested in co-operating with other countries on it, as Iran is hugely affected by it.  I do not necessarily agree with the Iranian response to the problem which includes the execution of those involved in drug smuggling.  However, it is a huge problem not only for Iran, as the drugs will end up on the streets of Dublin.  In the past we all saw the effects of cheap heroin coming into the country, with the loss of thousands of lives in Dublin, across Europe and elsewhere in the world.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach referred to migration flows in the region in the context of the Lampedusa tragedy.  The more regular migration flows are a problem.  Was there a discussion of the coffin ships that bring people to Europe?  Likewise, did a discussion take place on the issue of people trafficking?

The latter part of that sentence - &ldquo;in accordance with the Lisbon treaty and the opportunities it offers&rdquo; - is the key part which addresses some of the concerns raised by Members about compatibility between the conclusion and Ireland&rsquo;s neutrality.  It recognises the safeguards for Ireland in the Lisbon treaty which, in turn, rests on Article 29.4.9&deg; of the Constitution which lays out clearly what the country can and cannot do regarding defence policy.  If I look at the understandable concerns raised by Members as to what the CSDP could look like in the future, I point to what it has done in the past and now, as well as Irish participation in it.  We should look at the work of the Defence Forces in Chad, Somalia and Mali where the men and women of the Defence Forces have been engaged in activities completely consistent with our neutrality, as well as its safeguards in the Lisbon treaty.

The Government - I explained this in the D&aacute;il before Christmas - has underscored its grave concern about what is happening there.

In recent weeks Members have seen the devastating effects of flooding and storm damage on householders, farmers and business owners, as well as on people's livelihoods, in many parts of the country, particularly the midlands and the River Shannon catchment area of Longford-Westmeath.  Many people in the River Shannon region suffered severe hardship as result of recent flooding which was a recurrence of the November 2009 floods.  I sympathise with those affected.  In 2010 the then Oireachtas joint committee, after consultation with the various agencies involved, prepared and presented a report on the severe weather events to a number of agencies, including the Office of Public Works, OPW, the Minister's Department and the local authorities.  It was felt by the majority at the time that, if implemented, it would ensure future severe weather events would be managed at least partially.  During the years most flooding events on the River Shannon have been followed by a report which, in turn, has been followed by little or no action.  I had reservations about the last report, as a River Shannon authority was once again sidelined by the Government of the day.  Having raised the matter of the establishment of a River Shannon authority several times in both the Seanad and the D&aacute;il during the years, I was disgusted at the response from the then Minister which contained the same old standard speak regarding the co-ordination of flood risk management with the OPW as lead agency and embarking on the development of a catchment flood risk assessment and management plan for the River Shannon.  I have heard it all before.<\/p><p>  Were my proposal for a River Shannon authority to be put in place by statute, it would have overall control of river management and development in the River Shannon catchment area from the source of the river to the Shannon Estuary.  Such an authority would have control of putting in place a flood alert system as part of a national system to increase awareness of potential river flooding.  It could alleviate flooding in the Shannon basin in both urban and rural areas by the co-ordination of water levels on the entire river right through the year.  It would be the tool with which the 40-plus State agencies and voluntary bodies would work to co-ordinate their activities.  The onus is on the Government to act, to put in place this River Shannon authority and bring forward real and substantive plans to manage the River Shannon and prevent serious flooding in the Shannon region like that experienced in Athlone, County Westmeath and Clondra, Lanesborough and Clonmacart, County Longford.<\/p><p>  There is a genuine fear, should the proposed abstraction of water from the River Shannon by Irish Water go ahead, that it would have a detrimental effect on tourism in the midlands, as well as on the water supply for group schemes in Longford, Westmeath and other counties.  I do not wish to see the River Inny as a casualty, as it supplies water to one third of counties Longford and Westmeath.  It is important, before any project commences or water is drawn, that water levels be agreed to by such an authority now that the local authorities will not have authority in this regard.  It is important, from the point of view of the public in the midlands, that the drawing of water be measured to the lake or reservoir and a charge be levied on Dublin for every 100,000 Iitres of water drawn.  Such moneys could be used for projects outside Government resources for the benefit of the midlands.  The existence of a River Shannon authority would mean the drawing of water could be monitored and administered from the midlands only.  There is no structure to ensure the co-ordination of the activities of the bodies involved.  A River Shannon authority would provide such a structure.  <\/p><p>  I am not leaving this proposal here and intend to pursue it again, as its delivery is essential.  This is the umpteenth time householders, farmers and business owners in the counties adjoining the River Shannon have faced immeasurable hardship owing to flooding.  I reiterate my belief that were this proposal to be taken on board and implemented, it would minimise flooding and allow the natural function of the river basin to develop.  This is an issue about which I feel strongly and this authority has long been promised.  Its delivery is now essential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100039#MM01000","speaker":"1062"},{"type":"speech","time":1390332600,"counter":589,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy Bannon for raising this matter.  On behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Brian Hayes, who is absent on business, I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the subject of the management structure of the River Shannon.<\/p><p>  At the outset, it would be useful to outline briefly the position regarding the responsibilities and involvement of different agencies to the Shannon.  There are many organisations, national and local, with statutory obligations for the management of the catchment.  For example, Waterways Ireland, WWI, has responsibility for navigation and, as such, will exercise some limited control over water levels in lakes and river stretches.  The Electricity Supply Board, ESB, has statutory responsibility for the control of lake levels arising from water requirements for hydroelectric generation of electricity at Ardnacrusha.  Environmental concerns, fisheries matters and tourism or recreational issues are dealt with by the relevant agencies with responsibilities in these matters.  Local authorities, ten county councils, in the catchment monitor water quality with the assistance of a number of laboratories and have responsibility for its control.<\/p><p>  The Office of Public Works main area of responsibility is for maintenance on those tributaries where capital works have been carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945.  The OPW hydrometric service also gathers water level and discharge information at a number of sites on the river.  Operational control of water flows and levels on the Shannon is therefore primarily the responsibility of both the ESB and WWI.  The ESB has overall statutory responsibility for the management and control of water flows and levels on the Shannon.  WWI also has a direct role and function in managing levels on the river.  A system of management and control is in place involving co-operation by those two bodies under a detailed set of operational protocols and arrangements for the regulation of water levels on the river.  I am advised that it is the bodies' view that this system has worked and is working satisfactorily.  The OPW has no direct operational responsibility for the management of water levels on the Shannon.  The OPW liaises regularly with the ESB and WWI on the operation of the management protocols.<\/p><p>  Given the variety of bodies involved and the disparate functions for which each one is responsible, the formation of a single authority or agency to oversee and co-ordinate management arrangements for the Shannon has been discussed on a number of previous occasions and indeed has been the subject of Private Members' Bills in this House.  The question of creating a single authority for the River Shannon is a major policy issue because of the very diverse range of powers, activities and responsibilities that would be affected.  These include electricity generation, tourism, infrastructure, water quality, water extraction, waste water disposal, flood risk management and a range of environmental responsibilities.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Bannon is aware, the question of the optimum structure or structures to manage the Shannon and its tributaries was the subject of a report in 2002 by a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport.  It is worth noting that the report indicated that a consensus existed among the numerous groups and bodies involved in the management of the Shannon that, while improvements in the management of the Shannon basin were needed, there was no agreement on the establishment of a new organisation as the best means to achieve this end.<\/p><p>  The 2002 report attempted to establish how effectively the present organisational arrangements enabled the Shannon catchment to be managed and what might best be done to improve the process.  Two main merits attributed to the present arrangements for the management of the Shannon catchment were identified.  They were that functional responsibility is clearly fixed in law and each organisation has a precise remit, knows exactly what it is required to do and has clearly established priorities; and communication and collaboration between the various agencies take place using well established mechanisms, such as committees, working groups and partnerships.<\/p><p>  The main weakness identified was a lack of co-ordination, among the organisations involved.  The sub-committee took the view however that it would be undesirable to establish any additional institution unless it could be clearly demonstrated that tangible benefits would flow which could not otherwise be achieved.  It noted the danger that an extra organisation might usurp or duplicate existing institutions or else be just a talking shop.  The report concluded that the establishment of a new organisation would be something that could be recommended only as a last resort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100040#NN00100","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1390332600,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  At the beginning of his presentation he outlined the problem, namely too many bodies with responsibility.  He mentioned the 11 local authorities from Fermanagh down to Clare, the various State agencies and vested interests etc.  We need a single body to co-ordinate those agencies.  I live in the Shannon valley and I see first hand what is happening.  The co-ordination is not working.  No Government or Minister could do anything about the severe weather conditions but the monitoring was not up to an acceptable standard, considering the amount of land that was flooded.  I have raised this time and time again.  It does not cost a lot of money to get the weir gates opened and keep the water levels two feet below the weir wall in Athlone.<\/p><p>  On the maintenance of the Shannon and the waters feeding it, debris such as leaves and branches flows down into the river.  It is important that those blocks are cleared fairly often between Lough Ree and Lough Derg.  There needs to be more local consultation and co-ordination, and flood warning systems and emergency management need to be put in place to alleviate the build-up of silt in the River Shannon.  We should examine using the cutaway bogs in Counties Longford, Westmeath, Offaly and Roscommon to drain off and store water from the Shannon when necessary.<\/p><p>  As I said, a large number of statutory bodies exercise authority over various aspects of the river management and they are all chiefs in their own right.  A number of private organisations are also involved.

I accept that.  The management of flood risk on the Shannon is being actively and comprehensively addressed through the OPW's catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme.  The CFRAM programme is the core strategy for addressing flood risk in the Shannon basin.  The CFRAM study is being conducted by Jacobs Engineering on behalf of the OPW and I am advised that good progress is being made on the project.<\/p><p>  The output of this important project will be an integrated plan involving mapping and modelling of the river system and identifying specific measures to address, in a comprehensive and sustainable way, the significant flood risk factors in the Shannon basin.  This will also include looking at all existing arrangements for the management of water levels and the roles and responsibilities of the main bodies involved, including the levels of co-ordination between them.  The detailed plan to manage flood risk which will be produced under the CFRAM study will consider and make recommendations on any improvements deemed appropriate and workable in the existing arrangements and protocols being operated by those bodies.<\/p><p>  We must wait to see what recommendation emanates from the CFRAM study and plan on the best way forward on the co-ordination of the management arrangements for the Shannon, which is what Deputy Bannon argues for.  In the meantime the main bodies involved will continue to maintain constructive dialogue with all the main stakeholders to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that a balanced and fair approach is taken to the management of water levels in the Shannon and its lakes to meet the needs of navigation, power generation and the welfare of those living directly adjacent to the main river channel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100040#NN00700","speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alternative Energy Projects","time":1390333200,"counter":596,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100041#OO00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1390333200,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me table this matter on the Shannon LNG project.  This proposed project is hugely important for the Ballylongford area of north Kerry, but it also has significant positive and economic implications for the entire south-west region.  The proposed project is for a liquified natural gas terminal on the Shannon Estuary, near Ballylongford and it is to be operated by Shannon LNG, which is owned by Hess Corporation, and Poten &amp;amp; Partners, a 50:50 partnership.<\/p><p>  Shannon LNG secured planning permission originally in 2008 to build on the 287 acre site at Ballylongford and it was to take four years to complete the project, which would be valued at &euro;600 million.  A &euro;400 million power plant was also to be built on the site.  This would be a total investment of &euro;1 billion, with the potential for 650 construction jobs and from 50 to 100 permanent jobs.  This would be a game changer for the region and we are crying out for such a project.<\/p><p>  After years of delay, in 2011 the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, pointed out that Shannon LNG would have to pay &euro;50 million a year towards the use of interconnecting pipes that bring gas between the United Kingdom and Ireland, despite the fact the company has no plans to use that infrastructure.  Bord G&aacute;is is the main user of that infrastructure.  On 11 December, the courts found against the appeal made in the judicial review by Shannon LNG against the tariff of &euro;50 million per annum.  That decision has completely jeopardised the future of the Shannon LNG project.  The company has lost a huge amount of money, losing &euro;51 million last year, which was an increase of &euro;20 million on the previous year's losses.  These losses have occurred before anything at all has been done with the project.  Incidentally, a few days after the judicial decision on Shannon LNG, the sale of Bord G&aacute;is went through.<\/p><p>  Policy should incentivise and enable efficient new entry into the gas market here.  It should not preclude new entry.  If we want to become the best small country in the world to do business, the experience of Shannon LNG is not one we should hold up as a shining example.  The idea of levying on a company &euro;50 million to use infrastructure it does not intend to use is like charging me a levy for the use of the M50 while driving around the Ring of Kerry.  This is not a sensible proposal for a project that will cost &euro;1 billion in investment in the south-west region and provide hundreds of much needed jobs.<\/p><p>  The Minister told me on numerous occasions, both orally in the Chamber and in writing, that it is not his place to give policy direction in individual cases and I accept that.  However, the Minister has within his powers the scope to give general policy direction.  That is where he could show some flexibility.  I ask him to re-examine this issue and find a way to accommodate this huge investment in jobs and the south-west region.  I call on the Minister to propose a plan to deal with this.  Has he a plan for how to bring this project to fruition and how to reward this company for having faith in Ireland?  Has he a plan to ensure that we can hold this project up as an example of how a company can overcome red tape and bureaucracy and do business here?  I would appreciate hearing whether the Minister has a plan for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100041#OO00200","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speech","time":1390333200,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Griffin for giving me the opportunity to address the House on this important issue.  I have already spoken on the issue in discussion with my ministerial colleague, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, and with Deputy Arthur Spring, both of whom have consistently engaged with me on this issue.<\/p><p>  At the outset, let me underline the Government's positive interest in the potential investment by Shannon LNG.  While there is a great deal of misunderstanding of the role of the Minister, I want to express again my personal support to assist Shannon LNG in any way I can to construct an LNG terminal near Ballylongford, County Kerry.  Such a facility, together with the bringing onshore of Corrib gas would provide important security of gas supply for Ireland.  It would also create some badly needed jobs in north Kerry.  However, the recent High Court judgment sets out very succinctly how the decision is not one for the Minister.  Deputy Griffin says the decision of the High Court has jeopardised the project, but it was Shannon LNG which sought the judicial review.<\/p><p>  Not all Deputies will be aware of the High Court ruling of 11 December last in regard to the judicial review taken by Shannon LNG against a CER decision of 29 June 2012 in regard to the regulatory treatment of the BGE interconnectors.  The regulator's decision was a high level decision which set out the principles of a reformed tariffing regime, a regime not scheduled to come into effect before October 2014.  In summary, the court upheld the decision of the regulator in regard to gas reform of the tariffing regime.  The court rejected Shannon LNG's claims that the regulator's decision breached national or EU law, and that the decision of the regulator had effectively amounted to a State aid to Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann as the transmission system owner.  The matter of an appeal of the High Court judgment is, of course, an issue for consideration by the company.<\/p><p>  Decisions on the regulatory treatment of the gas interconnectors and tariffing are statutorily matters for the CER, under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.  Therefore, policy on tariff setting has been settled since 2002 when the responsibility for regulation of the gas market was conferred by law on the regulator.  The regulator, as the independent energy regulator, has a remit to protect energy consumers, ensure security of supply and support competitiveness.  The independence of the regulator in its decision making is expressly provided for in EU legislation as transposed into Irish law.  The CER also has a duty to ensure that new sources of gas for the Irish market do not result in unwarranted increases in the price of gas to business and domestic consumers.<\/p><p>  Tariff reform is being driven by new entry into the system, new sources of gas for the Irish market and the regulator's overriding concern that new sources of gas do not result in unwarranted increases in the price of gas.  Tariffs are one consideration for gas and LNG investors, and investment decisions are commercial matters for developers taking account of a wide range of considerations, including suitability of location, international energy price trends, LNG price trends, LNG capacity issues, proximity to markets and a regulatory regime that has certainty.<\/p><p>  I understand that subject to no appeal by Shannon LNG, the CER will be turning its attention to tariff settlement.  In its decision making, the CER will be informed by EU and Irish law, in particular by developments at EU level in regard to framework guidelines on transmission tariffs that will be binding on all member states via network codes.<\/p><p>  There is a need for all interested parties to have clarity on regulatory certainty at the earliest opportunity in regard to future pricing.  I very much hope for all concerned, including business and residential consumers, that the constructive input of stakeholders will facilitate timely decision making by the CER.  Shannon LNG has until 31 January to lodge an appeal and until then, technically, the  CER, Department and Shannon LNG are still involved in a live court case.  We need to be sensitive to this while they are still reflecting on whether or not to appeal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100041#OO00300","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1390333200,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

I am in a very unusual position, not because of any action of the Department or any agent of the State or the Government but as a result of the decision by the company to seek a judicial review.  A distinguished, now retired, High Court judge weighed up all of the issues which the Deputy advanced.  I entirely understand the Deputy's passion in the matter.  I have had discussions with local representatives in County Kerry, including the Minister, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, and Deputy Arthur Spring, and understand the compelling arguments about employment and the desirability of such a facility being built in north Kerry, but a regulatory framework is in place and part of the responsibility of the regulator is to ensure neither consumer nor business is subjected to higher prices as a result of any one operator getting a free ride on the system.

It is not the best use of my time, that of the Minister of State or the Department to have to draft a memo when such matters could be readily dealt with by furnishing me, an elected representative, with a half-decent answer a little longer than one sentence.  I have come to the national Parliament to raise what is effectively a local issue.  I would not have to engage in a 12 minute debate in the national Parliament on an issue affecting a housing estate beside a hospital with regard to a helicopter landing site if I had been furnished with a half-decent answer by the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, or the Department, but that is where we are.<\/p><p>  Last January Beaumont Hospital made a statement on helicopter landings adjacent to it.  It stated the football pitch at Our Lady of Mercy College, Beaumont would be used as a landing pad for the air ambulance service and that the initiative would be trialled over the following 12 months.  It stated approximately six landings per year were envisaged, with no increase in the number of patients transferring to the hospital.  It also stated the national aeromedical co-ordination centre, NACC, would manage the activation of the helipad and that the control centre dispatched Air Corps and Irish Coast Guard helicopters in support of the ambulance service for emergency calls.<\/p><p>  A reply to a parliamentary question from a Government colleague of mine which was more complete than the one with which I was furnished stated the NACC dispatched Air Corps and Irish Coast Guard helicopters for emergencies, as well as for planned and routine aeromedical transfers, which is completely different from the response given by the area manager of Dublin City Council in July 2013 who, in answer to a question tabled by Councillor Andrew Montague, stated the national ambulance service had admitted to two test runs using the grounds earlier this year and that, having proved suitable, the grounds had been used on four occasions since.  The expected six uses of the service had happened by halfway through the year.  It was confirmed that transfer by helicopter was less desirable than transfer by road and that the helicopter service was used only in life and death situations, which is completely different from what was stated previously about planned and routine transfers.  It was also stated the service representatives had accepted planning permission had not been granted to use the sports ground as a helicopter landing pad and would examine their options in this regard.  Mr. Liam Duffy, the chief executive of Beaumont Hospital, stated in a communication with a resident that he had raised concerns about safety standards for the helipad.  There are various points of views from various agencies, including Dublin City Council, the management of the hospital and those running the service.<\/p><p>  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health to try to obtain clarification on how long it would be used, whether it would be used forever and whether the hospital had a plan for a permanent helipad.  Nobody wants a situation where helicopters cannot be used, but the residents are asking a reasonable question as to how long it is envisaged helicopters will land in their estate.  I received a one liner stating it was a HSE problem.  The Minister of State knows as well as I do that Deputies can wait months for an answer from the HSE.  Part of my frustration is due not only to the fact that the residents are trying to find out reasonable information, but also to the fact that have I had to come to the national Parliament to raise an issue about a small housing estate beside a hospital because the Minister for Health or the Department could not be bothered to give me more than one line.

Aeromedical assistance is provided to the HSE by both the Irish Air Corps and the Coast Guard who aim to ensure the highest level of safety in all aeromedical missions.  Both the Air Corps and the Irish Coast Guard require predetermined landing zones.  These are suitable landing areas that have been surveyed, and are deemed suitable for safe aeromedical operations.<\/p><p>  The predetermined landing zone in Beaumont Hospital is inoperable due to ongoing construction works.  In the time available, it was not been possible to identify other suitable landing sites within the hospital complex and, therefore, an alternative site outside, but close to the hospital was required.  The national ambulance service aeromedical liaison officer scoped the area and identified the football pitch of Our Lady of Mercy school as a suitable temporary landing site.  The board of management of the school granted permission for the use of the site and protocols were agreed and put in place to ensure the safe operation of the landing zone.  I am informed that the site is used only in daylight hours and has been surveyed by both the Air Corps and the Coast Guard and found to be safe and appropriate.  A secure and locked area is provided, which ensures no unauthorised entry can be gained during an aeromedical mission.  The protocol also requires that Santry Garda station be informed of an aircraft arrival.<\/p><p>  I have no doubt the House will accept it is vitally important, as the Deputy has acknowledged, that acutely ill patients receive all necessary medical care and are transferred as rapidly as possible to an appropriate facility.  The availability of emergency helicopter transfers has been a major step forward for patients.  However, I stress that the use of helicopters is not routine.  Helicopter transfers are deployed only in exceptional circumstances.  I am informed that the Beaumont Woods site has been utilised on 17 occasions in the past year.<\/p><p>  While there may be local concern regarding the use of the site in Beaumont Woods, the provision of this particular predetermined landing zone has significantly decreased journey time of seriously ill or injured patients to appropriate care.  The current alternative site is Dublin Airport, but that would add 30 minutes to the patient's onwards journey to hospital and, in time-critical patients, this additional time might be crucial to their prognosis.<\/p><p>  As I have indicated, this is a temporary arrangement which seeks to ensure the fastest access to treatment for acutely ill patients.  Ideally, the helicopter ambulance should land on the hospital complex but, unfortunately, this is not feasible during current construction works.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the Deputy's comments.  I was not aware of the history of his inquiries.  I agree with him that it is appropriate that he or any Deputy should have an answer given to him or her expeditiously and clearly.  I cannot account for conflicts in the different answers given to the Deputy but if he requires further information on foot of the reply I have given, I will ensure that is established for him expeditiously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100043#QQ00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1390334400,"counter":606,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister of State's reply but I am sure he will agree that if I had been provided with it in response to a parliamentary question, I would not be in the House now wasting everybody's time.  This is a reasonably detailed reply.  It indicates that the helipad has been used on 17 occasions in the past year, although it was supposed to have been used only six times.  However, that is information about which I was not aware previously and I also have an indication as to the reasons for that.  If I had received this in reply to my parliamentary question, I would have been able to work on the issue, talk to residents and find out from HSE management when the helipad on this housing estate will no longer be in use and when the helipad in the hospital complex will be used again.<\/p><p>  A one-line reply to parliamentary questions such as the one I tabled shows zero respect for Members and for the people whom we are trying to represent.  We are not trying to annoy anybody.  I asked a genuine question about an important service that the people of the country need, that the hospital deems important and about which residents have a concern.  If I had been furnished with this detailed answer previously, I would not have had to raise it as a Topical Issue.  I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle affording me the opportunity to do so and I appreciate the sentiments expressed by the Minister of State.

For the considerable time I have known her, Margaretta D'Arcy has been involved in anti-war campaigns and, in particular in recent years, the campaign at Shannon Airport.

The case she conducted as a citizen committed to defending Irish neutrality is supported by the overwhelming majority of citizens and, for the service that this women has selflessly given, she finds herself incarcerated, at almost 80 years of age, in Limerick Prison.  I would like the Minister's opinion on this national embarrassment.  Letters were published in today's edition of The Guardian calling on the British Government to intervene and to bring some rationality to this scenario.  I salute the gesture of Mrs. Higgins, the President's wife, who visited her former colleague.  That gesture should be reciprocated by the Minister and he might make a trip to the prison.<\/p><p>  Towards the end of last year, the United Nations Committee Against Torture asked the Government what it was doing about its use of Shannon Airport.  People like Margaretta D'Arcy have led the fight.  Every month we come to the House and we ask the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, about the countless number of US aircraft that pass through Shannon Airport.<\/p><p>They are supposed to be unarmed, not carrying explosives or ammunition and not engaged with intelligence gathering but even when aircraft display cannons they are not inspected and are granted permission to continue.<\/p><p> How can the Minister allow a committed peace activist to lie in jail without a single garda being sent to investigate US military aircraft travelling through this State?  It is a national scandal.  The Minister should be ashamed of himself.

This has caused a near revolt.  Everybody acknowledges that the actions of the Ukrainian Government, following on from the actions of President Putin's Government in Russia, are actions of a repressive and undemocratic regime and that we must uphold the right to peaceful protest.  In this country, however, a 79 year old writer - like the Minister - and activist of conscience who engaged in an act of civil disobedience is languishing in prison even though she is ill with Parkinson's disease.  Is that not appalling?  Whatever one may think of her views, Margaretta D'Arcy is acting on her conscience on an issue with which a huge number - probably the majority - of people in this country are in agreement, namely, that the airports of a neutral country should not be used to facilitate the CIA programme of illegal torture and kidnap or the transport of military equipment and troops used in the bloody wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  She has a right to protest against that and she should not be imprisoned for doing so.  I appeal to the Minister to intervene on humanitarian grounds to direct that Margaretta D'Arcy be released.  True to herself, Margaretta has asked us not to worry so much about her but to raise the issue.  For the umpteenth time, I ask the Minister to investigate the use of Shannon Airport in the illegal kidnap and torture programme and for the purpose of conducting war.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100044#RR00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1390335000,"counter":613,"content":"<p>Since 2001 we have facilitated the transport through Shannon of more than 2.5 million US and NATO troops and their munitions and supplies, primarily to engage in illegal wars based on fabricated evidence which wreaked havoc on societies in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Hardly a day goes by in which we do not read about deaths in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  We were told these countries were being invaded in order to bring democracy and nation building to them but the bombs dropped on Kabul, Baghdad and Tripoli did not build much.  They did not replace what they destroyed and they did not replace the people they killed.  Sadly, we have played a part in bringing this about.  Margaretta D'Arcy has been put in jail at the age of 79 years for highlighting that war is senseless and stupid.  Wars allow a small elite to make a crazy amount of money.  The permanent members of the UN Security Council have engaged in a colonial carve-up in order to exploit the planet.  This woman is a hero.  She has done what this State has lacked the courage to do and undertook great risk to highlight the shameful nature of our efforts to facilitate this destruction and murder.

The House will appreciate that the courts are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in their functions.   They are independent of Members of this House and of the Government.  In the context of Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's contribution, I note that when his colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, was asked about this issue and whether the individual concerned should be released, he stated that it was a matter for the Judiciary and that no politician should interfere in such decisions.<\/p><p>  What I can say is that the person referred to was convicted at Ennis District Court last month of endangering lives by entering on the runway at Shannon airport in late 2012.  She was sentenced to three months imprisonment which was suspended for two years on condition that she enter into a good behaviour bond and stay away from entering any part of Shannon Airport which is not authorised to the public.  Having failed to enter the bond, the sentence was activated by the court and the person was committed to Limerick Prison to serve that sentence.  As I have already stated, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the decision of the court whose function it is to apply the law and to arrive at a decision having heard all the evidence in a case.  I would add, however, that it is a matter of regret that the person in question did not avail of the opportunity afforded by the judge to enter into a bond and thus avoid the necessity to serve the sentence which the court felt it appropriate to impose.<\/p><p>  While I am not going to comment on the specifics of this case, I have to say that encroaching on an airport runway is a very serious and very dangerous act.  It potentially places the lives of those who encroach at risk.  It also puts the lives of garda&iacute;, airport workers and airplane passengers in danger.  It is a highly irresponsible act and cannot be justified by adherence to any cause.  This is not a question of someone being deprived of a right to protest.  I respect the right of individuals to protest but I expect those people to respect the rights of others.<\/p><p>  There has been ongoing protest action around Shannon Airport for a number of years.  These protests have resulted in the expenditure of significant additional moneys by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in policing the protest around the airport.  Between 2004 to the end of 2013, additional Garda costs amounting to over &euro;17.3 million have been incurred in connection with the security operation at Shannon Airport.  This is money which could have more usefully been used for normal policing work and for the provision of additional Garda equipment but because of the actions of a very small minority in this country, these valuable resources have to be expended on maintaining law and order, ensuring the effective operation of the airport and the safety of passengers, pilots and other airline staff.  I remind the House that Shannon Airport is a designated emergency landing airport and there are regular emergency diversions to it.  <\/p><p>  As regards her imprisonment, I have been informed by the Irish Prison Service that the individual concerned is currently detained in the female section of Limerick Prison and has access to the full range of services there.  It has been reported in the media that she suffers from a number of medical conditions. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on this but I assure the House that she has full access to the range of medical services available in Limerick Prison.  She was medically assessed on committal to prison and seen by the prison doctor the next day.  She has access to a 24-hour nursing service in prison and access to a doctor daily if requested or on referral by the nursing staff.  In addition, any hospital appointment she may have scheduled will be facilitated by prison management.<\/p><p>  I have been informed by the Irish Prison Service that the duty governor explained the mechanism of temporary release to the individual concerned on her committal to prison.  I understand that she has not applied for temporary release and it would not be right for me to make any further comment on that.  I should also say, however, that it is my understanding that she remains unwilling to enter into a good behaviour bond.  I am sure the House will agree with me in saying that the rule of law must prevail even where it creates difficult circumstances.  Nobody is above the rule of law irrespective of their age.  I ask those who call for the individual's immediate release whether this individual by future action on her own or accompanied by others again be permitted again to encroach on a runway.<\/p><p>Is she to be ignored and allowed to do so repetitively?  If such further encroachment takes place with a resultant loss of life, would any of the Deputies who spoke take responsibility for such an eventuality?  Are they prepared to give a free pass to those who so behave and, by so doing, place lives at risk and the law in disrepute?<\/p><p> I do not believe the individual concerned should be presented in this context in heroic guise or that it is in the public interest that she be so depicted.  A court decision has been delivered.  I am advised it was not appealed.  The signing of the bond to keep the peace would result in the individual's immediate release.  I am sure that the House will appreciate that, in the circumstances of this particular case, the resolution of the matter rests entirely with the individual concerned.  It is something that I expect a majority of people outside this House would readily understand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100044#RR00400","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390335600,"counter":616,"content":"<p>I will be brief because I am aware of the time constraints.<\/p><p>  I am aware of the constitutional separation between the Judiciary and the Executive and this House, but I have a straight question for the Minister.

Her stance is a stance against the greater problem of the slaughter in Iraq and the continued use of Shannon Airport to facilitate drones and other military aircraft.  It is quite an insult to people in this State for the Minister to talk about enforcing the rule of law, saying it must be upheld in this case, and talk about this almost-80-year-old woman being a danger to lives while there is no such talk from him about the law being upheld in investigating US military aircraft landing in Ireland and no such talk about the endangering of lives that results.  There has been no report to the United Nations Committee Against Torture, which asked the Minister to update it on the investigations he has carried out to ensure that our airports are not being used for purposes for which they should not be, because he has not carried out such investigations, yet the Minister has the neck to condemn this woman.

As most Members of the House will already be aware, this Bill seeks to amend the Charities Act of 2009 by ensuring that all the provisions of that Act are fully enacted by 31 May 2014.  It also seeks to add the &quot;advancement of human rights&quot; on to the definitions of charities eligible to be registered, as outlined in the charitable purpose section or section 3 of the 2009 Act.<\/p><p>  I want to take Members briefly through the purpose of the 2009 Act before going on to discuss our Bill.  The original purpose of the Charities Act 2009 was to reform the law relating to charities.  It aimed to ensure greater accountability, offer protection against abuse of charitable status and fraud and also to enhance public trust and confidence in charities and increase transparency in the sector.  The Act provided for the creation of a new charities regulation infrastructure, a charities regulator, a register of charities, consultative panels to advise the regulator and a charity appeals tribunal, and the Act laid down, for the first time in primary legislation, a definition of charitable purposes.  The Act meant that organisations, which wished to present themselves to the public as charities, or fundraise directly from the public for charitable purposes, will have to seek and secure inclusion in the new register of charities.<\/p><p>  What we in Sinn F&eacute;in have produced is a short and simple Bill which is of the utmost importance not only to charities but also to the public in what has escalated to a crisis following the Central Remedial Clinic scandal.  Our Bill seeks to ensure that the 2009 Act is fully implemented once and for all.<\/p><p>  Since the foundation of this State charities have been unregulated.  The effect of this is now doing untold damage both to the charities but, more important, to all of the vulnerable people who depend on them.  In 2009 Fianna F&aacute;il published a shiny piece of legislation claiming to regulate the charities sector but never implemented it, thereby failing the charities and public confidence in them.  Labour and Fine Gael have had almost three years to rectify this by fully enacting all the provisions contained within but instead they rested on their laurels and dragged their feet, allowing scandal after scandal until it got so big that they had no option but to agree to the establishment of a regulatory authority.  I thank the Minister for finally listening to the charities sector and Sinn F&eacute;in on this one.  Unfortunately the failure to act on this issue over the years is what has created the scandal we are now witnessing.  The next logical step is to support our Bill tomorrow night and ensure that the entire infrastructure arising from the original Charities Act is fully implemented by May of this year.<\/p><p>  Despite the fact that it is welcome and certainly a step in the right direction, the establishment of a charities regulatory authority by Easter in isolation is simply not enough.  We need all provisions of this Bill enacted and we need it done as soon as is possible.  The most vulnerable in our society are already suffering massively due to the deeply unfair and unjust cutbacks implemented by this Government.  The failure to fund many schemes, on which many of our most marginalised people depended, has meant that more and more people were relying on charities for their very survival.  Economically and in terms of the protection of people's rights, the charities sector has often had to step in and do what the Government has ceased to do.  <\/p><p>  The scandals which have erupted have, understandably, had a hugely negative effect on public confidence which has led to a dip in donations to charities.  The recent revelations of generous salary top-up payments and gold-plated pensions paid from charitable funds at the Oireachtas Committee of Public Accounts hearings are proof that the sector needs regulation urgently.  In a survey by <i>The Wheel<\/i> it was found that one in five charities around the country was facing a 10% dip in their donations even before the scandalous revelations about the Central Remedial Clinic this week.  Of 150 charities surveyed, it found that 53% have suffered a drop in fundraising, 97% believe public trust has been lost and 54% believe the damage may be permanent.  The survey also revealed that one in four has received concerned telephone calls or correspondence from donors or members of the public and 14% of volunteers, fundraisers or staff have been subjected to negative or abusive comments.  It was also widely agreed by more than 80% that the Government had not done enough to implement the Charities Act 2009.<\/p><p>  The second aspect of our Bill relates to the inclusion of the &quot;advancement of human rights&quot; in the definitions under &quot;charitable purpose&quot; in section 3 of the Charities Bill 2009.  This should never have been left out in 2009 and is seen as a serious omission.  In other jurisdictions it is widely accepted that the advancement of human rights is a charitable purpose.  There is also a knock-on effect in the failure to include this; for example, the principle of equivalence, which lies behind the Good Friday Agreement and which has directed much of the legislation in this area, is undermined as a result of this omission because as most of Members will know, human rights advocacy is afforded charitable status in the North.<\/p><p>  Despite the fact that existing human rights non-governmental organisations are protected, organisations established in the future to protect human rights will not be afforded charitable status. In addition, existing NGOs will encounter greater difficulties in raising funds because they will not meet the criteria set out in the legislation.  The omission of human rights as a charitable purpose is a systematic and concerted assault on the human rights architecture of this State.  <\/p><p>  The Minister will bring in a Bill to amalgamate the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority later this year.  There have been concerns around the significant cuts to funding, particularly in terms of the Equality Authority where the chairman stood down because of the huge cuts and the inability  of the authority to do its job.  This State is internationally respected in terms of our human rights track record in developing countries.  We are a world leader in terms of our contribution <i>per capita <\/i>to overseas development and in respect of what we donate to charities.  That is something we in Ireland do well.  It was a serious mistake not to establish the regulatory authority and also not to implement all of the provisions of the Act.  We have an opportunity to debate this matter tonight and tomorrow night.  The Minister has now taken an measure in this area and he could support this Private Members' Bill.<\/p><p>We have not had any indication of the Government's position, but I hope it can support this Bill and work with us and we can work with it to make it happen.  All of us, collectively, need to send a message from the House about the issue that has arisen at the Committee of Public Accounts and which has been handled expertly.  The committee's hearings have shone a light of despair on a dark issue.  People contribute to charities and Ireland is one of the leading countries in terms of what we contribute <i>per capita<\/i>from the Exchequer or in people contributing to charities.  For the people to see stories emerge in the way they have is galling when added to all of the other stories on high pay.  We need to be seen to stand together and, collectively, restore confidence in the sector to make sure it has what it needs.<\/p><p> It is clear to Sinn F&eacute;in that if we had not put this issue on the agenda, we might have been waiting until the end of the year.  When asked about this last Friday morning, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, said it would be taken in October or November.  He knows how Bills scheduled for late this year may be taken next year.  The first step is welcome, but let us go the whole way and have the entire Act implemented.  We should work together to restore confidence in the sector.  I hope for all-party support tomorrow night and that we can work together to make it clear to the public that what it has seen at the CRC will never happen again in the charity sector.  The money the public contributes should, in the main, go to those they hope to benefit.  The concern about the burden of administration and managerial costs should be dealt with once and for all.  I hope we can work together to secure a pass tomorrow night rather than a &quot;No&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100046#TT01400","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390336800,"counter":661,"content":"<p>Charity should not be necessary in a just society, but it is vital in this society, with a Government imposing austerity on working people who can hardly take anymore.  The message going out from the Government, more often than not, to people in trouble because of illness, a disability, poverty or discrimination is that they are on their own.  However, they are not alone because there is a vast body of people in this country who are there to help, not for profit or personal gain but because they are selfless in their efforts for the common good.<\/p><p>  We are a generous people.  Anyone who has ever stood to watch a marathon or watched the women&rsquo;s mini-marathon on the streets of Dublin during the June bank holiday weekend has seen a passing parade of generosity and a willingness to help our fellow human beings.  Every t-shirt will bear the slogan or logo of groups, foundations, trusts and societies from north, south, east and west which step into the breach where State social services fall down or to add to existing services where a need arises for which the State is not yet providing.  Every disease, condition, mental and physical disability, syndrome or injury is represented.  The runners have not only trained to perform the physical feat, but they have organised fundraising events and pestered their workmates, family members and friends to support their cause and help the people who need it.<\/p><p>  We have an international reputation for our generosity.  When Bob Geldof organised Live Aid in 1985, despite the State being in economic recession, the Irish people donated more <i>per capita<\/i> than any other nation to the &pound;40 million total by giving a staggering &pound;7 million.  Our reputation for generosity is something of which we should be proud and which we should protect by making sure money donated by people, usually out of the goodness of their hearts, is not siphoned off for a purpose other than the cause for which it was intended.  The Government which has made the need for charity in society more urgent owes them that at least.  The Bill attempts to protect the generosity of citizens by putting in place the proper safeguards for their selfless contribution.  It is designed for two purposes: first, to enact the provisions of the 2009 Act.  After the CRC scandals exposed last week, there was never a more opportune time to enact a Bill to ensure charities would carry out their financial dealings in a proper, transparent and administratively correct manner and that they would be given guidelines by which to do so.<\/p><p>  The establishment of a modern regulatory framework for the first time, the charities regulatory authority, is as overdue as it is necessary.  The ability to register a charity and have a template for its regulation will be a great relief to those trying to self-regulate the raising and charitable distribution of money collected from citizens.  It will give a sound foundation to the generosity of the people and help to remove the doubts which have crept into people&rsquo;s hearts in the past few weeks when they are approached to donate money, buy a ticket or contribute to a fundraising event.  It will also provide protection for the very special kind of people who devote much of their spare time to raising money for charities throughout the State and who deserve to have their work regulated and certified as honest and scrupulous, which it is in most cases.<\/p><p>  The Bill would provide for enactment to take place not later than the end of May.  Why would we want to delay it any longer?  It is already overdue.  I particularly welcome the provision for the inclusion of the advancement human rights as a charitable function.  It is a logical progression for anyone involved in fundraising for a cause to eventually ask himself or herself and then society why he or she should be out shaking buckets and selling tickets in order that people can have their human right to live as independently, comfortably and securely as is possible, despite physical, mental, financial or social difficulties.  The best charities become a voice for those they try to help.  It is a logical progression for those who care.  The Bill would provide a framework that was a necessity up to last week, but after last week, it is vital.  I urge Members of the House to support Sinn F&eacute;in's Bill and send a message to members of the public who have been badly shaken, disappointed and let down by the actions of a few that have come to light in the past few weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100047#UU00200","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1390336800,"counter":662,"content":"<p>Some 12 months ago the Minister visited Cork and, for our sins, we put on football boots and socks and ended up playing a charity match for a worthwhile organisation that was just getting off the ground.  It was trying to help families who had lost loved ones through suicide.  That effort is being replicated across the State and there is not one Deputy or member of the public who has not contributed to a charity of some sort.  Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn put it well when he said that, by our nature, Irish people are charitable.  We do so without a grumble and because we recognise, despite any hardship we are going through, that there are others who are worse off and in greater need of finance, support or resources to help them to have a better quality of life.<\/p><p>  There is no Deputy or member of the public who has not been touched by a charitable organisation in a personal capacity.  When my father was dying of motor neurone disease, the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association provided help and support for our family that was second to none.  Organisations cannot provide that service or show compassion for families such as mine without the Minister, Deputies and members of the public dipping their hands into their pockets and handing over hard-earned cash.<\/p><p>The recent scandal involving the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, has rocked the confidence of many people.  I am very confident that this will not stop people from giving to charities, nor should it, as we cannot allow the greed of the few inflict on the very many in need of those charities.  That would be unfair, as people in society will recognise as they continue to contribute to charities.  Nevertheless, damage has been doubtlessly been done to confidence in some areas, as there cannot be a scandal like this without people's confidence being affected.<\/p><p> There is probably a sense of envy among Opposition Deputies when they see a Minister like Deputy Shatter who has the power to enact the very measures needed to restore public confidence to a sector which not only relies on but thrives on public confidence.  We welcome the Minister's announcement to set up the regulatory authority by Easter but measures must go beyond that, and the Minister seems to recognise that.  I followed some of the speeches given by the Minister since taking office at the Department of Justice and Equality, and in 2011 he stated that although there was some regulation with regard to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, taking in the charitable sector, without doubt the ideal solution was to enact all aspects of the Charities Act 2009; that must happen now.<\/p><p> At the beginning of 2014, there is probably more pressure on charities to provide services as we are coming off the back of an economic recession.  I will not play politics with the issue but because of the economic position we were in, there have been cutbacks in areas such as community groups, support services and all spheres of Irish society.  As a result, more people have been forced to turn to charities.  In my constituency and probably in others, local welfare officers are now directing people wishing to avail of Department of Social Protection services to organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  The Minister has it within his gift - he can do it at the stroke of a pen - to restore public confidence in the area, which is needed now more than ever.  I hope he will support Deputy Mac Lochlainn's Bill and that we can work together to restore public confidence and ensure that those people who rely on charities can get the support they need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100047#UU00300","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390337400,"counter":664,"content":"<p>As other Deputies have already stated, the CRC scandal has done untold damage to the fund-raising potential of charities across the country.  Instead of delivering, for example, 14 full-time physiotherapists or occupational therapists, as would have been intended by those who made donations to the CRC in its Christmas bear appeal, half of the money was spent on a golden handshake.  It is a scandal that people put their hands in their pockets in straitened times with an understanding of where the money is supposed to go only to be left with a big black hole in the funding and financing of the CRC because it paid out such a handsome sum to the man at the top.<\/p><p>  The need for support for charities, as noted by Deputies, has risen sharply in recent years, and they are needed more now than ever.  Some of this need comes because of budget cuts from this and the previous Government but it is also due to underspending on services etc.  In 2011 alone there was a 35%  increase in demand for the services of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, and that rate has increased again in 2012 and 2013.  That is the scale of the crisis arising from needs in our society.  The Simon Community saw similar increases in the numbers of people seeking its service, and many other charities helping people in dire need have seen increased service demands as people have grown poorer because of the recession.  Services that they relied on have not been able to deliver for such people.<\/p><p>  The unravelling scandal means that many people who were previously very generous and donated to people less well off than themselves are no longer doing so.  In some cases these people had very little but the Irish have always been generous, and we are renowned throughout the world because of that.  I hope this scandal will not prevent people from being generous, and I appeal to the Irish public to continue giving at the same rate to charities.  We have the responsibility to deal with the legacy of the CRC and ensure that no other charity will end up in the same position.  Representatives of other charities will come before the Committee of Public Accounts and I hope they have put their houses in order.  We should be able to say at the end of this period that charities in Ireland are properly regulated and the funding and donations goes where they are meant to.<\/p><p>  The second part of the legislation before us deals with an omission from the previous Government in a Charities Act, which we raised at the time.  This relates to organisations advocating for human rights which were excluded in being recognised as a charity.  The matter should be addressed, which is why it is contained in this very short piece of legislation.  I remind the House of what the now Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, stated at the time about the same issue.  He indicated:<blockquote>It is still beyond me why he [a Minister of State, former Deputy John Curran] is not prepared to accept a wording that provides specifically for the promotion and advancement of human and civil rights.  Any of the areas that are covered do not cover the entire gamut of civil and human rights.  These are organisations specifically dedicated to human rights.  Amnesty International is one such organisation but its remit is not covered by the terms of this legislation [the Charities Act 2009].<\/blockquote>He continued to say that the Minister of State at the time, former Deputy John Curran, had indicated that the <i>status quo<\/i> would not be interfered with but that the wording that clearly underpins our commitment as a country to the promotion and advancement of human and civil rights should be allowed.  During the debate I also wholeheartedly agreed with the then Deputy representing Galway West, Michael D. Higgins, when he stated:<blockquote>One could also argue that the last decade - the last five years in particular - have seen a retreat from the rights perspective internationally, so the amendment would be a very good thing.  The most progressive NGOs are expressing their interest and wish to operate on a rights basis.<\/blockquote>He also stated that the acceptance of the amendment at the time would save time in future in amending or reviewing the legislation.  He argued that the Minister of State at the time should have considered how the accommodation of five or six words would represent so many possibilities for the people interested in the area.  We are appealing to the Minister in this respect today, and I said the same thing in my contribution at the time.  As Deputy Mac Lochlainn indicated, the omission was contrary to the Good Friday Agreement and the equivalence principles of human rights advocacy, as such advocacy is recognised and afforded charitable status in the North.  I appeal to the Minister to give an indication that this will be accepted.  Not only should all the sections of the Charities Act be enacted but they should be acted upon as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100048#VV00200","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1390337400,"counter":665,"content":"<p>The real victims in the recent controversy about pay, bonuses and pensions in the Central Remedial Clinic have been the clients and families.  Nobody could fail to be moved by many of the families on our television screens on recent nights, with tears being shed in frustration and fear because of the greed of others.  The work done by the staff in the CRC is second to none and I take this opportunity to compliment them on the sterling work they continue to do.  The ripples of the recent revelations have been felt right across Irish society, and nowhere have they been felt more strongly than in the charities and community sector.  Years of good work is under threat of being undermined and discredited by the few at the top who are more interested in lining their own pockets than providing a service to those who need it most.<\/p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's contribution tonight is positive.<\/p><p>Our proposed legislation was written in consultation with the sector.  It calls on the Government to reintroduce the advancement of human rights, as argued for by the sector but excluded by the Fianna F&aacute;il Government in the 2009 Act.  It also calls on the Government to specify the date for the full enactment of all the provisions of the 2009 Act as no later than 31 May 2014.  The sector deserves to be supported and protected.  That is what our legislation aims to do.<\/p><p> Right across the State, charities continue to provide services that the private and public sectors cannot or will not provide.  I note great work being done daily in my constituency in Cork.  I refer to groups such as Cumann na Daoine, For&oacute;ige and Youghal 4 All.  As with many towns, Youghal has a healthy number of vibrant organisations providing a wide range of services, from those of Chatterbox, which promotes dance and music among young people, to those of High Spirits, a group that works with young people in the production of music, theatre and dance.  Youghal Musical Society stages productions for all ages.<\/p><p> Groups with charitable status extend from the very local to the national and international.  A household name is Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann.  From experience, I know of the great work it has been doing, particularly in Youghal, over the past 20 years.  The organisation promotes Irish music and culture in every town across the island.  It is also organised internationally.  Its members are true ambassadors of Ireland and all that is positive in our culture.<\/p><p> I compliment some of the groups in Dublin that are tackling the causes and consequences of the drugs crisis.  One such group is Recovery through Arts, Drama and Education, RADE, a group based in the south inner city.  Its aim is to engage drug users with the arts and therapeutic supports and provide a platform their artistic expression.  It has done this through the media of arts, film and theatre.  Mick Egan and his dedicated team have provided an excellent service since 2004.  Addiction Response Crumlin, ARC, provides a wide range of services from family support services to the Ciall project, which provides a safe, confidential and accessible service to the under-18s.  ARC provides rehabilitation, education and aftercare services to families living with addiction.<\/p><p> Many athletes who competed for Ireland on the international stage in the Paralympic Games benefited directly from the terrific service provided by the Central Remedial Clinic.  With regard to the homeless leagues, I had the privilege of playing soccer with those concerned here last year.  We held a reception in Leinster House for those who played in the Homeless World Cup.<\/p><p> I mention these services not to single out any one project or service but as part of an attempt to highlight the rich and varied work provided by the sector.  It needs our support, both politically and financially.  It also requires that legislators legislate to protect those working in the sector and those they serve.  Charity should not be turned into a political football.  The challenge for us here as Members is to work together to provide a solution.  The Bill deserves Members' support.  The charities and those who benefit from them deserve no less.  I encourage all Members in the House to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100048#VV00300","speaker":"981","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390338000,"counter":667,"content":"<p>When people think of charity, they generally think of those things over and above basic necessities that make life and living a bit better for the poor, disabled and disadvantaged.  Many charitable groups fulfil a role in this regard but in the current economic climate charity is a necessity for many.  It was said that over the Christmas period, probably every Member helped in, organised or supported the raising of funds for various charities, be they local, national or international.  I am sure that each of us met many constituents who simply could not survive, let alone live a life with dignity, without the helping and willing hands of some charity or other.  Unfortunately, many rely on charity, sometimes just to make ends meet.  This is the context in which any discussion on charity must take place.<\/p><p>  How can we, as legislators, regulate charities so they can provide the greatest support possible for the people they aim to serve?  As recent events have shown, there is clearly a need for this regulation to be stringent, transparent and fair.  There can be no doubt as to the sincerity of the vast majority who work with the various charities in the country.  Those involved in charities are among the most selfless and giving of people.  They often do most of their work unnoticed by the general public, and it is rare that they get honoured in the public sphere.  This, however, does not mean that their work should be unappreciated.  The recent scandals surrounding the CRC should not detract from the considerable good work done by so many of those working with various charities.<\/p><p>  As Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on communications, energy and natural resources, I am keenly aware of some of the sterling work carried out by various charities involved in tackling fuel poverty.  It is striking to note that a quarter of what the Society of St. Vincent de Paul gives to families is spent on fuel and energy for homes.  Despite enduring relatively mild winters, Ireland and the United Kingdom have the highest rates of seasonal mortality in northern Europe.  It has been shown that such mortality rates result in no small part from inadequately protected, thermally inefficient housing stock.  An increased rate of morbidity and a higher incidence of various cardiovascular and respiratory diseases have been associated with chronic cold exposure within the home through living in fuel-poor conditions.<\/p><p>  The charity ALONE was founded by Dublin fireman Willie Birmingham in 1977 after he came across an elderly man who had literally frozen to death in a flat in Dublin city.  The charity still works today to attempt to alleviate the suffering of many elderly people.  Poorer and more vulnerable householders typically live in worse quality housing and have the fewest resources and opportunities to invest in improving their houses' efficiency and heating technology.  That unnecessary deaths recur year on year should be a national scandal.  The connotation is that the very lives of those affected matter less than they might among the not so old and not so cold.  I acknowledge that the Government has invested in insulating homes but it is not enough or happening fast enough.<\/p><p>  We have all been aware over recent weeks of the scandalous abuse of taxpayers' and generous citizens' moneys donated to a small number of charities.  It is obscene to see what some of the senior executives of some charitable organisations receive by way of annual salary and expenses.  It is questionably criminal as well as obscene that the money of hard-pressed citizens, given in good faith and through generosity to help improve the lives of people with disabilities, should be diverted to slush funds to provide pension benefits that most people could only dream of to those same executives.  This rumpus arose only in the past month but I have no doubt that these unethical practices have been occurring for years.<\/p><p>  I have serious concerns that these practices are more widespread than currently reported.  What we are seeing may have been regarded as fair game and the norm by certain people who were put, by the political system, into positions that they could exploit for their own gain.  Was this their pay-off for loyal political party membership?  Corruption works best from the top down.<\/p><p>  We must consider the role of auditors and accountants in all of this.  As with the banking meltdown, auditors and accountants either noticed nothing wrong or noticed something but said nothing in the belief that it was an acceptable part of the prevailing culture.<\/p><p>There is something seriously wrong there.  What is important now is to protect those depending on charity while ensuring the correct legislation, policies, practices, culture and checks are in place to minimise the opportunity for corrupt practices.  There are some who will try to use this scandal to blacken the reputation and work of all charities and of all those people working for the agencies where unacceptable practices have presented.  The Government, however, must resist the temptation to reduce or eliminate support to charitable organisations providing essential services.  The Government's responsibility is to ensure there is proper legislation, policies and checks in place to ensure that all public moneys, whether provided by taxpayers or through voluntary contributions, are spent and accounted for properly.  This Private Members' motion seeks to put in place the first piece of the very necessary legislation.  <\/p><p> It can be argued that much of what is done in the name of charity in this country is simply filling the gaps in what should be quality, State-provided services.  The majority of those who work for and support charitable organisations do so for the highest of idealistic reasons.  It would be tragic if the actions of a few selfish, greedy, unprincipled and unregulated individuals were to blemish the record of so many heroic volunteers or, more importantly, were to undermine the very necessary services provided to those who need them most.  This amendment to legislation would help the public to know that they can give in confidence to the charities of their choice.  It would also give them the confidence to know that they will not be conned again.  We should also urgently consider how best to legislate to ensure all aspects of cronyism, school-tie networks and silver and golden circles are tackled, whether they are in charities, State or semi-State bodies, political life, private, commercial or professional services because clearly, the banks are not the only offenders here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100049#WW00200","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390338600,"counter":669,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Keating, Barry, O'Donovan, Connaughton and Spring.<\/p><p>  I am pleased to address the House on this Private Members' Bill.  We are all concerned at recent disclosures regarding certain charitable organisations.  We are all concerned at the impact these disclosures are having on Ireland's charities, many of which are excellently run and have nothing to fear from increased transparency and accountability.  The Charities Act of 2009 provides for a system of regulation of charities in Ireland, at the heart of which is the creation and support of strong trust and confidence in our charities.  On the part of Government, we plan to support this through the phased introduction of the Charities Act.<\/p><p>  In addressing the Bill before us today, I will first take some time to remind the House of our work in this area since coming to Government and outline what we intend to do in the coming months.  The Charities Act was enacted under the previous Government in February 2009, with cross-party support.  My own party, then in opposition, was pleased to support it as a necessary advance in the regulation of a sector that plays such a vital role in our economy and society.  A vibrant and well-governed charity sector is in everyone's interests and the measures contained in the Charities Act are aimed at supporting this.<\/p><p>  The Act provides for the establishment of a new regulator for the charity sector.  The Charities Regulatory Authority is to be an independent State agency charged with the registration and regulation of all charities operating here.  The creation of this body is essential to the full roll out of the Charities Act.  By the time this Government took office in March 2011, over two years from the enactment of the necessary legislation, the authority was not yet established and no concrete plans for its establishment had been announced.  A number of minor, primarily technical, sections of the Act had been commenced but that was all.<\/p><p>  Under the restructuring of Departments that took place at the time this Government was formed, the Charities Act came into my area of responsibility as Minister for Justice and Equality.  As with all other areas of existing or planned expenditure, the establishment of the new regulatory authority had to be examined as part of the comprehensive review of expenditure conducted by all Departments that year.  During this process, it became clear that the roll out of the Charities Act as envisaged by the previous Government was no longer financially viable given the urgent need to reduce Government expenditure.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding this, at all times it has been the policy of this Government to strengthen the regulation of the charitable sector in a pragmatic and proportionate way.  This is why, on coming into Government, we took some time to examine alternatives to the regime envisaged in the Charities Act that might deliver improvements in charity governance without the expense to the State and its citizens of establishing a new independent regulator. The outcome of this process was a recognition of the fact that, given that the Charities Act had been enacted and stood on the statute books, any meaningful new regulatory measures outside of the framework of the Act would first require its repeal or, at the very least, substantive amendment.<\/p><p>  The Charities Act represents an important legislative milestone in this State.  For the first time, charitable purpose is defined in law, comprehensive statutory registration of charities is prescribed and the legal basis is established for a significant increase in the information about charities and their affairs to be made available to the public.  In view of this, and notwithstanding the fact that for reasons of cost it was no longer possible to implement the Act as originally envisaged, we have at no time proposed the repeal of this legislation.  Such a move would not represent an advance in the regulation of the charities sector.  Instead, we have put our efforts into determining how best to bring into force key measures of the Act in a way that does not involve unsustainable expenditure on the part of the State and yet is capable of delivering a demonstrable improvement in the regulation of the sector.<\/p><p>  To advance this, my Department conducted a public and stakeholder consultation over an eight week period from January to March of last year.  The constructive engagement of an active and informed stakeholder community has been one of the hallmarks of the development of charities regulation over many years.  Since taking responsibility for this area, I have continued this approach and have directly consulted with some individuals and bodies myself.  I was impressed by the scale and calibre of stakeholder participation in last year's consultation.  I was also struck by the breadth of support among the sector and the general public for the introduction of these reforms.  This engagement is helping to inform our approach and I am committed to an ongoing dialogue with our stakeholders as we proceed.<\/p><p>  Following last year's consultation, I developed proposals for the implementation of the Charities Act and these were approved by Government last July.  This will involve the establishment of a charities regulatory authority and the development and publication of a register of charities, as provided for under the Act.  In order to minimise the cost to the taxpayer, we will initially establish the authority on a small scale, to be staffed by officials from within my Department.<\/p><p>  In time and in order to enable the development of the services provided by the Authority, charities themselves will be required to meet some of the costs of its operation through payment of a modest and proportionate annual fee.  This is provided for in the Charities Act.  In this way, the regulation of charities will become largely self-financing in due course.  It is only through utilising this provision that we are able to establish these new structures at this time of constraint in Government spending.  The proposal to levy annual fees on charities was contained in the consultation documents published this time last year and charities had the opportunity to give their views on and propose alternatives to a suggested fee structure.  I will take account of the views expressed and alternatives proposed before putting in place a fee structure.  Registration fees will not be payable by charities before 2015 at the earliest.<\/p><p>  Following Government approval of my proposals in July, I announced my intention to establish the new authority in 2014, following the necessary resource approvals from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Sanction to fill the post of CEO on an interim basis and a number of other administrative posts from within existing resources was received by my Department in mid December.  The sanction given represents a reduction on the resources originally sought, such that the new authority will initially be staffed by approximately ten administrative staff.  Its focus in the early phase of its operation will be on the preparation for publication of a statutory register of charities.<\/p><p>  We are very aware of the urgency of making progress on this.  That is why I announced last Friday that I intend to have the administrative staff positions filled by the end of February.  Arrangements are also being made to fill the post of CEO of the new authority on an interim basis by this time.  Regarding the independent board of the new authority, I also announced last Friday my intention to make appointments to this board by Easter.  To facilitate this, I will issue a call this week for expressions of interest from suitably qualified persons who wish to be considered for appointment.  I look forward to being able to report further progress to the House on this important work in the near future.<\/p><p>  The importance of high standards of probity within our charities cannot be overstated.<\/p><p>Many of these are large organisations with a substantial financial turnover.  Many of them receive significant levels of Government funding in addition to funds raised through the generosity of the Irish public.  They have a duty to use those funds efficiently and ethically in pursuit of their charitable purpose, and those who provide the funds have a right to know that they are being used for the purpose intended by the giver - be that Government, philanthropic organisation, corporation, or private individual.  Where funds intended for charity are not being used as intended, or indeed where they are being used inefficiently, such that an unacceptable proportion of the funds is spent on overheads, that should concern all of us, not least the charities themselves, who must strive to benefit their given charitable purpose to the maximum extent possible.  No one disputes that those who are employed by charities must be remunerated at an appropriate level for the work they do, but the charity sector is not well served by a lack of transparency over senior executive salaries, nor by excessive levels of remuneration, where such may exist.<\/p><p> In recent weeks we have heard a series of disturbing allegations about the use of charitable donations by various organisations.  The details of these have been the subject of considerable<\/p><p>examination by others in this House, and by committees of this House, and I do not propose to revisit them this evening.  In so far as my responsibilities as Minister for Justice and Equality extend, I have given detailed consideration to the question of the appropriate use of donated funds by charities.  In June 2011, responsibility for the operation of the charitable lotteries scheme was transferred from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the Department of Justice and Equality.  I wish to say at the outset that there are two cases currently before the High Court with regard to the charitable lotteries scheme, and that I do not wish to say anything this evening that would create any difficulty for the judges of the High Court in determining these matters or that could be deemed to prejudice the outcome of the proceedings.  However, as Minister, I have a responsibility to notify this House about these matters that are, in the context of the court proceedings, already in the public domain and matters that have recently been discussed at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and are directly related to the question of the transparent use of donated funds by charities.  It is in that context that I wish to make the following limited comments about the charitable lotteries scheme.<\/p><p> The scheme was established in 1997 in response to claims by a number of charities that their ability to raise funds had been severely curtailed by the introduction of the national lottery in 1987.  Under the terms of the scheme, funds are paid out to eligible charities that have been operating a fund-raising lottery since at least 1997 in which products are sold that are similar to products sold by the national lottery.  The total amount paid out in any one year is determined as part of the budget allocation and was, at its highest, &euro;8.618 million in 2009 and 2010 and, at its lowest, &euro;4 million in 2013.  Eligible charities must apply each year for funding under the scheme, and the total available funding each year is divided among the successful applicant charities.  The allocation of funding under the scheme is by reference to gross sales of qualifying products averaged over three years, and it is a requirement of the scheme that all funding paid out under the scheme must be used for charitable purposes only.<\/p><p> However, in relation to lottery fund-raising operated by a charity receiving funding from the scheme, there is no requirement for such a lottery to be operated efficiently, or indeed at a profit.  There is no incentive for such charities to keep the operating costs of such lotteries down.  In fact, the charitable lotteries scheme incentivises charities to leverage public funds, payable under the scheme, by maximising their gross ticket sales with no regard to either operating costs or how much of the money raised by ticket sales is, in fact, used for charitable purposes.  Under this scheme, since 1997, successive Governments have paid out a total of more than &euro;120 million in national lottery surplus funding and taxpayers' money to a group of charities that operate fund-raising lotteries.<\/p><p> On assuming responsibility for the operation of the scheme, I immediately undertook a review of payments being made, the manner in which the scheme operated and the nature of fund-raising activities that were being supplemented by the State under the scheme.  I became very concerned that the fund-raising activities of some of the organisations that benefit from the charitable lotteries scheme operated at very low profit margins and that the operation of the scheme incentivised inefficient fund-raising practices that could be used as a means to leverage Government funding under the scheme.  The focus on the number of tickets sold, rather than profitable fund-raising, ensures additional funding from Government for the charity concerned.  Accordingly, I took steps to reduce Government support for inefficient methods of charity fund-raising through the gradual phasing out of the costly and inefficient charitable lotteries scheme.  My decision to phase out the scheme was based on the budgetary exigencies of the period and the fact that the scheme is an inefficient and uneconomic use of the State's resources for the following reasons: it encourages inefficient fund-raising practices and high administration costs; it creates an incentive to run a charitable lottery at a low profit margin or at a loss; it has resulted in low proportions of profits reaching designated charities; and it was unfair to the donors that such a low proportion of moneys donated were being used for charitable purposes and that the scheme had essentially evolved into a mechanism for obtaining taxpayers' and national lottery surplus funds.<\/p><p> Many of the lotteries whose organisations benefit from the charitable lotteries scheme operate at very low profit margins.  The proportion of profits generated that flows to the charitable cause for which the lottery products are sold is very low.  For example, in the case of Rehab, which received approximately two thirds of the total available fund each year, the proportion of the face value of a Rehab Lotteries Limited instant win scratch card that was retained for the benefit of the charitable organisation averaged around 1%, and the average was around 15% for draw lotteries over the period 2008 to 2010.<\/p><p> In May 2012 an audit was carried out by the Department of Justice and Equality on the charitable lotteries scheme funds received by Rehab for the two-year period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.  It was found that in 2010 the costs of generating the lottery sales in Rehab represented a significant percentage of overall sales revenue, leading to a low profit margin.  For example, bingo sales of &euro;3,190,000 in this period yielded profits of only &euro;548,000, while scratch card sales of &euro;3,969,000 yielded profits of only &euro;9,452.  In summary, 2010 figures supplied by Rehab Lotteries Limited show its gross lottery sales of almost &euro;7.2 million yielded a net profit of &euro;558,000 or 8%.<\/p><p> In November 2011, I met with Rehab and queried the size of the profits accruing from the scratch card product of the Rehab lottery, noting that it generated a profit of only &euro;9,452 based on product sales of close to &euro;4 million.  I noted that the profit ratio seemed disproportionate and expressed concern at the approach being taken to public fund-raising.  I made it clear I was considering issues relating to the scheme.  Further work was subsequently undertaken on the matter within my Department.<\/p><p> In October 2012 I wrote to all beneficiaries of the scheme advising them of my intention to wind down the scheme gradually over a period of three years, beginning in 2013.  I emphasised to them that the gradual withdrawal of funding was intended to give them an opportunity to review their fund-raising practices where necessary to ensure their profitability.  It is important to charities and their donors alike that fund-raising efforts are run in a businesslike and efficient manner and that the maximum possible proportion of funds raised is used to support charitable activities.  My objective in phasing out the charitable lotteries scheme is to wind down a scheme that I believe is no longer fit for purpose.<\/p><p> I understand that at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality held on 9<sup><\/sup>October 2013, the CEO of Rehab referred to the winding down of the scheme as a &quot;shocking decision&quot; by Government.  I hope after this evening my approach to the scheme is now better understood.  The planned reduction in payments first took effect at the end of last year.  Funding was to be reduced each year according to the following plan: it was maintained at &euro;6 million in 2012 across the scheme, followed by a reduction to &euro;4 million in 2013, &euro;2 million in 2014, &euro;1 million in 2015 and nil in 2016.  The scheme would then cease to operate.  My decision to phase out the scheme is currently the subject of judicial review proceedings brought by the Rehab Group and Rehab Lotteries Limited.  The judicial review hearing took place on 24, 25<sup><\/sup>and 26<sup><\/sup>July 2013 and judgment of the High Court in this matter is awaited.<\/p><p> In the meantime, the Rehab Group and Rehab Lotteries Limited have chosen to embark on separate litigation against the State under competition law, claiming damages of up to &euro;1.5 billion in connection with the operation of the national lottery.  Whatever the outcome of this costly action, it is likely to exert a significant burden on either public resources, charity resources or both.  That seems to me unfortunate at a time when both public and charity resources are under such extreme pressure to meet the front-line needs of our citizens as we work together towards recovery.  As I have said, while I do not wish to make a comment that may in any way prejudice the outcome of proceedings that are before the courts, it is important that, as Minister, I take this opportunity to brief the House in so far as it is appropriate for me to do in the context of a debate about governance of charities and use of donated funds.<\/p><p>I wish to emphasise that, in explaining the areas of my concern, I do not want in any way to detract from the excellent service Rehab provides to its service-users nor do I want to undermine or denigrate the work of dedicated Rehab staff engaged in the provision of those services.  My essential concern is to ensure Rehab, as well as the other charities which have benefited from this scheme, operates efficiently in the raising of public funds, and that a substantial portion of funds raised are used for the charity&rsquo;s objectives and on those who rely on its services.<\/p><p> It is the Government's focus to work towards implementing the Charities Act as it stands.  To embark on a process of amending this legislation at this time would be an unnecessary distraction from the work in hand.  The Act provides for a full review of its operation five years after the establishment of the Charities Regulatory Authority.  That review will allow for a proper, considered and consultative process to determine whether there are ways in which the Act needs to be improved.<\/p><p> We do not at present envisage amending the Charities Act.  The Government does not support the amendment in section 2 of this Private Members&rsquo; Bill to include the advancement of human rights in the list of purposes that are of benefit to the community.  This is not due to any lack of recognition of the vital role of human rights organisations in our communities, both here and worldwide.  Rather, it is in light of the importance of ensuring the new system of regulation of charities is appropriately aligned with the system of charitable tax exemption long operated by the Revenue Commissioners.  Under this system, the Revenue Commissioners recognise the advancement of human rights as a charitable purpose only in the case of a human rights charity that has consultative status with the United Nations.<\/p><p> Under section 40 of the Charities Act, organisations holding a charity reference number denoting they hold a charitable tax exemption number from the Revenue Commissioners will be automatically placed on the register of charities by the new authority.  It is, therefore, important the two systems are aligned.  It is important to recall the Charities Act was consciously framed so as not to negatively impact on any organisation that currently enjoys charitable status with the Revenue Commissioners.  Accordingly, under the circumstances, I consider the amendment is not necessary, as human rights organisations that already have charitable tax exemptions will be automatically registered as charities under section 40.  The provisions in section 3 of the Charities Act provide for the extension of charitable status to organisations with purposes not specified in the Act.  This is an issue that could be considered in the context of the aforementioned five-year review.<\/p><p> The Government does not support section 3.  I have already set out our plans for the charities regulatory authority to be staffed to an interim level by the end of February and to have its board appointed by Easter.  Following that, it will work in a preparatory mode for some time to enable it to develop the register of charities for publication, as well as putting in place such other administrative policies and procedures as are required for its operation.  The Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland will be dissolved on the formal establishment of the new authority and their functions transferred to it.  Once the necessary arrangements are in place, the authority will be formally established by ministerial order and the register of charities published.  Subject to the necessary arrangements being in place, this will be before the end of 2014.  In light of this, the Government does not support the proposed amendment nor the proposed Bill.<\/p><p> I reiterate how important it is that trust and confidence in our charity sector is restored.  The new system of charities regulation, provided for in the Charities Act, will be an important part of this.  Critical also is clear leadership from the charity sector itself.  Our foremost charities must lead by example and demonstrate through their own actions that there is no place in Ireland's charity sector for poor governance or lack of transparency.  In light of recent events, the public's demand to know what becomes of its charitable donations seems entirely reasonable.  It is a demand I support that can only be met by the charities themselves.  I call on them to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100050#XX00200","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390339800,"counter":672,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s contribution to this Private Members&rsquo; Bill.<\/p><p>  Given the crisis the charity sector finds itself in, I have written to the Taoiseach to ask the Government to consider a once-off grant, by way of an <i>ex gratia<\/i> payment of &euro;740,000 to the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic as an expression of the Government&rsquo;s goodwill to the clinic&rsquo;s front-line workers who are devastated by the expos&eacute;s over the past several weeks.<\/p><p>  There may be other charities engaged in sharp practice or maybe even fraudulent activities when it comes to charitable funding and fund-raising.

Is this good corporate governance?  Are there other aspects of Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospice which are so far undisclosed?

We need effective oversight, sanctions and transparency in this sector.  If these three elements can be married together, we will certainly be moving in the right direction.  I compliment the Committee of Public Accounts on its sterling work in this area to date and wish it well in the future.  I hope well known high-profile individuals who, in my opinion, abused their position of trust when they took out full-page newspaper advertisements to scaremonger and defeat the referendum to extend the powers of Oireachtas committees will reflect on their inappropriate actions and their consequences.  People want, expect and deserve answers about the banking crisis and the demoralising behaviour regarding charities.  In the case of the latter, it is unacceptable that generous people have been deceived in such a manner.<\/p><p>  I fail to see the need for enormous salaries for chief executives of charities.  Charities need to be looked at critically to ensure the primary beneficiaries of charities and donations to them are not the charities themselves.  Transparency is key in this area.  As we have been for the past several years, we need to tidy up one more aspect of poor governance, a problem that has dogged this country for far too long.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100052#ZZ00300","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speech","time":1390339800,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  The Minister for Justice and Equality pointed out there is much more work to be done in the charities regulatory area.  While some Members attended the justice committee to describe their shock at the Minister&rsquo;s decision to wind down a particular aspect of lottery funding, some of the figures revealed here this evening on the low net profit margins of some of these schemes pose questions of which the Oireachtas has a duty to get to the bottom.  I agree with the calls for an examination of the use of these schemes since 1997, since that in itself leaves many unanswered questions.<\/p><p>  Charities across the country will be distressed by what has happened in their sector over the past several days.  When one sees individuals before an Oireachtas inquiry giving evidence that falls between the-dog-ate-my-homework excuse and that which was given by a certain individual in Dublin Castle once upon a time when he tried to convince the country he found money in a suitcase which he then carted around O&rsquo;Connell Street, is it any wonder people thought they would get away with it?  The damage will have to be repaired and confidence in the sector restored.  I have raised the issue of governance in this sector on a Topical Issue Matters before.  How do people become board members of these charities? Who elects the boards?  Who appoints their chief executive officers?  Where are the public interest directors and ministerial nominees to these boards?  These will all have to be fleshed out.  When it comes to annual reports, Deputy Colreavy earlier asked where are the auditors in all of this.  There are so many intricacies in this unseemly mess, which I hope will be shortlived, that the big losers in all of this will be the charities and their service-users.  Ultimately, the big losers in this should really be those being paid multiples of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s salary.<\/p><p>The days of a person sending someone out with a bucket to collect a bonus to top up a salary of &euro;368,000 or &euro;370,000 must stop.  While the Bill has some good aspects, the earlier comments made by the Minister for Justice and Equality certainly must be fleshed out to a greater extent.  I urge him and his Government colleagues to empower the relevant Oireachtas committee to consider this issue in greater detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100052#ZZ00400","speaker":"1058","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390340400,"counter":676,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak on this issue, even for a short time.  <\/p><p>  I welcome the Bill and even though I may not be able to support it, it certainly is in the right area.  While I greatly welcome the Minister's statement that there will be a regulator with a proper department, the biggest problem in this regard brings us back to a point made by Deputy Tom Barry on the need to ensure such a department will be properly resourced and given the powers to do its job.  One of the most serious problems is the lack of accountability.  It appears to be everyone's fault and no one's fault at the same time.  People are being given a rap on their hands, but no one appears to be held responsible.  <\/p><p>  In many ways, the scandal at the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, was almost like Christmas-time again for politicians, as they can jump up and down, wave their hands and be appalled and dismayed.  While this happens in so many other scandals, ultimately, the real problem is whether anyone is ever held responsible for any of these actions.  In this case, people want to see action more than words.  While I acknowledge what Deputy Derek Keating was trying to say about getting the money back to the CRC, I would rather see it returned as the former chief executive officer is not entitled to it.  Speaking as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, when asked about his lump sum payment, he gave a figure of &euro;200,000, although he knew that another &euro;500,000 had been included in the payment.  Instead of appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts and being wrapped on the knuckles, he must pay it back.  I acknowledge that the HSE has stated it may consider doing so.<\/p><p>  There is a wider issue with regard to pay gaps in the public sector.  This all emerged from the making of a top-up payment which now has unravelled into something much bigger.  Moreover, as Deputy Michael Colreavy stated, this may not be the end of the matter either and perhaps there is a great deal more to it.  We must arrive at a position where when a pay cap is imposed in the public sector, in particular, it is adhered to.  Perhaps this is something on which the Government has not been overly strong heretofore and I hope it is something that can change now.  Members should be under no illusions - what has happened at the CRC has done tremendous damage to the charity sector.  I spoke to people over the weekend who will not give to that charity again because they believe the money went straight into the back pocket of a man who simply did not deserve it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100053#AAA00200","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speech","time":1390340400,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  <\/p><p>  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this timely Bill which has spurred the Government into action on an important issue.  Across the country thousands of volunteers give selflessly of their time and efforts to fund-raise for a worthy cause.  Regardless of whether it is a marathon run or a head shave, the Irish people have a remarkable spirit of generosity that sustains the charity sector.  Even in the difficult economic period through which they have suffered in recent years, ordinary people have been willing to give whatever they can to help a good cause.  Their immense commitment to helping others through whatever means they have available is testament to the strength of Irish society.  The revelations of grossly inflated pay levels and lump sums at the CRC are all the more dispiriting against the backdrop of ordinary people's generosity.  The litany of unwarranted payments deeply shook the confidence of the volunteer army that sustains the charity sector.  There is something rotten in the culture of a body that allows such greed to fester and grow.  The issue cannot be allowed to slip into petty political point-scoring, as it is much more important than that.  Members must move to address the fundamental problems with the corporate governance of these bodies.  A failure to confront these issues will undermine fatally the confidence of the public in the good work that they do.  This will devastate the capacity of the sector to undertake the vital fund-raising that keeps them going.<\/p><p>  It is important that not all bodies are tarred with the same brush.  I recognise the charity sector has taken individual steps towards enhancing corporate governance.  The steps taken by the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, towards initiating the 2009 Act mark something for which the industry has been calling actively since it was passed by the Oireachtas.  It is not true, as has been stated, that the Minister has done nothing in this regard since taking office.  I raised this issue with the Taoiseach on the Order of Business on 18 December last and the Minister replied to me in the positive to the effect that consultation had taken place and that sections 1, 2, 4, 5, 10 and 90 had already been commenced.  A number of charities have voluntarily submitted themselves to the standards laid out in the British legislation and furthering the introduction of a regulator here will ensure this will become legal practice in Ireland.<\/p><p>  When Fianna F&aacute;il passed the Charities Act in 2009, it represented a milestone in the development of the regulation of the sector.  Its aims are all the more important now, in the light of the shocking information on the activities of the CRC.  The purpose of the Charities Act is to reform charities law to ensure greater accountability, protect against abuse of charitable status and enhance public trust and confidence in charities, with increased transparency in the sector.  Key aspects of the Act provide for a definition of &quot;charitable purposes&quot; for the first time in primary legislation.  It also provides for the creation of a new Charities Regulatory Authority to secure compliance by charities with their legal obligations and encourage better administration of charities.  In addition, it provides for a register of charities, in which all charities operating in the State must register, and the submission of annual activity reports by charities to the new authority.  It updates the law relating to fund-raising, particularly in respect of collections by way of direct debits and similar non-cash methods, as well as providing for the creation of a charity appeals tribunal and the provision of consultative panels to assist the authority in its work and ensure effective consultation with stakeholders.  This marks a key moment in the transformation of how charities are regulated in Ireland.  It also recognises the dramatic development of the sector and the scale of the work it does across innumerable spheres of Irish life, both at home and abroad.  Putting it on a sound legislative basis will sustain the sector in the coming decades as it grows and evolves alongside the challenges it confronts.  The Act will also enable volunteers and members of the public and ensure their hard-earned money will be spent in the most effective manner and not siphoned off or wasted due to grossly inadequate governance.<\/p><p>  The initiation of the Act will have a significant impact on the internal workings of the sector.  Members must ensure they are adequately prepared to deal with the new raft of paperwork they will be expected to process.  One does not wish for a situation where honest charities doing good work in the community will suffer unduly owing to the regulatory burden.  Red tape should not be allowed to strangle the work of the sector.  A number of aspects of the Act are worth dealing with individually and teasing out as the charity regulator gets going.  All charities registered with the regulator will be obliged to submit an annual activity report.  The Minister should move further to consult the sector before deciding on what will be required of charities in this annual report.  This will be a useful mechanism to outline the level of work done by each charity and as a comparison between bodies.  Most charities already submit financial accounts, but the format and process by which this is done will depend on how its organisation is set up legally.  This will be a vital part of securing public trust in the system and setting up a clear line of accountability for the expenditure of charitable moneys.  Transforming how charities operate and establishing clear new lines of accountability will boost the strength of charities.  Essentially, the Act enshrines the principle of openness that many charities already have embraced fully.<\/p><p>  Implementation of the Act ran into the strong headwinds of the economic downturn.  The Government has consistently cited costs as an impediment to the establishment of the body.  The charities regulator in Northern Ireland costs an estimated &pound;800,000 per annum.  I understand charities will be expected to pay an annual registration fee to fund the new regulator.  The annual fee will range from between &euro;75 and &euro;500, depending on the scale of the charity involved.  This also will leave a significant gap to be bridged by the taxpayer to fund the 20 staff strong body.  What level of Exchequer funding subvention will be provided to assist in the creation and ongoing running costs of the body?  Has the Minister specified the costs involved with the new regulator and its funding mechanisms?<\/p><p>  Recent events have underlined the importance in the long term of underpinning public trust in the charity sector.  The financial pressure being felt by the sector has compounded its need for reliable fund-raising to be undertaken.  Transparency, accountability and regulation are absolutely integral parts of the long-term sustainability of any organisation.  The vital role public trust plays in driving on the charity sector makes it all the more important in that sector.  The new regulator will require a robust and committed board to fulfil its mandate.  This means drawing from personnel who blend experience of the charity sector with an appreciation of the needs of the public.  The appointment process cannot be allowed, as have so many others under the current Administration, to be dominated by cronyism, with political hacks stuffing the ranks.  The open public appointment process must be more than a mere fig leaf thrown in the direction of transparency.  A regulator set up to promote transparency must itself be transparent.  The regulator must be beyond reproach to achieve the objective of restoring public trust which has been battered by the debacle at the CRC.<\/p><p>The open and transparent process should be started as soon as possible to put the body on a solid footing and enable it to pursue its objectives straight away.  We should not let the actions of a negligent board and the cynical acts of a few cast a dark shadow on the bright story of charity work in Ireland.<\/p><p> Full implementation of the Charities Act 2009 will represent a decisive step in recognising the central part good governance has in the running of a burgeoning sector.  It gives a strong legal basis for the spirit of transparency that must underpin the entire area.  Members must draw from the shocking lessons of the CRC scandal that has enraged so many people across the country.  Full implementation of the Act sends a strong and unmistakable message that good governance is the standard operational procedure for the parties involved.  I look forward to the swift enactment of the provisions of the 2009 Act, both the letter and spirit, to assure those volunteers and ordinary people across the country that their efforts are not wasted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100053#AAA00300","speaker":"1057","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390341000,"counter":679,"content":"<p>Cuireann s&eacute; &aacute;thas orm deis a bheith agam c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; maidir leis an gconsp&oacute;id at&aacute; ar bun faoi ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; carthanachta sa t&iacute;r.

We brought in the Act.  We enacted it in my time in the Department.  The issue now is why we waited three years to have the regulator put in place and how the Minister could believe that we did not need a regulator.  He was looking to see if we could avoid having a regulator.  It is extraordinary.  By not moving to put the regulator in place properly to regulate the sector, the Minister has deterred ordinary people from putting money the way of charities since this controversy broke.  The cost of the regulator to the taxpayer would have been very small compared to the loss of income to genuine charities who are working genuinely for the good of people.<\/p><p>  There seems to be a belief that all charities in this State are mega organisations like the ones around which this controversy has grown.  Most charities are driven by ordinary people.  We must have a situation where ordinary people can serve on boards.  We must not deter all the ordinary people from serving on boards because they do not have legal or accounting proficiency.  They bring other skills to boards.  Some charitable organisations get some subvention from the State, some are nearly totally dependent on State support and others get no money from the State and are totally depending on raising money in other ways.  The vast majority of employees of charitable organisations are not on high salaries, are probably earning less money than they would in the private sector doing the same job with the same responsibilities, and in many cases they work very long hours and are passionately dedicated to the work they are doing.  There are a few bad apples in the barrel and we must be very responsible and careful in this House not to destroy the people's general trust in the charities that they support which, in the main, give very good value for money to this State.<\/p><p>  The Minister could do nothing about what happened before his time but much of the controversy of the last few months could have been minimised had he introduced the charities regulator and brought in proper change.  Had he done so, we could have stood up and said that was then and this is now, and that if people give money this Christmas it is not being given under the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime<\/i> but under a new regime with a proper regulator who is accounting for the money under an Act we brought in as Members of this Oireachtas.  I welcome the Minister's belated conversion to introducing a charities regulator.  I hope he does it swiftly and that by the end of this year we will be able to say we have a properly regulated charities sector in this country.  It will not eliminate all risk of cheating.  Nothing ever will.  No law or regulation will ever do that, but it will make it much less likely and make for much higher standards, greater transparency and greater certainty than in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100054#BBB00600","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1390341000,"counter":684,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to tonight's debate.  Everyone in the country watched last week with growing horror and anger at the performance at the Committee of Public Accounts of the CRC directors and the disgraceful actions they carried out in providing for the pension of their former CEO.  In the drip feed of information about the cost of the pay off, many wondered why they had contributed their hard earned money to charities at all.  The anger increased when people realised there is comprehensive charities legislation on the Statute Book which is not being implemented.  The reason a charities regulator has not been established is the cost.<\/p><p>  What has been the cost of the scandal played out in our committees over the last number of weeks?  According to a recent survey 53% of charities have suffered a drop in fund-raising, 97% believe public trust has been lost and 54% believe that damage could be permanent, all because of the cost of establishing a regulator.  The full implementation of the Charities Act might not have prevented the actions of the CRC board in treating the donations of their many families and supporters as a slush fund to be used for their own benefit.  However, it would have placed them under the scrutiny of a regulator and could have been a deterrent to prevent them from acting in this way.  They have done untold damage to the good work being done by all charities in Irish society and have made their work more difficult.<\/p><p>  The actions of the board of the CRC will cost taxpayers much more because the State will have to pick up the slack caused by the drop off in donations.  The failure to establish a regulator will probably end up costing more than it would have had it been up and running three years ago.  This State abdicates so much of its responsibility to the charity sector and we should debate that in this House another day.  Now we will end up carrying the cost of this inaction.  The many families who feel obligated to fund-raise for the charities whose good work their children have benefited from feel very let down by the inaction of this State and the actions of the CRC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100054#BBB00700","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1390341000,"counter":685,"content":"<p>When James Joyce offered his book <i>Dubliners<\/i> to his London publishers, he drew attention to the &quot;special odour of corruption&quot; that floats over his stories.  He said, &quot;It is not my fault that the odour of ash pits and old weeds and offal hangs round my stories.&quot;  While we are not assailed by the odours of offal and ash pits, we are assailed by the far more odious, offensive and pervasive odour of greed, selfishness and corruption at the heart of what we are discussing tonight and tomorrow night.  In the D&aacute;il recently we have examined abuses including the residential institutions, the Magdalen laundries and the ladies who suffered the ordeal of symphysiotomy.  One thinks one has reached the end of it, that there could not be any more horror stories.  Then we come to this particular horror story and see the abuse of the people who were using the services and of the generosity of the Irish people.<\/p><p>This scandal at the CRC has done untold damage to charities and charitable organisations in this country.  People with special needs, both mental and physical, our elderly, our schoolchildren and the homeless should not have to rely on charity and fund-raising in order to address their needs, but that is what must happen.  They need fund-raising services due to a lack of commitment on the part of successive governments to adequately address the needs of those sections of society.<\/p><p> When we look at the composition of the CRC boards, we cannot help but wonder at it.  It is almost like a <i>Who's Who<\/i>of members of the Fianna F&aacute;il party.  We cannot help also but come to the conclusion that the CRC and other institutions, like the Mater hospital, allowed themselves to be used as a thank you for those who served Fianna F&aacute;il in the past.  This must be a source of embarrassment for current members of the party.   It is unfortunate that this system of rewards for members of political parties continues in this D&aacute;il.  I fear that when other charitable organisations are examined, more of what we have seen in the CRC will come to light.<\/p><p> I have a question with regard to the work of the charity regulation section of the Nenagh office of the Revenue Commissioners.  For the past 40 years I have been on the voluntary board of a number of small charities and organisations and am aware of the amount of paperwork and rules and regulations we must go through in order to get charitable status and of the extent of professional fees these organisations must pay.
