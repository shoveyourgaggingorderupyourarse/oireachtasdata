In essence, the Chequers statement represents a pathway and a platform on which serious negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union to determine their future relationship can progress.  The resignations of David Davis, MP, and Boris Johnson, MP, confirm this reality.  The Chequers statement is much more in line with the economic reality from the perspective of the United Kingdom and reveals a new Brexit realism that rendered it impossible for the hardl-ine Brexiteers to continue in office.  Hard-line Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson and David Davis never produced a blueprint and a coherent alternative.  The outgoing Foreign Secretary said it was the beginning of the end of the dream.  However, dreams rarely correspond with reality.  Credit should be given to the British Prime Minister for navigating this new direction in very difficult political circumstances, as we all know.  <\/p>  <p>  I have been very critical of the Brexit decision, but the British people took that decision.  I was particularly critical of the absence of any coherent blueprint to be put before the electorate in advance.  It was fuelled by certain racist tendencies, anti-immigration sentiment and so on.  That said, as a country, we export hugely to the United Kingdom.  The studies undertaken in Ireland, including the Economic and Social Research Institute's study and those conducted by the Department of Finance, have predicted negative outcomes, depending on the nature of Brexit, for the small and medium enterprise sector.  That is particularly the case for the agrifood sector and the Border, west and north-west regions which will be very badly hit by a hard Brexit.  We must avoid any such outcome.<\/p><p> We are still facing into very difficult negotiations.  Time is short and politics in the United Kingdom are very volatile.  Clearly, the negotiations between the UK and EU will be particularly difficult and complex.  As a country, we must maintain a key focus on what is optimal for the entire island of Ireland while preserving the integrity of the European Union and its mission and rules.  Does the Taoiseach accept that a positive UK-EU agreement on their future relationship is the optimal outcome for Ireland?  In light of this country's significant market presence in the United Kingdom, particularly in the agrifood and SME sectors, does he accept that the east-west relationship between the UK and Ireland is critical to the island's economic growth and well-being?  Does he accept that the Chequers statement from the UK Government represents a credible basis for the progression of the next phase of EU-UK negotiations on Brexit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531227900,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  All of us are noting very closely the political events that are unfolding at Westminster.  I note the resignation of the former Foreign Secretary, Mr. Johnson, and former Brexit Secretary, Mr. Davis.  I also note that the Prime Minister did not waste too much time in replacing them.  Of course, these are internal matters for the UK Government and the Conservative Party.  As far as the Irish Government is concerned, the Prime Minister is the Prime Minister.  Theresa May is the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and when she speaks, she does so on behalf of the UK Government.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke to Prime Minister May by phone for approximately half an hour on Saturday and she briefed me on the statement released from Chequers on Friday.  We had a very good conversation.  It was an opportunity for her to explain to me what the statement meant and what the next steps will be.  She explained that the first of those steps will be the publication of a White Paper later this week.  That White Paper will be approximately 100 pages long and will give us a lot more detail than the three-page statement released on Friday.  I specifically asked her what will be the process and she explained that the White Paper will have to be approved by the British Cabinet and not just the Department for Exiting the European Union.  We look forward to seeing that White Paper.  Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, a member of the Fianna F&aacute;il Front Bench, suggested at the weekend that we should read that White Paper and consider it in full - in consultation with the task force and the EU 27 - before producing a definitive response to it.  That is exactly what I intend to do.  Contact is being kept, on a regular and close basis, between Government Buildings and Downing Street.  I am in touch with the Prime Minister - we are in contact sherpa to sherpa and chief adviser to chief adviser.  The T&aacute;naiste is in close contact with his opposite number, David Lidington, as is, of course, the Minister for Finance with Philip Hammond.<\/p>  <p>  The Chequers statement is welcome.  It can have an input to talks in respect of the future relationship, although we would like to see the White Paper first.  As already stated, the statement from Chequers is three pages long and the White Paper will be more than 100 pages long.  I imagine there will be lot more in 100-page White Paper than there was in the three-page statement.  I hope the White Paper will still be published this week.  It will give us the opportunity to consider what is proposed in consultation with Michel Barnier, the task force and the EU 27.  On the face of what we see, it can have an input to the talks on the future relationship.  It is welcome and, as we have always said in the past, if the United Kingdom was able to relax its position regarding some of its red-line issues, then the European Union could also be flexible.  Perhaps we are now entering into that space.<\/p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's question, I have always said that the best option and the best way to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland is through what we have been calling for quite some time, namely, option A, which is the future relationship, rather than option C, which is the backstop.  It has always been our view that the best solution is one that would be all-encompassing in nature and that would involve the United Kingdom staying very close to the European Union and, therefore, Ireland and thereby negating the need or even possibility of a hard border on our island.  Nonetheless we will still need a backstop.  It will not be possible to negotiate the final stages treaty, that is the new treaty between the UK and the EU, by October.  At best we will have a political declaration.  That treaty will have to be ratified not just by this Parliament but by the parliaments of all the member states of the European Union.<\/p><p>There is a risk that even if we agree a future relationship treaty, any one parliament in the European Union could reject it, which is why the withdrawal agreement must include a backstop and give us that insurance policy.  Should we fail to conclude successfully and to our satisfaction a UK-EU final state treaty, we must have a backstop on which to fall back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000004#B00200","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531228500,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  He has said these are internal matters for the British Government, but they are also of relevance to and have a profound impact on Ireland.  Put simply, the pathway being pursued by hard-line Brexiters such as Mr. Boris Johnson and Mr. David Davis, if they had succeeded and if they succeed in the future - hard-line Brexiters are still there in numbers within the British Tory Party - would lead to a significantly negative impact on our economic well-being, particularly on the west coast, in the north west and the midlands, as documented by the Economic and Social Research Institute.  At times there has not been an adequate focus on the potential economic damage and the downside to a less than optimal east-west relationship between the United Kingdom and Ireland.  It affects the island in its entirety in terms of exports to the British market which cannot easily be replaced quickly through diversification and other channels.  Does the Taoiseach believe the Chequers statement represents a credible pathway to negotiations?  It represents a departure and a significant change in direction, with greater coherence than we have seen to date from the British Government.  Therefore, it requires a proximate and proportionate response from the European Union that should be distanced immediately from some of the comments that have emanated from some hidden sources in the Union, with talk of rats deserting sinking ships.  Such crowing over-eggs the discussion.  It is time to get down to serious negotiations, to find the optimal resolution for the European Union, the United Kingdom and Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000005#C00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1531228500,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The statement produced at Chequers is a valuable input into the negotiations on the final status.  It may produce a credible pathway towards further negotiations, but we need to study the White Paper first.  On its own, it is not a solution and nobody is claiming that it is.  As we have said so many times in the past, if the United Kingdom is willing to modify and evolve some of its red lines, the European Union should be flexible also.  In the period ahead it is a space we can be in.  It is two years since the referendum occurred in the United Kingdom and for two years we have not known what Brexit means.  There has not been a united position in the British Government.  I firmly hope what we saw emanating from Chequers on Friday and what we will see in the White Paper later this week will at long last represent an agreed UK Government position on what it wants the future relationship to look like.  We have always known what we want it to look like.  First, it should protect the common travel area; second, it should allow continued free trade between Britain and Ireland; and, third, it should avoid a hard border on the island.

Two years on from the Brexit referendum, the British Government produced a three-page document.  The world was told that it represented a unified approach to Brexit in the British Cabinet.  As we now know, that narrative began to unravel on Sunday evening with the resignation of Mr. David Davis as Brexit Secretary.  His departure from office was followed yesterday afternoon by the resignation of the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Boris Johnson.  A chief architect of Brexit, he has decided to run away from the mess he helped to create.  I dare say a man who equated the Border in Ireland with boundaries between boroughs in London will be no great loss.<\/p>  <p>  Despite all the drama and the toing and froing in London in the past couple of days, we should make no mistake that the problems for Ireland remain.  They are real and present.  We still have no workable solutions from the British Government or legal guarantees from the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, on the political agreement made last December which the Taoiseach may recall that he described as \"cast-iron\".  The Tory Party tactic has been to play for time.<\/p><p>They have been openly reneging on the backstop or protocol for a while now.  The Chequers document only makes a passing reference to a backstop.  Speculation is that the white paper, publication of which we await, will contain something similarly vague.  To add to this, Mrs. May confirmed to the House of Commons yesterday that she would not sign up to the December agreement and backstop.  That cast-iron agreement, as the Taoiseach put it, is a non-runner according to Mrs. May.<\/p> <p> Obtaining legal guarantees that protect Ireland's interests, North and South, is essential.  A new Brexit realism would understand how essential it is to bring clarity and certainty for our people, our all-island economy and our agreements.  A new Brexit realism would understand that the backstop agreed in December is the bottom line.  The Taoiseach cannot concede.  There cannot be any flexibility, no blurring or softening of the lines on this matter.  I believe the Taoiseach cannot continue to accept bad faith from the Tory Government.<\/p> <p> We cannot allow these matters to slip into the hazy days of the summer and sit back and hope for the best.  My questions are straightforward.  What is the Taoiseach's plan now to ensure that Ireland obtains the necessary legal guarantees from the British Government?

In December, there was a political agreement.  The UK Government has been very consistent that it stands by the political agreement that was made in December.  The UK Government made the agreement in December and reaffirmed it in a letter from Theresa May to President Tusk in March.  In fact, the UK Government reaffirmed it again in the paper produced from Chequers on Friday.<\/p>  <p>  The backstop text was produced by the EU 27 in March and the UK Government has never accepted the text.  Negotiations will have to continue on the detail of that.  As we have said, and as all 27 member states have said, there will be no withdrawal agreement without an Irish protocol, without a backstop.  Even if we can agree the parameters of the future relationship in October, we will not be able to negotiate a full, detailed, complicated new treaty between the UK and the EU.  It will take the entire transition period, if not longer, to negotiate that.  That is why we have to have a protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland in the withdrawal agreement.  Those in the UK Government understand and accept that.  They did so in December, by letter in March and reaffirmed that again in the statement from Chequers.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about a future summit and that is possible.  The 28 Heads of State and Government will meet for an informal EU Council meeting in Salzburg in September, hosted by the Austrian Presidency.  A chance occurred to us here on Sunday and I discussed with those responsible the possibility of upgrading that meeting to include a formal discussion on Article 50.  That is a possibility and I know it was discussed between Prime Minister May and Chancellor Merkel as well.  It is too soon to make that judgment call but it is certainly an option.  We will all be there together in Austria on 20 September and it might be a good time for us to all talk together about Brexit, but we will make that judgment call nearer the time.  It is an obvious opportunity for us to have a further Article 50 Council meeting should it be advisable.<\/p>  <p>  I have set out what we aim to achieve: keeping the common travel area in place, no hard border between North and South; and minimising the impact on free trade between Britain and Ireland.

It is useful that we have something with which to engage, although it remains to be seen whether it will continue to be the settled position of the British Government once the more detailed White Paper is published in a few days' time, or if the particular White Paper will command a majority in the British Parliament because there are serious questions to be answered.  Mrs. Theresa May has suggested Britain would continue to have access to the Single Market for goods, but she has not declared her willingness to oversee and monitor it and, similarly, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and the maintenance of the four freedoms.  They can be debated, but at least we now have something with which to engage.<\/p>  <p>  The direction of travel in the United Kingdom seems to be towards closer alignment with the European Union, rather than the drift away which was prevalent previously.  However, we cannot afford to be complacent, welcome though it is.  There have been so many variations in the UK proposals that there is no guarantee that the latest variation will survive.  There is also a real possibility that Mrs. Theresa May's minority Government will fall, triggering a UK general election.  The policy of the British Labour Party, with which I keep in very close contact, is to retain full membership of the customs union and the Single Market for at least a four-year transition period that would ensure an appropriate time within which to negotiate more robust permanent arrangements.  Mrs. Theresa May's aim is still to leave both by March next year, at which point Northern Ireland's Border will be thrown into question.  <\/p>  <p>  The need for clarity on the backstop position is urgent for us.  Last week I said there was a golden opportunity, following the announcement of the Austrian Presidency of a special summit on 20 September, to add to the agenda this one issue, namely, the need for clarity on the legal text of the Irish backstop.

It would give Ireland and Britain an opportunity to deal with the broader issues without this matter being on the agenda.

I genuinely think that is a better approach for us.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider that, even if he cannot give me a definitive answer now.

An early agreement is in the interests of our citizens, who want certainty, and in the interests of business, which needs to plan for changes that might take place in the future.  Of course I want to have an agreement as soon as possible.  I am not going to make concessions in order to get an agreement as soon as possible.  I want to get the best agreement.  If it takes a little longer to get the best agreement for Ireland, so be it.  Under the guidelines agreed by the EU 27 in March, the deadline is the October Council in Brussels.  That is when we hope and expect to sign off on the withdrawal agreement.  It is understood by the EU 27, including Ireland, and by the UK that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  If the text of the backstop were to be agreed in August or September, it would not actually be agreed until everything is agreed.<\/p><p>The deadline for that is the summit in Brussels in October.  It is important to bear in mind why that deadline was put in the guidelines.  It is because the withdrawal agreement and backstop require approval of the UK Parliament and the European Parliament.

The truth, however, is that it means nothing.  Behind the figures he boasts about, there lurks a dark underworld - a battlefield for an almighty assault on the working conditions of workers, particularly women, in this country.  This week marks its escalation, with a number of industrial disputes brought about as a result of brute intransigence by profitable companies refusing to negotiate with unions or to deal with the industrial relations machinery of the State.  Actually, it is becoming quite a trend.  The first is LloydsPharmacy, the largest pharmacy chain in the country.  It has 800 staff, 92% of whom are women.  It is owned by a multibillion dollar US pharmaceutical giant.  This company is in modern &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;.  There are no guaranteed hours.  One can be brought in to work any day at any time.  If one is sick, tough.  The company will not pay one if one is sick, forcing many low-paid workers to work sick in a job where they interface with sick people.  One could not make it up.  Since February 2017, the company has refused to negotiate with Mandate and it is now blatantly ignoring a Labour Court recommendation.  Of course, it does not have any problems at all in accepting the State when it comes to putting its hand out for the significant HSE community contracts from which it profits.<\/p><p>Meanwhile, in the Taoiseach's neck of the woods, another group of workers being forced to take action are those at Ryanair.  They are due to take that action on Thursday next.  We note the irony of Ryanair, the company that wrote the manual on blackmail and bullying, accusing its pilots of bullying.  Is Ryanair serious?  The pilots are simply demanding a master seniority list, something that costs the company nothing but that would provide a transparent mechanism for dealing with base transfers, command upgrades, holidays and the like, which have a major impact on family life.  Of course, Ryanair wants to keep it so that it can continue to bully its staff.  As a former Minister with responsibility for transport, the Taoiseach knows well the root cause of this dispute.  Precarious employment contracts are being used to deny pilots and cabin crew basic employment rights, such as the rights not to be dismissed unfairly and to maternity leave.  We are unique in Ireland in facilitating such employment contracts.<\/p><p>It is about time the Taoiseach started to deal with this rather than talking about it.  We are becoming infamous as a flag of convenience for social dumping.  I want to know what the Government is doing, against the backdrop of employers abandoning the voluntary industrial relations system, to ensure that workers have access to collective bargaining and a right to have their employment conditions protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000009#G00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1531230300,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I am delighted Deputy Clare Daly is reading my speeches.

Let us look at the facts - the CSO statistics.  The unemployment rate peaked at 16% in 2012 when people had trusted Fine Gael, the Independent Alliance and Independents to manage the country's economy.  It is now down to 5%.  The long-term unemployment rate is 2%.  For the past year or so, the number of full-time jobs has been increasing and the number of part-time jobs has been decreasing.  We heard from the left consistent arguments that people were drifting into part-time work.<\/p><p>The facts say otherwise because part-time work is decreasing and full-time work is increasing.  In addition, the number of people in self-employment as a proportion of the entire workforce is stable, so the suggestion that more people are being pushed into self-employment does not stand up.  The proportion of people in self-employment is as much as it was many years ago.<\/p> <p> To answer the Deputy's question about what we are doing, workers' rights legislation is currently being brought through the Houses by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty.  It deals with matters such as zero-hour contracts and banded hours.  It is before the D&aacute;il and I hope Members will co-operate with the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, in getting it passed before the recess this week.  Second, the Cabinet subcommittee yesterday signed off on the straw man proposal, the draft proposal for auto-enrolment.  There is an enormous inequality in Irish society at present where two thirds of people working in the private sector have no pension provision other than the State pension.  People in the public sector generally have good, guaranteed pensions.  We signed off yesterday on our proposals to change that by enrolling automatically everybody over the age of 23 years in a pension scheme, a top-up pension that they can add to their State pension, with the requirement that the employer contributes as well as the person who will benefit in the end.  The State will also make a contribution.  I look forward to the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, producing that, getting agreement on it and drafting the legislation so we can introduce it in 2021 or 2022.<\/p> <p> With regard to the specific industrial relations issues the Deputy raised, as always I strongly encourage both sides, the unions and employers, to make use of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  It is a State body that stands ready to intervene and to help resolve these disputes.  I ask both sides to engage with the WRC, which is more than willing, capable and qualified to help broker a solution in the interests of citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000009#G01000","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531230900,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I have no problem with the Taoiseach repeating his soundbites, if they are his, as much as he wishes if that is what he is into, but a soundbite does not put food on the table.  Statistics show, as Social Justice Ireland did earlier this year, that as the economy has recovered more people at work are in poverty.  Over 100,000 workers at work are in poverty because of zero-hour contracts and precarious contracts of employment.  My question was about that issue.  The Labour Court recovered almost &euro;2 million in unpaid wages last year for vulnerable women workers in particular.  Talking about new legislation is good and we welcome that legislation.  However, the point the Taoiseach is missing is that it is not enough when employers are deliberately ignoring the industrial relations machinery of the State.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of Lloyds Pharmacy, for example, why does the Taoiseach not say that those who do business with the Government, the HSE or otherwise should, as a minimum condition, treat their workers fairly, not have zero-hour contracts and adhere to the principles of equality?  We should be doing ethical business.  If the Taoiseach inserts such clauses in State contracts I guarantee that he will do more for the working conditions of people in the State than through any other measure he might take.  It is a little ironic that we talk about measures such as changes to the constitutional clause regarding women in the home and so forth when we ignore, in particular, the areas where women work and the number of women who are exploited because of the failure to recognise unions.  Lloyds Pharmacy recognises the union of its male workers in the distribution depots, where wages are good, but not the women's union.  People do not want the Taoiseach's soundbites or his talk.  They want to see a little action on some of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000010#H00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1531230900,"counter":53,"content":"<p>The Deputy is absolutely right that soundbites do not put food on the table - jobs do.  There are more people at work in Ireland than ever in our history.  Almost 2.3 million people are now at work.  The working family payment for those in low paid jobs with families, and we improved that payment this year, ensures that people who are in work, do 19 hours work or more every week and who have children are kept out of poverty.  That is the reason we have the working family payment.  The CSO is not a NGO or a lobby group.  It produces official statistics and those statistics show that poverty and deprivation in Ireland are falling and inequality and income inequality are narrowing.  Those things should be welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge we have more to do: there is always more work to do.  We intend to do that work by continuing to build employment, continuing to increase wages and improve incomes, continuing to give more people their money back through reductions in taxation, reducing the cost of accessing public services such as childcare and healthcare and by putting through the type of legislation being brought forward by the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, to enhance workers' rights, ban zero-hour contracts in almost all circumstances and to introduce banded hours.  All of those measures are very much part of the Government's programme to improve living standards.

I visited Monaghan hospital as well, which obviously works in tandem with Cavan General Hospital.  I believe we can do an awful lot more there and that what was allowed to happen there in the past was a shame.

It is important to state that the plantation of forestry is positive and is something that our society needs.  Planing permission is needed for almost every development that happens in the State.  If a person wants to put a different type of gate on his or her house or paint the roof a different colour, he or she has to obtain planning permission.  However, forestry can be planted without practically any planning permission at all.  Planning permission is only required in order to plant more than 50 ha of forestry, which is a very large area.  As a result of this, very few people have had to apply for planning permission at all over the years.<\/p><p>What we are really concerned about here is the type and scale of forestry that is evident in many parts of the country and the visual, environmental and societal impact it has.<\/p><p>The visual impact is certainly something I see in my part of the world, where we have large areas of forestry, mainly, Sitka spruce and pine forests, which grow and block out people's light.  In many places on the landscape we see them break the horizon.  They completely destroy people's lives.  Many people built or bought houses with a beautiful view of a lake or mountains and within a couple of years forests grew in front of them and they have no right to object and no right to say anything to anyone about it.<\/p> <p> Support for the Bill comes from many agencies and groups throughout the country.  Birdwatch Ireland supports obtaining planning permission for forestry.  Other farming and environmental organisations also support obtaining planning permission for it.  Local authorities throughout the country have passed motions in recent years to try to do something to regulate afforestation.  It is more than 30 years since the first motion was passed by Leitrim County Council looking for the obtaining of planning permission for forestry.  That motion was supported by all parties.  <\/p> <p> There is cross-party support almost everywhere in rural Ireland to do something about this problem which we continue to see.  Local authorities have huge issues in that regard, particularly in the case of roads.  Forestry is considered to be a crop which people grow.  When we harvest most crops, they do not have an impact on the road structure, but when forestry is removed, it means trucks coming out with 20 or 30 tonnes of timber onto small country roads and destroying them.  Local authorities have no way of preventing it from happening.  Of course, new entrances are also made in places where places there were never entrances before.  All of these issues continue to blight the landscape and cause huge problems.  <\/p> <p> We also have issues where forestry was planted in areas which have become landlocked.  In my constituency there are many large blocks of forestry of 20 ha, 30 ha or 40 ha that have never been thinned or extracted.  They cannot be extracted because there is no way in or out to them.  They were simply put there because there were very good grants available.  People make money on grants and leave the trees to die eventually or to be blown away in the wind.  This is a huge problem that needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p> The environmental cost of planting the wrong type of forestry is part of the problem that needs to be addressed.  One of the ways to address it is through looking at the need for planning permission.  As well as the visual impact, in seeking planning permission the environmental impact is also looked at.  There is monoculture as pine needles block out the light.  If anyone goes into a forest of grown pine trees, he or she will be under a complete canopy across the top.  The pine needles fall and nothing grows.  It is like a desert inside and there is complete silence.  There are no birds or wildlife, yet we are talking about biodiversity.<\/p> <p> We really need to get hold of and understand the problem, which is the wrong type of forestry is grown.  We have to regulate the industry and ensure we will not destroy communities by having the wrong type of forestry in the wrong place.  It has to be done properly, with continuous cover.  It needs to be done in places where people want it.  It is a very poor sign of our society when people object to the growing of trees beside them.  We need to sit up and listen and realise there is something wrong and that it is a problem that needs to be addressed.  The way to address it is through the obtaining of planning permission in order that people will know what is going on in their community, that they will see a sign going up and that they can object to it if they believe there is a problem.  It does not necessarily have to be a problem but a positive way forward.

It is a straightforward and necessary Bill which will place a statutory obligation on the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, to publish statistics annually for the numbers of children in care.  I know that I speak for many Deputies in the House when I say we have had difficulties in accessing information from Tusla.  Many believe there is something of a closed loop between Tusla and the Department.  One example is the use of voluntary care agreements and the length of time children spend, in some cases, most of their childhood, in what is supposed to be a temporary agreement which can be ended at any time.  This is also something many advocacy groups, care leavers and campaigners have criticised.  For many young people, there can be a complete lack of security.  While most voluntary care agreements are used appropriately, there is a feeling that in a limited number of cases this type of agreement is being used as a quick fix to avoid going through the courts to secure a more appropriate type of care order.  On numerous occasions I have asked parliamentary questions about the number of children covered by certain care orders and their timeframe, only to be informed that this information is unavailable.  The Bill will oblige Tusla to outline annually the number of children in voluntary care agreements and other care types, as well as noting changes to care orders, and to publish this information.  It is about ensuring all data are published.  As I said, this is a straightforward Bill, but it is about ensuring transparency in order that, as legislators, we will have up-to-date statistics and data when it comes to the most vulnerable children in the care system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000018#Q00900","speaker":"1362"},{"type":"speech","time":1531235100,"counter":177,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000018#Q01000","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531235100,"counter":178,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000018#Q01100","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531235100,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1531235100,"counter":180,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000018#Q01300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531235100,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000018#Q01400","speaker":"1362"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531235100,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Standing Orders: Motion","time":1531235100,"counter":183,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000018#Q01600"},{"type":"speech","time":1531235100,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That in accordance with the recommendations under Standing Order 107(1)(<i>a<\/i>) of the Committee on Procedure, and with effect from 18th September 2018, the Standing Orders of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann relative to Public Business be amended as follows:(<i>a<\/i>) in Standing Order 61&mdash;<blockquote>(i) in paragraph (3), by the deletion of all words from 'If the defamatory nature' down to and including 'after the making of the utterance' and the substitution of the following:<br \/><br \/>'If the defamatory nature of the utterance is not apparent at the time during the course of proceedings, and at the earliest opportunity, but not later than six weeks after the making of the utterance, or by the time of the dissolution of the D&aacute;il, whichever is the sooner&mdash;';<br \/><br \/>(ii) by the deletion of paragraph (5) and the substitution of the following:<blockquote>'(5) In any report which it may make to the D&aacute;il on a request, submission or referral under this Standing Order, the Committee may include a response by a person who has been referred to in the utterance by name, or in such a way as to be readily identifiable, and  may make any of the following findings:<blockquote>(<i>a<\/i>) that <i>prima facie<\/i>no abuse of privilege has occurred, in which case the Committee may recommend that no further action be taken by the D&aacute;il or by the Committee in relation to the request, submission or referral;

The bottom line is that the facts now paint a different picture from the rhetoric and soundbites emanating from the Government relating to housing, particularly the fact that homelessness is up 24% since the Taoiseach and the Minister took office last year.  Child homelessness is up an astonishing 32% in the same period, with almost 1,000 more children homeless.  That is unacceptable and represents a clear failure to deliver.

We were told when LIHAF was introduced that 40% of any development with such funding would deliver affordable housing.  That was then dropped with no explanation.  Now, essentially no percentage is guaranteed for money that was supposed to deliver affordable housing.  It is a similar problem with HBFI, which is a major fund for lending to private developers but absolutely no commitment, guarantee or obligation on the part of those who get those funds to deliver housing that is affordable.  What is the point in these initiatives if they deliver large sums to private developers but with no guarantee whatsoever that they will deliver housing that will help address the housing crisis and meet the Government's commitment to address that crisis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000019#R02800","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1531235700,"counter":224,"content":"<p>There are only three minutes remaining in the slot so I ask Deputy Burton to be brief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000019#R02900","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531235700,"counter":225,"content":"<p>There are 15 Cabinet members and there are 19 Ministers of State, only a small proportion of whom are women.

I am happy with the work of my Ministers but of course there are always issues of concern.  Where there is concern, it is shared concern and my job as Taoiseach is to work with Ministers and assist them in meeting their objectives.<\/p>  <p>  We should never forget where we are coming from with housing.  We had seven years during which virtually no public housing was built because the Government was broke.  We had seven years during which the private sector built few houses because the banks were bust and the construction industry was on the floor.  We should not forget where we were in 2011.  House prices were plummeting and many people were distressed because of that.  Many were stuck in negative equity and paying mortgages on houses that were worth far less than they paid for them.  There were ghost estates all over the country, homes infested with pyrite and tens of thousands of construction workers on the dole.  I appreciate that the Leader of the Opposition apologised for that but the people are still suffering from the consequences of the housing, construction and credit bubbles and what they caused.<\/p>  <p>  We are now seeing some progress.  For the past two quarters, rents have increased by 1% or less than 1%.  Having increased dramatically, they are now levelling off and that is encouraging.  We have seen rough sleeping fall by 40% on the most recent count.  Central Statistics Office figures show us that 14,446 new homes were built last year.  That was a 50% increase on the year before and a 75% increase on the year before that.  Of course that does not include 1,000 unfinished houses that were finished and nearly 2,500 that were reconnected.  Student homes are being built too.  We are finally starting to see an uptick in construction.  Some 7,000 houses were added to the social housing stock last year through various mechanisms.  However, we are catching up on a period of seven years when almost no new homes were built, so we have a way to go yet.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asked me if I am happy.  No, I am not happy and I will not be happy until the numbers of people in emergency accommodation are falling.  I will not be happy until home ownership is increasing.  I believe in home ownership.  I know it is not possible for everyone to own their own home but I want as many people as possible to own their own homes.  It distresses me greatly that people who are now buying their first homes are, on average, in their early to mid-30s, whereas it was the case for a long time that people in their mid-20s or late-20s would buy their first homes.  We need that to change.  We need to get back to the situation where home ownership in Ireland is rising again.  That is very much an objective of mine and of Government.  We will focus on this issue in the same way as the previous Government focused on solving the employment crisis.  We want to apply the same effort and commitment to resolving the housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation on Housing Building Finance Ireland is now before the House.  LIHAF has made two funding rounds, if not three.  The objective of LIHAF is to provide infrastructure to sites so that they can be developed for housing with a proportion of those being affordable housing.  I am not sure of the answer to Deputy Boyd Barrett's question but I will check up on it.  Obviously, it is public money and if public money is being used to provide access to sites, then a decent proportion of the homes built on those sites, where practicable, should be affordable housing.  The same principle should apply with Housing Building Finance Ireland.  It is important to bear in mind when it comes to HBFI that the finance is not a grant.  It is a loan and the developers will have to pay the money back in full with interest.  This is something that the taxpayer or Exchequer will benefit from.  It is very different from LIHAF, which is an Exchequer grant to local authorities to access sites.  It is important not to confuse the two.  I know no one in this House has but people in other places have.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of unpaid private parliamentary secretaries has not been pursued.  I do not propose to create any unpaid private parliamentary secretaries, or paid ones for that matter, during the period of this Government.  However, it is something that could be considered for the future.  I am aware that there is an unfair division of labour among Departments, Ministers and Ministers of State.  It is evident that the Departments of Justice and Equality, Health and Housing, Planning and Local Government are required to be in the House far more often whether because of legislation, private members' business or committee work.  There is a case to have private parliamentary secretaries in those busy Departments if they need to be represented in the Chamber all the time.  The Judicial Appointments Commission Bill has been debated for 72 hours so far in this Chamber and the other Chamber.  That is a vast amount of time for the Minister for Justice and Equality and the sole Minister of State at the Department to be in the Chambers.  There is a case for the posts in the Departments with a busy parliamentary load but it is not something that I am pursuing during the period of this Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000020#S00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1531236300,"counter":228,"content":"<p>We are way over time now, Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000020#S00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531236300,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Am I over time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000020#S00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1531236300,"counter":230,"content":"<p>It is not the Taoiseach.

It is a little odd.

The Taoiseach and I disagree on Ireland's role in tax avoidance by Apple, but one thing is beyond dispute or doubt - Apple is an aggressive tax avoider which uses, exploits and abuses loopholes, whether it be in the Isle of Man, on the Cayman Island or here to evade tax.  I find it odd that we do not challenge it about it, or, specifically, that the Taoiseach does not do so.  Instead, we roll out the red carpet; it is given extraordinary access and there is no statement from the Taoiseach to say we think Apple should pay its taxes and that it is unconscionable one of the richest corporations in the world pays less than 2% in tax.  How can that be anything other than obscene?  When the Taoiseach met Mr. Cook, did he mention the extraordinary housing crisis in this country and the massive deficit in investment in water infrastructure, two issues which should be of importance to him, as well as the &euro;110 million deficit in the public health service?  In that context, did he perhaps reconsider, with Mr. Cook, whether it was a good idea to engage in a legal action to try to prevent the &euro;13 billion from being paid into the Exchequer in taxes the European Union believed Apple owed to this country?

That is nonsense.  Apple has been one of the biggest employers in Cork for almost four decades.  I can recall that in the late 1990s, when we had just entered into government, there was huge clamour from the Opposition to do what we could to prevent Apple from closing in Cork.  It was related to its pipeline at the time and so on.  The late Joe Gantly who was managing director of Apple in Cork went to Steve Jobs and told him that they could do different things in Cork, in the provision of customer support and financial operations in the European and the Middle East and Africa, MEA, region.  The level of employment was not significant at the time; I do not think it was as much as 700 or 800.  Its growth has been dramatic and the real innovation has been the advent of touch screen iPhones, the iPod, the music revolution, Apple's research capacity and so on, which transformed its operations in Cork, in both manufacturing and also service support for the MEA region.<\/p>  <p>  Whether we like it, a report was published today on growth in Ireland from the 1980s to date.  Notwithstanding the global financial crisis and its impact on this country, growth has been upward.  Without question, our foreign direct investment policy has been the linchpin of Ireland's industrial and economic growth from the 1980s and before, the 1960s and 1970s.

The result of this decision was a massive placing onshore of billions of euro of such assets.  While the documents to which I refer leave some questions unanswered, they shed some light on the motivations behind a move that is costing the State &euro;650 million a year.  At the time, a senior policy adviser in the tax unit of the then Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation warned against the former Minister's proposal, saying he disagreed with it \"on reputation grounds\" on the basis that it \"would reduce the potential minimum effective tax rate from 2.5 per cent to 1.25 per cent, as 1.25 per cent is too low and such a change could backfire.\"  Rather than taking this advice, the former Minister decided to increase the threshold which was under discussion in the paper in question, from 90% to 100%.  We know from a letter that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, sent to Deputy Pearse Doherty that the Department of Finance admits that Apple raised these precise changes in 2014 during the passage of the Finance Bill.  The Department will not release the minutes of four meetings it had with Apple which was the largest beneficiary of this tax move.

I will ask the Minister for Finance to provide an answer for Deputy Joan Burton in that respect.  I am sure there is a good reason, but I honestly do not know what it is.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is not a tax haven and we do not want it to be one.  We certainly do not want it to be seen as a tax haven.  That is not our industrial policy at all.  We are working with the OECD, particularly in the base erosion and profit-sharing process, to remove loopholes in our tax system that companies or individuals might use to exploit our tax laws.  We have got rid of the double Irish arrangement.  We have also got rid of the idea of state discorporations.  Under the information sharing agreements we now have, we share with the revenue commissioners in other countries how much tax individual companies are paying.  It is really important for us to know how much they are paying in Germany or Ireland because it enables us to make sure tax is being paid.  Today the Cabinet signed off on a further OECD-led international agreement on tax transparency and base erosion and profit sharing.  It will be ratified by the D&aacute;il and enable us to deal with the issue further.<\/p>  <p>  To be frank, large corporations should pay their taxes.  They should pay them in full and where they are owed.  Often, there are disputes about how much is owed and where it is owed.  That applies to all taxpayers.<\/p>  <p>  We dispute the European Commission's view that Ireland gave Apple state aid by means of a special bespoke tax deal.  I ask Deputies to bear in mind that this is a state aid, rather than a tax, case.  We dispute the Commission's argument that many decades ago Ireland gave Apple state aid in the form of a special tax deal that was not open to other companies.  Ultimately, the matter will be decided in the European court.  We do not yet have a court date.  The date for the appeal is at the discretion of the court.  It is expected that we will receive approximately six weeks' notice.  Although Apple's appeal is separate from Ireland's, given that they relate to the same subject matter, it is possible that the court will arrange for the cases to be heard together in what is known as a rejoinder.  The US Government sought for the court to intervene in Apple's appeal, but this was rejected by the general court of the European Court of Justice.<\/p>  <p>  I was asked whether housing had come up during the discussion.  Yes, it did.  Almost every time I meet the chief executive of a major corporation, he or she raises the issue of housing.  It is a major concern for citizens looking for homes in which to live.  It is a major concern for employers also because their employees need homes in which to live.  Increasing housing and rental costs are putting upward pressure on wages.  This is one of the areas in which the Government, the Opposition and the big corporations are totally aligned.  Nobody disputes that we need more housing in Ireland.  Mr. Cook and I had a particular discussion about the need to build many new homes in Cork in the context of the increasing Apple workforce in Hollyhill.<\/p>  <p>  I had a very interesting discussion with Mr. Cook on the proportion of Apple employees who now work from home.  Between one quarter and one third of Apple employees work from home.  This has huge benefits.  It means that more people can live in other parts of Cork and Munster and work from home.  If they have to go into the office just one or two days a week, it makes good sense in finding affordable housing and good planning.  It also spreads the benefits of investment well beyond Cork city to a much wider region.  As broadband is extended to more and more parts of the country, the opportunities for more and more people to work from home are enormous.  That will help in dealing with the transport problems and traffic congestion we face in cities.  It will also help in dealing with climate change.  We had a really interesting discussion on that issue.  Apple could have even more employees working from home.  Other employers might be able to follow its example by increasing the level of working from home.  It would be useful for parents - men and women - if we could enable more of them to work from home.<\/p>  <p>  I was also asked about the minimum effective rate of corporation tax.  I will have to study it because I have not looked at it for a couple of years.  I will have to understand its impact before being able to say whether it is a good idea.<\/p><p>One would certainly have to consider the impact it would have on research and development, the knowledge box and intellectual property.  A big part of our industrial strategy is to encourage more research and development, more intellectual property development and more value creation at the highest end in Ireland.  If the introduction of a minimum effective tax rate were to undermine our knowledge box, it would undermine our industrial policy and tax base.  That would not be a good move.  I would have to understand how the proposals being made by the Labour Party and others would affect the knowledge box, particularly research and development.  Without having studied this, which I admit is the case, I would be concerned that it would be damaging.  I would have to study it properly to give an informed view.<\/p> <p> I do not have the documents that Deputy McDonald has, or at least I do not have them in front of me.  The change that was made to our tax laws at the time in question was linked to the abolition of the double Irish.  That is why the decision was made at the time.  It has been already reversed.  It was reversed by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, in the last budget, if not the one before.<\/p> <p> The matters to which Deputy McDonald referred  were not discussed at the meeting I had with Tim Cook.  I was not at the meeting in question.

While skills policy is primarily a matter for the Department of Education and Skills, my Department supports the work of the expert group on future skills needs, EGFSN, which plays a key role in identifying the future skills needs of enterprise.  Recently completed work and ongoing work being undertaken by the EGFSN focuses on the food and drink sector, design, high-level ICT, Brexit-related skills needs and digitalisation.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the new national skills architecture, the work of the EGFSN feeds into the National Skills Council, NSC.  Together with additional skills and labour market intelligence provided by the regional skills fora and SOLAS, the council, of which the Secretary General of my Department is a member, provides a mechanism for mediating demands on resources in a manner that facilitates the prioritisation of investment in identified skills needs and enhancing the responses by education and training providers to delivery of those needs.<\/p>  <p>  The work of the EGFSN informs my Department's employment permit policy.  Employment permits are part of the response to addressing skills needs likely to continue into the medium term.  Employment permit policy has focused on facilitating the recruitment of highly skilled personnel from outside the European Economic Area, EEA, where skills needs cannot be met by normal recruitment or training.  <\/p>  <p>  The system for determining eligibility for employment permits is flexible and responsive to change, with the list of eligible occupations reviewed on a biannual basis.  It is not, however, intended as a long-term substitute for upskilling the State's resident workforce or sourcing skills from within the EEA.  In undertaking any adjustment in the orientation of the system, the interests of the 219,300 people on the live register in Ireland and the 17.5 million unemployed in the EU 28 must be remembered.<\/p>  <p>  As we have been approaching full employment, I have requested my Department to conduct a review of economic migration policies underpinning the current permits system to ensure our policies fully support Ireland's emerging labour market needs.  This review is scheduled for completion in the coming weeks.  As the review was under way, I became acutely aware of the emerging labour shortages being experienced in the agriculture and hospitality sectors, and I asked that these sectors be prioritised.  This resulted in a pilot scheme being developed to allow workers for specific occupations in the agriculture sector to be sourced from outside the EEA.  The temporary scheme provides for 500 permits for the horticulture sector, 250 for the meat industry and 50 for the dairy sector.  Other recent changes to the regulations removed certain chef grades from the ineligible occupation list.<\/p>  <p>  The strategies in place to ensure Ireland's skills needs are met include the overarching National Skills Strategy 2025 and the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019 and its associated annual implementation plans, in addition to strategies focused on apprenticeships and traineeships, ICT skills, STEM and foreign languages. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000023#V01100","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1531238100,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the reply.  There is no doubt, based on the assessments made by the Department and stakeholders in industry, and by those who analyse the broader economy, that there are massive labour and skills shortages across huge swathes of the economy.

This difficulty is coupled with a shortage of skills in transport, the hospitality sector, agriculture, which the Minister mentioned, and other key areas of the economy.  Therefore, we have a major problem.<\/p>  <p>  The expert group on future skills needs assesses the economy based on a five-year horizon.  Training some of the people takes longer than that so we need to look beyond five, seven, ten or 12 years in assessing what the economy needs.  The most damning point is that there are only four civil servants working in the expert group in the Department to assess what the economy needs.

The sectors sent the information to the relevant Department, which in their case was the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and a case was then made to my Department.

Ireland&rsquo;s overall competitiveness performance remains positive.  Our improved fiscal position and increased cost competitiveness have contributed to Ireland&rsquo;s improved international competitiveness.  This improvement is reflected in a range of metrics, notably economic growth, increased employment, falling unemployment and a strong trade performance.  In particular, our overall strong competitive position is reflected in the strong performance of the labour market across sectors and regions.  The results from the Labour Force Survey in respect of quarter 1 2018 shows employment totalled 2,220,500, up 2.9% or 62,100, from the same quarter in 2017 with employment increasing in 11 of 14 economic sectors over the year.  Notwithstanding this strong position, addressing Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness remains a key economic priority for Government.  We continue to monitor Ireland's cost base and to analyse the factors that are crucial to improving our cost competitiveness. <\/p><p>The Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2018 report, published by the National Competitiveness Council on 1 June, found that the cost base for enterprise is internationally competitive across a range of metrics, including the cost of starting a business, communications costs and average income taxes.

I assure the Deputy that the Department is very focused on spreading investment across the country.  This includes jobs and investment that could potentially arise as a result of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Creating more jobs in the regions is a particular priority for IDA Ireland and my Department.  That is why additional financial resources have been secured to support the strategic response to Brexit by our enterprise agencies, including IDA Ireland.  This is aimed at both capitalising on the opportunities and addressing the challenges associated with the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.  These resources have already allowed for new posts to be created and for an increase in marketing and communication activities.<\/p>  <p>  While, as the Deputy has pointed out, lower accommodation costs are a selling point for cities outside the capital, attracting foreign direct investment to regional areas is not without its challenges.  This is largely because there is a global trend to base foreign direct investment in large urban areas.  For example, they want to be near transport hubs or in close proximity to third level institutions.  Companies also often want to be located near competitors or clusters of other similar enterprises, which means they are more likely to decide to on an urban area.  If they are near others in their sector they can get more workers for their companies.  This can make securing investment a little bit more difficult.  At the same time quality of life is also important.<\/p>  <p>  Despite all that, real progress has been made in the level of foreign direct investment outside the main urban areas.

As a result of the Brexit scenario, 40 companies across the various sectors the Deputy spoke about - the financial, life sciences, technology and engineering sectors - have all chosen Ireland.  I expect more of these companies to come to Ireland because we are English-speaking and we have the fastest growing economy in Europe.  We also have a reputation for having a good, young, educated workforce.  I expect to see more of that because of the rollercoaster effect.  The IDA is targeting that.  We certainly will convey the Deputy's concerns about it to the IDA.  I see more investment coming into the regions because of the quality of life they offer, the talent in them, the universities, other third level institutions and the various infrastructure such as transport hubs.

The report also found that a significant share of cross-Border trade is accounted for by firms that trade simultaneously in both directions.  These two-way traders comprise approximately 18% of firms but accounted for more than 60% of exports and more than 70% of imports.

There is a significant range of different legal, administrative, regulatory and financial systems in place and Northern Ireland is part of the much larger United Kingdom economy.  However, regardless of the political structures in place on the island there is an overwhelming economic case to be made for more economic agreement and I absolutely support and encourage more cross-Border initiatives.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000027#Z01200","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531241100,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I commend InterTrade Ireland on its work.

Enterprise Ireland's be prepared grant is one of a number of supports provided through the Department's agencies.  It was introduced in June 2017, and is a grant support of up to &euro;5,000 for\u00a0SME clients in preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit.  To date 113 companies have been approved for support under this initiative.  However, it is important to highlight that the be prepared grant is one of a suite of initiatives designed to help companies plan for Brexit and complement the range of existing Enterprise Ireland supports to make companies more competitive and resilient in export markets. <\/p><p>So far in 2018, EI has supported 639 Brexit exposed clients.  These supports included 50 innovation grants, 108 competitiveness grants and 100 market diversification supports.  In addition, 180 Brexit exposed clients have participated on trade missions in the first six months of the year.<\/p><p>In terms of Brexit advisory services, EI's seventh Brexit preparedness clinic, which I attended, took place in the Aviva Stadium on 21 June with more than 110 companies attending, 67 of which were EI clients.  Four more clinics are planned over the next six months.  To date, 2,328 Brexit scorecards have been completed, 999 by EI clients, 231 by local enterprise office, LEO, clients and 1,098 by non-clients.  The number of 'act on' consultancy assignments completed is 41 and a strong pipeline is in place.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House <\/i><\/p><p>A range of sectoral round table client discussions have been also convened and are planned, including in financial services.  The LEOs are also providing a range of supports including, in the year to date, 186 clients have availed of Technical Assistance for Micro-Enterprises TAME programme and 137 have availed of 'lean for micro' Brexit-related supports.  Similarly, InterTrade Ireland is also providing a range of supports with, for example, 149 'start to plan' vouchers with a value of up to &euro;2,000 approved to date.In conclusion Deputy, I would emphasis that the\u00a0be-prepared grant is but one of a\u00a0number of supports that are\u00a0helping businesses to plan their Brexit response and I will ensure we step up our work with impacted firms as the potential shape of Brexit becomes clearer in the coming months. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000028#AA00700","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1531241100,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Behind the Minister of State's comprehensive reply there is poor uptake of the various schemes available to companies, for example, 2% of Enterprise Ireland's, EI, clients.

The Department and its agencies work intensively with Irish companies to deal with the challenges and opportunities arising from Brexit.  There are strategies to maintain and grow in the UK market.  The take-up was not as big as we thought it would be in the many companies we have met dealing into the UK market.  Let us give companies credit.  Many Irish companies are confident and competent that they can deal with whatever Brexit throws at them and they do not necessarily need to take up any assistance from EI or otherwise.  We would not be too sure what companies they would be.  We can only go by the companies that come to us with all that we make available to them.  One of the major initiatives we had was the &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme to enable companies fund a Brexit response strategy.  I urge companies to look at the summary of Brexit supports available from the Department.  It goes through loan schemes, tourism, hospitality and everything one can think of.

We must ensure that a sector by sector detailed analysis is done of the impact that various scales of Brexit could have.

In addition, a forensic accountant was identified from a recruitment campaign run by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, and is expected to be appointed shortly.\u00a0 Similarly an enforcement lawyer has been identified and an assignment date is expected shortly.<\/p><p>As senior level vacancies have arisen, there has been a reconfiguration of the skill sets, competencies, roles and responsibilities associated with those posts to better reflect the organisation's current needs.  The investigative procedures used by the office have been fundamentally amended so that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na take the lead in all criminal investigations.  A greater culture of risk management has also been fostered within the office.

Changing the structure of the ODCE from an office to a statutory agency will provide greater autonomy to the agency and ensure it is better equipped to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law.

In 2014, two individuals were convicted for the giving of unlawful financial assistance by Anglo Irish Bank for the purchase of its own shares and in 2016 and one individual was convicted of fraudulent trading on foot of a plea of guilty.  Also in 2016, another individual was convicted for failing to maintain a licensed bank's register of loans to directors on foot of a plea of guilty.  In 2017, a person was arrested and charged with fraudulent trading based on an invoice discounting fraud, entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced, in March 2018, to 18 months in prison, with the final six months suspended.  The person was also disqualified from being a director for a period of five years.  In June 2018, a person entered a plea of guilty on ten counts of offering unlawful financial assistance, relating to loans provided to property developers by Anglo Irish Bank.<\/p><p>Over the past ten years the ODCE has referred files in respect of a number of investigations to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, on foot of which the latter has directed a total of 214 charges on indictment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000029#BB00600","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1531241700,"counter":355,"content":"<p>The Director of Corporate Enforcement delivered his report to the Minister's office this time last year.

Consumers can also refer complaints to it.  In 2017, 2,100 complaints were referred to it, of which 75 were upheld.  The authority's complaints committee has also considered three complaints from online influencers since 2017.  One of these complaints is the one to which the Deputy has referred, involving images of beauty bloggers which had been photoshopped and filtered.  The complaint was upheld.

I am conscious that further efforts are needed to ensure companies in the Border region are resilient to economic shocks, including\u00a0Brexit.

The north-east and north-west regional action plan for jobs will also boost enterprise and job creation across the Border region.

The average annual growth of these firms between 2006 and 2014 ranged between 2% and 3.9%.  Another study undertaken by the Department on economic and enterprise impacts from public investment in research and development in Ireland, also published in 2016, found that among agency firms in manufacturing and services, research and development activity is a characteristic of those firms that contributed most to employment growth between 2000 and 2014.

I have a number of similar cases.  These draconian increases should and must be reversed.  What is the position in the making of a differential rent scheme?  Is it a reserved function of local authority members?  If not, when will it be made a reserved function as set out in the 2009 and 2014 legislation?  It is clear that management in councils throughout the country is now using this confusion to impose huge and savage increases on local authority tenants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000032#EE01200","speaker":"1348","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531244100,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister.  I thank him for the opportunity to outline the current position.  In response to his final question, my understanding is this is not currently a reserved function for local authority members.  I will try to get an answer on the effect of SI 214 of 2014 on the differential rent scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which has not been commenced, provides that the Minister may make regulations providing for matters to be included in a rent scheme to be made by a housing authority, including the manner in which the financial circumstances of households and their ability to pay rent shall be taken into account in determining rent.  This includes the level, type and sources of household income that may be assessed for the purposes of determining rents; the manner in which adjustments may be made to the rent in respect of any obligations imposed on the tenant under the tenancy agreement relating to the maintenance of the dwelling; the amount or method of calculation of any allowances in respect of rent that may be made for dependants; and the procedure for rent reviews during the period of a tenancy, having regard to any changes in household circumstances or income levels.  Section 31(7) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides for, among other provisions, the making or revocation of a rent scheme to be a reserved function.  However, as indicated earlier, this section has not been commenced.<\/p>  <p>  The practice of a national differential rent scheme was abandoned in 1986, when rent setting was devolved completely to individual housing authorities, subject to broad principles laid down in departmental guidance.  Housing authorities are also empowered under section 58 of the Housing Act 1966 to include charges in the rent relating to costs of works and services provided to dwellings under the Housing Acts.  The current practice involves a disparate approach across housing authorities to rent setting for accommodation funded wholly by the Exchequer.  Whereas all housing authorities charge rents related to household income, similar households in similar accommodation are charged varying amounts of differential rent depending on which local authority is letting the accommodation.  Individual authorities also differ on matters such as types and amounts of income reckonable for differential rent purposes.  On that basis it is recognised that a greater degree of national uniformity needs to be introduced.<\/p>  <p>  Considerable work has been carried out by the Department in developing a national rents framework, including common income thresholds and disregards.  The new system aims to be more equitable and transparent, with regulations setting out a common method for determining household income across the country for rent purposes.  This work is now being examined further in light of a broader commitment in Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness to review the disparate systems of differential rent for social housing in place across local authorities.  The objective is to ensure housing supports are fair and sustainable, to prioritise those on the lowest incomes and to avoid creating welfare traps that may prevent people from either returning to work or the private housing market.  The Minister expects the results of this review will be available shortly and on foot of that we will consider the appropriate next steps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000033#FF00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1531244100,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the response but it is the usual Department script.  We need to know why, nine years after the 2009 Act, the rent differential scheme is not yet a reserved function for local authority members.  It is now four years since the introduction of the Housing Act 2014.  Reserving this function for local authority members is an element of both Acts.  Will the Minister of State clarify the position of SI 214 of 2014?  The increases that have been introduced are horrendous.  The example I provided indicated a more than 100% increase but I have numerous others.<\/p>  <p>  There is a new method of assessing incomes of joint tenants or of partners and spouses.  It imposes a 20% rather than 10% assessment of additional income.  In many cases, there are husbands and wives, spouses or partners where one has a half-rate carer's allowance.  The new system reduces the &euro;107 per week of the half-rate carer's allowance by &euro;21.40, or 20%.  These carers are looking after spouses or partners on a 24-7 basis but they are effectively being cut by 20%.  There is a similar issue with family income supplement, as workers on very low incomes entitled to family income supplement lose 20% under these new rent rules.  These are horrendous increases.  When will the process become a reserved function, as indicated in two Acts going back over nine years?  We have heard promises before but they have not been implemented.

The Deputy cannot expect to ask about SI 214 of 2014 and expect me to know the answer off the top of my head but I will get the answer to that question.  The review's results are imminent and the Minister has indicated he will act on it.<\/p>  <p>  It is unfair that there is not a common yardstick for different types of income in the calculation of differential rents across local authorities and the Deputy is right to point that out.  That is one of the main purposes of the review.  This stems from the fact that the common scheme disappeared in 1986 and was replaced with individual rent setting by housing authorities.  There are 31 of them now and there would have been many more in 1986.  The purpose of the review that the Minister will act on is to ensure the same broad standards and system apply in the calculation of differential rents in Tipperary County Council, Kilkenny County Council and every other local authority in the country.

The Act is supplemented by the procedures that all public bodies are required to put in place under section 21 for the making of protected disclosures and for dealing with such disclosures.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills operates within this legal framework when dealing with protected disclosures.  The Deputies will appreciate that there is a legal responsibility on the Department to protect the identity of the individual who makes a protected disclosure.  While respecting this legal responsibility, I am happy to provide the Deputies with an update on the specific issue raised today.  I can confirm that the Department received a protected disclosure relating to CIT in May 2017.  There have been 12 steps to the process since then.  In line with the agreed procedures within the Department, the disclosure was referred to the Higher Education Authority for examination.  Under step two, I understand officials from the HEA made initial contact with Cork Institute of Technology in July 2017 to provide the officials with an outline of the allegations, but in a manner to protect the identity of the discloser consistent with the strict confidentiality provisions set out in section 16.  The HEA has also met the discloser to discuss the allegations in more detail.<\/p>  <p>  Under step three, following an initial response from CIT, officials from the HEA met the discloser to discuss the disclosures in more detail.  Under step four there was subsequent correspondence between the HEA and the discloser arising from that meeting.  Under step five, in light of the additional information arising from this subsequent engagement with the discloser, the HEA has recently taken further steps to examine the issues raised.  Specifically, under step seven, the HEA wrote to the chair of the governing body of CIT on 29 June seeking the definitive response from CIT to the allegations.<\/p>  <p>  Under step eight, the HEA has asked CIT to respond to a specific set of questions relating to the disclosures.  The HEA sought confirmation that CIT is satisfied that academic staff in the department in question are not engaged in any external activities that are in conflict with their roles in CIT.  The HEA sought confirmation that academic staff in that department have sought the necessary approvals to engage in external employment outside CIT.  The HEA sought confirmation that CIT is satisfied that there has been no breach of the code of conduct for employees by academic staff in that department.  The HEA sought details of the actions taken by CIT to investigate any previous or similar complaints or allegations made about those same issues.  The HEA also asked whether CIT has suffered any adverse financial impact as a result of the practices that are alleged to have happened in the protected disclosure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000034#GG01100","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1531244700,"counter":421,"content":"<p>The Department and the HEA know that this has been going on for six years.

The whistleblower needs to be put back in employment and there must be recognition of what was done in the context of the information she gave to Mr. Paul Gallagher.

The decision to close it is ridiculous and follows on from a decision made last year to close half of the inpatient services for the months of June, July, August, September and October last year.<\/p>  <p>  Every parent I know who had a child attend the Linn Dara CAMHS unit in Cherry Orchard Hospital has had very positive experiences and praised the service and the staff, in particular, and acknowledged the benefits for his or her child.  Closing the service is a retrograde step which will add huge pressure on inpatient services not only in the future but also now, as those who cannot access the day service will try to get their children into the inpatient service.  It will also put pressure on the local adult mental health services because the parents of children will have to reach out somehow to get some help or seek relief for their children, as well as some access to psychiatry, social workers, nurses, occupational therapists, dieticians, social care workers, speech and language therapists and educationists who are available in the day services provided in the CAMHS centre.  It is a multi-disciplinary service which has worked well.  I commend the Mental Health Warriors who have protested against the closure and will arrange another this Thursday.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to intervene to ensure the centre will reopen as quickly as possible, which means tomorrow or this week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000035#HH01900","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1531245900,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I echo what my party colleague said.  It is a bit like \"Groundhog Day\".  I raised the closure of 11 beds last year.  Approximately 12 months to the day - there may be a couple of days in it - I am raising the decision to close the outpatient clinic at Linn Dara at a time when the 22 inpatient beds are full.  According to the staff members to whom we have been listening, the HSE is not putting a sufficient focus on this.  We had the same situation last year and - lo and behold - we are back with the same old thing this year.  There is no such thing as forward planning.  Things are breaking down.  The Minister admitted earlier this year that those closure of the Linn Dara beds has put pressure on adult admissions into mental health services.  For two years, this House has been debating the need to keep children out of adult services.  This is another example of the failure to engage in forward planning.<\/p>  <p>  I am aggrieved about the reply I received to a parliamentary question I tabled in respect of Linn Dara services, which asked \"the Minister for Health the estimated annual cost of reopening the closed CAMHS\" beds at the centre.  It is ironic that I received the reply in question on 5 July, which was the day before the closure of the outpatient clinic.  Even though I had asked about the annual cost of reopening the beds, I was told in the reply I received that it had been decided to reduce temporarily from 22 to 11 the number of inpatient beds available at Linn Dara.  I was advised that this temporary reduction was applied from June 2017 to October 2017 and was necessary because of ongoing nursing staff shortages.  I was further advised that funding was maintained throughout the year to assist with the reopening of these beds.  It is like saying, \"We gave them a bucket with no ass in it and sent them to the river to empty it\".  Twelve months on, we are in the exact same situation.  All we are getting is absolute waffle from the Department.  It cannot even answer a question.  I asked for costs.  There is no forward planning.

I know they are genuinely interested in mental health services.  The policy of the HSE, as reflected in its annual service plans, is to provide age-appropriate mental health services to people under the age of 18.  In view of the significant additional funding that has been provided over recent years, I reiterate this Government&rsquo;s commitment to the development of all aspects of mental health, including that relating to young people.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is continuing to make the case for further resources annually, in line with evolving demands and in accordance with the commitments set out in A Programme for a Partnership Government.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE service plan for 2018 commits to further developing child and adolescent mental health services, known as CAMHS.  This is happening against a background where the demand for CAMHS increased by 26% between 2012 and 2017.  Various youth mental health initiatives other than the specialist CAMHS service are also being progressed.  We have 69 CAMHS teams and three paediatric liaison teams supported by approximately 75 CAMHS beds nationally.  Further beds are planned to come on stream as quickly as possible.  The Government has funded an additional 140 psychiatric nurse undergraduates places each year to help to improve the planning and delivery of services over the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of staff recruitment and retention, particularly in the sphere of CAMHS, is a key difficulty that is being addressed on a steady basis by the HSE.  These are two key issues in this debate.  The recent appointment by the HSE of 114 assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists will help to develop counselling services in primary care.  It is anticipated that these posts will deal with less complex child and adolescent cases, thereby reducing the demand on CAMHS.  The Minister of State recently approved ten new posts for advance nurse practitioners that will be specifically directed to the CAMHS service nationally.  These new practitioners will play a key role in delivering better service co-ordination where local service pressures are greatest.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE Linn Dara CAMHS service covers a population of approximately 420,000 across County Kildare, west Wicklow and south-west Dublin.  There are seven multidisciplinary community CAMHS teams for these areas.  The HSE has indicated that a decision was taken by the Linn Dara management team to temporarily suspend its day programme from Friday, 6 July 2018 to maintain essential community and inpatient services.  It is expected that the day programme will reopen in September or October.  This decision was taken due to psychiatry and allied health professional temporary staffing shortages in the community sectors.<\/p>  <p>  To maintain essential provision of services, psychiatry and multidisciplinary staff have been reassigned from the adolescent day programme to maintain other key community-based Linn Dara services and manage their overall capacity at this time.  The small number of young people who were scheduled to attend the adolescent day programme will continue to attend their existing community CAMHS teams and to receive appropriate individual and therapeutic programmes.  The HSE has a statutory responsibility to ensure safe, adequate and sufficient service provision to all areas of the CAMHS service.  The Linn Dara inpatient unit will remain fully operational as normal, with 22 beds and functioning community teams available.  I assure the Deputies that the Minister of State will keep this matter under close review.  All efforts will continue to be made by the HSE to address the ongoing service difficulties at Linn Dara.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000036#JJ00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1531245900,"counter":442,"content":"<p>This closure is unacceptable and inexcusable.

This means that more than 200,000 young people no longer have access to day programmes.  The Minister of State has said they have access to local CAMHS services, but that is not what many of those involved need at this stage.  Most of them have been through the CAMHS service and have been referred to the day service for a particular reason.  If they are unable to access those day services for a number of months, it could be detrimental to their health and future well-being.

As a member of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care, I recently paid a visit to my local Offaly-Laois child and adult mental health service, CAHMS, located at St. Fintan's Hospital in Portlaoise.  Built in 1832, it was formerly known as St. Fintan's Asylum.  It is an intimidating building and much of it is in a poor state of repair.  Even the main entrance steps are damaged, with grey timber panels on either side attached to the railing.  The first impressions are not great.  Internally, however, the Laois CAMHS facility has been upgraded and is modem and bright.  The Offaly service is also run out of this old building.  It has not been refurbished but I was delighted to learn on the day of my visit that there are plans to move to a modern premises in Tullamore, which will result in a better experience for young people.  The new premises will be more accessible to them and their parents.<\/p>  <p>  While on my visit, I was extremely concerned to learn of plans to reduce the staffing levels in the young adult mental health service, YAMHS, in Offaly and Laois.  This service is specifically targeted at those between 16 and 18 and has a fully functioning team and no waiting lists.  I was dismayed to learn during my visit that, at a time when the Government's stated objective is to prioritise mental health services and increase the resources for youth mental health services, the HSE management team in CHO area 8 is planning to cut three full-time equivalent posts in the YAMHS.  This means that one psychotherapist position, two nursing posts and an administrator are due to be cut by the HSE.  This proposal flies in the face of a cross-sectoral commitment to improving mental health services for children and young adults.  We are all aware of the vital importance of access to services and treatment in a timely manner for young people who find themselves distressed or in an emergency.  I know from my dealings with local families who have engaged with the YAMHS in Offaly and Laois that they are highly complimentary of the quality of the service and the dedication and commitment of the multidisciplinary teams working there.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that the service is currently meeting targets for all its performance indicators but the proposed cut to staffing levels would inevitably damage the capacity of the service to cope with the ever-increasing number of referrals it is receiving.  Over five years, the service has dealt with 1,000 referrals.  What plans has the HSE to deal with the young people from 16 to 18 who may be referred over the next five years?  Reducing the staffing levels in the YAMHS is just going to place increased pressure on the CAMHS, which is trying to manage significant waiting lists in Offaly and Laois.  Is it intended to put those patients back into the CAMHS where there are existing waiting lists?  How will emergency cases be dealt with?<\/p>  <p>  I understand that, year on year, the number of children and young people engaging with the service for diagnosis and treatment for conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is increasing.  It is important that our children and young people have access to early intervention and that the necessary professional supports and services be provided at the appropriate time.<\/p>  <p>  Psychotherapists play a pivotal role in the delivery of the youth mental health services, as do the specialist nurses.  The operation of the service requires skilled administrators.  All play a vital role in the lives of the young people who need to access the service.  I am perplexed as to why staff numbers are being reduced at a time when anxiety among young people is at an unprecedented level.  There are myriad reasons for this but there is emerging evidence that social media have a large role in this. <\/p>  <p>  We must ensure that the proposed cutback in this area does not happen.  Can the Minister of State confirm the accuracy of the reports that one of the psychotherapists working in the YAMHS in Laois and Offaly will be leaving their position at the end of July and that two nurses and an administrator will have to leave their posts?  What is the reason for this?  Does the HSE intend to get rid of the YAMHS altogether?  It seems to be providing a service that we all aspire to.  Should the HSE not be trying to replicate this model across the country instead of trying to get rid of it? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000037#KK00200","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speech","time":1531246500,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy for raising this important issue.  I am well aware of the great work of the Oireachtas committee, particularly on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  There are six CAMHS teams in the midlands mental health services.  The staffing levels of these teams are currently at or above the national average.  The staff allocation for the two young adult mental health service, YAMHS, teams in the midlands is also above the national average.  The level of staff in Laois-Offaly YAMHS is at 222.6% of the figure in A Vision for Change and that for Longford-Westmeath YAMHS is at 182.4% of the figure in A Vision for Change.  As such, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has been informed that the HSE intends to reconfigure the staffing levels by removing any unfunded posts, which do not form part of the sanctioned allocation.  This is necessary to provide a service within the allocated resources available and to comply with the policy in A Vision for Change.<\/p>  <p>  Mental health remains a priority for the Government.  This is reflected by the allocation in budget 2018 of an additional &euro;35 million for new service developments, bringing total HSE mental health funding to around &euro;910 million this year.  Since 2012, around &euro;200 million in additional funding has been provided for this care programme, and some 2,000 new posts were approved.  The HSE continues to enhance various aspects of its CAMHS, including improved access at local level for areas such as Laois and Offaly.  There has been increased funding for CAMHS for Laois-Offaly, rising from &euro;1.387 million in 2011 to &euro;2.528 million in 2018.  The overall staff number for the service increased from approximately 16 in 2011 to 34 in 2018.  It should be noted that there has been a significant increase in activity levels for the respective years.  For example, the number of referrals received increasing from 167 to 1,044.  New appointments offered increased from 146 to 797, and the number of new clients seen increased from 107 to 484.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE service plan for 2018 will further develop all aspects of CAMHS, including inpatient or community-based care.  This is a strategic priority action in the plan, against a background where the population of children is increasing and where demand for CAMHS has seen a 26% increase since 2012.  Approximately 18,800 referrals are expected for HSE CAMHS nationally this year, with in the region of 14,300 being seen by this specialist service.<\/p>  <p>  Among the other CAMHS-specific measures included in the HSE service plan for 2018 are: an initiative to increase the number of CAMHS referrals to be seen this year by 27% over the number in 2017; provision for a seven-day-week service for CAMHS to ensure supports for young people, in line with Connecting for Life; and improvement of the day-hospital services within CAMHS.  The HSE is also focusing on enhanced access for older adolescents to specialist mental health services, along with continued appropriate placement and care in CAMHS-specific settings.<\/p>  <p>  I must also mention the broader menial health activity in this area.  The HSE midlands, Louth and Meath community health care organisation, in partnership with community, voluntary and statutory organisations, is developing a regional suicide prevention action plan for the counties of Laois, Offaly, Longford, Westmeath, Louth and Meath.  This local strategy is aligned with the national strategy to reduce suicide, Connecting for Life, in which young people have been identified as a priority group for support and prevention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000037#KK00300","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1531246500,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I just cannot accept this diminution in the service when the Government is increasing budgets to the mental health services every year and, crucially, when the demand for the service is also increasing.  That staffing levels are above the national average, that there are no waiting lists at this point and that the services are dealing with the emergencies when they come to them point to the success of the YAMHS team.  I would not be penalising it by suggesting it is overstaffed, wishing it luck and stating that its staffing number will be reduced to that of others that are not able to deal with those they need to deal with when they need to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has no grade for art therapist.  Art therapy is widely accepted as an important aspect of therapy and treatment for young and old alike.  Now it seems that position is to be dispensed with.  That the HSE does not even have a grade goes to show how little it emphasises something of such importance to young and old alike.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE's stated position in its mission statement on mental health is to \"Promote and protect the mental health of the population, to provide effective services to those who need them making the best use of existing resources and to seek to continuously improve those services making best use of the resources available\".  How can the HSE stand over this decision given the negative consequences for the remaining staff and young patients who are and will be accessing the service?  This development is completely avoidable.  I really resent what the Minister of State said about the service being overstaffed.

It would have been my preference that IDA Ireland did not have such power, particularly as the power to take land from people at the behest of foreign private companies is quite extraordinary, not only in the sense that it is very far reaching but also in the sense of it being very unusual in a global context.  As I cannot table those amendments again, I have put forward amendments Nos. 1 and 3, which at least curb the powers of IDA Ireland under the 1986 Act.  If passed, all the amendments would do is create a situation where IDA Ireland could only exercise its power to use compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, if there was no viable alternative land available for whatever American multinational for which it wishes to seize the land.<\/p><p>For example, if the Thomas Reid case, which gave rise to this Bill, were to be rerun tomorrow with the no-viable-alternative provision I am proposing here, there is every chance that Mr. Reid would not have had to be put through the years of hell through which he was put by IDA Ireland when seeking to grab his lands for Intel.  There would be many other landowners, as there were, in the 2 km radius of the site who would have been willing to sell their land to Intel or to have it compulsorily purchased.  However, Intel wanted his land because it was the easiest option.  I do not believe that facilitating the bottom line of private companies and their shareholders should be our key goal.  It is a little strange that political parties which otherwise would be crying over interference with private property do not seem to be as exercised about this issue as we are.  The key to the provision I am putting forward, as a happy middle ground, is that it would stop people from being forced off their lands and out of their homes purely on the basis of what constitutes the most economically advantageous route for a multinational corporation.<\/p><p>It is worth pointing out that while Thomas Reid was being dragged through the courts by IDA Ireland and Intel in 2014, Intel had global profits of $11.7 billion and our Government deficit was $7.2 billion yet the taxpayer spent &euro;1.4 million going out to bat for this multibillion corporation against one Irish citizen who just wanted to hold onto his land and home.  That is quite incredible.  The literature globally on the use of CPOs talks about them being absolutely appropriate for state infrastructure projects and occasionally appropriate for public private partnerships, which is unsurprising in a neoliberal world order, but the concept of forcibly expropriating land for private multinationals is rare.  It is practically unparalleled on the global scale.  The Bill only deals with CPOs for large industry, which in Ireland overwhelmingly means foreign industry.  In fact, Enterprise Ireland has been specifically excluded from the Bill so if anybody thinks that we are getting land for small and medium sized businesses, we are not.  A review of compulsory purchase order laws by a World Bank senior counsel said that an overarching principle in most cases is that a government's taking powers are extraordinary powers that are intended to meet public needs that are not well addressed through the operation of the market, hence it was not typical for laws to allow governments to use compulsory acquisition as the normal means of assembling land for purposes that are clearly commercial, industrial or for other profitable private uses alone. That is exactly what we are talking about facilitating here.<\/p><p>There is a deep irony in the situation when one considers some of the case law from the United States in the 2000s.  In one instance the state of Connecticut won a case that allowed it to expropriate homes for the redevelopment of an area in the city of New London where the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer wanted to build a research facility.  As a result of the outcry from this case, 42 states changed their laws to prohibit or limit the taking of homes and lands for the benefit of private corporations under the pretext of economic development.  It is interesting that in the wake of that case the then President of the United States, George W. Bush, who was not a famous socialist, signed an executive order restricting the use of CPOs, stating that they were only permitted for the purpose of benefitting the general public and not merely for the purpose of advancing the economic interest of private parties by being given ownership or use of the property taken.  In other words, in the United States, the home country of most of the multinationals that have bases here in Ireland, those companies cannot ask their government to grab land for them.  They can only do that here.  One could not make this stuff up.<\/p><p>There is another lesson from the aftermath of that high profile case.  When it hit the headlines in the United States the public were predictably horrified at the idea that the state had the power to grab land for private enterprise, and the political response to that public horror was to curb those powers.  Ireland had its high-profile court case and the political reaction was to entrench the powers here, the complete opposite response.  It is absolutely disgraceful.<\/p><p>My final point is that the fourth programme of law reform of the Law Reform Commission, which looked at the laws on compulsory purchase, came up with a possible list of guiding principles for reform.  Having reviewed case law and legal principles the commission wrote that in deciding on the approach that should be taken when considering whether a CPO is consistent with an interference with a person's property rights under the Constitution or the European Convention on Human Rights the acquiring authority may intervene with those rights only where it is in the pursuit of a legitimate aim which seeks to further the common good and not solely private interests.

I am happy, therefore, to support amendments Nos. 1 and 3, as we believe they clarify the approach the IDA would be expected to take in considering a CPO, namely, that it may only be exercised where no other viable land is available by agreement.  This spells out the common sense approach the IDA would be expected to take in these rare circumstances and that it strikes a fair balance.  I thank Deputy Daly for tabling these amendments, both of which Sinn F&eacute;in supports.  This proposal strikes the fine balance that must be achieved to ensure that land and property owners are not adversely affected in the pursuit of suitable sites for multinational companies.<\/p>  <p>  On Committee Stage, the Minister of State undertook to come back to on what would happen if land was acquired by CPO but for some reason the use of the land fell through and on whether the land could be sold back to the landowner at the same price.  <\/p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the work and success of the IDA in attracting jobs to Ireland.  We need to focus on bringing more of these jobs to regional Ireland, which will require greater investment by the Government in our infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000039#MM00100","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1531247700,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Daly and Quinlivan for their contributions throughout the entire debate on this Bill.  I thank Deputy Daly for tabling this amendment but I am unable to accept it because it is not necessary to include this provision in the legislation.  The Deputy will be aware that this Bill addresses the implications of the 2015 Supreme Court judgment and seeks to ensure that the IDA will continue to have the capacity to compulsorily acquire property on an exceptional basis, in limited circumstances and subject to strict requirements.  I must emphasise, as I did on previous Stages, that this Bill does not grant any additional or expanded compulsory purchase powers to the IDA.  It remains the case that a CPO will only ever be considered as a last resort in a truly exceptional circumstance where all other viable options have been exhausted.  It is abundantly clear that a compulsory purchase would not be pursued unless it was necessary and this would not be the case if there was a suitable alternative.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate that the aim of this Bill is to modernise and apply fair practice to the IDA's CPO process.  The process used in this legislation is well established process outlined in the Housing Act 1966.  I remind the Deputy that as per the terms of the Supreme Court judgment provision has been made in section 7 for an independent body, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, to take a full adjudication role in the process.  This role, which is written directly into the legislation, is aligned to An Bord Plean&aacute;la's existing role in compulsory purchases carried out by other State bodies.  The consideration of suitable alternative sites is a key part of the existing objection procedure that is overseen by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and will now be applied to the IDA.  For this reason, the amendment is not necessary and I do not propose to accept it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000039#MM00200","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1531247700,"counter":459,"content":"<p>The Minister of State said that a CPO will be used only when all other avenues have been exhausted and for this reason the amendments are not necessary.  This may be the case but that did not happen in the Reid case and there is no reason to believe it will happen in the future either.  The amendment says to multinationals that if they can afford to buy other land from a willing seller, which is viable for their use, they cannot turn to the IDA to get it cheaper by way of a CPO.  This is in line with the Law Reform Commission's recommendations, the Constitution and the European Court of Human Rights.  It is not asking too much.  I need the amendment accepted if I am to support the Bill.<\/p><p>The IDA has had this power since the 1980s but the only time it used it was in the Thomas Reid case.  It is important to point out that in that regard the Supreme Court adjudicated that it had acted <i>ultra vires<\/i>of the 1986 legislation and also that it was objectively biased in its quest to CPO Thomas Reid's home, the objective bias being that the chairman of the IDA at the time of the CPO was also a non-executive director of the consultancy group that targeted the site.  The judge in this case found that a reasonable observer would say that he could not have been objective.  Giving powers to a State agency which is not democratically accountable - An Bord Plean&aacute;la has limited oversight provisions - leaves the door open to massive potential abuses.  There is no guarantee that the same will not happen again.  The Minister of State said that the IDA can only exercise a CPO when all other avenues have been exhausted.  The amendment seeks to copperfasten that.  It is even better for Fine Gael supporters in that the farmers will benefit because the people buying the land will have to go to a willing seller and maybe pay a bit more rather than relying on the IDA.

When we brought it forward on Report Stage, we had a series of amendments that were well intentioned, but there was a need to take more time to consider what would meet the issues we had sought to pursue.  That opportunity was taken in the Seanad and we are now back with an amendment that I think has a broad basis of support.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure a Gaelscoil or a Gaelchol&aacute;iste can give priority to a pupil who has a level of fluency that is consistent with him or her using Irish in his or her normal non-educational context.  That level of fluency, of which the pupil or the parent would have to provide evidence, sets a high bar.  It is not intended that a person would be able go to a na&iacute;onra&iacute; for a year or to the Gaeltacht and be deemed to have priority access to a Gaelscoil.  This will apply to someone who is genuinely using Irish as part of his or her normal life.  The belief on all sides was that such a pupil should have priority access to a Gaelscoil in order that his or her level of Irish would not regress.  That is what we have done.  We had to take care to ensure it would be legally robust because some of the phraseology used earlier as the thinking was evolving did fall foul of some requirements of the Constitution.  We have amended it in such a way that we are satisfied it is robust and technically sound.  <\/p>  <p>  Senator Robbie Gallagher had sought an assurance which I gave to him that when we were setting out the procedures for section 29 appeals, we would set out additional guidelines for how the provision should be interpreted.  We intend it to be a high bar.  The Senator and others, including Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to whom I spoke outside the Chamber, wanted that assurance.  We can give it through the procedures for section 29 appeals and the intention of the Oireachtas will be clearly conveyed.<\/p>  <p>  I should mention that Seanad amendment No. 31 requires a small amendment to be agreed verbally.  A new paragraph (h) was inserted.  Because of that I have to name the next paragraph h(a).  Amendment No. 31 made in the Seanad on Report Stage inserted a new paragraph (h) in section 62(7) of the Education Act which was inserted by section 9 of the Bill.  That results in two paragraphs labelled as (h) in this section of the Act of 1998.  Accordingly, I am requesting the Clerk of the D&aacute;il to renumber the second paragraph (h) as paragraph h(a).  This correction will have no effect on the wording or meaning of the text or provision, but it is necessary in order to avoid a numbering anomaly in the Bill.  Amendment No. 31 provides that a Gaelchol&aacute;iste can give prior access to students of a Gaelscoil.  This is already provided for in the case of feeder schools, but Senators wanted it to be written into the legislation and it was passed in the Upper House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000043#QQ00100","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531249800,"counter":539,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531249800,"counter":540,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 31:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1531249800,"counter":541,"content":"<p>This is the amendment about which the Minister just spoke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000043#QQ00400","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1531249800,"counter":542,"content":"<p>It was discussed with amendment No. 30.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000043#QQ00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1531249800,"counter":543,"content":"<p>May I make the renumbering amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000043#QQ00600","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1531249800,"counter":544,"content":"<p>It is only a clerical correction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000043#QQ00700","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1531249800,"counter":545,"content":"<p>It is agreed to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000043#QQ00800","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1531249800,"counter":546,"content":"<p>It is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000043#QQ00900","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531249800,"counter":547,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531249800,"counter":548,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 32:\r\n\r\nSection 9: In page 26, to delete lines 21 to 28 and substitute the following:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531249800,"counter":549,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531249800,"counter":550,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 33:<\/p><p>&lsquo;Irish language school&rsquo; means a school that provides education through the medium of Irish;\r\n\r\n&lsquo;level of fluency in the Irish language&rsquo;, in relation to a student, means a level of fluency indicative of what would be expected of a student who uses the Irish language as a normal means of communication in a non-educational environment, taking into account the age and any special educational needs of the student concerned.&rdquo;.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531249800,"counter":551,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531249800,"counter":552,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 34:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531249800,"counter":553,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531249800,"counter":554,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 35:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531249800,"counter":555,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1531249800,"counter":556,"content":"<p>Seanad amendments Nos. 36 to 39, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000043#QQ01900","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531249800,"counter":557,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 36:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1531249800,"counter":558,"content":"<p>These four amendments were all agreed to on Committee Stage in the Seanad.

It has taken a long time to get it through, but the time taken has been well used in that we will succeed in getting to introduce new provisions that Deputies on all sides want to see.  One deals with religion in the context of admissions policy.  We now have a provision that has broad support.  We have also introduced a provision such that not only can the NCSE ensure a child with special needs will be accommodated in a school but also that schools will open special needs units where needed.  That was something many Deputies believed was a invaluable part of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  We have also succeeded in dealing with access to Gaelscoileanna.  More widely, the Bill gives more certainty and provides for transparency and fairness in the way we administer admissions.  It will make a significant contribution to the modernisation of the way we run schools.  Everyone recognises that Ireland is changing rapidly and the system has to respond.  Many of these issues will be revisited in the future.  It is recognised on all sides that the situation is evolving, but this is an important contribution.  Many people have put a lot of time and effort into the amendments and developing the Bill.

In fact, my only complaint, to which the Minister did allude, is that it has taken so long to get it through.  It has been knocking around for years.  It is one year since the leader of my party offered it as one of five Bills that could be progressed quickly.  I think we have got two of them through.  Both were in the area of education, the Technological Universities Act and this Bill.  I do not think either the D&aacute;il or the Seanad can be faulted for the fact that it has taken a long time to get the Bill through.  I do not know the reason it has taken so long.  In fairness to the Minister, he has achieved consensus on the Bill and taken ideas from the Opposition such as the provision dealing with special classes.<\/p><p>He has also taken on board ideas on the Gaelscoileanna.  A genuinely collaborative effort has been adopted to pass the best possible legislation.  <\/p> <p> I welcome all the Bill's provisions.  I have spoken to people involved in Catholic schools, and it is clearly the case that those schools have no fear of this Bill.  In fact, quite a few schools had moved away from a baptism barrier in recent years.  The barrier was operating, but quite a few schools operating it had made it clear that a different approach was desired.  Those schools will not now be able to operate a barrier, which is good news in some of the areas affected.<\/p> <p> While it is great to pass legislation, the unrelenting focus must be on resources for our schools.  Wee have to ensure they have the time, wherewithal and money to put some of the Bill's provision into practice.  It involves drawing up a policy in each school, which is not expensive but which adds to the administrative hassle in schools.  We must be conscious of that; I am always slow to legislate because of that consideration.  The target of 400 new multi-denominational schools set by the Minister must be massively ramped up.  It is one thing to remove the baptism barrier, but it must be remembered that people are entitled to education in an ethos other than Catholicism.  One way of doing that is by honouring that commitment, which has been happening very slowly so far.  It has to happen. <\/p> <p> I again pay tribute to Mr. Graham Manning, who brought the issue of special classes to the fore.  We were all aware of it, but he brought it to our attention, and an opportunity to bring in a legislative provision to deal with the issue was spotted in this Bill.  Mr. Manning is an ordinary citizen who brought his concerns to his local representatives in Cork, who then forwarded them to the education spokespersons of the various parties in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  He has managed to get the law changed.  We took the issue up as a priority and told the Minister that we would not facilitate the Bill without it, even though there was reluctance at some levels within his Department to include this measure.  In fairness to the Minister, he accepted it and worked collaboratively with us on that.<\/p> <p> We do not want any delay on the commencement of the sections, which has become a feature of legislation in the past year or so.  We will insist on that, and I do not believe the Minister will have any difficulty with that approach.  We have worked well on this.  It is a signal moment in Irish education, and represents a big change.  Indeed, it will probably signal further change in terms of the ethos of schools in Ireland.  There are other debates to be had, but I want the main focus to be on resources and on making sure that our schools are able to educate our students without being tied up in knots, rules and regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000043#QQ03600","speaker":"1225","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531250400,"counter":575,"content":"<p>Seanad amendments reported.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill 2017: Order for Report Stage","time":1531250400,"counter":576,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000044#RR00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1531250400,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Report Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000044#RR00300","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531250400,"counter":578,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill 2017: Report and Final Stages","time":1531250400,"counter":579,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000044#RR00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1531250400,"counter":580,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 6 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000044#RR00600","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1531250400,"counter":581,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>In page 6, to delete lines 18 to 25 and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;(a) section 344;<br \/><br \/>(b) section 935A;<br \/><br \/>(c) section 935B;<br \/><br \/>(d) section 935C;<br \/><br \/>(e) section 935D;<br \/><br \/>(f) section 936;<br \/><br \/>(g) section 941A;<br \/><br \/>(h) subsections (4) and (5) of section 996;<br \/><br \/>(i) subsections (7) and (8) of section 1220;<br \/><br \/>(j) subsections (3) and (4) of section 1277;<br \/><br \/>(k) section 1441;<br \/><br \/>(l) section 1448.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><p>With this group of amendments we are asked to choose how we should provide in law for the few companies which find themselves unable to meet the deadlines for transparency obligations.  These are important obligations that come with the privilege of limited liability.  They provide that an annual return and financial statement must be filed with the Companies Registration Office, CRO.  The approach I propose in amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 6 seeks to help companies avoid late filing in the first place.  After all, companies which file on time face no late filing fees or applications to court for more time, and keep any entitlement to the audit exemption.  It also means the financial information provided is relatively up to date and therefore has the benefit of being useful to all companies.  <\/p><p>Deputies Kelleher and Quinlivan have both tabled amendments proposing that we continue to permit companies which are late to apply to the District Court for extra time.  That approach only benefits a few companies and undermines the protection that transparency brings for all, but I will return to their amendments shortly. <\/p><p>It is important to remember the purpose of asking companies to file on time.  This is done because public filing by each company is an essential protection for all other companies, suppliers and employees who rely on meaningful financial information.  The law currently allows up to 11 months after the end of a financial year for public disclosures.  This is not onerous, especially when the recent simplifications that have been introduced are considered.  Any further delay in publishing this information means that it becomes less useful for anyone trying to assess whether a company can meet its financial obligations, that is, pay its bills and wages owed. <\/p><p>My amendments will streamline the process for filing annual returns and financial statements with the CRO.  We have excellent levels of compliance - approximately 95% - but we can still improve.  My amendments seek to bring practical and real time saving benefits to all companies.  The amendments retain the full period currently allowed for filing but remove one interim step so that the annual return and the financial statements may be filed in a single step.  I hope that the amendments proposed will be supported by the House.  <\/p><p>We have a choice between amendment No. 3, which is an integral part of my approach, and amendment No. 4 in the names of Deputies Kelleher and Quinlivan.  Due to the way in which the amendments are structured, we cannot have both.  Amendment No. 4 represents a backwards step.  I accept the spirit in which both Deputies have tabled the amendment, and that they are motivated to act on behalf of the few small companies which are unable, for genuine reasons, to meet filing deadlines.  I can see the point they are making, and I have received representations from local accountants on this matter.  That is why I have tabled amendments to help those small companies avoid being in that situation in the first place.  However, I do not agree that going to court is the solution.  <\/p><p>The provision the Deputies are seeking to maintain only came into operation in 2015, and experience has shown that it is not appropriate as it risks undermining transparency and can be used to avoid proper disclosure.  Last year, just over 1,000 companies were granted an extension of time by the courts.  That may not seem like many companies, but each one of those is likely to have a network of suppliers, employees and other creditors.  The purpose of filing annual returns and financial statements in the first place is so that those suppliers, employees and other creditors can access that information.  Each time a company goes to court for an extension of time, the result is that its financial statements may not be publically available for as much as two years after the end of a financial year.  This renders the information almost useless to third parties.  Clearly this undermines the protection that transparency is intended to give to creditors and employees.  In effect, amendment No. 4 rewards the few companies that fail to meet deadlines at the expense of the vast majority of companies that comply with the law every year.<\/p><p>I am advised by my officials that the experience of the CRO is that a number of companies are persistently late.  These companies do not face a once-off, genuine circumstance we can all understand, but rather are repeat offenders.  They are happy to work the system by paying the late filing fees and applying to the courts to withhold information.  It is not right that some companies can deliberately abuse the system in that way.  As legislators, we have made several changes over the past few years that make filing and financial reporting obligations easier and simpler.<\/p><p>We have extended the audit exemption to more companies.  It is only correct that we also consider the rights and the interests of others that rely on timely and meaningful disclosure.  For this reason I have reservations about the amendments proposed by Deputies Kelleher and Quinlivan, but I am happy to listen to their arguments.

Nobody wants to be argumentative about ensuring compliance with company law.  In recent times, there have been some high profile cases of people breaching company law.  We need, therefore, to ensure integrity in the process and that we have a system in place where suppliers and people who trade with companies have confidence in the accounting system and certainty that the books they present on an annualised basis are fair and compliant.  It is critically important for the confidence of people trading with a company to know that what is said in the accounting system and on their accounts is audited and signed off.  By and large, that happens with almost all companies.  However, a small proportion of companies fail to comply in a timely manner each year.  They currently apply to the District Court.  Fewer than 0.5% of companies apply to the District Court because of late filing.  It is not as if the number of companies that are taking this particular route is hugely significant.<\/p><p>With that in mind, we believe that this procedure should be retained at District Court level.  Most of the companies that apply are doing so for genuine reasons.  This change would penalise small companies by forcing them to pay exorbitant fees to go to the High Court.  An appearance at the High Court will cost at least five to six times what it will cost to go to a District Court.  That in itself  is a huge inhibitor for companies that have been unable, for good reasons, to comply with the filing process laid out in statute.  That is the main reason. <\/p><p>Within that, the companies could have genuine reasons for late filing.  There could be <i>force majeure <\/i>in the form of<i><\/i>something happening to one of the directors.  There could be myriad reasons why they are late in filing, yet we will compel a company to go to the High Court if this legislation is passed.  That is unacceptable given that every day of the week we come in here and talk about small and medium-sized businesses being put to the pin of their collar.  We were talking about it today during Oral Questions.  We talk about the pressures on small businesses, the exorbitant costs, the creeping anti-competitiveness in the economy and so on.  To be consistent, these matters should be dealt with by the District Court.  That is why we will oppose amendment No. 3 and press amendment No. 4.<\/p><p>We need to ensure that there is unanimity in the House where corporate governance is concerned.  We need to ensure there is integrity in how we govern companies and how we enforce company law.  I believe in all of that.  Equally, I also believe in fairness, proportionality and in ensuring that we do not use a sledgehammer to crack the odd nut.  Unfortunately, the High Court is a place where we will be sledgehammering an awful lot of small nuts.  Instead, I urge that we go down the route of proportionality and leave these matters to the District Court.  It is not a huge number; just over 1,000 companies go to the district court because of late filing.  It is less than 0.5%.  It is not locking up the court system or judicial system, but it does allow a company with a good reason to make its case to the District Court without having the burden of exorbitant fees placed on it, which would arise if it had to make its case at the High Court.  I urge the Minister to look at it through the lens of proportionality.  That suggests that the District Court is the place to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000045#SS00500","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1531251000,"counter":587,"content":"<p>First, thank the Minister and her officials for forwarding the notes on the 40 amendments she has tabled to what was a complex Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Along with Deputy Kelleher, I have tabled two amendments.  A large number of small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and accountants got in touch with us during the last few months.  They were concerned about sections 9 and 10 of the Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill 2017.  They were unhappy about changes in this Bill which would see District Court judges being allowed only to waive the late filing fees and not to save the audit exemption.  To preserve the audit exemption status of the company, an application will  have to be made to the High Court, which will be prohibitively expensive for most companies.  Therefore, our amendment seeks to maintain the current situation, which would allow companies who have missed the filing deadline due to mitigating circumstances to make an application to the District Court to save the audit exemption.  <\/p>  <p>  This is a fair approach to take for most SMEs.  I have an issue with amendment No. 3, which provides for the deletion of section 343(7) of the Companies Act 2014.  Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il's amendment seeks to retain this subsection while deleting lines 4 and 5 of page 8 of the Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill 2017.  We cannot support the Minister's amendment as it goes against our own amendment.  In addition, Sinn F&eacute;in will not support amendment No. 7.  We are happy to continue to support the other amendments tabled by the Minister, and to support the rest of the Bill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000045#SS00600","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1531251000,"counter":588,"content":"<p>I too have no big issue with the Bill.  As Deputy Kelleher said, fewer than 0.5% of companies apply to the District Court on foot of late filing.  However, that option is available.  It is a local solution and it is not overly onerous or expensive.  I know that we want to uphold the concepts of good governance and proper accounting, but I feel we are legislating here to deal with white collar crime, or bigger companies who might prevaricate and delay or go to courts for reasons that are not always genuine.  In doing this, we will catch and penalise small companies.  I refer to limited companies that are small and that do not have the resources, the time or the ability to go to the High Court.  They can put their reasons for late filing forward at the District Court.  They can file returns late if they have genuine reasons.  The matter is resolved locally, and the companies are not afraid to go before their peers or the local District Court.  The High Court, as any of us who has been there will have seen, has a backlog amounting to hundreds of cases.  It is a totally unwieldy system as it is.  All kinds of cases are heard, and a business that has to appear there will have to pay solicitors and barristers and junior counsel for three days, which is punitive.  It is using a sledgehammer to crack a chestnut and it does not make sense.<\/p>  <p>  Let us leave this at local level to the District Court.  I ask the Minister to consider sections 9 and 10, because they provide for another layer of expense and difficulties foisted on SMEs and small companies that cannot afford it.<\/p><p>It is different for the conglomerates and the big heavy hitters as they have their own legal teams on hand all of the time.  They are used to dealing with various issues causing late filing, for example, trying to take over other companies.  There are genuine cases where people have ill-health or something has happened so accountants are unable to file.  A couple of years ago my accountant's mother died.  One tax officer was very lenient with him but another was very demanding that all of the companies he represented had to have filed by the deadline no matter who died or what happened.  There needs to be flexibility.  As we know, the majority are paying their way and paying their taxes.  They want to work with their accountant locally.  The accountant does not have time to be going off to the High Court.  I appeal for common sense to prevail.  It is difficult enough for businesses having to engage with company legislation and the plethora of other legislation, such as employment legislation and health and safety legislation.  It is putting huge demands on companies and there is not a lot of leeway.  I support the amendments that have been tabled proposing that this be left at local level in the District Court.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000045#SS00700","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531251600,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the Minister sent us an explanation of her amendments, and she has moved a little in terms of the 56 days and some modification on the link with audit exemption.  The one year period is somewhat of a change.  The point being made, which was made in correspondence we all received, is that Ireland is the only country in the EU that links audit exemption to late filing.  It is this link that is the problem.  It is because the two are linked that the late filing issue is of such concern.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned that any process whatsoever for anybody, in particular for a small business, would be prohibitive in terms of the cost of the High Court as opposed to the cost of the District Court.  I do not understand why the District Court is not kept within the picture.  Surely anything that can be done at District Court level should be done at that level rather than at High Court level.  The response we have received is still that the accountancy companies are concerned, particularly with the effect on a relatively small number of small businesses.  We all acknowledge this is a complex Bill, but for the sake of what are relatively small proposals coming from the Opposition, I ask the Minister to consider what is being proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000046#TT00200","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1531251600,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this because I have a gripe with regard to small companies having to go to the High Court to get the deadline extended.  Today, I had contact from a person whose accountant was sick.  That person received a fine because the deadline was missed by a few days.  The small companies in my neck of the woods are all family-run operations.  They have to work all of the hours God gives them to make ends meet.  On my way here this morning, I received a call from a fellow trying very hard and just because his accountant was sick and could not do the accounts he has to pay a fine.  This man can do everything but he is not good at paperwork and he depends on his accountant to keep things straight.  This is what has happened to him.<\/p>  <p>  It will be very prohibitive and costly for companies if they have to go to the High Court and employ barristers, and we know what they cost.  I appeal to the Minister and I will vote against this part of the Bill because it is not fair on small companies.  I do not know who thought up this idea.  I do not know whether it is the Government or the officials, but I regret very much this is what they are at because these small companies are the people keeping us in here.  They are paying the Bills for the civil servants, the Members and the local authorities, and they help to pay for the services.  If we nail these people by insisting they must go to the High Court to extend the deadline it will be a very regrettable day.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad I have an opportunity to lodge my complaint against this.  There are many things going through the House, but we are going to hurt small companies with this.  The District Court is well able to deal with it.  The way the thing has gone now, it is totally loaded on the side of the State because there are only so many days to make returns.  People do not have a C2 certificate for the year any more.  It is now on a two monthly basis.  It is a hard struggle for many companies out there.  I do not know what line of business the Minister is in besides politics, but I know what small employers are going through because I am one and I know about many others.<\/p>  <p>  What happens on top of everything is the people who are working hard are caught by the big contractors for massive sums of money at the end of the jobs.  We have asked the Government to do something about this.  The big contractors do not care when they are tendering because they know they will not pay the subcontractors at the end of the job but will let them go whistle their ducks and not pay them the last of their money.  I know of one company that had &euro;20 million practically written off.  It reddened people from Malin Head to Mizen Head and down through the country, including small shopkeepers and operators who needed their money but they left them without it.  They are after getting away scot clean.  They are out now and they will pay a sum of 5 cent in the euro to all of the creditors who are struggling.  One young fellow was left without &euro;600,000, and that is the truth.<\/p>  <p>  We are doing nothing to help the people who are affected.  We are doing nothing to prevent the larger companies from doing this.  They are able to get these jobs because they have such a big turnover.  There are only so many of them allowed to tender for the big contracts or any worthwhile contract.  One of the bars to being allowed to tender is turnover.  These companies have the turnover, which is why they can put in whatever price they like and let the small businesses suffer at the end of the line because they will not get the last of their money.  This is happening.  It is not happening just in Kerry.  It is happening throughout the country.  To think we are coming in here this evening and agreeing that these poor contractors or companies, that are trying to put bread on the table and working very hard for their money and not getting it for nothing, should come up to the High Court or go to the High Court in Tralee or Cork to extend their deadline.  This is highly unsatisfactory and I ask the Minister to drop it because it will hurt a lot of small businesses and drive them further into the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000046#TT00300","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1531251600,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Danny Healy-Rae that small companies are the backbone of the economy.  We need to be very careful the actions we take do not hinder them in trying to survive.<\/p><p>We have seen some of them survive for many years on very little and they have kept many people employed, sometimes to the detriment of the company owner, etc.  We need to bear that in mind.<\/p> <p> I have not followed this Bill's passage through the Houses so far but it is odd that the Minister is suggesting we go to the pre-2015 mechanism of the High Court.  Anybody who has been to the courts or looks in the newspapers can see that the High Court is clogged and one cannot get hearings but the Government wants to transfer this process from the less onerous District Court, where it could be done quite quickly.  If the process is transferred to the High Court, there would be a huge cost both for the State, I presume, and also for small companies that cannot afford the expense.  We need to be careful with any step we take that there are no unforeseen circumstances.<\/p> <p> When the Minister introduced the amendment, she spoke about persistent offenders and companies that continuously file late.  There is usually a reason for this but if companies are persistent offenders, there is a way to address the issue.  I presume that the State can go to court and argue that it is the first, second, third or tenth time that a company has applied for an extension.  An extension would not have to be granted because in a court, a judge can take a decision based on the evidence.  If the Revenue Commissioners are not happy with the same companies persistently seeking extensions, they should note that in court.<\/p> <p> It is correct that deadlines are onerous and that our tax system is secure.  Another recent change in society is the trend towards making everything into a company.  Community development projects are now companies, as are sports clubs and charities, although they have charitable status.  I do not have a problem with all of those having to comply with the law but it can be very onerous on a community development programme, for example.  I am involved with a number of these and I am the treasurer at one of them.  It comes up every year and we must comply with the law like everybody else, despite it being so onerous.  It is the same with charities, which do not operate at a profit and which cannot necessarily always afford the large fees charged by auditors and accountants.  They often try to make do with their own books and when the time comes to file, they may not be in the correct order.  The onus is on a small company, charity or community development project to organise its affairs in a proper manner.  I am not saying they should not do so.  There is the threat of High Court proceedings, with such an extra cost that could end up damaging companies trading with nominal costs, such as charities.  It could end up with those companies closing.<\/p> <p> Will the Minister bear in mind that she should not move towards a High Court process?  The District Court is sufficient, particularly for the smaller companies.  With persistent defenders, the State just needs to defend itself and argue that these companies cannot continuously get extensions.  Perhaps the Minister should consider giving companies only three extensions in a ten-year period or something of that nature.  It could be the mechanism to force companies to get their act together, which must happen.  Companies must ensure that files are returned, although there will be occasions when some may not have the wherewithal to do that.  Sometimes there are odd incidents where people have not been able to file an account because of sickness, etc.  Such things happen and that is why the mechanism is there in the first instance.  It is not meant to be as onerous as having the large cost of a trip to the High Court for a small company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000046#TT00400","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531252200,"counter":594,"content":"<p>As already stated, I have reservations about deleting section 9.  However, I have heard the Deputies' arguments and I realise that there is a support for removing it in its entirety.  On that basis, I will not move amendment No. 3.  I have also outlined my concerns about the application to the District Court for an extension of time but I accept the spirit in which Deputies Kelleher and Quinlivan have brought forward this amendment.  I clearly say I am not trying to target small companies which for genuine reasons may end up filing late but I am trying to target companies repeatedly filing late, perhaps for cynical reasons and in order to withhold information and reduce transparency.  By deleting section 9, this will continue.  It sometimes happens that a company waits until the CRO sends an enforcement notice and then it applies to the court, which puts a stay on any enforcement until the grant decides on whether to grant a time extension.<\/p>  <p>  The CRO is introducing a new information technology system that will make it easier for us to obtain accurate figures on the profile of companies that are persistently filing late.  Deputies will agree that there should be repercussions for those companies that are abusing the system.  I hope the Deputies will keep an open mind and perhaps this is a matter we can keep under review.  If, when we collect the data, we find there is a cohort of repeat offenders, perhaps we can revisit the matter.

Since 2003 it has been the policy of successive Governments that where a company files its annual return late, any entitlement to the audit exemption shall be lost for two consecutive years.  As things stand, this applies to a past financial year and the current financial year.  However, this look-back to a past financial year that may be long finished can be particularly costly and time-consuming.  Therefore, my amendments to sections 363 and 364 of the Companies Act 2014 remove the requirement to audit the current financial year as, in practice, this is the past year, as well as the following year, which is typically the year in train.  We have replaced that requirement with an obligation to audit the financial year in train and then the following year.  These amendments will be of practical benefit for those few companies which find that they are unable to meet their filing deadlines.  There no longer will be a need to look back in time to conduct the audit.  This should reduce the cost and impact of the audit for companies.  I understand that two of the larger professional accountancy bodies have supported this move as a practical improvement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000048#VV01700","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531252800,"counter":615,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1531252800,"counter":616,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 8 to 11, inclusive, 13 to 17, inclusive, 19, 22, 26, 28, 31 and 32 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000048#VV01900","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1531252800,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 8:<\/p><blockquote>In page 16, line 3, to delete &ldquo;section 957A&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;section 957AA&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><p>The amendments in this group are all technical.

This important legislation seeks to amend certain provisions of the Insurance Act 1964, as amended, to clarify the role of the Insurance Compensation Fund, ICF, and to implement the recommendations of the review of the framework for motor insurance compensation in Ireland report of 2016.  The review was triggered following the failure of Setanta Insurance, a Maltese incorporated company, in 2014 and the uncertainty that followed over compensation arrangements for third-party claimants which highlighted weaknesses with the current insurance compensation framework in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The cause of this uncertainty is the fact that there are two insurance guarantee schemes in place in Ireland with differing compensation levels, namely, the ICF and the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI.  The ICF covers the liabilities of non-life insurance policy holders in the event of a failure of an insurance undertaking and covers 65% of a claim or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser, and the MIBI&rsquo;s primary purpose is to compensate victims of road traffic accidents caused by uninsured drivers and unidentified vehicles and covers 100% of a claim, subject to a limit of &euro;1.22 million in the case of claims for property damage.  This uncertainty was reinforced when, taking account of a clearly outlined reference to MIBI in the ICF legislation, the Law Society of Ireland brought a case to the High Court seeking that MIBI was liable to pay the Setanta third-party claimants.  The outcome of this case was that in September 2015, the High Court ruled in the Law Society&rsquo;s favour and the Court of Appeal, in January 2016, upheld this decision.<\/p>  <p>  This was the context in which the review of the framework for motor insurance compensation in Ireland was carried out in 2016.  The review made a number of recommendations which are addressed in the Bill, with the key recommendations being that the level of compensation from the ICF for third-party motor claims be increased from 65% to 100% in line with that currently provided by MIBI, and the increased coverage of the ICF be funded by a direct contribution to the ICF from the motor insurance industry via the MIBI to the value of 35% of the third-party motor insurance claims. <\/p>  <p>  Subsequently, in May 2017 the Supreme Court overturned the decisions of the High Court and Court of Appeal and found that the ICF was liable for the payment of compensation to Setanta third-party claimants.  The major effect of this was that Setanta third-party claimants who had previously thought they were going to receive full compensations were now only entitled to 65% of their claim or &euro;825,000, whichever was the lesser.  As a consequence, the Minister for Finance after appropriate consideration agreed that Setanta third-party claimants will receive 100% of a claim subject to a limit of &euro;1.22 million in the case of claims for property damage and this decision is reflected in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  As Members will be aware, the heads of the Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in March 2018 and I welcome the report of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  The report contains a number of recommendations regarding the heads to which I will return later.<\/p>  <p>  I will now outline the main elements of the Bill, which comprises 17 sections.  Part 1 deals with preliminary matters, including the Short Title of the Bill, definitions of terms used in the Bill and the authority for expenses incurred in the administration of the Bill.  A separate commencement of Part 4 is included to allow the MIBI adequate time to put arrangements in place for the new motor insurers insolvency compensation, MIIC, fund.  This part also provides for the transfer of functions relating to the administration of the ICF from the office of the accountant attached to the High Court to the Central Bank and relevant functions in relation to applications to the High Court, to the State Claims Agency, where liquidations are already in progress. <\/p>  <p>  Part 2 deals with matters relating to the transfer of the administration of the fund such as the preparation of final accounts of the ICF, the payment of any moneys in the ICF to the Central Bank and the transfer of records from the accountant attached to the High Court to the Central Bank and the State Claims Agency.<\/p>  <p>  Part 3 relates to the amendment of the Act of 1964 and comprises sections 8 to 15, inclusive.  Section 8 amends of section 1 of Act of 1964, including definitions.  Section 8 amends some of the existing definitions contained in the Insurance Act 1964 and inserts new definitions.  Section 9 amends section 2 of Act of 1964 to provide that the Central Bank of Ireland will take over the functions performed by the accountant attached to the High Court in respect of the administration and governance of the ICF.  It provides that the accounts of the ICF be given to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General not later than six months after the end of each financial year to be audited and thereafter laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister for Finance.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 10 amends section 3 of the Insurance Act 1964 to disapply the current limit of 65% or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser, to be paid to third-party claimants from the ICF in the case of the failure of a motor insurer.<\/p><p>This amendment provides for the payment of personal injury claims in full and to a maximum of &euro;1.22 million for injury to property in the case of third-party motor insurance claims, in line with the amounts paid by MIBI where a driver is unidentified or uninsured.  It also provides that in such a scenario, the ICF will be able to recoup the balance over the limits mentioned from a new motor insurers insolvency compensation fund, which is to be established under section 16.  These amendments implement the key recommendations of the review of the framework for motor insurance compensation in Ireland.  Finally, this Part of the Bill facilitates the payment of 100% compensation to third-party claimants for existing motor insurers that have gone into liquidation since 30 September 2011, namely, Setanta and Enterprise Limited.<br\/><br\/>Section 11 amends section 3A of the Insurance Act 1964 to provide that applications to the High Court by a liquidator, in the case of an insolvent insurer authorised in Ireland, for approval of payment from the ICF must be accompanied by a report from the State Claims Agency following its assessment and verification of the claims.  A provision is also included in this section and in the following section to ensure any moneys which are recovered from the liquidation of a motor insurer are repaid on a <i>pro rata<\/i>basis to the ICF and the motor insurers insolvency compensation fund.<br\/><br\/>Section 12 amends section 3B of the Insurance Act 1964 so that in the case of an insolvent insurer authorised in another member state, the State Claims Agency will make the application to the High Court.  Before doing this, it will have assessed and validated claims on the basis of information provided by the person appointed to perform the functions of a liquidator in that other state.  The amounts approved by the High Court will be paid by the Central Bank of Ireland from the ICF to the State Claims Agency for disbursement to individual claimants.  This section also shortens the time limit for making applications to the High Court for payments from the ICF from no more than once in any six-month period to no more than once in any three-month period.  This will allow payments to be made more frequently.<br\/><br\/>Section 13 amends section 3C of the Insurance Act 1964, which deals with companies in administration, to provide that any application to the High Court for payment from the ICF shall be accompanied by a report prepared by the State Claims Agency confirming that the methodology applied for estimating claims reserves and assessing liabilities is appropriate and in line with generally accepted accounting principles or practice.<br\/><br\/>Section 14 amends section 6(6) of the Insurance Act 1964 to update the existing regulatory powers of the Central Bank of Ireland to take action in the event of an insurer failing to contribute to the ICF.  Section 15 repeals section 14 of the Insurance Act 1964, which provided for the regulation-making powers of the Central Bank in relation to the Act.  This is being done because the Central Bank already has appropriate regulation-making powers under section 48 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013.<br\/><br\/>In Part 4, section 16 provides a legal basis and sets out the arrangements for motor insurers operating in the Irish market to contribute an amount under normal circumstances equivalent to 2% of gross written motor premiums to an <i>ex ante<\/i>fund to be held by MIBI, to be known as the motor insurers insolvency compensation, MIIC, fund.  The purpose of this payment is to build up a fund to enable industry to meet its 35% commitment in the event that a motor insurer is liquidated in the future.  The contribution rate will be subject to an annual review by the Minister, and may be varied between 0% and 3% depending on factors such as the amount held in the MIIC fund and the likelihood of a call on that fund in line with the following parameters: an amount equivalent to 2% of gross written motor premiums until the MIIC fund reaches &euro;150 million; reducing to a contribution equivalent to 1% until the MIIC fund reaches &euro;200 million; and contributions to be then suspended until such time as there is a call on the fund.  In the event of a significant call on the MIIC fund and there being insufficient moneys in the fund, the contribution can be increased to the equivalent of 3% of gross written motor premiums until the fund reaches &euro;50 million, after which time a contribution equivalent to 2% of gross written motor premiums will again apply.  It also sets out the circumstances in which payments will be paid out of the MIIC fund to the ICF.  In the event of an insurer failing to make a contribution to the MIIC fund, MIBI may seek to recover the debt and may refer the matter to the Central Bank for regulatory action if deemed appropriate.<br\/><br\/>In Part 5, section 17 contains consequential amendments.  This section amends the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000 to provide the statutory basis for the State Claims Agency to carry out the additional functions given to it under this Bill.<br\/><br\/>I note the work of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on the scrutiny of the general scheme of the Bill.  I thank the committee for its detailed consideration of the proposals.  Deputies will note that many of the committee's recommendations have been taken into account in the drafting of the Bill.  For example, provisions have been made for the recovery of costs by the agencies involved - MIBI, Central Bank and the State Claims Agency.  A mechanism has been provided for to make sure there is flexibility to change the levy in response to the amount held in the fund and other relevant regulatory considerations.  The policy options in respect of other matters, such as the funding mechanism, were thoroughly examined in the regulatory impact analysis before the scheme was published.  On the basis of this exercise, the preferred option was to establish an <i>ex ante<\/i>industry fund into which insurers would contribute an amount equivalent to 2% of gross written motor insurance premiums to be used to meet any future obligations in respect of motor insolvencies.  This approach seeks to strike an appropriate balance between protecting policyholders affected by an insolvency and minimising the exposure of the Exchequer, particularly in the event of the insolvency of a larger insurer, while at the same time ensuring Ireland remains an attractive place for insurers to conduct business through the provision of as much certainty as possible to insurers operating in the State.<br\/><br\/>I reiterate the importance of the swift passage of this amending Bill to ensure full compensation can be paid to third-party claimants who have been waiting a long time for the resolution of this matter.  I look forward to working with Deputies to bring this important legislative measure through the Houses of the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.  I commend the Bill to the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000049#WW01300","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531254000,"counter":699,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Deputy Michael Moynihan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000050#XX00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1531254000,"counter":700,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I am pleased that this Bill has finally been introduced.  Now that we have a chance to discuss it, its progress through the legislative process can commence in a meaningful way.  It has to be acknowledged that over two years have passed since the review of the motor insurance compensation framework and over four years have passed since the collapse of Setanta Insurance.  The Minister of State will confirm that along with other Deputies, I have pressed him on this issue consistently over recent years.<\/p>  <p>  The consequences of the collapse of Setanta Insurance left many people in the lurch and in complete limbo.  Claimants were and continue to be left short.  Policyholders who took out valid insurance policies in this State from Setanta Insurance, which was principally regulated in Malta but regulated here for conduct of business purposes, faced the prospect of being held personally liable for any shortfall in claims made against their policies.  People were getting letters from solicitors to advise them that judgments could be taken out against them in respect of any shortfall.  Ultimately, such a judgment could be made against the mortgage on one's home.  People were deeply fearful of what all of this might mean for them.<\/p>  <p>  The nightmare is continuing for claimants.  Over 1,500 active claims are associated with the collapse of Setanta Insurance.  Not a single cent has yet been paid as compensation to approximately 750 claimants.  A further 826 claimants have received the 65% limit set out under the insurance compensation fund.  I welcome the fact that this Bill provides a statutory basis for dealing with this issue.<\/p><p>The Government committed in January that people caught up in the collapse of Setanta Insurance would have 100% of the cost of their claims met.  That needs to happen.  The Minister of State knows many stories of individuals, as do I.  I got to know some of them quite well because they check in with me very often to learn the current state of play on the legislation.  It is not an exaggeration to state some of them have had their lives on hold, in many cases for more than four years since the collapse of the company.  In some cases, people have still not got anything seven or eight years after the accidents that led to their claims.  This issue needs to be dealt with as a matter of priority.<\/p> <p> With regard to the other central elements of the Bill, the Minister of State might elaborate, in wrapping up or later, on why a new insolvency compensation fund has to be established.  Why is he not requiring the extra contributions to go into the insurance compensation fund, which was after all set up to deal with the failure of an insurance company.  Why is there to be a separate fund under MIBI?  If the Minister of State could address that issue, it would be very helpful.<\/p> <p> While there is some good news in the pipeline for those caught up in the Setanta Insurance collapse, it does mean, in effect, another levy on policyholders.  A 2% levy will be imposed in respect of non-life insurance policies.  That is on top of the existing 2% levy paid into the insurance compensation fund and which is passed on directly to policyholders.  It is also on top of the 3% stamp duty paid on non-life insurance policies and which has been paid since 1982.  Therefore, there is stamp duty of 3%, a levy to the insurance compensation fund of 2% and a new levy going to the new insolvency fund of 2%.  This amounts to 7%.  Three percent is tax and the remaining 4% is in the form of a levy.  I understand the insurance compensation fund is in deficit to the tune of more than &euro;800 million and that the current amount collected from the existing 2% contribution to the fund is approximately &euro;70 million per year.  Therefore, it will be another 11 or 12 years before the legacy from the collapse of Quinn Insurance will be fully paid.<\/p> <p> There is a real sting in the tail for consumers because we are all acutely aware of the challenges posed by the cost of insurance.  This House has rightly deemed it to be a priority issue following on from the work of the cost of insurance working group, its recommendations and the work on employer and public liability insurance conducted in phase 2.  As the Minister of State knows, the Oireachtas finance committee has dedicated considerable time and resources to focusing on the issue of insurance, particularly from a consumer perspective.  That there is an extra levy needs to be put in context by the Minister of State.  He should explain the overall numbers and the long-term plan.  When the insurance compensation fund eventually washes its face, in a dozen years or so, will it be the Government's plan to build up more money in the fund, meaning that the 2% levy will remain in place indefinitely?<\/p> <p> The new levy provided for in this Bill will reduce to zero eventually when a certain amount of money is collected in the fund.  Consumers need to see light at the end of the tunnel when paying all these extra levies.  It really is a moot point to state insurance companies do not have to pass on these levies to consumers.  We all know that, in practice, they are passed on directly to policyholders in the form of an increased premium.<\/p> <p> While there is oversight regarding the cost of motor insurance through the CSO data, there is no oversight regarding the cost of business insurance or insurance for sports clubs, community groups and voluntary bodies.  We have plenty of anecdotal evidence of the really serious threat that is posed to so many businesses and voluntary, community and sports organisations, right down to the level of festival organisers, owing to the rising cost of insurance, especially public liability insurance.  It seems that any activity or business that involves considerable public footfall faces increased premiums and, if not increased premiums, an increase in the excess in the policy or an increasing number of exclusions from the policy.  That is a key issue.<\/p> <p> We will continue to hold to account the Minister of State and the Government with respect to bringing about the necessary reforms needed right across the insurance industry, whether dealing with issues of data and transparency, getting the national claims information database in place quickly, benchmarking awards in Ireland against those in other jurisdictions through the working of the Personal Injuries Commission, or having a much more robust approach to dealing with fraudulent and exaggerated claims.  We hope the Minister of State will get around, as a priority, to setting up the anti-fraud unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in conjunction with his colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality with a view to focusing on insurance fraud.  That is important also.<\/p> <p> I would like the Minister of State, when concluding, to set out in practical terms when he expects this legislation to be enacted.  He will have the co-operation and support of Fianna F&aacute;il.  We will engage constructively.  We will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage but we want this legislation put into effect as quickly as possible.  We are not going to reach Committee Stage this side of the recess but I hope and expect that this legislation will be regarded as a priority.  As a member of the Select Committee on Finance, I will advocate that we prioritise this when we come back in the autumn so we can get to Report and Final Stages and have the Bill commence its journey through the Seanad.<\/p> <p> In the Minister of State's concluding remarks, I would like him to state when he expects all the outstanding claims related to Setanta Insurance to be paid in full.  That is information that people are waiting on.  Could the Minister of State outline his intentions regarding the new levy, the proceeds of which will go into the insolvency fund?  When can people expect that to be hitting their premium statements in the period ahead?  How quickly after the enactment of this legislation does the Minister of State anticipate putting that into effect?  That concludes my opening remarks.  I look forward to engaging with the Minister and colleagues on this Bill in the autumn Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000050#XX00400","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531254600,"counter":703,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I compliment our finance spokesman, Deputy Michael McGrath, on the work he has done for those affected by the Setanta Insurance issue and on the amount of work he put into our Private Members' business.<\/p>  <p>  I am disappointed the Government did not move a little faster on trying to pass the Bill in both Houses prior to the summer because people have been living a nightmare since the collapse of the insurance company.  A number of issues arise in this regard.  First, there are the difficulties the affected people have had regarding insurance and existing claims.  Also to be considered is the legacy and the 2% levy to be imposed on insurance.<\/p>  <p>  Society from top to bottom is concerned about how insurance is working and crippling people.  Deputy Michael McGrath mentioned small festivals.  Right across the spectrum, however, from vehicle owners, homeowners and those seeking public liability insurance to businesspeople, people have been very seriously affected by the rising cost of insurance.  There is unanimity in this House on this issue and its seriousness.  A series of legislative changes need to be made in the Houses to effect real and substantial change in the insurance industry.<\/p><p>The Minister of State is meeting people every day and attends meetings throughout the country so he must be encountering the same issue we encounter, which is that nobody appears to be getting to grips with the rising cost of insurance.  A new group that was formed, the Business Insurance Reform Group, met the Minister of State last February when it was here for a Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members' motion.  That group seeks major change.  It and other groups and businesses have sought substantial changes in different legislative measures in this regard.  There have been reports on how the cost of insurance has stagnated in certain sectors of motor insurance, but that is not enough.  What we need is an absolute understanding from the Government down that insurance is a challenge for everybody.<\/p> <p> Last week, at a meeting in a nearby hotel, Members heard about problems people were having with regard to ten year old cars.  That is another issue that has manifested itself.  The logic of it is very difficult to understand.  These cars are tested every 12 months and are deemed to be roadworthy yet a loading is imposed by the insurance industry.  People who left this country in the past nine or ten years are returning from other countries and we welcome them back.  They have been driving without claims in this jurisdiction and other jurisdictions over the years but they are being given loaded quotes of &euro;3,000 and &euro;4,000 for insurance policies.  That is simply not good enough.  This is one legislative measure to deal with a company that collapsed and left people who had paid their premiums high and dry.  Industries and businesses are making calculated decisions not to take out insurance or pay an insurance premium.  This is extremely dangerous.  It is dangerous for them with regard to their personal liability, their homes and so forth.<\/p> <p> We must have an insurance industry that works in this country.  We have a growing population and a growing number of people are paying into an insurance pot.  The logic of how insurance premiums are rising must be explained carefully and we must be shown how the formulas are done because it is challenging to know why the premiums are being loaded in many insurance companies.  We must be very clear that if a person pays for an insurance policy and if there is a claim against that policy it must be explained to the policyholder why the claim has arisen and that it is up to the policyholder to contest it if the person so wishes.  We have seen from television programmes and from the contributions of Members on all sides of the Houses of the Oireachtas, because everybody is hearing about it, that the policyholder is never informed until he or she goes to renew the insurance and then is met with a massive loading.  That is simply not fair.<\/p> <p> I wish to turn to the other sectors, such as the charity sector, festivals and local community events.  Many of these people are operating without insurance.  Many communities throughout the country are considering holding charity walks and so forth, which do great good in their communities.  However, if the letter of the law was applied these events could not go ahead.  Charity organisations have insurance, such as some of the service providers for people with intellectual disabilities.  One of them is in Charleville in north Cork.  St. Joseph's Foundation had an insurance premium of approximately &euro;100,000 but over the last two years the cost of that premium has gone up to &euro;580,000.  This organisation is serving people across five D&aacute;il constituencies in Cork, Kerry and Limerick.  It has built up massive goodwill and provides a fantastic service.  It has been innovative with regard to challenges on the autistic spectrum, animal training on Liskennet Farm and so forth.  It is at the cutting edge.  It is a voluntary board that is working its way through by raising funds and receiving a block grant from the HSE.  There is another argument to be had in that regard.<\/p> <p> However, its premium has gone from a little over &euro;100,000 to &euro;568,000.  That is unacceptable.  It looks at that premium and the challenges.  Then we find that in some instances there is only one underwriter in the country and only one quote available.  That is unsustainable.  If we are to have an orderly society where insurance is in place, as it must be, the premiums must reflect the conditions and must be explained to the people who are putting their hands in their pockets and paying for the insurance policies.  Some of the smaller community groups, sporting organisations, community centres and so forth that are seeking insurance are seeing their premiums escalating.  They have to hold one fundraising event just to cover insurance.  That is unacceptable.<\/p> <p> I believe that this is the most important issue across the spectrum as it affects all age groups from the young to the elderly as well as the business community.  The people who formed the Business Insurance Reform Group were here in their droves to make their case and tell their stories.  Those stories have been aired on television and elsewhere since then.  They told us their experiences and that they are at their wits' end trying to ensure they have proper policies in place.  Many small businesses are seeking to expand, whether it is by putting more vehicles on the road or by expanding into different sectors or areas of their business.  However, when they seek insurance and see the quoted premium they realise they cannot service that amount of insurance.  There is no way that St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville can continue with that insurance cost.  It is more than &euro;500,000 for a voluntary organisation that is fundraising to expand its services and for capital investment to provide badly needed houses and facilities for people and families.  We can have another debate on the amount of money being given by the HSE, but its insurance policy has gone through the roof.<\/p> <p> The single message the Minister of State should take from this debate is that we must see a desperate urgency at Government level on the insurance problem.  Our spokesperson, Deputy Michael McGrath, has been lobbying on this for some time.  It is a desperate problem across all sectors.  For God's sake, can something be done about it at this point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000051#YY00200","speaker":"1283","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531255200,"counter":705,"content":"<p>It is not lost on me or many other people that we are dealing with a Bill that will impose another charge on premiums on the day that David Drumm was given a suspended sentence in court for offering illegal loans to ten wealthy businessmen worth &euro;450 million.  Those loans, known as the \"maple ten\", originated from the fact that Se&aacute;n Quinn of Quinn Insurance was betting on Anglo Irish Bank and built up a contract for difference of 28%.  As he admitted, he was chasing his losses so he took &euro;280 million out of Quinn Insurance to try to cover those losses.  Today, everybody who has a non-life insurance policy is picking up his tab and the tab of the bankers who facilitated such schemes, while people walk free from it.  For the past number of years we have picked up the tab.  The cost of that tab was &euro;1.15 billion.  Irish consumers will be picking up that tab for many years to come.  That puts the issue in context.  We cannot continually revisit the fact that insurance companies are collapsing in this State because of dodgy regulation, criminal practices or alerts that should have been identified but were not acted on.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Bill and the fact that we are finally discussing this issue.  Three years ago I said from these benches that this is exactly what the Minister had to do.  People were at their wits' end with their lives put on hold.  They were entitled to major claims but there was a legal argument between the ICF and the MIBI and the State was picking up the legal tab as it went through the High Court and the Supreme Court.  In the middle of all of this were the people who were injured in accidents and had legitimate claims, but who were not having those claims paid.<\/p><p>At that time, I made the point that we needed to amend the legislation to allow the ICF to pay out 100% and to remove the &euro;825,000 threshold.  Four years later, we are now dealing with that legislation.  In April 2014, Setanta Insurance went into liquidation, which is over four years ago.  As I established from communications with the Maltese authorities problems at Setanta were well now before then.  The company was breaching its regulatory buffer as far back as 2011.  In September 2013, the Central Bank was given the information about the company.  A material shortfall in the reserves of the company was identified early in January 2014 and it was only ordered to stop selling insurance on 24 January 2014.  From 2011 when the buffers were being breached to 24 January the company was on the brink but customers were still in the dark buying its insurance products.  Many people were left high and dry in terms of claims.  Many others who paid yearly premiums were also left high and dry and those premiums went down the drain.  The most serious victims are those who have been waiting for what they are entitled to, namely, 100% of the claim for an accident in respect of which they were not at fault.  I support the Bill because those claimants and victims have waited long enough.  Some of them have received 65% of their claims but almost half have received nothing.  Those who have received the 65% are still wondering when the Government will get its act together and get this legislation enacted so that the remaining 35% can be paid.  I ask that in his closing remarks the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, would give us a date for the enactment of this legislation so that the remaining 35% can be paid.<br\/><br\/>There are wider issues that deserve full debate and scrutiny.  It is striking how complex the proposed system is in this legislation in that it is begging from pot A to put into pot B, with pot C being refunded.  I cannot help but think there is a more straightforward way of doing this.  We know that other countries operate a single fund.  This is an idea worthy of consideration but not one I would not want to hold up or stall this legislation.  I welcome the transfer of administration of the fund from the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice to the Central Bank such that the ICF will now rest with the Central Bank.  This brings an accountability structure as funds that are under the courts are excluded from the scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor General and it is only right that such an important fund would come under the scrutiny of the State's financial watchdog.  This is a massive fund.  As I mentioned, the cost for Quinn Insurance is &euro;1.15 billion and for Setanta Insurance is in excess of &euro;100 million.<br\/><br\/>I am conscious that asking the Central Bank to look after everything is the default position, in particular when discussing the insurance industry.  In giving the Central Bank additional tasks we need to provide it with additional staff and the resources to do the job properly.  For this reason, I believe serious consideration needs to be given to finding an alternative body to run the national claims information database when established.  A more critical reason is that, unfortunately, the Central Bank's mandate, or at least its interpretation of its mandate, is that stability trumps everything and, therefore, profitability of companies outweighs the rights of consumers.  We all agree that transparency is essential if we are to see a real reduction in premiums but I am not convinced that the Central Bank is the body to take up the mantle of driver in this area.  Therefore, serious considerations needs to be given to having the national claims information database housed with a different agency.  However, we can have that discussion when that legislation becomes before us.  The fact that it has not yet come before us tells its own story, and the priorities of the Government.<br\/><br\/>Following much public anger and good work by the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, the Government produced a report on the cost of rising motor insurance.  Major elements of that report, like the national claims information database, remain unimplemented.  The Government has taken its foot off the pedal on these issues, which is evident from the level of insurance premiums right across the business community and, in some cases, motor insurance also.  During the pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill one of the issues raised was the fact that as MIBI will hold this fund it can be tapped into for public use.  In other words, the public can call on this fund and the Minister of the day can direct the level of money that will go into the fund.  This raises the question of whether MIBI too should now come under the lens of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I believe this is worthy of consideration.<br\/><br\/>When it comes to the industry and my experience of it, the maximum level of accountability and transparency is required.  It has been placed in the position where reform is necessary but despite the rhetoric there is no reason to believe it has any interest in real reform.  The insurers thrive in the world of spin, vagueness, legal costs and fraud, exaggerated claims and so on.  All these are real issues.  I acknowledge the sterling work done by some journalists, in particular Charlie Weston who has been running a series of articles on fraudulent claims and questionable claims.  The front page of <i>The Irish Sun <\/i>reports that one of the Minister of State's colleagues is involved in what the courts called a questionable claim.  There is a need for scrutiny of insurance fraud.  Fraudulent insurance is theft and it needs to be dealt with as such.  There is no doubt insurance fraud adds to insurance premiums.  We know from former Governor Honohan's private correspondence to the previous Minister for Finance that the industry was lying to the Central Bank.  This is the reason he called for reform of the law in this area.  We know also that the industry gambled in the purchase of Government bonds and that when through quantitative easing those Government bonds reduced in terms of value to the insurance industry it left a major gap in terms of its funding. <br\/><br\/>I am opposed to allowing Insurance Ireland to fund our police service.  It is terrible idea.  I understand that at a time when there is huge pressures on premiums it is easy to go for the easy fix but An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to be independent and above reproach.  The idea that private business would fund a section of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not a good one.  It is a slippery slope.  It must be remembered that the insurance industry in this city was subject to dawn raids not too long ago.  It is under investigation by national authorities and by European authorities and yet we somehow think it is a good idea that it would fund a part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is not the way to go.  If it needs to be taxed and brought into the general taxation system then we should do that and use that money to fund the services.  It is more than 12 months since those raids took place.  As I said, they are subject to anti-competitive practices in terms of the investigations that are ongoing.<br\/><br\/>Insurance fraud is theft and it must be pursued rigorously and prosecuted.  More action needs to be taken to stamp out insurance fraud, including by way of establishment of a specialised Garda insurance fraud unit and the introduction of a new offence of insurance fraud but this must be paid for by the central Exchequer and not private business interests.  Just as important is challenging the insurance industry to stop settling suspicious claims.  It is important that claims deemed to be suspicious or fraudulent are reported and acted upon.  My legislation, which I touched on earlier, provided that those in the industry would be subject to imprisonment if found to be lying to the Central Bank.  As we know, the industry has done so in the past, as reported by the former Governor to the previous Minister for Finance.  This is the type of action we need, and more of it, to keep this industry on the straight and to ensure that it reduces premiums.<br\/><br\/>Returning to one of the core areas of this Bill to help reduce premiums, for years we have been told that one of the reasons for the 70% increase that occurred over a three year period was the uncertainty around what would happen in another Setanta-type collapse.  This is what the industry told us was the reason for it increasing premiums to the level it did.  Through this legislation, we now have a roadmap for reducing premiums but are not hearing the insurers commit to reducing premiums to previous levels or anywhere near those levels.<\/p><p>The excuse has been removed and the solution has been given but there is no commitment from the industry.<\/p> <p> One issue not addressed in the Bill which needs to be considered on Committee Stage relates to the changes to the waterfall of preferences in the liquidation processes.  The ideal in cases such as Setanta would be that claimants get priority in the liquidation process and that, to the maximum degree possible, the process meets the majority of claims.  The ICF or MIBI could pay upfront and then recoup the moneys during the liquidation process.  That would be preferable to having to wait for a long period to deal with this.<\/p> <p> I see no reason for applying an extra 2% levy to premiums.  This move provides the certainty the industry claimed it needed and it sets an insurance policy for itself.  Over the longer term this new fund is supposed to save money for the industry and therefore this levy should not be placed on customers' insurance premiums.<\/p> <p> I would like to go through much more on this legislation, but we will have time to do that on Committee Stage.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure the Bill gets through these Houses with the appropriate scrutiny as quickly as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531256400,"counter":708,"content":"<p>I will be sharing time with Deputy Munster.<\/p>  <p>  As the motor insurance business affects thousands of people's lives, how the State regulates it is very important.  The State in some aspects is not acting to protect people.  I wish to highlight the effect on rural dwellers and low-income workers who need a car for work.  Last week I attended a briefing on insurance by the motor industry.  We were presented with the shocking reality of people being refused insurance despite having a valid NCT certificate.  I get complaints about that in my constituency office every week from people who cannot get insurance simply because their cars are more than ten years old.  This is being used by the motor insurance industry to either not give a quote or give astronomical quotations.  It is putting people under huge pressure to buy new cars or putting people off the road completely.  It disproportionately affects rural dwellers and low-income workers who need a car for work.<\/p>  <p>  More than 77,000 cars more than ten years old were scrapped in 2017, an increase of 49% on 2016.  From an environmental and financial point of view, this represents a loss to the Exchequer.  It accelerates the devaluation of cars, particularly cars more than ten years old.  It increases CO2 emissions because the CO2 emissions created by manufacturing a new car is equal to what is pumped out of the exhaust pipe of a car over 160,000 km, as shown by a recent report.  That needs to be factored in.  It causes a reduction in rural mobility and particularly causes problems for the people who need their cars for work, the people who the Taoiseach says get up early in the morning and whom we need to look after.<\/p>  <p>  There is no logic in this.  These cars have passed their NCT every year.  There is also evidence to show that older cars are not on the roads as much.  Someone with a car that is 12 or 13 years old is not doing 50,000 km like some of us are doing.  I always drove an old car until I was elected to this House and then I discovered that an old car would not stick the going so I had to get a new car.  My point is that older vehicles are not on the road as much.<\/p>  <p>  Once a car has passed its NCT, that is it; it is in good condition.  The NCT is very thorough and very professionally done.  There is no reason to take these cars off the road.  In Australia it is common for cars 20 years old to be driven around and the same is true in parts of Europe.  Therefore it cannot continue.  While we support the Bill, I am using this opportunity to highlight the issue to the Minister of State.  I want the Government to do something about it.  This is in the interests of motorists.  We talk about protecting rural Ireland; this is in the interests of rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I do not advocate having bangers driving around that are not fit to be on the road.  I am advocating a bit of common sense here.  At the moment the insurance companies are picking the pockets of low-income workers and those people living in country areas who need their cars to get to places such as Portlaoise, Tullamore, Edenderry or elsewhere in the morning.  That is exactly what is happening and we need to stop it.  I want the Government to give serious consideration to this and to put a stop to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000054#BBB00200","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1531256400,"counter":709,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill which has been a long time coming.  In the case of Setanta customers, it has been more than four years.  It is simply unacceptable that private insurance companies in this State can become insolvent without their customers being protected.  I commend the work of my colleagues, particularly Deputy Pearse Doherty and others, on pushing for this Bill to ensure customers are treated fairly when these companies fail.  It is only right that they are compensated in full and that customers in future can be confident that they will be protected should another insurance company fold.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation to establish the motor insurance insolvency compensation fund is therefore a welcome development.  The Government operates a system of mandatory motor insurance, which is only right, but it leaves the regulation of that sector to the market, meaning that the State opts out.  For-profit companies are left to operate as they see fit, which inevitably has led to the utterly dysfunctional market we know.<\/p>  <p>  Every other week my office receives calls from motorists who are unable to insure their vehicles due to the outrageous rip-off quotations received from insurance companies.  Many people, especially those in rural areas cannot go about their daily lives without the use of a car.  As we well know, public transport is lacking and they have no choice.  Others drive for a living or need to drive as part of their jobs.  We know that premium quotes are outrageously high for some, especially those with cars older than ten years.  Insurance companies like to claim that this is because of fraud, which is the fault of drivers.  While, of course, we know fraud is a problem, it is not the cause of a dysfunctional insurance market.<\/p>  <p>  The market is as it is because the sector was not regulated in a proper fashion.  When it came under pressure during the recession the companies hiked up the cost to cover themselves.  That is the fault of the companies and the market.  It is also the fault of the Government for washing its hands of this issue.  While I welcome the Bill, I would like the Government to examine other issues in the insurance sector.  The current system is grossly unfair and is causing great hardship for thousands of people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000054#BBB00300","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1531256400,"counter":710,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Michael Collins, who is sharing with Deputies Mattie McGrath and Danny Healy-Rae.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000054#BBB00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1531256400,"counter":711,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which seeks to amend and extend the law relating to insolvent insurers and to provide for the establishment of a fund to be known as the motor insurance insolvency compensation fund.  This fund will be controlled and managed by the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland.  Vehicle insurers will be asked to make a contribution to that fund.  What effect will this have on people's premiums?<\/p>  <p>  As we are all aware, in recent years insurance costs have become totally unjustified and unsustainable.  They are placing huge financial pressure on people and businesses.  These rising insurance premiums simply cannot go on.  We are hearing a lot of sympathy for young people this week, but we did not hear much sympathy for them last week.  When getting insurance, every obstacle is being put in front of them.  On the one hand we criminalise their parents if they drive on their own.  If they are lucky enough to get a driving test and pass it, they are then being hit with out-of-control quotes for insurance which they cannot afford.  It is very difficult for young people to get off the ground.<\/p>  <p>  As other Deputies have said already, I am inundated with constituents coming to me distressed and upset over the quotes they are getting for motor insurance.  Some of them get no quote if they have a car more than ten years old.  We need insurance companies to be transparent and to explain why they are increasing their customers' premiums.  Insurance companies are in total control of what is going on.  Nobody has any control over them; they are a law onto themselves.  Fraud and exaggerated claims need to be clamped down on.  There should be zero tolerance for these types of claims and we need to ensure they are pursued and tackled more aggressively by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and insurance companies.<\/p>  <p>  Owners of cars of ten years and older are being penalised with huge insurance premiums.  Why are these motorists quoted these high premiums as we have the NCT to ensure all vehicles are roadworthy?  Why is the owner of a car of ten years or older getting such an excessively high insurance quotation and in many cases not getting any quotes when compared with the owner of a similar car that is newer?<\/p><p> Another important point to mention regarding motor insurance is people returning to Ireland after living abroad who are now accessing motor insurance and being quoted very high premiums.  We should be welcoming back people who have decided to return home and ensuring they are not priced out of the market.  We should also look at businesses and community organisations.  Many have been forced out of business.  Nightclub owners are at the end of their tether.<\/p> <p> We need to see urgent action.  The time for talking is over.  Action on the ground is needed.  In Kilbrittain secret gardens, the O'Mahony family has put a huge amount of money into building a fantastic activity centre enjoyed by many children throughout west Cork.  Their insurance bill this year went from &euro;4,000 to &euro;5,000 to close to &euro;25,000.  They employ more than 20 people in a rural community.  They cannot sustain it.  They will take the hit for one year but will go out of business the next year and we are standing idly by as politicians.  We are doing an awful lot of talking.  I have been talking about this for two and a half years and nothing is happening on the ground.  The bottom line is people are paying excessively high insurance premiums and we need to look at ways to reduce these premiums as insurance prices are not sustainable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000054#BBB00500","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531257000,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I am delighted to speak on the Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2018 which was published on 19 June.  The House is rising this week and nothing has been done about insurance during the tenure of the Minister of State or that of his predecessor or even before that.  We promise and promise.  We are being robbed left, right and centre.  It is extortion.  A person cannot go without it.  He or she has to have it but when it comes to the fine print, that person has nothing.  I am sick and tired of talking about it.  A committee was set up and there was a report containing 79 recommendations.  It was nothing short of a fudge.  It was a total and absolute fudge.  Nine actions would be too many.  Maybe two or three would be implemented.  The Government does not want to do it.  There is no appetite in the Government to tackle the cartels.  That is the situation across the line because they are all supporting the Government.  It is a sad day.<\/p>  <p>  I am old enough to remember when PMPA went into liquidation and the levy that went on and was never taken off.  Now we have the issues with Quinn Insurance and Setanta Insurance.  Deputy Michael McGrath gave the numbers earlier.  He mentioned &euro;800 million.  People have been left high and dry.  Many thousands are waiting and waiting.  They cannot afford to wait.  They are not big business people.  They are ordinary families trying to eke out a living, educate their children, do their business and stay within the law.  The Government is passing more legislation.  The public will get a break from it after tomorrow because the Government will be away from here for two months so there will be no more regressive legislation passed.  The Bill the Government is passing is demonising and weighing down self-employed people and ordinary families.  It is evidence of the Government's failure and ineptitude in dealing with the insurance companies.<\/p>  <p>  I am a small businessman like my colleagues, but I am more involved in the community and voluntary sector and it is being crucified and blackguarded.  Many events have been cancelled because of insurance costs.  Many wonderful events which were wonderful days for our people, especially in weather such as this, have been cancelled because of insurance costs.  Everything is about insurance.  There are assessors waiting.  That is not to mention car insurance, fleet insurance or lorry insurance.<\/p>  <p>  Why can we not go to Europe or the world market to get insurance?  Why are we stuck here with a limited number of companies that can treat us like dirt?  If a person rings up an insurance company, he or she has to press button after button because all the offices have been removed.  The office of AXA Insurance will leave Clonmel in Tipperary very soon.  It is not possible to engage with a person.  We had a broker before whom we could deal with but now we are talking to machines and robots and we are told the call is being recorded for training purposes.  They want to record everything but it is all one-way traffic.  We cannot record what they say.  It is just obstacle after obstacle.  When the proposals in the Bill are up and running, there will be a 7% levy but 3% of it is tax and 2% goes elsewhere.  That is punitive.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance companies are now giving two fingers to the national car test, NCT, system.  I have a lot of issues with the Road Safety Authority, RSA, but the NCT is one of the things I agree with.  There are people with cars that have valid NCTs and have passed the test but the insurance companies are rejecting them.  The driving testers are rejecting them.  They are saying there is something wrong with them.  What standing does the NCT have if insurance companies and driving testers say a car is not fit even though it passed the NCT the day before?<\/p>  <p>  The haulage industry is being crippled.  Last week we heard about the Ponzi fund racket in which people have to keep buying a car every four years and then trade it in.  We are trying to bring in legislation on electric cars which Deputy Ryan and the Minister, Deputy Naughten, are championing.  They are talking about lowering emissions and lowering toll charges for fully electric cars when we are having all these cars crushed.  What about the pollution and CO2 emissions generated by that?  Our right hand does not know what our left hand is doing.  That is the extent of it.<\/p>  <p>  The attack on ordinary families is merciless and continuing.  It should not be allowed to go on.  There is an issue for nightclubs.  Bar room owners were here recently.  They told us insurance has gone up 100%, 200% and 300%.  It is like phone book numbers.  Then a claim goes in and the minute a claim goes in, an excess is put on the policy.  There is excess on the policy anyway but there is a charge then to take account of an impending bad outcome.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has refused steadfastly to tackle that big building down on the quays, the Four Courts, where all the murky business goes on and where all the deals are done.  People are dragged along.  I have been there many a time myself.  People tell their insurance companies that it is a fraudulent claim and they do not want them to pay out.  One comes along like a good boy and turns up for several sessions in the High Court only to find out the legal eagles have had a cup of tea together and a chat.  It is a \"You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours\" attitude or one of \"You rub soap to my something and I'll rub soap to yours\".  The Minister of State knows what I am talking about.  The attitude is to hell with him, he is only the punter, he will pay anyway because his insurance company is going to pay.  It is about the greasy paws of the legal system.  The free legal aid racket will not be tackled.  It is a revolving door.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State will have to tackle the insurance industry.  I have no faith in this.  We are rising this week and will wait until we come back in September.  It will be October before it will be on the agenda again.  I have no faith in it.  A lot of this is very aspirational.  It is about preliminary measures and a general scheme.  It is legal jargon obviously done up by the legal adviser for pre-legislative scrutiny.  It is giving all the cards to the insurance companies.  Let the buyer beware.  Let the taxpayer and insurance payer beware.  He or she will have to pay anyway.<\/p>  <p>  We have mentioned young people trying to get on the road.  Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh siad is a wonderful saying.  We are not doing much of it here.  We are persecuting them.  We did it last week on legislation and the Minister, Deputy Ross, is now proclaiming we were vandals to be opposing legislation and using the filibuster which is one of the oldest traditions in democracies all over the world.  That man has gone off the radar and off the Richter scale.  He should deal with some of the issues in road transport which the RSA will not deal with.  They are flagrantly abusing people.  We passed legislation that criminalised people who want to stay within the law but cannot because they cannot get a driving test.  Is that fair?  It is the same with insurance.  They cannot get insurance.  The Government would love to tell them all they can get it.<\/p>  <p>  What about the famous leader, St. Leo, the Taoiseach, when he talks about full employment?  How will the people in rural Ireland get to the employment?  How are they going to go to apprenticeships if they get apprenticeships?  How will they go?  Will it be by air or kangaroo or something?  We need a gluaiste&aacute;n.  We need people to learn how to drive a gluaiste&aacute;n.<\/p>  <p>  To hell or to Connacht is the attitude of the Government to people in rural Ireland.  That is not to mention the people who want to go to the pub for a social drink.  We will park that issue.  To hell with them.  They are consigned to a future of depression and being locked away.  Our young people who want to have lives, education and career paths cannot because they have no Luas, DART, bus, bicycle scheme or taxis.  The Government is not interested in rural Ireland but rural Ireland will be interested in the Government.  I do not know if the Government will get another confidence and supply agreement from the boys here on my right.  I do not know if the Government will or not.  I do not have much confidence in the Government or Fianna F&aacute;il because they are voting for the same legislation which is regressive towards rural Ireland and especially towards young people.  They will be waiting.

I gave several weeks to discussing the programme for Government and pulled out before I had finished because most of the stuff I was putting into it was being pulled out as fast as we were putting it into it.  I did, however, think the Government would do something about insurance.  It has the power to do something about the cost of insurance, the cost of claims and all of the racket that is going on, but it is doing nothing about them.  There is nothing in the Bill that will help the ordinary young person on the road today or who will try to go on the road tomorrow to get insurance at a reasonable cost.  All I can see is that there will be a percentage added to insurance premiums to help insurance companies to go wallop as they have been doing.  We all saw clearly after Quinn Insurance went out of business how the cost of insurance went up.  Surely the Government can also see that they now have a monopoly.  There is no one competing with them; they are all doing the same and offering the same price.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State do something about the business of ten-year-old cars which are perfect in every way, with a low mileage and doing a low mileage, for which the insurance companies will not quote?  Will he talk to them and did he talk to them?  He will not talk to them because it is clear that if he did, he would get some results.  Quotes for older people are being doubled from &euro;400 to &euro;800 or &euro;900.  Young fellows who deserve a chance to go on the road for the first time are being quoted &euro;3,500, &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,500.  How can they manage to pay that sum?  I am talking about people living in rural Ireland who do not have a bus, DART or taxi service or access to any public service.  The Government talks about seven or eight bus routes that it has added to Rural Link in County Kerry.  For what will that cater?<\/p>  <p>  It may be wrong for me to point my finger or direct my venom at the Minister of State, but where is the rest of his gang who were here in numbers last Friday clapping for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross?  Where are they tonight?  Why are they not all here listening to this debate on the serious matter of insurance for people who do not want to break the law and need insurance to go on the road to get to work, their apprenticeship or college?  There is no holding them here tonight, but they will clap for the Minister all right when he ensures more people will have to stay at home, thumb or cycle from vast distances into towns.<\/p>  <p>  Business people are being hit by the cost of claims.  In England someone who suffers a whiplash injury will receive &pound;7,600.  In Ireland, for a very minor injury, someone will receive &euro;19,400 and the figure has been known to go up to &euro;77,000.  They must have brass necks or gold necks.  It is very unfair to think that is happening here and that the Government has been told about it before, but it has done nothing and will do nothing about it.  It is two and a half years since it promised that it would.  I thought that in this Bill it was going to sort out verything to do with insurance, but there is nothing in it.  The Government is only codding the people.  It told lies and I mean that.  A few weeks ago it stated the cost of insurance had gone down by 17%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000056#DDD00100","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1531257600,"counter":719,"content":"<p>The Deputy should not accuse the Minister or anyone else of telling lies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000056#DDD00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531257600,"counter":720,"content":"<p>They were untruths.

I was an immigrant who came back, but I was walloped for not having a no claims bonus.  That is how I got into this issue.  In the 2016 general election this was a major issue on the doorsteps and it continues to be.  Because of that the Government reacted and set up the cost of insurance working group.  I have been working behind the scenes with the Minister of State, Deputy Michael D'Arcy, and his predecessor who is now the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  We want to make this happen.  We want to do what we can to make it happen, but in trying to do so we are encroaching on and working with the private sector.  There are several anomalies.  The Government is on one side; the insurance companies are on another, while the Judiciary are on another.  There are several pillars involved.  There has been a change of culture in the insurance companies because they use more sophisticated systems to segment the market.<\/p><p>These strands were never segmented before.  This allows insurance companies to concentrate on the vehicle, the age of applicants, demographics, emigrants - they never had them before because they never came home.  They now use these various segments to gain competitive advantage.  That culture has crept in, as I know from talking to people and receiving their feedback.  <\/p> <p> I quizzed representatives of Insurance Ireland for 15 minutes at a committee three weeks ago on some of the issues raised by previous speakers.  I am not convinced by some of the answers they provided given the anecdotal feedback I have received on the ground.  I will give some examples.  Sales representatives who have been on the road for 15 years and are insured under an employer's group insurance policy are told when they seek insurance in their own name that they do not have a no claims bonus built up because it is the first time they have ever had insurance.  The advice given to them is to get a slip of paper or confirmation from the insurance company that provided cover to the company they worked for previously and present that to their new insurance company.  What is being pushed back on them now is that because they cannot prove they did not have an accident, because it was a group policy, they are still being charged the same.  That is not fair play.  That is not the Government's fault though.  It is private enterprise pushing back.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000056#DDD01500","speaker":"1328","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531258200,"counter":734,"content":"<p>Where is the regulator?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000057#EEE00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1531258200,"counter":735,"content":"<p>Order, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000057#EEE00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531258200,"counter":736,"content":"<p>There is an anomaly straightaway.  There is also the issue of ten year old cars.  Given that these cars have been tested under the NCT procedure, I cannot see any reason they should not be on the road.  I have been told there are data on this but I have not seen any to justify the current position.  We need to have the national claims information database in place in order that all the data are available and the system is open and transparent.  I ask the insurance companies and Insurance Ireland to work with us as much as possible.  The Minister of State will soon publish the relevant legislation, which should be pushed through the D&aacute;il as quickly as possible.  I ask the insurance companies to work with us.  I keep getting responses mentioning commercial sensitivity.  I understand that but it is being used as a catch-all or a stick to beat us with when we are trying to get these data.  If it does stack up, that is fine, we will have to deal with that some other way.  We should at least see the data to allow us to address the matter.<\/p>  <p>  We have also had problems in respect of business insurance.  Businesses are being quoted higher premiums and then finding out or being told that a claim has been made.  That communication process and style is a simple thing that needs to be changed.  Road hauliers are another group feeling the effect.  The Government backed road hauliers because exports were one of the first parts of the economy to recover.  The Government realised that help with tax cuts three or four years ago, if I remember off the top of my head.  They are now again feeling the effect of insurance on their business.  Exports and road haulage are a big part of our economy and the issue of insurance is now having a significant impact on them.<\/p>  <p>  We have to address this issue, which is coming back from the private sector.  We must take a unified position and push back on the private sector in respect of what is happening here.  We need to speak with one voice because if I know the private sector, it is trying to divide and conquer us anyway in what we are trying to do.  There is a public relations battle going on here and I urge the House to pull together on this and try to push measures through as quickly as possible, specifically the national claims information database which will give us the information we need.<\/p>  <p>  Drivers in rural areas are feeling the impact of insurance costs.  People starting college and driving for the first time are able to get a car more easily than before.  The price of insurance, however, is crippling them.  In Limerick, for example, people from County Limerick will drive into the University of Limerick or Limerick Institute of Technology because they are not far, relatively speaking, and it makes more sense economically to drive to college than to stay in the city.  They can live and perhaps work at home but the insurance price is also starting to hurt these people.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of facets to this issue.  We need to maintain the momentum of the cost of insurance working group.  We also need to examine and debate trying to benchmark claims in respect of the Judiciary.  We must also address the fraud and claims culture, of which we have seen some examples.  There are different strands to be tackled.<\/p>  <p>  I hear what Opposition Deputies are saying.  We all hear the same things on the ground but there is no simple solution.  Different strands have to be pulled together and major bodies of work have to done.  I want to see that done as quickly as possible and I want to push that as quickly as possible.  I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Cabinet our desire to have the issue of insurance costs prioritised.  It is a real and live issue and, for want of a better word, one of the lowest common denominators on the ground because it affects almost everybody.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000057#EEE00400","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1531258200,"counter":737,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Eugene Murphy, who is sharing with Deputy Eamon Scanlon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000057#EEE00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531258200,"counter":738,"content":"<p>I am speaking on the same issue, the same difficulties and the same problems as previous speakers.  I refer to the collapse of insurance companies.  People believe they have insurance cover for a year and then a company collapses, as happened with Setanta Insurance, and they have to seek to be reinsured.  Many have still not received compensation following the collapse of Setanta four years ago.  We should remember in this debate that many people are on low income.  When a person pays &euro;700, &euro;800, &euro;900 or maybe &euro;1,000 - or even &euro;500 or &euro;600 in the case of someone on low income, a blow such as the collapse of an insurance company creates more problems.  Sometimes people shop around and believe they are getting a good deal.  If the company collapses, however, they find they have to go to their credit union and refinance their insurance policy.  This issue must be tackled quickly.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome this Bill but this has been a long process for such an urgent issue.  People simply cannot wait.  It will probably be a long time before this legislation is passed because the D&aacute;il will wrap up for the summer on Thursday.

In the meantime, many people are frustrated, annoyed and coming into our clinics.

There is a serious problem with the whole insurance business.  While we are focusing specifically on motor insurance, business and flood insurance are also a problem.  The whole insurance business must be reviewed.  In recent months, we have seen raids on certain insurance businesses and there is an ongoing investigation.  It would be interesting to find out when that investigation will come to a conclusion and what will be the outcome.  Every aspect of the insurance business needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  Like Deputy Mattie McGrath, I welcome the Bill and my great wish is that it can be dealt with as quickly as possible.  I have an issue with the 2% levy.  While I accept there has to be a fund because there is no such thing as a free dinner, I want to know for how many years the levy will apply.  Has this been calculated?  It must not become a permanent fixture in insurance costs.<\/p>  <p>  We heard many examples this evening of what people are suffering in the motor sector.  Insurance for taxis can now cost anything from &euro;5,000 to &euro;14,000 and some companies will not even quote for taxis.  We have all heard the stories of young people.  I often talk about my daughter who has a full driver's licence and has never been involved in a crash or other incident.  A decent car can be obtained for &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000 but the best quote somebody like my daughter and many of her friends can get is for &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000.  This is a serious problem for students, young workers and people living in rural Ireland where there is not the same level of public transport.  I am sure the Minister of State sees it in his own county of Wexford.<\/p><p> The issue of returning emigrants also arises.  They seem to have major difficulty in getting insurance cover, or have to pay an exorbitant fee for it, even if they have a good, clean record.  The issue also affects lorry drivers and road hauliers.  It is a fact that many road hauliers are based outside the country, in other parts of Europe, which causes Ireland to lose business.  The hauliers say that they simply cannot afford it.  <\/p> <p> It is great to hear so many contributions on the issue of ten year old cars.  They might have a full NCT and a very low mileage.  I raised this issue in this House approximately ten months ago.  I made the point at the time that there are many ten year old cars with low mileage, particularly those owned by people living in cities who do not run up large mileages.  These cars are in perfect condition and fly through the NCT.  So many young people, in particular, are disappointed when they look for insurance; they are told that companies cannot insure a ten year old car.  We are living in the era of NCTs, which is a good practice.  It forces us to look after our cars more carefully; we have to.  I fully endorse the process.  However, there are people who put their car, which is in perfect condition, through the NCT, who then go to the insurance company and cannot get cover.  I am sure that the Minister of State knows this from his own constituency.<\/p> <p> We are in a crisis situation in terms of the insurance industry.  I welcome this Bill, arriving as it does in the last days before the summer recess.  However, it is extremely important that it is pursued with absolute vigour in the autumn.  The approach of the Government, and I do not mean this as an attack on the Minister of State because I know he means well in this area, has been extremely frustrating and slow.  It is a complex area, and I am not going to deny that, but motor insurance premiums have shot up by 31% since 2012.  That is a fact.  There is currently no index tracking business insurance costs.  Despite this, the major recommendations of the cost of insurance working group have yet to be acted upon.  There are many issues to deal with, and in the meantime people are suffering, unable to get cover.  This must be tackled as a matter of urgency.<\/p> <p> Like many other Deputies in this House, I am concerned at the slow pace of progress on this issue.  We will speak again about flood insurance and business insurance but the Bill this evening deals with motor insurance.  The Government must realise that this is a huge issue for many people, and must be progressed as quickly as possible.  The Bill raises a number of issues in terms of the compensation fund, which has been well explained in the details.  I do not have an issue with that, and generally accept the levy issue.  I do not want it to become a permanent levy on everyone, but I am a realist and know that a fund has to be in place.  I urge the Minister of State to pursue this issue with vigour, and ask him to go back to his senior Cabinet colleagues to ensure we progress this issue as quickly as possible.  There are many people out there who are trapped due to insurance issues and the cost of insurance.  In many situations, they cannot get insurance cover at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000057#EEE00800","speaker":"1342","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531258800,"counter":742,"content":"<p>Much of what I am going to say has already been said, but it is important that it is said.  I want to compliment my college, Deputy Michael McGrath, because he has pursued this for many years.  Quite a number of people were badly affected by what happened to Setanta Insurance.  At least 1,500 people have been left in limbo for the past number of years, not knowing where they were going to go.  They were stressed out.  They received legal letters, and wondered what their future was going to be.  I am glad that issue is being dealt with at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there are no free dinners.  Someone is going to have to pick up the tab for this, which is unfortunate, but it is the right thing to do.  Quinn Insurance has added 2%, and another 2% will now be added on top, plus 3% tax.  That amounts to a 7% increase overall.  I would like to think that this levy will be abolished as soon as this fund has been collected.  It is important that happens.  I am old enough to remember PMPA insurance and the levy that was put in place at the time to sort that problem out.  I do not believe that levy was ever removed.  Perhaps it was; the Minister of State might let me know.  It is important that when the required moneys are collected the levies are removed.<\/p>  <p>  There has been much talk about claims and the cost of insurance, particularly around motor insurance and motor insurance claims.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, was brought in by this House in 2009.  PIAB did its job for a number of years.  It worked.  It brought down the cost of claims and insurance, particularly for young people.  The way young people are treated in terms of insurance has been mentioned tonight, and I believe it is very unfair.  Every young person who seeks insurance today is treated like a road hog.  The quotes they get for insurance are very unfair.  There are many very good young people out there who are willing to work.  They can buy a car, but cannot pay for the insurance.  That is the unfortunate, sad thing.  I come from south Sligo, which is a rural constituency, much like that of the Minister of State.  If people want to get to work they have to get a lift from someone who is travelling close to their work, or a lift from their parents, which is often not easy.  They need transport.  There is no such thing as a bus, DART or Luas in my constituency and in many others around the country.  It is discriminatory against these young people.  I believe they need help.  PIAB worked, but unfortunately the legal profession, over a period of time, wound it out.  The facility is not being used as much as it should be now, and claims have crept up.  <\/p>  <p>  One day a car rolled back and hit the front of my car.  There was no damage done whatsoever.  I got out and looked at it and found no damage to my car or the other car.  Everything was fine.  My no claims bonus was protected.  I eventually discovered that the person who owned the car that rolled into mine was paid &euro;36,000.  That is a fact.  I only found out by accident.  I insisted that my car and the other car were inspected by the insurance company and was told that there was no damage to either car.  This is the type of thing that is going on.  I am glad to see that in recent times these insurance claims are being investigated and stopped.  They are robbing everyone in this country, and it is only right that such claims are stopped.  <\/p>  <p>  The issue of ten year old cars was mentioned.  It is important that it is mentioned as often as possible.  We all drive on the roads every day.  A car might overtake us, and we might have to add up the years to figure out how old it is.  A car that looks well and is driving well could be 13, 14 or 15 years old if it is well looked after, well serviced and taken for an NCT regularly.  Believe it or not, 147,000 people in this country own cars which are over ten years old.  There are many reasons for that, one of which is affordability.  Other reasons include that cars today, which are well serviced, will last for 15, 16 or 17 years.  It is outrageous that insurance companies inflate premiums for people driving these cars.  It is legal robbery.  <\/p><p>Most of the people who have these cars look after them.  If they did not, they would not be in the condition that they are in.  What is being done is outrageous.<\/p> <p> Moreover, this is affecting rural areas and rural jobs.  It is affecting the small garages that employ three or four people in small towns like Ballymote, Tubbercurry, Gurteen and other places like that.  It is affecting jobs there.  It is affecting the person supplying the tyres for those cars.  Little businesses have built up throughout the rural areas servicing that type of business.  This phenomenon is taking jobs away.  That is exactly what it is doing.  It should not be allowed to happen, because it is forcing people to change their car more often.  That is the reason.<\/p> <p> Something else it will do, which people do not yet realise, is devalue the six year old, seven year old or eight year old car.  What is that car going to be worth?  Nothing, quite honestly, if they get away with what they are doing.  It is outrageous, and a lot more should be done to make sure that they do not get away with it.<\/p> <p> I refer also to public liability insurance.  The haulage business was mentioned in that context.  I have a friend who employs 42 people in the haulage business.  His insurance premium went from &euro;70,000 to &euro;140,000.  That is a fact.  Will the Minister of State imagine taking out his chequebook and writing a cheque for &euro;140,000 just to stay in business and keep employing 42 people?  There is no support for those people.  They get no support whatever.  In fairness to them, they do not want it provided they get a level playing field.  They are definitely not getting that today where insurance is concerned.  It is outrageous, quite honestly.<\/p> <p> The other issue that was mentioned was people returning home.  If someone has been away from the country for three years and comes back, they are new again as far as motor insurance is concerned.  That is not fair to people.  As was said by the Minister of State's colleague, Deputy Neville, some people work in a company and drive a company car for ten, 15 or 20 years.  They may have 20 years' worth of no-claims bonuses.  When they retire from work, purchase a car for themselves and try to get insurance for the car, the same company tells them they are starting out again.  That is outrageous carry-on.  They should not be allowed to do what they are doing.<\/p> <p> Another issue is driving licences.  I know it is not the Minister of State's brief, but people are coming back to this country and we welcome them back.  If I come from Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia or England, I can exchange my licence in that country for an Irish licence.  If I come from America, however, I cannot exchange an American licence from an Irish licence unless I come from one of three states.  People coming from America have to start off again with a provisional licence.  Thanks to the Bill passed through the D&aacute;il last week by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, even though they might have driven for 40 or 50 years, they have to have a fully licensed driver with them until they can do their test.  This is the nonsense that is going on.  Quite honestly, it has to stop.  I know the Minister of State is a decent individual, and I hope that he carries the message loud and clear to the senior Ministers of this Government so that this can be dealt with fairly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000058#FFF00200","speaker":"1344","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531259400,"counter":744,"content":"<p>While I welcome this Bill to the House, it is unsatisfactorily late for the people who suffered in the Setanta Insurance debacle.  That includes both those who were insured with Setanta, and those who were involved in accidents, in which they were not at fault, with people who were insured with Setanta.  They were left hanging for years on end.  The way that this issue was dealt with was very unsatisfactory.<\/p>  <p>  My view of life is that if people comply with the law, if people buy products that are meant to be checked by regulation, either at European or national level, they are innocent victims and should not be hung out to dry like those injured parties in accidents involving somebody who was insured with Setanta, whether the damages they suffered consisted of vehicular damage or personal injuries.  Then there are the people who thought they had insurance with Setanta.  They were also left hanging with no money.<\/p>  <p>  If I were asked what the biggest change in recent years has been, and it is one thing I have noticed about the world, I would say it is the amazing ability to do everything very slowly, to make everything so complicated that we can never seem to get to a conclusion on any issue.  If the public are left waiting, so what?  That seems to be the attitude.  It should not be the attitude.  These are ordinary human beings going about their ordinary daily business, following the law and doing everything perfectly.  As I have said, in many cases they were not insured with Setanta themselves but they were involved in an accident with someone who was.  Even that person was innocent because they thought they had good, valid insurance.<\/p>  <p>  I look at all the schemes that come in now such as housing schemes.  We ask for the numbers of people who are successful under those schemes.  I look at this debacle.  We have created a society where ordinary people always seem to be the losers.  I welcome this Bill coming in, and I hope that we can truly say that this will never happen again, that people driving on our roads, insured with companies that are legally allowed to operate in this jurisdiction, will never be a risk to themselves or anybody else because of the insurance that they carry.<\/p>  <p>  I know one constituent with a very modest income who was involved in an accident.  The reality was that having to carry this for all this period has been a huge financial burden.  What did they do wrong?  Nothing.  They drove on the public road in a perfectly insured vehicle, they were hit by someone in a vehicle that was supposedly insured, and they were let down by the State.  I have been told about all the legal complications in the High Court, the Supreme Court and whatever.  My attitude is that all those things should be fought out, but in the meantime we should make sure that the ordinary small punter is sorted and work out who pays what in the end between all the big people.  I have been told that is not possible.  I do not believe it.  When things have to be done, they can be done.  I welcome what has been done, but I wonder why it took so long.<\/p>  <p>  I was listening to Deputy Scanlon when he spoke about the wider issue of the inaction of the Government on insurance, particularly concerning loading.  He spoke about older cars, which is a very valid issue.  I believe that under the law, no insurance company should be allowed to load anybody for anything - penalty points, age of car or any of those issues - unless it can produce objective evidence that the risk is higher.<\/p>  <p>  Many moons ago I was discussing getting a reduction in insurance premiums for those living on the islands.  We had a special regime of lower taxation on the islands because of the small amount of roads.  That provision still exists to this day on the islands.  We also had a regime whereby there was no need to carry out a national car test, NCT, on cars on the islands, because taking a car off an offshore island and onto the mainland was a very expensive operation.<\/p><p>Inis M&oacute;r, the biggest island, might have six miles of road but they are narrow roads and people cannot get great speed on them.  I was negotiating discounts for them on the same basis.  I asked whether the fact they do not have to do an NCT would make a difference.  In fairness, at the time the islanders got a 30% discount, but they have lost it since.  They said to me that the NCT does not really make that much difference because a mechanical failure rarely causes accidents in the modern world.  I know there are exceptions but insurance companies do not work on individual cases, they work on statistical risk issues.  If someone can prove to me that statistically a ten or 11 year old car with an NCT is more prone to accidents and that mechanically it is more likely to fail and cause a serious accident, or an accident of any type, I will say that is fair enough and it is a justified loading, but I wonder whether there is any objective criterion.  My belief is the law should state insurance companies should not be allowed to load unless they have objective criteria to prove the loading is justified and not something that is done on the back of an envelope.<\/p> <p> I fully accept a 30 or 40 year old car is significantly different because modern vehicles are made differently and are designed to crumple in a way that reduces the damage compared to what would have happened in an equivalent car 30 or 40 years ago.  I do not believe there has been that much development in the past ten or 15 years but, again, let us base it on fact.  Let us base it on the model.  One would have to look at all the different models of car and decide which are the safe models in terms of safety features and their ability to crumple in a serious accident in the places they should crumple and not to crumple in the places they should not crumple and provide maximum protection in the cab.<\/p> <p> As somebody who was involved in a head-on collision I realise the importance of the driver.  I was not driving as it happens, and I was lucky that day that I probably had one of the best trained drivers in the State driving me.  It is certainly a credit to him that we came out with very minor injuries.  Furthermore, it made a difference that we were driving in a good well-built car that was very well designed.  It was a Volvo.  It did what it said on the tin in terms of the way it acted.  If that car were still on the road it would be well over ten years old, but its design features would not have changed.  Again, I believe we have to tackle the insurance loading issue and the insurance cost issue.<\/p> <p> This country has become particularly cruel for young people.  Houses are out of their price range and their wages are reduced if they join the public service.  There is also the cost of car insurance, which virtually everybody needs to get to work and for leisure purposes in the modern world.  All the Government is thinking and talking about, and what the universities persistently want them to do, is pay for their education by taking out loans they will pay back when they get to work and get a job.  This insurance issue needs to be tackled scientifically and the insurance companies acting as prima donnas, without any explanation to anybody and without any evidence, has to be eliminated.<\/p> <p> I welcome the Bill.  Is fearr deireanach n&aacute; go br&aacute;ch, ach t&aacute; s&eacute; seo thar a bheith deireanach.  Is maith an rud &eacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; ag teacht faoin&aacute;r mbr&aacute;id.

I have to say the level of ignorance of some Deputies, specifically Deputies Mattie McGrath, Michael Collins and Danny Healy-Rae, about insurance and what has happened, what is happening and what is to happen is astounding and I find it disappointing.  I asked Deputy Mattie McGrath to stay so he might listen to what I have to say, but he did not do so and neither did his colleagues.  That is disappointing.  This is on top of what happened three weeks ago, when I had an information session on insurance in the AV Room and over the two hours four people showed up.  If we look around the Chamber there is myself and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and nobody else.  Nobody is really interested in the answers and solutions on insurance at this moment in time.  They want to come in and throw boots around the place and say we are doing nothing.  Nothing could be further from the truth.<\/p>  <p>  This is a very important issue and it is the appropriate place for me to put on the record of the House what has happened, what is happening and what is yet to happen.  The Bill is to amend what happened with regard to Setanta Insurance.  The failure of Setanta Insurance in 2014, and the uncertainty that followed over the compensation arrangements with third-party claimants, highlighted weaknesses with the current insurance compensation framework, in particular the fact that a third-party motor insurance claimant under the insurance compensation fund is only entitled to 65% of a claim, or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser, while the equivalent third-party claimant under the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland for uninsured, unidentified vehicles is generally entitled to full compensation.  This is undoubtedly inequitable.  Even in overturning the decision that may have been liable for the Setanta Insurance payments, this was recognised by the Supreme Court.  The purpose of the Bill, therefore, is to address this unfairness by increasing the level of insurance compensation fund coverage for all future third-party motor claims from 65% to 100% for personal injuries, and to &euro;1.22 million per claim to ensure Setanta Insurance and Enterprise Insurance third-party claimants are compensated in full.  The other key element of the Bill is to require that the increased coverage be funded by a contribution to the insurance compensation fund by the motor insurance industry to cover this extra 35% as well as providing for enhanced governance and administrative arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we prioritise the passing of this legislation on our return in September, in particular to enable those who have settled their claims and have already received compensation from the insurance compensation fund to receive the balance of 35% owing to them.  To Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and anybody else who is listening, I am quite happy to pass this before the recess.  If Members of other groups and the Business Committee want to conclude this I will do so with them, but I cannot do it on my own.<\/p><p> It should be remembered that only claims that have been settled can be included in any future applications to the High Court for payment from the insurance compensation fund, ICF.  The settlement of claims is very much a matter between claimant and liquidator or for the courts, and it is something over which the Government has no control.  In many cases I understand the process of settling claims is ongoing and subject in some cases to complex negotiation between all relevant parties.  It is hoped, therefore, that by the State taking steps to ensure that third-party claimants are compensated in full, this will lead to an acceleration of the settlement of all outstanding claims.<\/p> <p> I will speak to insurance in general and some of the areas touched on by the debate.  Nobody used the most important word applying to insurance in Ireland today, which is \"awards\".  We had some conversation about claims but nobody mentioned awards.  The Department of Finance has done work on awards and we are referencing them to our closest neighbours, the UK.  The indications are that an award in Ireland, when compared with an equivalent award in the UK, is between three and six times as much.  One does not need to know much about insurance to understand that if there is a high awards system, there will be a high premium system.  It is as black and white as that.<\/p> <p> The cost of insurance working group report was published in January 2017.  Flowing from that was the Personal Injuries Commission report from Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns and the report from the working group on the cost of employer and public liability.  By the end of this year, we will have 26 from 29 recommended actions concluded from those reports.  There will be approximately six actions not concluded that relate to the motor insurance report.<\/p> <p> Mr. Justice Kearns in his report highlighted many important areas, including the progression of the updated book of quantum.  The book of quantum is not what anybody might think an award should be for an injury but rather it considers the previous three years, averaging those awards.  The reduction of the book of quantum is a matter for the courts, and if the awards are reduced, the book of quantum can be reduced.  There was criticism to the effect that this Chamber does not set the awards but it does not have the authority to do that.  Awards are civil matters between an individual and, most likely, an insurance company.  If somebody is not insured, the process involves another individual or party.  These are civil matters in the civil courts of this jurisdictions.  These are the limitations.  We made requests of the Attorney General and it in turn asked the Law Reform Commission to make an examination.  We hope the Law Reform Commission will take this on and produce a large body of work.<\/p> <p> I will turn to the comments of Deputies.  A Deputy raised the matter of levies and we expect the 2% levy to be in place for four or perhaps five years.  That will bring the total to &euro;150 million.  Subsequent to this, the opportunity exists to reduce the levy to 1% and take the amount up by &euro;50 million to &euro;200 million.  At that stage we will have the opportunity to bring the amount to nil.  We hope to do that in four to five years.  A Deputy mentioned the PMPA levy but this was discontinued in 1991.  A levy was subsequently reintroduced because of the Quinn Insurance liquidation and it has been in place since.  The 2% levy is a matter for insurance companies, which can absorb it into costs or pass it on.  It is not for us to tell them what to do, although I know what I would like them to do.  It is a commercial decision for each insurance company.<\/p> <p> I was asked if there is a long-term plan, and there is such a plan.  This Bill is before the House and legislation relating to a national claims information database is to be published next week, to be taken by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  We will have amending legislation for the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, which will strengthen the powers of PIAB with respect to non-attendance at medicals and matters of that nature.  We hope that will go to the Government next week for approval to be published.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will bring forward the Judicial Council Bill 2017, with the Department considering the insertion of a provision for the training on assessment of personal injury damages.  The Bill has been published but we are awaiting Committee Stage amendments and a date for that debate.<\/p> <p> The Department of Justice and Equality is also considering the amendment of sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.  The initial draft heads have been prepared to amend these very important sections and how they would interact with new data protection rules.  If somebody has imagery, they are obliged to delete the footage within one month, but we are reconciling the time somebody has to retain the imagery.  This relates to the time in which a party must be informed of a potential incident and be afforded the opportunity to save footage to aid defence in the future.  Section 14 of the amended Act would allow a court to draw an inference from failure to produce a verifying affidavit within 21 days.  If somebody does not do what is required, such as saving video imagery, inference can be taken against that party in court, which is very important.<\/p> <p> A Deputy spoke about the implementation of a new section being required for revised matters relating to the criminal act of insurance fraud.  We are satisfied the Act, particularly sections 25 and 26, is strong enough in this regard.  The penalties are a &euro;100,000 fine or prison or both.  That is strong enough.  If somebody wants to take a chance on insurance fraud or exaggeration, the sanction is sufficiently strong to deal with the matter.  It has fallen down between a justice suspecting an element of insurance fraud or exaggeration and the correct pathway between the court, the Garda, the Director of Public Prosecutions and insurance companies.  There is no correct place for the judge to air an opinion of fraud and call in garda&iacute; to take a statement from the person sitting in court who is taking a chance on a one-way bet of insurance fraud for tens of thousands of euro.  I am not saying that will happen but it is something that could happen if we get the pathway correct.<\/p> <p> There are some other issues and I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair.  There was mention of the Garda fraud unit being funded by the insurance industry.  Deputy Doherty is opposed to this and in newspaper reports I note Deputy O'Callaghan, the Fianna F&aacute;il justice spokesperson, has raised concerns about it.  I have concerns about this personally.  I came into this job 12 months ago and this was a recommendation.<\/p><p>I outlined in the finance committee my concerns about it and how it was a matter to be discussed between the Minister for Justice and Equality and the incoming Garda Commissioner.  Some people took complete offence at that.<\/p> <p> I do not support the idea that an industry should pay a portion of the wages of garda&iacute;.  That is a personal view.  I will try to implement the recommendation because it was concluded before I came into the job.  I have an obligation to do that.  However, at a personal level I have major qualms about any individual private sector funding any section of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The same view has been outlined by several other people.<\/p> <p> There are other ways of doing exactly that.  If there are other ways of doing exactly that, then we want to ensure we explore the opportunities and how we may put in place a correctly-funded Garda insurance fraud unit with a budget of &euro;1 million &ndash; that is what Insurance Ireland has said it will do.  It has said it will provide &euro;1 million towards the section.  I believe there are more appropriate ways of doing that.  Having said that, I will try to progress it with the Minister for Justice and Equality, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the new Commissioner, when he takes up the position.  We will take it from there.<\/p> <p> As I have said, I am perfectly happy for the legislation to come through before the end of this term, if that is possible but I am unsure whether it is possible.  If it is possible, then I am up for it and I would like everyone else to be as well.<\/p> <p> The reality is that we have awards that are, on average, between three and five and a half times more than the sums awarded in the UK.  We also have other awards that are even higher - these are outlier awards.  Under the new Solvency II rules on capitalisation insurance companies are obliged to fund accordingly.  If a person has a broken arm and there is an outlier award, the company has to capitalise on that basis of that amount.  This is what is really doing the damage.  We have awards that are too high.  We have exaggeration and fraud.  That is a perfect storm for insurance and that is why the awards in Ireland are some of the highest in the world.<\/p> <p> I wish to touch on the insurance companies quickly.  The insurance companies tell us that it is all the fault of exaggeration and all the fault of fraud.  As a result of these factors and the storms, including Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma, I decided to look into exactly how insurance companies deal with their clients or customers.  Their customers buy their products and insure themselves with a given company.  That examination is ongoing.  I have met all the insurance companies in recent months.  I am meeting the loss-adjusters and the brokers to try to learn more about the interaction between the individuals and the companies.<\/p> <p> I believe this is a significant consumer protection issue.  I have spoken with the Central Bank of Ireland and I have requested the views of the bank on the consumer protection side.  The Central Bank is the regulator and it is the job of the bank to ensure that consumer protection is appropriate.  I have asked for the views of the Central Bank on the matter.  I have no wish to predict the outcome of the report before it is concluded.<\/p> <p> There are other relevant areas and I have touched upon most of them.  Deputy Scanlon said nothing was done for the hauliers.  Three years ago there was a significant reduction by the Government at budget time on the haulier tax or tax on vehicles.  That was very much welcomed so I do not accept the contention.<\/p> <p> As I have said previously, I will look into company cars.<\/p> <p> Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned that individuals who took out Setanta insurance were let down by the State.  They were not let down by the State.  The State is intervening to ensure that the amount of redress, which was to be 65%, would be 100%.  We did not have to do that but we took the view it was appropriate and the correct thing to do.  People bought insurance and adhered to the law of the land on insurance.  The decision of the courts held that some people potentially would only be paid 65%.  We took the view that decision was wrong and not appropriate.  This legislation is dealing with the issue.<\/p> <p> I wish to put on record the reason there was a delay.  Some Deputies may know already.  Until 27 May, when the Supreme Court overturned the decision on the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, the Minister for Finance was not in a position to intervene as the insurance industry, through MIBI, was responsible for compensation for third-party claimants in full.  That was subsequently over-ruled by the Supreme Court.  Once that was done, it was necessary to take legal advice and carry out an actuarial assessment on the matter.  I understand that was not concluded until December of 2017.  The following January it was concluded.  In only a short number of weeks we made a determination that the right thing to do for those people who adhered to the law of the land was to ensure that they were fully compensated 100% and not only to the extent of 65%.  That is what we are dealing with under this Bill.  We are putting that into effect.<\/p> <p> I appreciate your indulgence, a Cheann Comhairle.  I imagine I have left out many aspects of this.  If people want this to be done before the end of the session, the Business Committee can help me out.  I imagine the finance spokespersons would facilitate that, as would I.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000060#HHH00700","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531261200,"counter":754,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2018: Referral to Select Committee","time":1531261200,"counter":755,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000062#KKK00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1531261200,"counter":756,"content":"<p>In theory, the Bill is supposed to be referred to the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3)(a) and 149(1).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000062#KKK00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1531261200,"counter":757,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure, Reform, and Taoiseach pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3)(a) and 149(1) of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071000062#KKK00500","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1531261200,"counter":758,"content":"<p>Having said that, if it is the case, given what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has proposed and what the Minister of State has said, that the House wishes to proceed otherwise, then we can ask the Business Committee tomorrow if it will consider finding some time in the remaining two days to progress the Bill through Committee and Report Stages.
