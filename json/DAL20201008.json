At the meeting in a barracks in Cork, we agreed that we should commit to meeting on a more regular basis and I am happy to follow through on that.  I hope we can meet quarterly or at least three times per year or as needed.  As the Deputy will be aware, the report of the Public Service Pay Commission on recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces was published on 4 July 2019.  The report was accepted in full by the then Government and, in order to facilitate implementation, an extensive high-level plan entitled Strengthening our Defence Forces &ndash; Phase One, was agreed and published on the same date.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the representative associations have been briefed on a regular basis by the officials of my Department charged with co-ordinating all the projects in the high-level plan as to progress in each of the project areas.

In this context, several submissions with extensive observations have been made and I appreciate this engagement.<\/p>  <p>  The immediate pay recommendations in the high-level implementation plan have all been delivered on foot of their acceptance by the representative associations.

However, it must be acknowledged that the anticipated timeframes for certain projects were overly ambitious.  In addition, the Covid-19 emergency has impacted on some of the project timeframes.  In some cases, personnel resources were necessarily reassigned to matters relating to the Covid-19 response and where other essential work was necessary, that took priority.  However, work is ongoing on all projects and they are being progressed as quickly as possible.  <\/p>  <p>  I intend to develop a very good relationship with the representative bodies.

This is in line with the single force concept and the role of the Reserve as described in the White Paper.

However, association with ICTU poses complex questions for the Defence Forces from a legal, operational and management perspective.  It is critically important that Defence Forces operations are not restricted and this is a key concern.<\/p>  <p>  The European Committee of Social Rights, in arriving at its decision, took into an account a statement made in the complaint which claimed that ICTU had stated that &ldquo;PDFORRA could be affiliated to ICTU with whatever conditions the Government deemed necessary&rdquo;.  Defence management, civil and military, have engaged in discussions with the permanent Defence Forces representative associations and ICTU regarding the practicalities of a Defence Forces representative association forming association or affiliation with ICTU.  These discussions have encompassed matters of concern to all parties.<\/p>  <p>  PDFORRA subsequently initiated legal proceedings on this matter on 26 June 2020.  As this matter is now subject to litigation, it would not be appropriate to comment further.<\/p>  <p>  This is an issue I would rather was not in court and was not concluded by legal ruling.  What we are trying to do in setting up a commission to look at all issues, including pay and structures within the Defence Forces, and the commitment in the programme for Government to set up a separate pay entity to assess pay within the Defence Forces after the initial commission's work is to recognise that serving in the Defence Forces is different to other public sector work.  People take an oath to the State, they are the last line of defence for the State and compromises come with that.  My job is to ensure that we more than take account of that in the structures that are there to represent Defence Forces personnel properly, whether that be in public sector pay talks or in any other area.

There is significant expertise in the Department with responsibility for the environment, climate and communications from a communications perspective, which is essentially the platform for cybersecurity attacks.  One could argue for the NCSC to come under the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Defence or the Department with responsibility for the environment, climate and communications or for central co-ordination from the Taoiseach.  The decision was made, after a lot of discussion, that the national cybersecurity centre should come under the Department with responsibility for the environment, climate and communications because we are talking about communications networks being intercepted and compromised by security threats.<\/p>  <p>  I understand the argument the Deputy is making but there is significant expertise in that Department.  Most important, the message is that the NCSC is about pulling together all of the expertise from different Departments, including the Defence Forces as well as the Department of Defence, to make sure we have a central office that is using all of the expertise available to make sure we are protecting the interests of the State from cybersecurity attacks, which are a significant threat internationally.

Personnel in the Naval Service are paid basic pay, military service allowance and, where appropriate, technical pay at the same rates as their colleagues in the Army and Air Corps.  Enlisted personnel of the Naval Service also receive naval pay.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of reports that a small number of personnel have left the Naval Service in recent times to pursue a career in the Army.  This can be for a variety of reasons, including career progression or personal circumstances.  The range of duties undertaken differs across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.  Where there is commonality, such as base security duties, the same duty rates are paid.  However, members of the Naval Service undertake seagoing duty which differs from duties undertaken by other members of the Defence Forces.  When on their two-year seagoing rotation, members of the Naval Service can be away from home on a regular basis.  For this reason and because of the nature of the duty, seagoing service can prove unattractive.  Jobs in the private sector and elsewhere which do not require such absences at sea have proved attractive for members of the Naval Service, both new entrants and more experienced personnel.<\/p>  <p>  Naval Service personnel undertaking seagoing duties are paid a patrol duty allowance for each patrol day that they undertake.  This is in addition to their basic pay, military service allowance, naval pay and technical pay, where applicable.  An increase of 2% on annualised salaries is being implemented from 1 October 2020 under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.  The 5% cut in allowances imposed under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, legislation is also being reversed from 1 October this year.  This will benefit Naval Service personnel with an increase in the daily patrol duty allowance to &euro;56.14 per day for personnel enlisted prior to January 2013, &euro;59.09 per day for personnel enlisted after January 2013 and &euro;58.86 per day for officers.  Each ship has a target of 165 patrol days each year.  A special tax credit was introduced on a one-off exceptional basis in the Finance Act 2019 to incentivise seagoing duties.  A seagoing naval personnel tax credit of &euro;1,270 applies for the 2020 tax year and is based on the number of days served at sea in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that we are continuing to work with the Naval Service to find ways of ensuring that we can enhance even further the attractiveness of committing to go to sea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800010#H00500","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1602153600,"counter":84,"content":"<p>First, I commend the valuable work done by our serving personnel on our behalf at home and abroad.

The occupational pension scheme terms for post-1 January 2013 new entrants to the public service, including the permanent Defence Force, PDF, are governed by the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012.  All first-time new entrants to pensionable public service employment on or after that date are members of the single scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The single scheme is a key structural fiscal reform introduced to help significantly reduce the cost of public service pensions in the long term, while at the same time continuing to provide valuable pension benefits for employees.  In the general context of that policy objective, the terms and rules of the single scheme, which are fundamentally different to previous superannuation public service arrangements, make no provision for the concept or award of supplementary pensions for any new entrants joining any public service group from 1 January 2013 onwards.  Notwithstanding the distinguishing features of the single scheme, members of the PDF in that scheme retain the minimum pension age of 50 to reflect operational needs, as already applies to new entrant military personnel recruited since April 2004.  Importantly, the single scheme also retains \"fast accrual\" pension terms for groups such as the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  Under the 2012 Act, overall statutory responsibility for the single scheme pension terms and rules rests with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  In that regard, the absence from the single scheme of provision for the concept of supplementary pensions for any new entrants joining any public service group, including the PDF, on or after 1 January 2013, has previously been confirmed by the official side to the Defence Forces representative associations, and the position in that regard has been restated to RACO by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at a recent meeting with that association.<\/p>  <p>  I am also advised that the Public Service Pay Commission considered certain aspects of military superannuation provisions, which were submitted as an influencing factor on military recruitment and-or retention outcomes.  The commission&rsquo;s report on recruitment and retention in the PDF, which was accepted in full by Government in July 2019, considered the concerns expressed by the military representative associations in relation to various aspects of pension scheme provisions for the Defence Forces.  The commission made no recommendations advocating any improvements to the pension scheme terms of the PDF.  However, the Public Service Pay Commission report recommended a range of measures relating to pay and non-pay aspects that would result in immediate and future benefits for members of the PDF.  These projects are currently under way or completed.  These include a review of barriers to extended participation in the PDF and, in particular, the possibility of extending or increasing retirement ages for members of the PDF.  Phase 1 of this project, the review of mandatory retirement ages for commissioned officers, is nearing completion, while phase 2, the review of contracts of service for enlisted personnel, is commencing.  However, while those deliberations are ongoing, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.  This is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and I need to be careful what I say in this regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800011#J00500","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1602154200,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that comprehensive response, which contains some interesting material.

As the Deputy knows, there is a reason many in the Defence Forces are required to retire at a certain age.  It is a challenging career, so there are age constraints in regard to some of the work that is done.  That said, we are discussing and reviewing this at the moment.  Many people in their 50s and 60s have pursued successful careers in the private sector and, indeed, the public sector after leaving the Defence Forces.  That is with good reason because they are highly sought after, by and large.  It is a problem for us at the moment because they are so sought after by the private sector that we are struggling to hold on to some of them, whether in the Naval Service or the Air Corps, where our pilots were essentially being headhunted by private airlines.  Because we train the Defence Forces very well, there are career options after people leave, particularly for officers but also for others, in particular as that skillset and discipline towards work are highly sought after.  That is a kind of double-edged sword from our perspective.

I am aware that there continues to be a shortfall between the overall current strength figures and those of the establishment and I am committed to restoring the strength of the Defence Forces to 9,500, which is the figure in the White Paper.  The Public Service Pay Commission report and implementation of the high level plan, Strengthening Our Defence Forces - Phase 1, is a key part of the response to address recruitment and retention challenges and my responses to other questions today detail this.<\/p>  <p>  I accept there are ongoing difficulties in the Defence Forces, and these have been well-documented.  The reduction in the number of operational ships due to personnel shortages is a case in point and is one area where I believe further measures are required.  The inability to induct recruits at previous levels as a result of Covid is also an aggravating factor.  However, there are also positive developments which are restoring capacity in areas which were significantly depleted.  By way of example, overall officer numbers are just 13 off the full establishment figure as at 31 August 2020.  While I appreciate that experience levels have declined at some ranks and that gaps remain gaps in certain areas, the continued attraction of officer cadets in what was a competitive jobs market is indicative of the continued attractiveness of such a career.<\/p> <p>Further initiatives such as the recommissioning of former Air Corps pilots have also assisted in boosting the number of much -needed specialists.  I understand that further specialist officers will be recommissioned.  The re-enlistment of former enlisted personnel is another initiative that is to be welcomed.  While the numbers being inducted are lower than initially anticipated, all will play an important role in restoring capacity.    <\/p> <p> The fact is that the restoration of capacity in the Defence Forces will take time.  The programme for Government provides that a commission on the Defence Forces will be tasked with examining a range of issues.  This will provide an opportunity to chart the future direction of the Defence Forces.  There is also a commitment to establish a pay review body specifically for the Defence Forces when the commission has completed its work.   <\/p> <p> Working closely with the Secretary General, the Chief of Staff and a range of other key stakeholders including the representative bodies, I am confident that the current challenges facing the Defence Forces can be overcome, although it will take some time.

It was, and still is, an extremely worrying situation.  Since the weekend, there have been a number of large clusters in nursing homes, including one in Convoy in my own constituency.  The rate of admissions to hospital has been on the rise and the number of Covid-19 cases in ICU has risen, as has the number of patients on ventilators.  This is all reflected in the comments of the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, Dr. Tony Holohan, yesterday who said that his level of concern on Sunday was lower than his current level of concern.<\/p>  <p>  Since then, instead of setting out a plan to deal with the situation in our hospitals, the Government has allowed a narrative to prevail that this it is everybody's fault bar their own.  The T&aacute;naiste said on RT&Eacute; television that NPHET's advice was landed upon him as a surprise.  We now know that is not the case.  The CMO organised an extraordinary meeting of NPHET on Sunday and informed the Minister for Health of this on Saturday.  He spoke to the Minister before and after the NPHET meeting.  He did everything he could have to keep the Government in the loop.  It was only when NPHET's recommendations made their way to Government that they were leaked.  For 24 hours afterwards, the Government said nothing.  When the T&aacute;naiste did say something on national television, it was to engage in distraction and a sideshow.  He played the man instead of the ball.  <\/p>  <p>  In all of this time the Minister for Health stayed schtum.  He said nothing and allowed the perception to prevail that this had all come out of the blue.  Most significantly, since then he has said nothing about increasing capacity in our hospitals.  That is the real issue here.  <\/p>  <p>  We are unprepared for a surge in our hospitals due to the lack of capacity.  The winter plan the Government published is insufficient, as everybody knows.  The Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, has said that the winter plan will not be enough.  Its president, Dr. Padraig McGarry, said that shutting down elective care to deal with any winter surge is not an option given the impact of delayed diagnosis, delayed treatment and ever-increasing waiting lists for outpatient appointments, inpatient day cases and investigative procedures.  This lack of capacity and lack of beds is the crux of the problem.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste might talk about surge capacity and so on in his reply but we know that the knock-on effects of this approach will be absolutely catastrophic for the health service. He knows that and so do I.  We need to tackle this issue head-on and to tackle it now.  Does the T&aacute;naiste accept that ICU capacity is a major issue?  Does he also accept that the current plan is completely insufficient to deal with a second surge without having a massive impact on non-Covid care?  Crucially, what is he going to do about it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800012#K00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1602154800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Covid is nobody's fault.  Nobody in the Government is engaging in any sort of blame game.  That is the game of others.  This is a virus.  Nobody is to blame for it whether here or north of the Border.  I will not speak for the Minister, Deputy Donnelly; I understand he is to issue a statement later in the day.  I can, however, speak for the Government and for myself.  I can give the facts.  Nobody in Government had any indication that consideration was being given to recommending a move to level 5 until Sunday.  This was confirmed by the CMO at last night's press conference.  It was a shock; it did come out of the blue.  We were not prepared for it nor was the country.<\/p>  <p>  What do I mean by \"out of the blue\"?  The recommendation came on Sunday, only three days after NPHET had said in writing that it did not strongly support a move to level 3 nationally at that time.  It was also not in line with the parameters set out in the Government's framework - a leaflet explaining it has gone through every door in the country.  Under this framework, restrictions are to be escalated in steps.  The criteria for reaching level 5 had not been met.  A decision of such gravity needs to be talked through and thought through.  I refer not only to the reasons for such a decision, but its implications for people, the exit strategy and co-ordination with Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  To clarify and to be very clear, the Taoiseach, the leader of the Green Party and I were informed on Saturday that a meeting of NPHET had been called for Sunday.  There was no suggestion, not even an inkling, that level 5 was being contemplated.  Had we known that, we would have sought an urgent briefing that night.  That is what could, and should, have happened.  The first indication I had that level 5 was being considered came on Sunday evening, after the NPHET meeting had taken place.  I received confirmation in writing at 8.30 p.m., setting out the recommendations and the reasons for them.  For some Minister, the first they heard of this on the news.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that the Deputy may want to make a big deal about which Minister knew what and at what time on Sunday but that is not the point.  The point is that we had no indication that this was even being considered until Sunday.  We need to move on from this.  This should not be NPHET versus the Government or the Government versus the Opposition; this has to be Ireland versus the coronavirus.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government is acting in response to the escalating situation.  We took the decision to move the entire country to level 3 only the other day and I believe the Deputy's party supports that decision and the decision not to go to level 5.  If that is not the case, the Deputy may wish to say so.  That decision is being implemented.  We know that level 3 was successful in counties Laois, Offaly and Kildare.  We can also see that it might be working in Dublin but it is too early to know for sure.  The R-nought number, however, seems to be down to approximately 1.  It will be the best part of ten days before we know whether it is working in the rest of the country but it is something on which we are acting.<\/p>  <p>  Capacity is an issue in our health service.  It is very often an issue.  Going into this crisis, we had well above the European average number of nurses and about the average number of doctors at 3.3 per 100,000.  We were a bit below average as regards hospital beds when compared with other countries but had more than countries such as Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Canada and New Zealand.  I could go on.  Since then we have added 800 acute and subacute beds to the system, approximately 150 of which are currently being used by patients who have Covid.  We have also increased the number of ICU beds, which was 225, by approximately 60.  Approximately 25 or 26 are being used today.  We have increased capacity and will increase it further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800012#K00400","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1602154800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste said this should not be a matter of NPHET versus the Government and I agree.

I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that, if it had been me, he would be the first to stand up and say that it was reckless, that it undermined public confidence and so on.

We know that was not the case, that there was an unscheduled meeting of NPHET on Sunday, and that the Minister for Health also had telephone calls before and after that meeting.  Telephone conversations are two way.  We would expect the Minister for Health to have asked questions to see what exactly that meeting was about and what measures NPHET was considering.  Was the T&aacute;naiste fully aware of that conversation and will he outline that for us?<\/p>  <p>  In hindsight, given the escalating numbers, does the T&aacute;naiste regret the interview with Claire Byrne?  Does he accept that it has been a distraction in the fight against the virus?  Does he accept that the primary focus this week has been about mending fences?  Indeed, the T&aacute;naiste has just said that he had a telephone conversation to clear the air.  We really should be focusing on putting our collective efforts into fighting this virus.  A collective approach is needed from the Government, NPHET, the political system and from the public.  The public can only do so much, however.  The State must also play its part and play it comprehensively.  We must reduce the incidence of the virus and take the pressure off the hospitals, and those matters are already being talked about.<\/p>  <p>  In March, the T&aacute;naiste told us that there was a comprehensive strategy involving restrictions, social distancing, testing, contact tracing and isolation where there was a positive test result.  That was followed in May when he announced the HSE's strategy on testing and contact tracing.  There were going to be key performance indicators for testing and contact tracing.  In recent days, a leading health specialist has warned that regional departments in the public health system can no longer cope and that Covid-19 outbreaks are going to be missed.  Dr. Anne Dee, a consultant in public health medicine, is reported as saying that eight regional departments are now \"throwing in the towel\" and giving up on \"proper\" contact tracing.  She spoke about the urgency of getting staff and was fearful that it will be the new year before those staff are in place.  She added that \"The regional health system is as close to collapse as it has been at any time before.\"<\/p>  <p>  We trusted the Government to ensure that these systems were put in place and that they were resourced and functioning.  The idea that contact tracing is nearing collapse should be a major source of concern.  We cannot contain the virus if we do not know where it is and we do not ensure that people are properly traced.  We need a frank discussion on the shortcomings and how they are going to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  Does the T&aacute;naiste believe that, to clear the air, the Minister for Health should make a full statement in the D&aacute;il so that people can ask questions?  I ask because we must get rid of this distraction.  Were those with responsibility for regional public health systems contacted and asked what is required?

I cannot answer the Deputy's second question regarding whether public health departments have been contacted, but I am sure they have been.  We all appreciate the amazing work the public health departments are doing in contact tracing.  They have had the assistance of people who would never have known what contact tracing was until recent months but who were trained to do exactly that, including members of the Defence Forces.  It is important that they are properly resourced.<\/p>  <p>  As the number of cases increases and the number of contacts people have also increases, contact tracing becomes all the more difficult.  That is why we are asking people to minimise the number of social contacts they have, because that will make the job easier for contact tracers.  If most of us have two, three or four social contacts, that makes the job of a contact tracer much easier than if we have 20, 30 or 40 social contacts.  That is part of the rationale behind encouraging people to avoid gatherings and limiting the size of gatherings that people can have.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Monday night, I did not say I heard it from a media leak.  I never said that.  If that is the impression the Deputy got, that is the impression she got, but it is not something that I have ever claimed.  I set out the timeline earlier in response to Deputy Doherty.  It is how many of the public heard, though, and that caused fear, anxiety and panic for hundreds of thousands of people who thought they might be out of work the next day and for tens of thousands of businesses that thought they might have to close for the last time.  It should not have happened in that way and that is not the way things were handled in the past.

Part of that infrastructure involves testing, and we are now testing 100,000 people per week.  There are 12,000, 13,000 or 14,000 tests every day.  This is polymerase chain reaction, PCR, testing which is the gold standard in testing.  Many other countries are not using PCR and are using less specific and less sensitive types of testing, such as antigen testing.  There is a role for that type of testing, but we are using PCR testing at the moment.  We are testing more people per head than many other countries that are often cited as models for dealing with the coronavirus, such as New Zealand and Germany.

Huge numbers of people were brought in to supplement the standing public health teams and that needs to be scaled up again, if it has not been done already. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800013#L02000","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602156000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>The last few questions have been about Covid but I wish to discuss the situation of school secretaries, who did enormous work over the past six months to ensure the reopening of our national and secondary schools, which is one of the best achievements during Covid so far.  Over 1,000 school secretaries are not being treated equally in their pay and conditions of employment.  Will the Government enter into meaningful discussions in the Labour Court, as agreed by the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Joe McHugh, in the House last October?  That was 12 months ago.  Over 1,000 school secretaries are being treated unequally as they are not getting paid other than through an annualised grant.  They are working side by side with secretaries in other schools in their towns and villages who are getting their full pay and being treated as public servants with holiday pay and entitlements.  We have relied on school secretaries to make sure that schools and their management have some resources in place.  Many of these school secretaries worked over the summer months without pay to make sure the schools reopened.  I understand that discussions have taken place but they have not been meaningful.  Will the Government ensure fair treatment and parity of esteem for those school secretaries?  They are not very happy that their issue has been kicked down the road and are contemplating industrial action.  It would be an indictment of all of us if school secretaries had to go out on strike after all they have done.  We have talked about front-line workers' bravery.  I believe school secretaries are front-line workers as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800014#M00200","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1602156000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Canney for raising this issue.  I know it is close to his heart and I remember us speaking about it months ago when we were in government together.  The Government really values the essential work done by school secretaries and caretakers.  Often, the school secretary is the first person one meets on the way into a school and the caretaker is the last person to leave in the evening.  Schools would not operate without them and the role they play in our education system is as important as that of schoolteachers, SNAs and school principals.  For that reason, it is the Government's objective to regularise their employment, terms and conditions, and pension rights.  That can only be done going forward.  It cannot be done retrospectively, for reasons that I will explain.  Of course, it has to be done by agreement and engagement and I sincerely hope that engagement will take place.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that officials from the Departments of Education and Skills and Public Expenditure and Reform and school management bodies met with the trade union F&oacute;rsa on 1 October in the Workplace Relations Commission.  An offer of a modest multiannual pay increase was made to F&oacute;rsa at that meeting but it was not acceptable to the union.  The Department of Education and Skills, in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is considering the union's request to refer the matter to the Labour Court for determination.  A number of technical issues exist as neither the Departments nor the management bodies are the employers of the staff in question.  In these circumstances, F&oacute;rsa's statement that it is considering strike action is regrettable, and as we know, any such action would have a day-to-day impact on the operation of schools at this critical time and would disrupt tuition for students who have only recently returned to school after a six-month gap.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the role played by these vital staff and significant improvements to the pay of secretaries and caretakers have been made since 2015, under a pay arbitration scheme.  This provided for a pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff, with a minimum rate of &euro;13 per hour phased in over that period.  The average hourly rate for a school secretary is now &euro;15.49, which is in line with the hourly rate for a grade 3 clerical officer, taking into account that a clerical officer works through the summer. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800014#M00300","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1602156000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>There are a number of issues here.  The T&aacute;naiste talked about engagement and it is important that engagement takes place.  It has been a year since the then Minister for Education and Skills agreed to enter into engagement with school secretaries.  The offer made by the Department was for a pay rise, but what the school secretaries want is equality in their pay, terms and conditions.  This issue has not been addressed by officials from either the Department of Education and Skills or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the discussions.  If we are going to bring into force what we say about holding school secretaries in high esteem, we need to engage in the mechanisms that are in place.  I again urge that this issue be taken up as a matter of urgency.  School secretaries are not people who want to go on strike.  They are not threatening it if they do not get somewhere but there is a short window of opportunity for the Departments to engage meaningfully to find a resolution to this matter once and for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800014#M00400","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1602156000,"counter":130,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct that a pay rise has been offered, but this is not just about pay.  It is about other issues as well and school secretaries and caretakers understandably want their employment terms and conditions to be regularised.  They want to be public sector employees, like teachers and other secretaries in the public service, working in local authorities or Civil Service departments.  However, we need to work out what equality means.  Secretaries and clerical officers working in Departments and local authorities work year-round and only have a few weeks of annual leave.  Many of those issues have to be worked out because equality must be defined in that context.  As is always the case with industrial relations matters such as this one, anything we do would have to be prospective and not retrospective.  If changes were retrospective, they would kick off claims from up to 100,000 other people who are not directly employed by the State but by bodies that are grant-aided by the State.  The Deputy will be familiar with a similar issue that arises with supervisors on community employment schemes.  The resolution can only be a prospective one but we do want to resolve this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800014#M00500","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1602156000,"counter":131,"content":"<p>T&aacute;naiste or Taoiseach, it makes no difference because Deputy Varadkar is both now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800014#M00600","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1602156000,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I am very definitely T&aacute;naiste.

One of the items on the agenda was the deficit in local authority funding.  I am fearful that there will be cuts in basic day-to-day services, such as taking care of housing stock, work on essential issues like roads and keeping services like libraries and public toilets open.  Our county will not be able to progress with new projects and initiatives.  Rather, it will struggle to provide essential services like those I have outlined already.  All our local authority has got so far is six months of a subvention on rates but it will now have to go after businesses looking for the other six months' worth of rates.  How in heaven's name can we go after cinemas, for example, which barely opened to very small numbers, and ask them to pay rates?  Our excellent county councillors on our local authority had to vote blindly on a property tax last week, not knowing what money they will be getting from central government.<\/p>  <p>  Now we are faced with a new issue, namely, the climate Bill.  New responsibility will be put on local authorities, which will be required to produce annual climate action plans, dealing with both the mitigation and adaptation sides of climate issues.  Frans Timmermans, the European Commissioner and Vice-President in charge of overseeing the European green deal, says we must plough ahead with this agenda at all costs.  What about the implications of imposing billions of euro of extra taxes on a public that is in dire straits and hurting already?<\/p>  <p>I will get a bit personal about this, not because she is my daughter as there are many other people's daughters.  Rosie Healy-Rae and Miche&aacute;l O'Shea, a very nice, young, respectable local man were getting married this Saturday.  It has been cancelled.  The implications and the economic bang of that for the hotel, the hairdressers, the car hire company and the people who provide the flowers is enormous.  That is only an example; there are other people.  10-10-20 was going to be their special day, like a bag of fertiliser.<\/p> <p> While all this is going on, the T&aacute;naiste and the Cabinet are signing up to &euro;9.5 billion of additional carbon taxes on a public who, like I say, are really hurting.  It will be &euro;1 billion a year of additional taxes.  I am not a climate change denier.  I want to protect all species on this planet, including the human species.  It is suggested that households may have to pay excise duty on their electricity to compensate for the drop in revenue to the State from the people switching from petrol and diesel to electric vehicles.  This is according to a report from the Department of Finance's tax strategy group.

I understand from Deputy Griffin that the financial gap for Kerry County Council is estimated at about &euro;5 million or &euro;6 million for 2020, potentially rising to &euro;13 million for 2021.  That would be a grave situation indeed.  The Government understands that local authority income is down for many different reasons, ranging from parking charges not coming in to other charges and income streams being depleted.  It is a matter that is being worked on by my colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, and the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath.  As the Deputy knows, we waived commercial rates for quarters two and three for most businesses.  There was a commercial rates holiday for most businesses for six months.  Usually, even in a good year, a local authority might only collect 87% or 88% of that money.  We gave them the full 100% anyway, so they got more than they would have from commercial rates in a normal year.  We are examining what we are going to do about quarter four rates.  An announcement about that will be made in the budget next week.  We are aware that additional funding will be required for local authorities to plug deficits that are arising.

What are the implications for our tourism industry, including, for example, our airline industry?  This is outside of Covid.  Will we have to reduce the number of people allowed to come into the country?  We are continuously trying to attract people here.  Will we say that planes will not be able to fly?  Will we have to say to people that they will not be able to burn turf or timber in their fires?  We always said the one thing that people had to do was to keep the home fires burning.  Are the T&aacute;naiste and the Cabinet, and present and future Governments, tying people's hands behind their backs and saying that they cannot do that?  I am not denying that we have issues to deal with with regard to our climate but we have to protect the present and future public from being overburdened with tax.

It is a different issue in towns and cities where we have a problem with air quality and that is impacting on people's health, especially those who have chronic conditions such as asthma and COPD, and therefore action needs to be taken.<\/p>  <p>  Taking climate action is one of the reasons why this Government was formed.  It is why Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party came together, to accelerate Ireland's response to climate change and to up our game when it comes to climate action, to honour the commitment to go from being a laggard to a leader as soon as we can.  The Government has made good progress in that regard.  The July stimulus included a package of investment in everything from bog rewetting and bog restoration to cycling and pedestrian facilities, which will have an impact on the climate in a positive way.  Just yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, published landmark legislation, a climate action Bill, and I congratulate him on that.  It builds on the good work of Deputy Alan Kelly in the Fine Gael-Labour Government with the first climate law.  Now there is a much stronger climate law brought in by Deputy Eamon Ryan.<\/p>  <p>  The carbon tax will go up in the budget.  That is programmed into it.  Bear in mind that most of the cost of the carbon tax will fall on business and the rest on households.

This is so that when people start flying again, it will have a fighting chance.<\/p>  <p>  Cork Airport went from 2.7 million passengers in 2019 to 650,000 passengers this year.  If we are speaking about regionally balanced economic policies, we must ensure Cork has a fighting chance in order that when the airlines that have left Cork decide to come back, they will be able to do it through a sustainable operation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800016#O01200","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1602157200,"counter":155,"content":"<p>It is really important that the aviation industry must survive this pandemic.  I mean our airports, airlines and the related sectors, including aircraft maintenance and repair organisations.  Ten or 12 years ago, during the previous recession, the construction industry collapsed and this was allowed because it was, in part, blamed for the crisis.  We paid a very heavy price for that because two, three or four years later, when we needed a construction sector to build houses and infrastructure, it was not there.  I am determined that will not happen again and that sectors like hospitality and aviation should survive this pandemic.  We are going to need them when the pandemic is over, and it will end.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter that the Government is considering.  EU state aid rules allow airports with fewer than 3 million passengers per year to receive state aid.

Years of neglect, under-investment and lack of political will have led to systemic failures in the mental health system.  Experts described the mental health services to the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response as being out of date and not fit for purpose.  A mental health parity of esteem with physical health approach will provide a holistic, whole-person response to all those who are in need of care and support, with their physical and mental health needs treated equally.  The relationship between physical and mental health is such that poor mental health is linked with a higher risk of physical health problems and poor physical health is linked with poor mental health.<\/p><p>Ensuring access to appropriate treatment for people with mental health needs is a major policy concern.  Mental health care has suffered from systemic neglect and a lack of appropriate services.  The neglect of people with severe and enduring mental illness has negative outcomes for individuals and their families.  The neglect of mental health is across the spectrum at policy, institutional, organisational and individual levels.  The Bill aims to offer hope for better mental health care by ensuring that vulnerable persons with mental illness are cared for efficiently and have parity of esteem with those treated for physical health difficulties.<\/p> <p>Access to counselling can often be a barrier to people obtaining the appropriate mental health supports.  Sinn F&eacute;in in government would introduce universal free counselling on GP referral.<\/p> <p> Our alternative budget also provides an increase in investment in 24-7 crisis intervention services.  If I hurt my head at any hour of the day, I will get the treatment I need.  However, if I have an issue going on inside my head, the chances are I will not receive the appropriate treatment.  These are only two of the changes we would make in mental health provision.  These would go some way to restore the parity of esteem between mental and physical health.<\/p> <p> This legislation aims to compel a change in attitudes towards mental health at the highest level of policymaking and governance.  If this change in attitude occurs at the highest level, it will filter down to all levels of society and will see the stigma often associated with mental health conditions lessened.  We need to break this stigma once and for all.<\/p> <p> The effective integration of mental and physical health services is particularly important.  This Bill will place a duty on the Minister for Health to promote health parity and ensure all organisations within the health system meet parity obligations in respect of mental health.  For example, no additional resources were allocated to mental health supports in the Government's winter plan.  No funding has been set out for this, which shows clearly the lack of parity of esteem between mental and physical healthcare in Ireland.<\/p> <p> This, however, is a Bill of hope.  It will give hope to any person suffering from mental health problems that he or she will be receive the right treatment at the right time.  It is easy to lose hope right now.  When restrictions were brought in first, many people, including myself, thought that these would be short-term measures and that we would be back to normality soon.  The longer the pandemic has gone on, the more messages I have received of pain and desperation from people who see no end to this.  I cannot tell people when this will end but I can tell them that it will end and we will come out the other side.<\/p> <p> People need hope right now.  People need assurances that the increase in mental health issues arising from Covid will be treated in a respectful and appropriate manner.  In the meantime, the most important thing we can do is be kind to each other, and to respect each other.  It is perfectly okay not to be okay right now.  It is normal to feel anxious, frightened, frustrated or worried about things that one has no control of.  Be kind and reach out, if you are not feeling okay.  You are not alone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800018#Q01700","speaker":"1469","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602159000,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800019#R00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1602159000,"counter":194,"content":"<p>It is not opposed.

As of this morning at least, none of us, apart from the members of the committee, has seen the Estimates and we do not know what the considerations are, yet we are being asked to push a Revised Estimate through on the nod.  I take the point that these are additional expenditures for the arts and no one wants to stop additional expenditure.  Some might want to see much more expenditure.  However, there is a problem with the D&aacute;il pushing through significant additional expenditures of public money on the nod without proper discussion and a report on the considerations from the committee.  I do not want to hold up the business of the D&aacute;il but I see that as a problem.  It is important to underline, as was pointed out at the Business Committee today, that the option that Deputies had to attend meetings of committees of which they are not members has now effectively ceased.  In the past, a Member who was not a member of a committee could still attend, listen and speak.  That is no longer an option.

T&aacute; a fhios agam gur chuir an Seanad&oacute;ir Kyne go leor oibre isteach sa Bhille seo agus ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt don obair sin.  Sular dr&eacute;achta&iacute;odh an Bille seo, cuireadh tr&eacute;imhse chomhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in ar bun leis na p&aacute;irtithe leasmhara &eacute;ags&uacute;la.<\/p> <p>Leagadh na ceannteidil faoi bhr&aacute;id Chomhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus na nOile&aacute;n agus foils&iacute;odh tuarasc&aacute;il an chomhchoiste ag eascairt as an bpr&oacute;iseas seo roimh samhradh 2018.  Ba mh&oacute;r an chabair &iacute; tuarasc&aacute;il an chomhchoiste d&rsquo;oifigigh mo Roinne agus an Bille Teanga &aacute; dhr&eacute;acht&uacute; acu agus gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gcomhchoiste as an ionchur luachmhar sin sa bpr&oacute;iseas. <\/p> <p> Mar luaigh m&eacute;, is i m&iacute; na Nollag seo caite a d&rsquo;fhoilsigh an Rialtas Bille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la (Leas&uacute;) 2019.

It has been ten months since it was published and it has been a very peculiar legislative period.  The Minister has brought this forward as soon as feasibly possible and this is appreciated.  The Labour Party will look to bring some amendments to the Bill to strengthen it, but overall it is a move in the right direction and we broadly support it.<\/p>  <p>  I will, however, flag some of the issues here that we will be raising.  An Post should not be able to avoid obligations of section 9 of the current Act with regard to marketing materials made available to the public because their duties under the Official Languages Act 2003 were not made sufficiently clear.  If a public body or a Government Department contacts the public in any way that contact should be made bilingually or in Irish only, and current exceptions should not be allowed.  There should be a requirement for a specific level of advertising to be included in the Bill.  It has been made abundantly clear that during the Covid crisis there was very little, almost zero, Irish or bilingual advertising from the HSE and the Government.  I spent a few days in the Gaeltacht during the summer and the vast majority of HSE signs were in English.  It was very visible. <\/p> <p>Warnings on alcoholic drinks should be bilingual as well, as they are in other bilingual countries.  That could be included in this Bill.<\/p> <p> There is a broader issue involved with the promotion of the Irish language, which this Bill falls under.  I will use this opportunity to speak about what the Minister of State and the Government can do before next week's budget, and then beyond, to promote the Irish language, in particular to young people.  I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with Raidi&oacute; R&iacute;-R&aacute;, which is an Irish-language music station aimed at 12 to 30-year olds.  It broadcasts online and via its app and has studios in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  It is seeking an FM licence.  There is no concern regarding the frequency; it just wants the opportunity to be able to broadcast to the 32 counties.  Raidi&oacute; R&iacute;-R&aacute; is a unique offering.  It is a vibrant radio station operated by young people for young people.  It plays exactly the same music and content as any radio station broadcasting in English, whether that is FM104, Spin 103 in Dublin, or stations anywhere else around the country.  The one defining and distinct selling point of Raidi&oacute; R&iacute;-R&aacute;, however, is that it broadcasts in Irish.  The costs associated with the request are not insignificant but, that said, they are not too high.  I am sure a briefing has been sent to the Minister of State's office on this issue.  This could have benefits for the language, and particularly for promoting it to young people.  Those benefits would be manifest compared with the money required to support it.  <\/p> <p> I am someone who is constantly trying to relearn Irish.  At the moment, I have CDs in my car, which I bought about six months ago to try to bone up on my Irish.  It is not working for me, but I am trying all the time. A station like Raidi&oacute; R&iacute;-R&aacute; would benefit people like me, who went through our education system for 14 years and still does not have the confidence or competence to speak as Gaeilge in our national Parliament.  We need to look at other ways of promoting the language outside the education system.<\/p> <p> We look forward to engaging with the Minister and Minister of State on this Bill as it goes through Committee Stage and into the Seanad.  We welcome this debate and thank the Minister and Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800026#AA00300","speaker":"1564","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602163500,"counter":269,"content":"<p>D'oscail Col&aacute;iste Eoghain U&iacute; Chomhra&iacute;dhe i gCarraig an Chabhaltaigh i gContae an Chl&aacute;ir mar chol&aacute;iste samhraidh don Ghaeilge sa bhliain 1908, ach bh&iacute; ar lucht bainist&iacute;ochta an chol&aacute;iste &eacute; a dh&uacute;nadh dh&aacute; bhliain &oacute; shin mar thoradh ar easpa maoinithe.

T&aacute; s&eacute; mar phlean acu, agus iad ag dul ar aghaidh, an col&aacute;iste a &uacute;s&aacute;id le haghaidh ranganna Gaeilge mar is gn&aacute;ch i rith an tsamhraidh agus mar shu&iacute;omh fiontra&iacute;ochta agus turas&oacute;ireachta i rith na m&iacute;onna eile.

T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go l&aacute;idir go gcabhr&oacute;idh an tAire leis an gcol&aacute;iste seo.<\/p>  <p>  I speak about Col&aacute;iste Eoghain U&iacute; Chomhra&iacute;dhe in Carrigaholt in County Clare.  It was founded as an Irish college by Conradh na Gaeilge way back in 1908, and during its many years of existence it only had to close once.  That was in 1920, when the building was partially burnt by the Black and Tans.  To the immense dismay of local people in west Clare and the Irish language movement across the county, Col&aacute;iste Eoghain U&iacute; Chomhra&iacute;dhe had to close its doors once again in 2018.  This time, it closed due to a lack of funding, which has been the enemy of so many organisations.  <\/p>  <p>  In March this year, Col&aacute;iste Eoghain U&iacute; Chomhra&iacute;dhe applied for rural regeneration and redevelopment funding, but its application was unsuccessful.  It is planned to make a second application for funding next month and I hope the Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht will make the effort possible to support that case.  The plan for the future of the col&aacute;iste is a realistic and sensible one.  Management envisages the col&aacute;iste operating as an Irish college, as normal, in June, July and August.  For the remainder of the year, it would operate as a centre in west Clare to be used interchangeably for enterprise and tourism activities.  It even has the potential to be a three-star hostel providing accommodation in the extremities of west Clare.  <\/p>  <p>  There are, therefore, many new uses for the col&aacute;iste beyond what was initially conceived in 1908.  Funding for the Irish college in Carrigaholt is not just about protecting our native language.  It is also about jobs and the rural economy in west Clare.  I ask that the Minister of State do his very best for Col&aacute;iste Eoghain U&iacute; Chomhra&iacute;dhe. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800027#BB00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1602163500,"counter":270,"content":"<p>D&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire.

It is an issue of which I am conscious, and I have committed to improving my Irish language ability.  It will be a great honour to be able to stand up in this House and address Ministers with more confidence.  I will be doing that in the weeks and months ahead.<\/p>  <p>  I am going to speak about the Bill and comment on some potential issues, topics and concerns that have been raised by members of the Irish language community, with whom I have engaged, and the Social Democrats' WhatsApp group as Gaeilge, which has welcomed me into its forum in recent days.  I also hope to raise various issues when we discuss amendments on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  It is great that 2030 has been set as the target date for increasing to 20% the proportion of recruits who are competent in Irish.  The provision for a review in 2028 and the power being given to the Minister to extend the deadline beyond 2030 will have to be examined and it is likely these provisions will need to be amended.<\/p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>The Minister with direct responsibility should not be able to give him or herself an extension.  It should absolutely be the D&aacute;il or an independent person or body that takes the decision.<\/p> <p> As with the Welsh Language Commissioner and the Ombudsman for Children in Ireland, the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga should examine all proposed legislation relating to the Irish language and any public strategy relating to the promotion of the official language, that is, the 20-year strategy for the Irish language.  Further duties for the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga need to be included in the Bill such as, for example, giving the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga a role in examining Government Bills and policies and in making observations regarding the Irish language and Gaeltacht matters, which may head off any problems arising after the enactment of legislation or Government policy.  This proposed role for the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga reflects a similar duty to that of the Welsh Language Commissioner in Wales.<\/p> <p> All functions delegated by public bodies in contracts to other bodies should automatically come within the ambit of the legislation, including the Dublinbikes scheme, the Go-Ahead bus services etc.  The comparison that was made to me when I spoke to the Irish language community was with Irish Water.  I do not know anybody who refers to it as Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  The idea of having a sole body's name be in the Irish language is important.  Bodies such as An Post should not be able to avoid the obligations of section 9 of the current Act regarding marketing materials made available to the public because their duties under the Official Languages Act 2003 were not sufficiently clear.  If a public body or Department contacts the public in any way, that contact should be made bilingually or in Irish only and current exceptions should not be allowed.<\/p> <p> A requirement for a specific level of advertising should be included in the Bill.  Deputy Duncan Smith has already raised the issue of the Covid restrictions, guidelines and warnings only appearing in the English language.  It is a particular source of annoyance to the Irish language community and is something that we need to address, possibly as a matter of urgency as the pandemic continues.  Anyone working in the Civil Service should have the same right to do their business with the State through Irish.  For example, the promotions process, the staff assessment process, internal correspondence for staff and so on should be made available in Irish for the Civil Service.  Employees should not be prohibited from using Irish in the workplace for no good reason.  This is an example of effective language planning in the wrong direction which needs to be banned if we are to increase the use of Irish in society.  Some issues have been raised with me about people in the hospitality industry who were reprimanded for use of the Irish language when engaging with customers, back when we had a hospitality industry.  That needs to be protected and enhanced, and anybody who engages with the language in their place of work should be protected.<\/p> <p> The commissioner and the public should be given a role relating to the enactment of the legislation, in line with the injunction mechanism under the planning Acts, given the strong public dimension relating to language legislation.  In the event that a public body refuses to comply with any provision of this Bill in accordance with any provision or regulations made pursuant to this Bill, the High Court may, at the request of the commissioner or any other person, whether or not that person has a particular interest in such default or refusal, require any public body, by order, to do anything in accordance with any provision of this legislation or in accordance with any provision in regulations made pursuant to the legislation, which is not, in the opinion of the court, necessary and specified in the order.<\/p> <p> As was already raised, the warning on alcoholic drinks should be given bilingually, as it is in other bilingual countries.  When this issue was raised in the past, it was noted that this may be in contravention to a European directive.  This would not actually be the case.  If one looks at cigarette packaging where the warnings are bilingual, those act as a template of how we could move this forward.<\/p> <p> As it is ensured that women and men are well-represented on State boards, there should certainly also be representation for Irish speakers on such boards.<\/p> <p> Irish should have equal status with English on Ireland's road signs.  This is done in Wales, Scotland and in other countries with more than one official language.  The current T&aacute;naiste, when he was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, supported the recommendation.  No one is talking about changing the signs overnight, only as they need to be renewed or as new ones need to be supplied.  It should be taken into account that research conducted by Conradh na Gaeilge, with a report prepared by the expert, Garrett Reil, shows that the current road signage system is defective and dangerous, especially as drivers get older.  This presents an opportunity to change it and make it bilingual.<\/p> <p> Section 18B, which is inserted to the principal Act by section 6, on the Irish language services advisory committee, advises that only member is to be nominated by the Minister as a representative of a Gaeltacht area, yet the rest will represent Departments.  In my opinion and the opinion of those with whom I have engaged in this regard, this proposal acts as tokenism, even by typical Irish language community expectations, and to have it at the bottom of the list shows the communities that this consideration and planning is as if it is a task that needs to be done for its own sake and not for the benefit of any community or people.  Instead, there should be clear representation from at least three of the main Gaeltacht areas, including Donegal, Galway and Kerry, for example, and at least one of the four urban Gaeltacht and emerging communities.  I specifically refer to Clondalkin, which has done incredible work to promote its Gaeltacht in recent years.<\/p> <p> With regard to Gaeltacht service towns and Irish language networks, this Bill, despite its amendments, is too passive.  It places little or no obligation or incentive on public bodies to improve their capacity for bilingual services unless they happen to be in already vulnerable Gaeltacht zones.  To boost the language, these service towns must be encouraged further to become bilingual for the nearby Gaeltacht communities and local second language communities.<\/p> <p> The proposed new section 19C is a derogation from language standards.  It is open to abuse from bodies which may not wish to engage with any new language standards and seek instead to opt out through whichever excuse they may find.  There is an equal suspicion being shared with regard to the amendment of section 12 of the Juries Act 1976, which removes references to both languages and court summonses.  A question was asked about why that is being done but Deputy Chambers addressed that in his contribution.  I look forward to seeing that be catered for.<\/p> <p> I will leave my contribution there and look forward to engaging with the process as it continues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800027#BB00400","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602164700,"counter":273,"content":"<p>Uaireanta, is iad na ruda&iacute; beaga a chuireann isteach ort mar Ghael - nuair a fhiafra&iacute;onn daoine &ldquo;What is that name in English?&rdquo;, mar shampla.

As I have the opportunity, I wish to raise an issue unrelated to this Bill with the Minister and the Minister of State.  I refer to the lack of a Gaelscoil in the postal districts of Dublin 10 and 12.  I acknowledge that this is a matter for the Department of Education and Skills but support from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht would help progress the achievement of some educational facilities in these very big postal districts which include areas like Ballyfermot, Cherry Orchard, Walkinstown, Drimnagh, Crumlin.  T&aacute; siad gan aon Ghaelscoil &ndash; not a me&aacute;nscoil or a bunscoil in any of those areas.  We managed to get a na&iacute;onra in Ballyfermot with the help of our local councillor Hazel De Nort&uacute;in over the last few years but there is a need for a Gaelscoil in these big working class areas, and there is a very deep desire among parents and young people to learn and become prolific in their own language.  There is a gr&aacute; for it and an absolute need for it.  We will be leaning on the Minister for her support in campaigning for a Gaelscoil in both Dublin 10 and Dublin 12.<\/p>  <p>  Maidir leis an mBille, mar a d&uacute;irt Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la eile, molaim go leagtar amach spriocdh&aacute;ta cinnte le go mbeadh 20% de dhaoine nua a thagann isteach sa St&aacute;tch&oacute;ras in ann a ngn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.

I recently shared a post on social media not because this debate was coming up but, rather, because it struck a chord with me.  The post in question was probably not written with Ireland in mind but it speaks to a hard truth and the responsibility on present and future Irish generations to act.  The post I circulated states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tSpeak your native language to your children or watch it die within the next 20 years!  Looking down on your relatives or friends who speak your native tongue because you speak perfect English is stupid - it is like being proud of borrowed clothes! <\/blockquote>  <p>As we contemplate Brexit and the need for our exporters to look to new market opportunities on the European mainland and beyond, we rarely consider language to be a significant barrier.  We have come to expect that customers in those countries will have a reasonable proficiency in speaking English.  It rarely impacts on our thought processes that English is not their mother tongue but, rather, was taught to them as part of their early school learning.  How is it that so many people from Finland, Germany, Holland and Sweden to name but a few can engage in conversation in English, often flawlessly, despite it being a second language for them?  Many of them also speak a third language with equal ability.  How is it that even though our children begin learning Irish from national school age and on into secondary school, so many pupils graduate without the ability to carry on even an informal conversation in Irish after 14 years of education?  Many students who decide to opt for another language in secondary school, such as French, German or Spanish, leave school with far greater proficiency in that language after five or six years of study than they have in Irish, which they have been taught for 14 years.  As part of new technology sector developments, Irish students are being encouraged to learn Chinese.  It is a sad fact that many of those who do so will develop greater ability to communicate in that language than in their cultural mother tongue.<\/p><p>I accept that the aspiration of the Bill is to increase access for those who wish to engage with public sector services through the medium of Irish.  I acknowledge that implementation of the steps contained in the Bill may be a positive development in improving frequency and some fluency in Irish-language usage in public service communications, but those steps alone will not be enough to secure Gaeilge as a contemporary used language in Ireland into the future.  In our current battle with Covid, there may be consideration of a circuit breaker announcement, that being a deliberate step-change initiated by the Government and designed to completely reset the parameters of dealing with Covid transmission in this country.  If we are serious about preserving this mother tongue, such an action is now required to reset and redefine our national attitude and the value we place on our national language.<\/p><p>As Irish people, we often take pride in the international recognition of our venerated names, our culture and our traditions, yet we often fail to associate that cultural development with the Irish language or acknowledge that it was largely communicated and facilitated through the medium of our Gaelic language.  Our inability to secure Irish as a working requisite language in this country is because of its deliberate downgrading within the outlines of what constitutes national identity and its modern dissociation with brand Ireland.  In the Ireland of 2020, a large proportion of citizens speak English as their mother tongue.  We consider ourselves intrinsically different from the rest of Europe even though many of us cannot carry on a conversation in the language of our forebears.  Such a situation would be laughed at in France, Germany, Finland, Sweden and many other countries I could mention.  Our country requires an Irish language circuit breaker moment.  Although the Bill is welcome, it will not provide such a moment.<\/p><p>To preserve Irish as a working language, we need a new national debate on how we value the language, the way in which it is taught in our schools and how we can integrate it into daily use so as to defend our Gaelic culture and traditions and so that we can message widely that we continue to retain a unique history, perspective and identity.  In truth, to achieve such a goal, the Government might need to announce legislation outlawing and custodial sentences penalising the teaching or speaking of Irish, in light of the fact that throughout our long history it has often been the case that we only value something when there is a threat that others may take it away.<\/p><p>As an interim step in securing the use of our native language, I welcome the Bill.  I see it as a bulwark to the erosion and loss of our ability to converse in our mother tongue.  The Bill provides for an objective of 20% of recruits to the public service being competent in Irish, which I welcome.  It also provides for the introduction of language standards in place of language schemes, a national plan for the provision of Irish language services and the adaption of public bodies' ICT systems to accommodate the representation of a person's name as Gaeilge.  I welcome the proposed establishment of an Irish language services advisory committee to oversee the drafting of a national plan for the provision of public services through Irish, which will set strategies for public bodies to increase the provision of services through Irish and increase the number of staff who are competent in Irish.  However, I question the fact that there is to be only one member nominated by the Minister as a representative of the Gaeltacht area.  That is hardly the level of representation our Irish language speakers need and it does not convey to me the appropriate level of engagement or commitment by the Government to the issue of Irish people being able to communicate effectively as Gaeilge with public institutions and with one another.<\/p><p>As Ireland moves to being a more multicultural society, we must embrace the challenges that brings, but also capitalise on the opportunities. We have a unique and proud history, unparalleled impact on world affairs given our small size and a diaspora that spans the globe and is counted in millions.  Our Irish language is a natural resource unique in the world, a resource that we have cultivated like our landscape.  We must honour and protect it but in order to do so, we must use it.  In using it, we must emphasise that it is the unique characteristic that an Irish person can carry abroad as a beacon of nationality and use at home as an anchor to a proud and cultured tradition.

I am not one of those who has any fluency in our native tongue and I regret that.  Like many others, I am a product of an education system which did not help me to get a grasp of Gaeilge.  I would love to be speaking as Gaeilge and am committed to learning and using the c&uacute;pla focal inside and outside the House.<\/p>  <p>  In my county, there are two small Gaeltacht areas, namely, R&aacute;th Chairn and Baile Ghib.  People were relocated to those areas from the western seaboard between 1935 and 1937, leaving their humble abodes to head to county Meath under a resettlement scheme undertaken by the Irish Land Commission.  Like every other Gaeltacht, the very survival of those areas is threatened because of a lack of investment in local jobs, education and the protections that would have allowed them to thrive and be a beacon of the revival of Gaeilge and living as Gaeilge from cradle to grave.<\/p>  <p>  There is a need for additional funding for Foras na Gaeilge, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, TG4 and Raidi&oacute; R&iacute;-R&aacute;.  I have met those groups and they have asked that they be adequately resourced such that they can properly implement, assist and plan in conjunction with the 80 Irish-language and Gaeltacht groups that currently exist.  Children from disadvantaged areas do not have the option to attend a summer college in the Gaeltacht as the fees are so high.  Will the Minister consider bringing in a scholarship scheme such as that recommended in the investment plan by the 80 Irish-language and Gaeltacht groups in order that such students have the option of attending summer college in the Gaeltacht?<\/p>  <p>  It is good that the Bill is before the House because it is an acknowledgement of the failure of the State to deliver its services bilingually nationwide and as Gaeilge in Gaeltachta&iacute; such as Baile Ghib and R&aacute;th Chairn.  There are wonderful people there who are tireless warriors for their community.  I invite the Minister to visit the area.  The Comharchumann R&aacute;th Chairn would be more than willing to give her a tour if she has not been there previously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800032#GG00200","speaker":"1506"},{"type":"speech","time":1602166500,"counter":282,"content":"<p>The Irish language has been spoken on this island since some time in the first millennium BC.  It was the primary vernacular until the late 18th century but then experienced a collapse in its population of native speakers, particularly in the second half of the 19th century.  Support for the use of the Irish language has consistently been a stated aim of the State since its establishment.<\/p> <p>However, the most recent research makes it clear that on current trends, use of the Irish language as the primary community language, that is, the normal language of discourse in the range of everyday interaction settings in the Gaeltacht, will not continue beyond 2025.  By contrast, there has been a consistent growth in the number of Irish speakers in the State overall.  However, despite this growth, the population of active speakers, daily and weekly speakers outside the education system and outside the Gaeltacht, has not reached what might be regarded as a relatively significant population density, being less than 5% in all but a small number of electoral districts.<\/p> <p> Based on a range of surveys conducted over recent years, support for the Irish language retains broad public support.  It also enjoys significant constitutional protection as the national and first official language, as well as having become a working language in the European Union in 2007.  The United Nations has recognised language rights as a component of human rights.  Finally, evidence of the potential benefits of bilingualism have been growing since the 1960s.  An increasing body of research suggests that bilingual populations may enjoy significant cognitive and health advantages over monolingual ones.<\/p> <p> I welcome the fact that this Bill is finally coming before the D&aacute;il.  It is long overdue.  The Official Languages (Amendment) Bill is an important element of development and sustaining a stronger and more fit-for-purpose language Act.<\/p> <p> Three areas must be delivered as part of this Bill.  The fragile state of Irish in Gaeltacht areas is evident in the census results and in various pieces of research in recent years.  It is, therefore, vital that the provisions of public services through Irish in the Gaeltacht is placed on a statutory footing and that the language rights of the Gaeltacht community should be underpinned by the legislation.  Unfortunately, at this stage, the Bill appears to contain no firm provisions placing a duty upon the State to ensure that the Gaeltacht community is served in its native language.  This is a point which has been highlighted repeatedly by the Irish Language Commissioner.<\/p> <p> I support the recommendation that a national statutory plan for the provision of public services through Irish be prepared and that new recruitment policies and practices should be an integral part of this plan.  However, I am concerned that external experts and the public are not adequately represented on the advisory committee to be established under the amended Act to prepare the implementation plan.  I am also concerned that there is no stated deadline for the publication of the plan and that there is no statutory obligation to implement any agreed plan.<\/p> <p> One of the main provisions of the Bill is the proposal to replace the language schemes system with a system of language standards.  This is a worthwhile proposal, but it is difficult to judge the possible impact of this change without sight of the draft standards.  I believe that the timely production of these draft standards would greatly benefit the process of assessing the Bill.  Can the Minister of State clarify today whether these draft standards have, in fact, been published, as I have been unable to obtain them to date?<\/p> <p> It would be remiss of me not to mention Cape Clear Island, one of the eight islands in my constituency in west Cork.  They have been speaking fluent Irish and promoting the Irish language on the island for many years.  I commend each and every person on Cape Clear who, I suppose, has gone against the trend.  It has been a massive promotion for tourism in the area, with people attending courses and whatever there.  In fairness to the people of Cape Clear, they have made such a Trojan effort to keep the Irish language alive.  It is an eye-opener for the rest of the constituency in Cork South-West and something that I commend greatly.  I commend each and every person on that island for doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800032#GG00300","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602167100,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I too am delighted to get c&uacute;pla n&oacute;im&eacute;ad chun caint faoin strait&eacute;is don Ghaeilge.<\/p>  <p>  I am proud to come from Caisle&aacute;n Nua na Si&uacute;ire i dTiobraid &Aacute;rann Theas agus na D&eacute;ise - an par&oacute;iste ch&eacute;anna.

It caters for after-school and before school and indeed, the bigger children at&aacute; ag dul ar an scoil n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta tar &eacute;is an na&iacute;onra freisin.  I note the way that they can pick up the Irish and their grasp of it, and the fun-loving way that the m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; sa na&iacute;onra sin are running it and the love that they have, above all, for the children, but also for the language, the heritage or d&uacute;chas.  It is tremendous.  There are many na&iacute;onra&iacute; throughout the country.  It is a great way of re-energising our teanga n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta.  It is very important.  We can have all the strategies in the world but if we do not use it, we will lose it.  We have to adopt some kind of a strategy of use it or lose it.<\/p>  <p>  Thosa&iacute;omar col&aacute;iste samhraidh Caisle&aacute;n Nua 20 bliain &oacute; shin freisin and that went very well for 12 years.  It was through the medium of Irish again, and fun.  One would not be sent home from the Gaeltacht.  There were many counts of dalta&iacute;, maybe dalta&iacute; m&oacute;r agus dalta&iacute; d&aacute;na perhaps, sent home from the Gaeltachta&iacute; that we knew of in different parts of the country, such as Corca Dhuibhne.  We did this through the medium of fun and it was very successful.  I salute the late Delia Egan, who was a founder member - bh&iacute; m&eacute; ann freisin - Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Slatara and George de Barra, Catherine McCarra agus daoine mar sin as ucht an obair stairi&uacute;il a rinneadar.

When we had the breac-Ghaeltacht up until 1957, it was an industry as well and it supplemented the incomes of the ordinary people who took in the dalta&iacute; or students.<\/p>  <p>  I salute former Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, ard-sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, agus a bhean ch&eacute;ile.  D&uacute;irt Labhr&aacute;s ar \"The Late Late Show\" o&iacute;che amh&aacute;in gur fhoghlaim s&eacute; a chuid Gaeilge i gCaisle&aacute;n Nua.  He always says that he is proud he learned it in Caisle&aacute;n Nua.<\/p>  <p>  Is m&oacute;r an trua nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge go fl&uacute;irseach agam anois ach t&aacute; m&eacute; chun &eacute; a thos&uacute; ar&iacute;s.<\/p>  <p>  I salute the families who took in the students in those days.  I remember meeting some of them in later years and hearing the fond memories they had.  They stayed in lodgings or \"digs\", and they got a fine country dinner.  Often they went out and gave a hand picking the spuds at this time of year with the farmers.  They got a feeling for the culture, our cluich&iacute; freisin, ar n&oacute;s peile agus iom&aacute;na&iacute;ochta, and, above all, our d&uacute;chas.  They loved that.  That friendship has held up with those people.  T&aacute; siad i Sasana agus a l&aacute;n &aacute;iteanna ar fud an domhain.  That relationship or connectivity is still there.<\/p>  <p>  Now we have a community policing unit in Cathair D&uacute;n Iascaigh anois, in Cahir Garda station, under the guidance of Sergeant Ray Moloney and Superintendent Denis Whelan and the team there.  Not only are they involved in the community and doing a wonderful job at this time of difficulties with Covid, and visiting the people, re-energising in this new level 3 and ready for whatever else might come, but Sergeant Moloney gives comhr&aacute; cois tine in Cahir House Hotel, Tigh &Oacute;st&aacute;n Cathair D&uacute;n Iascaigh, gach o&iacute;che Luain.  There are a number of people there, such as Gavin Berry, an m&uacute;inteoir.  As the people are coming in, they are finding it an tsl&iacute; ceart chun an Gaeilge a fhoghlaim.  It is a nice, soft, simple way of learning and picking up the Irish, transgressing it with English and, indeed, linking it to the logainmneacha.  These placenames are very important.  All those old placenames are oozing with our culture.  They are oozing with our heritage.  Fr. Christy O'Dwyer from Cashel, a renowned hurler for Tipperary fad&oacute;, gave me a valuable masterpiece including all the old seanfhocail as Gaeilge agus as B&eacute;arla.  It is a wonderful historical reservoir and I must learn much more from it.<\/p> <p>However, I thank Fr. Christy and wish him well in his retirement from Cashel.  Christy O'Dwyer was a renowned hurler for Tipperary fad&oacute; fad&oacute;.<\/p> <p> Sergeant Ray Moloney and the team there, and my own in&iacute;on, M&aacute;ir&iacute;n McGrath, get a lot of fun from this engagement every Monday night and they look forward to going back as soon as the cloud that hangs over our communities is gone.  That is the way to do it.  There should be more of that strategy in that area.  N&iacute; neart go cur le daoine.  Na daoine &oacute;ga sa na&iacute;onra.<\/p> <p> People might not realise but the m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; in the national schools have a huge part to play.  There have been many famous m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; thar na blianta and many people learned it from them.  When I went to school, bh&iacute; m&eacute; i mo bhuachaill d&aacute;na i gc&oacute;na&iacute; agus n&iacute;or fhoghlaim m&eacute; m&oacute;r&aacute;n Gaeilge.  Deputy Shanahan mentioned that if Irish was banned we would all be speaking it, I have often said so myself.  We are a wonderful country for resisting rules and regulations.  We must pay more attention to it.  <\/p> <p> While I welcome this strategy, there are a lot of gaps in it.  We have Foras na Gaeilge, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeilge, Conradh na Gaeilge, Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, CCE, agus Gl&oacute;r na nGael freisin.  CCE is a wonderful organisation facilitating song and dance, amhr&aacute;na&iacute;ocht, seanfhocail, rince sean-n&oacute;s and all the wonderful parts of our heritage and culture.  The sessions are often completely through Irish and they are wonderful.  We were involved in our own par&oacute;iste in Gl&oacute;r na nGael competitions and enjoyed some success when we had the Col&aacute;iste Cois Si&uacute;ire ar si&uacute;l.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh Col&aacute;iste Cois Si&uacute;ire ann ar&iacute;s an bhliain seo chugainn, le c&uacute;namh D&eacute;.  T&uacute;s nua ar&iacute;s.  Many people cannot afford the full-on Gaeltacht experience for a month or tr&iacute; seachtaine.  It costs a lot of money.  Our project was simple.  Buses collected people from a 30-mile radius, or beyond.  People came for the day and went home full of fun.  They would be there on their buses picking up their tin whistles and singing sean-n&oacute;s.  They were not ag rince on the bus although some of them were trying.  It was a wonderful way of doing it through fun.  All these organisations are doing hard work but we need more of a meitheal approach, and less of top bodies but a sense of learning up from the s&iacute;olta, &oacute;n talamh suas.  Let us plant the seeds and it will grow.  Then there are the GAA clubs.  Caisle&aacute;n Nua GAA club also helped us, and we used its facilities.  We used the Muintir na T&iacute;re community hall.  I salute them.  They all got an income from that.  It was a very good model for a summer college, col&aacute;iste samhraidh, and people made a few pounds out of it too.  That was not their motive but it was a spin-off.  There were concerts and aifrinn faoin speir.  There was an open air mass on the final night with the buachaill&iacute; and cail&iacute;n&iacute; chol&aacute;iste and there was fierce passion, energy and enthusiasm.  I had the privilege of presenting prizes.  There was much interest in it.  Na daoine &oacute;ga made friends and they are still friends today.  The main age group was ocht mbliana d&rsquo;aois go dt&iacute; 13 bliana.  Then they went on to secondary school and made friends, and some are still friends in university.  Some are in dancing classes and have been to the world championships.  I am not saying they learned it all there but they had wonderful dancing teachers such as Kathy McGrath and Monnie Hallahan in different places around Tipperary.  They developed the skill but they got the love and taste in the scoil samhraidh.  That is vital to like it.  I have often seen the bata scoir in school when the Irish was beaten into people but it did not achieve the desired effect and it never will; it will be resisted.  There should be more groups like Sergeant Moloney's.  It is simple and soft while people have their cup of tea or coffee.  In Newcastle we also had comhr&aacute; cois tine in people's houses, which is especially lovely in the winter months.  I do not know if we can do it this year.  It would be too cold to sing in the wind or le bheith ag caint but we can do our best.  We will look at the strategy and see.  <\/p> <p> Under the legislation, 20% of entrants to the Civil Service are expected to be proficient in Irish.  That idea has been there for a long time but has it happened?  People complain about the huge cost of translating all the European diktats into Irish but we will see.  I was in a lovely hostelry in Bray last night where I am staying where I met a Chinese man who had better English than myself.  He is in Ireland 18 or 20 years.  It is amazing what we can learn when we have to. He is highly proficient in English.  I meet many people from different lands who pick up Irish quite easily.  Some say it is an easier language to learn than their own.  With the multicultural cities and country that we have and that we all embrace, why not have pride in our own Gaeilge?  A nation is not a nation without its language, as P&aacute;draig Pearse said.  If we do not have that what do we have?  I have often known people who have gone abroad, if they get into trouble and are questioned in a police station, they use Irish and they often have to make phone calls home in Irish to see if there is any chance of a c&uacute;pla quid sa phost.  We have cards now and can transfer money but before that it went in the post.  They would be embarrassed but they could speak in their own language.  It is amazing the ingenuity we have to use it when it suits us.  I say: use it or lose it.  That is what we should do under this strategy.<\/p> <p> The strategy mentions of language rights and that the UN has recognised our rights but the UN has recognised lots of rights, and what good is it?  I met people outside the gates here protesting about what is going on in Azerbaijan.  The UN has enough to do without expecting it to support Irish.  Certainly, Irish should be protected and preserved.  We should do it ourselves from the ground up.  <\/p> <p> T&aacute; siad go l&eacute;ir b&aacute;saithe anois, but there were a l&aacute;n daoine in Caisle&aacute;n Nua ag caint tr&iacute; Ghaeilge up to deich mbliana &oacute; shin, such as Mattie O'Leary, Padraig O'Keeffe, Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Donnag&aacute;in, agus mo thuismitheoir&iacute; freisin.  It is amazing that people did not have English as a language at all in my village, Caisle&aacute;n Nua na Si&uacute;ire, up to the late 1950s.  It is a pity we ever lost the breac-Ghaeltacht status.  I will knock on the Minister's door to see if we can look at the model a bh&iacute; ann fad&oacute; and restart it.  We talk about clusters and counties and boundaries now.  Maybe we should start small and try to support a pilot in areas where there is a residue.  We are only 20 m&iacute;le &oacute; Dh&uacute;n Garbh&aacute;n agus 25 m&iacute;le &oacute;n Rinn.  We are all part of the D&eacute;ise and proud of our history and the historic kings in Cashel.  It is a very rich cultural area.  We must do better having more bilingual signage.  I thank the county council in Tipperary and the roads engineer for putting up some lovely artistic signs recently in both languages.  We can learn a lot.  We must try to engage the daoine &oacute;ga i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.  We have the right model with the re-emergence of our Col&aacute;iste Cois Si&uacute;ire.  It is an easier way to learn and it enlivens the spirit and interest of the whole community.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  We need to bring the community with us because we cannot do anything otherwise.  The African saying is that it takes a village to raise a child.  It takes a community to regain and rekindle the spirit of our seantuismitheoir&iacute; and the people going back so that we can remember them proudly, through the medium of Irish, with the heritage they left for us to mind.  <\/p> <p> I look forward to working with the Minister.  She might pay Col&aacute;iste Cois Si&uacute;ire a visit l&aacute; amh&aacute;in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800033#HH00200","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602168300,"counter":286,"content":"<p>T&aacute;im ag iarraidh eitilt ar leath-sciath&aacute;n anois.

My one regret is that I am unable to use our first language.  I envy those who can.  Nonetheless, it does not in any way diminish my firm belief that strong measures need to be taken to facilitate greater use of and familiarity with our language and to guarantee our citizens that they can use the medium of Irish when availing of State services.  For too long, we as a country - I include myself in this - paid a certain amount of lip service to promoting the use of our language.  Legislation guaranteeing citizens a certain level of service through Irish is a positive move.<\/p>  <p>  Among those who have walked the walk and not just paid lip service are the people who have established the more than 250 Gaelscoileanna throughout the country.  Establishing any school is a major undertaking.  The commitment and determination of those who have driven the establishment of our Gaelscoileanna is admirable.  I refer to Aonad Loch Gile, which is in Mercy College, Sligo where I had the privilege of teaching for 20 years.  Aonad Loch Gile was established after I left, although do not take that to mean anything.  It has been a successful undertaking and contributed much to the language's use in an everyday way.  It makes the language accessible to all who want to access it and normalises its use.<\/p>  <p>  An increase number of people either speak the language or want to speak it.  That is why we need a comprehensive policy for the teaching of Irish from preschool to third level and beyond.  The language must form part of our lifelong learning.  People like me who have a basic knowledge of it would then have an opportunity to improve our usage.  Sc&eacute;im na Pobal Gaeilge, which is run by Foras na Gaeilge, is an example of lifelong learning.  It is an Irish-in-the-community scheme that involves community development through the Irish language.  It reaches people whose formal educational opportunities have probably passed and puts the language at the centre of people's everyday lives.  The programme needs extra supports.  We also need to develop Irish language centres.  They normalise the language's use in our everyday activities.<\/p>  <p>  In the above context, the Bill is relevant.  It is about the State providing services to its citizens inside and outside Gaeltachta&iacute; through the medium of Irish.  The Bill will help to underpin many of the voluntary and community actions that have been taken to promote the language.  It will also recognise the rights of Irish speakers in Gaeltachta&iacute; and elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  One of the Bill's most important aspects is the need to include timescales for the proposed actions.  There will be a 20% recruitment target of Irish speakers in the public service and all public offices that provide public services in Gaeltachta&iacute; will operate through the medium of Irish.  The timescale for these measures is 2030.  That must be our target delivery date.  The Minister will appreciate that the date should be fixed at 2030 just as it is fixed for a reduction in CO2 emissions and that we are determined to reach that point.  It should be the date on which all State services from public bodies will be available in Irish to Gaeltacht communities.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we include the s&iacute;neadh fada.  I spent many years working in Brussels.  No self-respecting French speaker would tolerate the idea of the grave, circumflex or any other French accent not being part of French written words.  We must ensure that the same is the case in Ireland.  It is how it should be.  Anything else would simply be inappropriate.<\/p>  <p>  All public forms, be they applications for driver licences, passports, carer's allowance or old age pensions, should be bilingual.<\/p>  <p>  A study conducted by the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga in 2018 illustrated that only 551 out of 21,000 staff working in Departments had sufficient competence in Irish to conduct business through it.  The numbers may have changed slightly since, but even if that is the case, they represented only 3% of departmental staff in 2018.<\/p> <p>That highlights the need for the provisions in this Bill.<\/p> <p> It is proposed that an Irish language statutory advisory committee will be set up to support the work we are discussing.  That work will include the publication of a national plan for an increase in the provision of public services through the medium of Irish.  This plan is hugely important because it will ensure a systemic, planned and co-ordinated approach.  The process must not be open-ended and should include a timeframe for the drafting of the plan.<\/p> <p> The Bill provides for a duty on prescribed public bodies to facilitate the use of a person's name, address or title in the Irish language.  This includes the patronymic and metronymic forms of a person's name, which are of cultural significance, especially in Gaeltacht areas.  The rest of us could learn something from that.<\/p> <p> As I said, official forms are required to be published bilingually or in Irish.  It is also proposed that when renewing or altering logos, public bodies should ensure that text which forms part of the new or altered logo is in the Irish language or in both Irish and English.  The introduction of language standards is essential.<\/p> <p> Once the plan that will be produced by the Irish language statutory advisory committee is in place, it should be subject to a yearly review process in this House.  It is important that we, as politicians, are able to monitor its progress and implementation.  I understand the Minister has proposed to introduce such a review mechanism.<\/p> <p> I look forward to a reversal in the budget next week of some of the cuts in funding to Irish language bodies such as Foras na Gaeilge, Conradh na Gaeilge, Gl&oacute;r na nGael,  Gael Linn and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Those organisations were seen as low-hanging fruit during the most recent crisis and the cuts imposed on them must be reversed.  They have severely impacted job creation efforts in Gaeltacht areas.  We know that if there are no employment opportunities in an area, people will not stay there.  Increased numbers of people are working from home since the start of the Covid crisis.  We do not know whether they will continue to do so or if it will be the case for most of partly working from home and partly in the office.  The latter is the more likely outcome.  Either way, we have a real opportunity to ensure better employment prospects in Gaeltacht areas.  That in itself will have the knock-on effect of promoting the language.<\/p> <p> This Bill is a good start in seeking to address the issues, but the most important requirement is that its provisions are actually implemented.  I know from speaking to several Irish speakers in recent days that the Bill is welcomed by the Irish-speaking community.  However, it must be supplemented by budgetary measures that support the language.<\/p> <p> Before I conclude, it is important to mention the important role of TG4, not just in its promotion of the language but also the fact that much of its content is produced in Gaeltacht communities.  The same applies to Raid&iacute;o R&iacute;-R&aacute;.  It is not just about using the language but also providing an opportunity for participation and involvement by different communities.  It has a hugely powerful effect when people have a sense of the language belonging to them.  The Bill is welcome as an indication that the State will play its part in giving legislative support to Irish speakers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800035#KK00500","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602168900,"counter":292,"content":"<p>T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm nach bhfuil m&eacute; &aacute;balta an Ghaeilge a labhairt i rith an contribution seo.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  We have waited far too long for these proposals to come to the House.  The Bill amends the 2003 Act, which has not been fit for purpose for a long time, and attempts to ensure that the Irish-speaking population can engage with the State through Irish.<\/p>  <p>  It is useful to consider how we got here.  In 2011, the programme for Government set out the intention of the then Government to review the 2003 Act with a view to ensuring that expenditure in this area was best targeted towards the development of the language and that obligations would be imposed appropriately in response to demands from citizens.  In 2014, a public consultation took place on the review of the Act.  It identified a significant demand for services through the medium of the Irish language on a par with services provided through the medium of the English language.  There was an attempt in 2014 to amend the legislation but it did not come to anything.  We recognised then that the existing Act was no good.  More than nine years later, in 2020, we are finally amending that outdated legislation.  As well as taking a long time to get here, it has been a hard battle to do so.  It is welcome that legislative action is being taken at last but it must be implemented with urgency.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the Bill does not go far enough.  I am happy that the Government intends to introduce amendments, but we have not had sight of them.  Based on what the Minister said, they still do not go far enough because they do not reflect the emergency that exists in Gaeltacht areas.  Once again, the Government is not listening to the people who are directly affected by the legislation in question.  The Government has not even listened to the Comhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus na nOile&aacute;n.  The members of that committee, during the previous D&aacute;il, travelled around the country to every Gaeltacht area and listened to the people living there, who have a deep understanding of the emergency facing their population.  The committee also heard from the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga and all interested stakeholders.  On foot of these consultations, it published a unanimous cross-party report in May 2018 that contained 20 practical recommendations.  In the report, the Chairman of the committee expressed concerns in regard to the lack of recognition of the emergency in the Gaeltacht and among the Irish-speaking community.  That concern is not addressed at all in the Bill and it is clear that the Government did not take account of what the committee had to say.  People in Gaeltacht areas relayed to the committee that, unless supported, the Irish-speaking population will be wiped out.  We know that the numbers of native Irish speakers are at a critical level.  We must start with the recognition that there is an emergency.  There should be a strong statement in the Bill that we are in an emergency, just as the climate change and biodiversity emergency is acknowledged in the climate change legislation.  An urgent action plan to address this emergency is needed.<\/p>  <p>  Native Irish speakers or people who choose to speak Irish cannot engage or interact with the State in Irish, notwithstanding the recognition in the Constitution that Irish is our first official language.  The provision in the Bill of a requirement that, by 2030, 20% of public service employees must be bilingual is to be welcomed as partly addressing that issue.  However, it is a cause for alarm that the provision also states that whichever Minister is in charge in 2030 may extend the timeframe for meeting that target.  The deadline of 2030 is already too far out but the Minister of the day is to be given the option to push it out further.  It seems this Government is going to act on climate change but not on the Irish language emergency.  The reality is that people cannot access services through Irish, whether online, by telephone or in person.  This was laid bare in the summer during the public consultation process on the mess that is the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020.  In that case, legislative proposals that will have an impact on great swathes of the Irish-speaking population were not available through Irish.<\/p>  <p>  Another section of the Bill that needs to be addressed is that dealing with the powers of the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  As it stands, he or she is permitted to act only within the confines of the Official Languages Act.  The powers of the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga must be extended beyond that Act to enable him or her to examine other legislation.  It is vitally important in this day and age that the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga would be able to examine other legislation enacted by the Oireachtas to see whether it is benefiting the Irish language.  After all, Irish is the official language of the State.  One would not see a similar situation in any other country.  Similar to the way in which we poverty-proof and gender-proof legislation, the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga must have the power to ensure legislation recognises the Irish language emergency that exists and either helps to address it or at least does no further harm.  That is the least that is required.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the introduction of this Bill but the reality is that it simply does not go far enough.  I look forward to further discussions on Committee Stage when we will put forward amendments to make the Bill work effectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800036#LL00200","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602168900,"counter":293,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1602169500,"counter":294,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800037#MM00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1602169500,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Jennifer Whitmore - to discuss the funding deficit in local authorities; (2) Deputy Fergus O'Dowd - to discuss the delayed appointment of staff in Drogheda town to work on the national development plan; (3)   Deputy Dessie Ellis - to discuss the concerns raised by employees of Aer Lingus to access social welfare supports; (4) Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan - to discuss the provision of high speed broadband throughout North Cork; (5) Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith - to discuss the impact of Covid-19 on staffing levels in St Catherine&rsquo;s National school, Donore Avenue; (6) Deputy Niamh Smyth - to discuss the review of the midwifery led unit in Cavan General Hospital; (7) Deputy Patrick Costello - to discuss the implementation of the national Traveller health action plan and the targeted resources to address the mental health crisis in the Traveller community; (8)   Deputy Carol Nolan - to discuss the need for reforms to the Fair Deal scheme; (9) Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n - to discuss the status of the implementation of the Scally and MacCraith reports on CervicalCheck; (10) Deputy Martin Browne - to discuss planning issues and the proposed development of the Shannon pipeline; (11) Deputy Ruair&iacute; &Oacute; Murch&uacute; - to discuss access to public liability insurance for the leisure and community sector; (12)   Deputy Matt Carthy - to discuss the European Commission's REACH Committee's recent adopt of a regulation on the use of lead gunshot; (13) Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire - to discuss the delay in teachers being paid in recent weeks; and (14) Deputy John Lahart - to discuss the closure of Sancta Maria College, Rathfarnham due to no heating.<\/p>  <p>  The matters raised by Deputies Deputy Matt Carthy, Jennifer Whitmore, Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire and John Lahart have been selected for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800037#MM00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Bille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la (Leas&uacute;), 2019: An Dara C&eacute;im (At&oacute;g&aacute;il) - Official Languages (Amendment) Bill 2019: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1602169500,"counter":297,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800037#MM00300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602169500,"counter":298,"content":"<p>Question again put: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1602169500,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh leis an Aire agus leis an Aire St&aacute;it.

Bh&iacute; caint ag an Roinn go leagadh muid s&iacute;os na heagra&iacute;ochta a raibh dualgas n&iacute;os m&oacute; orthu i ngach plean n&iacute;os m&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.  Chomh maith leis sin, mar shampla, tugadh isteach na hionstraim&iacute; reacht&uacute;la maidir le comhartha&iacute;ocht.  Bh&iacute;omar ag r&eacute;iteach ionstraim reacht&uacute;la maidir le f&oacute;gra&iacute;ocht.  An t-aon cheist a bh&iacute; &aacute; phl&eacute; ag an am n&aacute; an &eacute; go mbeadh rogha ag an bhf&oacute;gr&oacute;ir St&aacute;it, mar shampla, f&oacute;gra a chur in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>agus ceann eile a chur i bp&aacute;ip&eacute;ar Gaeilge comhionann leis chun na rialacha a chomhl&iacute;onadh n&oacute; d&aacute; mbeadh f&oacute;gra i mB&eacute;arla an leor ceann i nGaeilge a chur ar TG4.  Bh&iacute; bunt&aacute;iste leis an cur chuige sin, mar chuireadh s&eacute; airgead breise f&oacute;gra&iacute;ochta i dtreo na foilsitheoir&iacute; agus lucht craolach&aacute;in na Gaeilge.  Beidh s&eacute; sin le pl&eacute; againn ar&iacute;s nuair a bheidh an Bille ag dul tr&iacute;d na D&aacute;la.<\/p><p>N&iacute;l aon amhras faoi, n&iacute; h&eacute; gur theip ar an Acht ach n&iacute;or cuireadh i bhfeidhm &eacute;.  Le naoi mbliana, bh&iacute; Rialtais ann nach raibh an oiread sin sp&eacute;is acu sa rud n&oacute; sa cheist.<\/p><p>Ba mhaith liom b&eacute;im a chur ar rud.  T&aacute; an-chaint anseo ar an nGaeltacht inniu, agus t&aacute; t&aacute;bhacht leis an nGaeltacht.  N&iacute; aon amhras faoi sin agus t&aacute; m&eacute; f&eacute;in i mo ch&oacute;na&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht c&eacute; gur rugadh agus t&oacute;gadh m&eacute; i gCathair Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath.  Fuair m&eacute; mo chuid oideachas ar fad tr&iacute; Bh&eacute;arla.  Ach n&iacute; mhairfidh an Ghaeltacht muna bhfuil an Ghaeilge l&aacute;idir ar fud na t&iacute;re.  N&iacute;l aon dream n&iacute;os fearr a thuigeann &eacute; sin n&aacute; lucht na Gaeltachta.  N&iacute; reservation, mar a deir siad i Meirce&aacute;, at&aacute; ann.  Is gn&aacute;th &Eacute;ireannaigh iad.  Tagann go leor de phobal na Gaeltachta chun c&oacute;na&iacute; sna chathracha.  Mar sin, agus muid ag freastal ar phobal na Gaeilge, caithfimid &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh chuile &aacute;it a bhfuil &eacute;ileamh ann.  Ceann de na ruda&iacute; is sp&eacute;isi&uacute;la n&aacute; an staid&eacute;ar s&iacute;ceola&iacute;ochta a rinne an tAthair M&iacute;che&aacute;l Mac Gr&eacute;il.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; in ann a chruth&uacute; gurb &eacute; an cheantair is m&oacute; agus an pobal is m&oacute; b&aacute; leis an nGaeilge n&aacute; an pobal me&aacute;naicmeach i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath.  Le gairid, mar shampla, nuair a bhuaigh Cuala craobh iom&aacute;na Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath, n&iacute; don ch&eacute;ad uair, is i nGaeilge a labhair an captaen agus Gaeilge bre&aacute; den scoth aige.  N&iacute; haon eisceacht &eacute; i measc clubanna Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath agus imreoir&iacute; sinsearacha Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath.  Mar sin, caithfimid a thuiscint go gcaithfimid seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; leithne a chur ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.<\/p><p>Rud amh&aacute;in a gcaithfimid a fhoghlaim maidir le reachta&iacute;ocht n&aacute; n&iacute; athra&iacute;onn reachta&iacute;ocht an saol.  Is gl&eacute;as &iacute; leis an saol a athr&uacute; ach inti f&eacute;in, n&iacute; athra&iacute;onn s&iacute; an saol.  Caithfear obair dian a dh&eacute;anamh plean cuimsitheach a bheith ann le spriocanna na reachta&iacute;ochta a bhaint amach.<\/p><p>Briseadh s&eacute; do chro&iacute; an cur in aghaidh a bh&iacute; ag codanna den ch&oacute;ras St&aacute;it sa t&iacute;r don Acht teanga deireadh.

Sh&iacute;lfe&aacute; go raibh s&eacute; sin thar a bheith simpl&iacute;.  Chuir me tweet amach tamaill&iacute;n &oacute; shin de chomhartha a d&uacute;irt: &ldquo;FOOTPATH ENDS IN 40M&rdquo; agus scr&iacute;ofa os a cionn i nGaeilge bh&iacute; &ldquo;As Gaeilge 40m&rdquo;.  T&aacute; a fhios ag chuile dhuine sa Ghaeltacht agus chuile dhuine a thriail riamh ar glaoch ar Chomhairle Contae an Gaillimhe n&oacute; ar aon cheann eile de na heagrais, agus teachtaireacht ar an bhf&oacute;n &aacute; r&aacute; &ldquo;M&aacute; t&aacute; t&uacute; ag iarraidh seirbh&iacute;s a fh&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge br&uacute; uimh. 1 n&oacute; tr&iacute; Bh&eacute;arla br&uacute; uimh. 2&rdquo;.  Nuair a bhr&uacute;tar ar uimh. 1, deirtear nach bhfuil duine le Gaeilge ann faoi l&aacute;thair ach teachtaireacht a fh&aacute;gaint agus go dtiocfaidh duine ar ais chugat am &eacute;icint, uair &eacute;icint, l&aacute; &eacute;icint.  An ch&eacute;ad uair eile, br&uacute;nn an duine ar uimh. 2 agus faightear an tseirbh&iacute;s tr&iacute; Bh&eacute;arla.  N&iacute; hionann &eacute; sin agus seirbh&iacute;s.<\/p><p>Chonaic m&eacute; cheann bre&aacute; le gairid.  Cuireadh foirmeacha ar fud na Gaeltachta chuig feirmeoir&iacute;.

Beidh daoine ag r&aacute; nach bhfuil a dh&oacute;thain ansin, nach bhfuil s&eacute; s&aacute;ch sciobtha agus mar sin de, ach s&iacute; f&iacute;rinne an tsaoil n&aacute; go gcaithfidh muid go leor oibre a chur isteach &oacute;n l&aacute; am&aacute;rach amach ag cinnti&uacute; go mbeidh na daoine ann le hearc&uacute;.  Caithfidh an c&oacute;ras oideachais, an c&oacute;ras ollscola&iacute;ochta agus an c&oacute;ras tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;il a bheith faoi r&eacute;ir agus caithfear infheist&iacute;ocht ollmh&oacute;r a dh&eacute;anamh le go mbeidh daoine inni&uacute;il ar an nGaeilge ann le cur isteach ar na poist seo.  Is f&eacute;idir an sprioc sin a scr&iacute;obh san Acht ach n&iacute; tharl&oacute;idh s&eacute; agus d&eacute;arfaidh an tAire faoi cheann ocht mbliana nach bhfuil na daoine ann.  Mar sin, n&iacute; leor an tAcht.  Caithfidh an gn&iacute;omh a theacht leis an Acht.<\/p> <p> Ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla eile a luaigh.  Is maith liom an leagan amach at&aacute; sa Bhille seo agus t&aacute; go leor ruda&iacute; fi&uacute;ntacha ann.  Leagtar bunchearta s&iacute;os san Acht agus cuirtear leo.  Cheana f&eacute;in t&aacute; buncheart ann maidir le comhfhreagras ach anois beidh rialacha ann agus beidh na bunchearta ar n&oacute;s comhfhreagras san Acht f&eacute;in.  Beidh rialach&aacute;in, fo-orduithe agus pleananna ann freisin.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go bhf&aacute;gfar na pleananna ann.  N&iacute; fheicim c&uacute;is ar bith iad a bhaint as mar feicim r&oacute;l d&oacute;ibh.  Pl&eacute;ifidh m&eacute; an cheist sin tuilleadh leis an Aire agus an Aire St&aacute;it ar Ch&eacute;im an Choiste.  Is maith liom go mbeifear in ann fo-ord&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar ruda&iacute;.  Is cumhacht thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; sin.  Is cumhacht nua &eacute;, a fhorbra&iacute;onn go maith an rud at&aacute; ann agus taca&iacute;m leis sin.<\/p> <p> T&aacute; for&aacute;il sa Bhille a deir gur f&eacute;idir le duine a ainm agus a sheoladh a &uacute;s&aacute;id i nGaeilge.  T&aacute; s&eacute; thar ama go mbeadh an ceart sin ag daoine.  N&iacute;l aon rud n&iacute;os seaf&oacute;id&iacute; n&aacute; ag scr&iacute;obh d&rsquo;ainm i mB&eacute;arla.  Rinne mise c&uacute;pla uair &eacute; ar shu&iacute;omh Aer Lingus.

Ansin is g&aacute; tos&uacute; ar&iacute;s agus d&rsquo;ainm a chur isteach gan na s&iacute;nt&iacute; fada.  Is maith an rud &eacute; go bhfuiltear ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar seo.<\/p> <p> T&aacute; caint ann freisin faoi theidil.  Cuireann s&eacute; m&uacute;is&iacute;n orm go pearsanta nuair a fhaighim foirm agus deir s&eacute; Mr., Mrs. n&oacute; Miss.  T&aacute;im tar &eacute;is staid&eacute;ar a dh&eacute;anamh ar mo theastas breithe agus n&iacute;l aon Mr., Mrs n&oacute; Miss air.  An t-ainm at&aacute; ormsa n&aacute; &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v agus c&eacute; go bhfuil teideal orm mar Theachta sa Teach seo n&iacute;or bhronn aon duine aon teideal orm.  Is rud m&iacute;n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha sa Ghaeilge &eacute;.  N&iacute; th&eacute;ann muintir na Gaeltachta thart ag r&aacute; &ldquo;an tUasal seo&rdquo; agus &ldquo;an tUasal si&uacute;d&rdquo; mura bhfuil siad ag scigmhagadh faoi dhuine.  Nach &eacute; &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v at&aacute; orm agus nach Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh at&aacute; ar an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh?  Is rud &oacute; na Gaill &eacute; sin a th&aacute;inig isteach, le daoine ag ceapadh go raibh siad t&aacute;bhachtach agus ag cur teidil orthu f&eacute;in.  Ba cheart go mbeadh an rogha ag an bpobal nuair at&aacute; siad ag l&iacute;onadh isteach foirmeacha agus an ceart dl&iacute;thi&uacute;il a bheith acu gan teideal a &uacute;s&aacute;id.

Ansin, ar an bhfoirm, cuireann s&iacute; &ldquo;Mrs. &Aacute;ine U&iacute; Chu&iacute;v&rdquo; agus t&aacute; an rud r&aacute;ite faoi dh&oacute;.  Is seaf&oacute;id &eacute;.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam nuair a thagann muid ag an mBille seo, go mbeidh s&eacute; de cheart reacht&uacute;il ag daoine gan teideal a chur s&iacute;os ar aon fhoirm mura bhfuil teideal acu.  N&iacute;l a fhios agam c&eacute;n f&aacute;th go bhfuil teidil ann, dubh, b&aacute;n n&oacute; riabhach.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir gur rud Eorpach &eacute; n&oacute; rud &eacute;igin ach n&iacute; rud &Eacute;ireannach &eacute;.  T&aacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; seans go dtabharfa&iacute; Micil Thomas Sh&eacute;amuis ort sa Ghaeltacht n&aacute; go dtabharfaid&iacute;s teideal ort.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go nd&eacute;arfaidh daoine gur rud beag &eacute; ach breathna&iacute;onn s&eacute; seaf&oacute;ideach m&aacute; chuireann duine a n-ainm s&iacute;os i nGaeilge.  Maidir leis an rud a th&aacute;inig isteach de dhaoine ag &uacute;s&aacute;id &ldquo;an tUasal &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rdquo;, is muintir Chonradh na Gaeilge a chumadh &eacute; sin ag t&uacute;s an ch&eacute;ad, ag d&eacute;anamh aithris ar n&oacute;sanna na nGall.  N&iacute;l aon chiall leis ar chor ar bith.<\/p> <p> T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil an Rialtas ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar cheist Coimisi&uacute;n na Logainmneacha.  N&iacute; raibh m&eacute; riamh in ann a thuiscint c&eacute;n f&aacute;th gur cuireadh deireadh le Coimisi&uacute;n na Logainmneacha nuair nach raibh aon s&aacute;bh&aacute;il ann agus n&iacute; raibh an choimisi&uacute;in ag f&aacute;il aon &iacute;oca&iacute;ocht.  Bh&iacute; daoine le saineolas den scoth ag cur comhairle ar f&aacute;il don St&aacute;t saor in aisce.  D&rsquo;oibrigh s&eacute; go hiontach thar na blianta.  T&aacute; a fhios agam ar a laghad go bhfuiltear ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar an laincis dl&iacute; a cotha&iacute;odh ar mhaithe le dada.<\/p> <p> Luaigh m&eacute; na beala&iacute; at&aacute; ag lucht riarach&aacute;in clo&iacute; leis an dl&iacute; ach gan &eacute; a chomhl&iacute;onadh.  Ceann de na sampla&iacute; is fearr n&aacute; plean&aacute;il sa Ghaeltacht.  San Acht Plean&aacute;la, caithfear suntas a thabhairt do ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; teanga le linn plean&aacute;la sa Ghaeltacht.  Mura nd&eacute;antar &eacute; sin, b&aacute;far na Gaeltachta&iacute;, go m&oacute;r m&oacute;r iad si&uacute;d at&aacute; gar do chathracha m&oacute;ra, ar n&oacute;s na Forbacha, an Spid&eacute;al agus Indreabh&aacute;n, le sc&eacute;imeanna tith&iacute;ochta.  T&aacute; an-dochar d&eacute;anta i mBearna agus Maigh Cuilinn.  T&aacute; cleas ag na comhairl&iacute; contae.  T&aacute; an rud c&eacute;anna ar bun i gContae na M&iacute;.  Bhreathnaigh mise ar chead plean&aacute;la a tugadh i R&aacute;th Chairn agus ar ph&aacute;ip&eacute;ar breathna&iacute;onn s&eacute; thar cionn, le 80% de na tithe coinnithe do Ghaeilgeoir&iacute;.  M&aacute; &eacute;ir&iacute;onn leo 80% Gaeilgeoir&iacute; a chur isteach ann beidh s&eacute; thar cionn, le daoine ag labhairt na Gaeilge gach chuile l&aacute;.  T&aacute; a fhios ag chuile dhuine sa Ghaeltacht go n-&eacute;ireoidh le duine i dteist na Gaeilge sna comhairl&iacute; contae m&aacute; t&aacute; an tr&iacute; fhocal Gaeilge f&eacute;in aige n&oacute; aici.  N&iacute;l ann ach mugadh magadh.  Ar an mbealach sin, t&aacute; an Ghaeltacht &aacute; scrios ag comhairl&iacute; contae agus na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is phlean&aacute;la ar fud na t&iacute;re.  Caithfimid d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar an gceist seo agus cinnti&uacute; sa Bhille seo n&oacute; i mBille &oacute;n Aire Tith&iacute;ochta, Rialtais &Aacute;iti&uacute;il agus Oidhreachta.  M&aacute; t&aacute; coinn&iacute;oll Gaeilge ag baint le cead plean&aacute;la, caithfidh daoine at&aacute; ag cur isteach ar chead plean&aacute;la n&oacute; ag comhl&iacute;onadh an coinn&iacute;oll, in east&aacute;t tith&iacute;ochta mar shampla, caighde&aacute;n Gaeilge neamhsple&aacute;ch a bheith cruite acu, at&aacute; s&aacute;ch ard go bhf&eacute;adfaid&iacute;s a ngn&oacute; laeth&uacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.<\/p> <p> Is &iacute; an Ghaeltacht at&aacute;imid ag iarraidh a choth&uacute; agus bh&iacute; go leor cainte anseo inniu faoin Ghaeltacht, taca&iacute;ocht don Ghaeltacht agus &eacute; seo agus &iacute; si&uacute;d a dh&eacute;anamh don Ghaeltacht.  T&aacute; an Ghaeltacht bheag agus leochaileach.  Caithfimid an rud is bun&uacute;sa&iacute; a chosaint, s&eacute; sin, gan an pobal a bh&aacute;igh, mar a tharlaigh i R&aacute;th Chairn, an Spid&eacute;al agus mar sin de.  N&iacute;l an oiread sin br&uacute; sa bhealach seo ar na Gaeltachta&iacute; at&aacute; i bhfad amach, ach mura gcosn&oacute;imid iad &oacute; bheith b&aacute;ite le slua m&oacute;r daoine gan Gaeilge ar bith ag teacht isteach, agus iad in ainm is a bheith ag clo&iacute; le riail plean&aacute;la, beidh deireadh len&aacute;r n-iarrachta&iacute; ar fad an Ghaeltacht a chosaint agus beifear ag caoineadh faoi c&eacute;ard a tharlaigh don Ghaeltacht.<\/p> <p> T&aacute; br&uacute; ar an nGaeltacht ach ar bheala&iacute; eile, n&iacute; raibh st&aacute;das n&oacute; c&eacute;im n&iacute;os airde riamh ag an teanga i measc an phobail. <\/p> <p>M&aacute; bhreathna&iacute;mid siar 120 bliain, b'iad an mionlach a bh&iacute; ag tac&uacute; leis an nGaeilge ach t&aacute; go leor le d&eacute;anamh agus n&iacute; cheart misneach a chailleadh.  Caithfimid &iacute; a fheice&aacute;il mar theanga n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta, n&iacute; teanga pobal amh&aacute;in tar &eacute;is comh t&aacute;bhachtach agus at&aacute; an Ghaeltacht.  Is mar thobar na Gaeilge at&aacute; s&iacute; t&aacute;bhachtach.  Chomh maith leis sin, is d&iacute;ol suntais gur fh&aacute;s l&iacute;on na gcainteoir&iacute; laeth&uacute;la Gaeilge taobh amuigh agus taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht idir an bhliain 2006 agus 2011.  Ba i ndiaidh 2011, nuair a d'athraigh polasa&iacute; an Rialtais, a thit s&eacute; ar&iacute;s.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam faoin Rialtas seo go bhfeicfimid f&aacute;s uair amh&aacute;in eile ar l&iacute;on na gcainteoir&iacute; laeth&uacute;la Gaeilge taobh istigh agus taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.<\/p> <p> Fuair m&eacute; f&iacute;se&aacute;n de bheirt gas&uacute;ir at&aacute; s&eacute; bliain as an Astr&aacute;il inniu.  Dr&aacute;ma beag a bh&iacute; ann a bh&iacute; curtha ar f&aacute;il do thuismitheoir&iacute; i nGaeilge.

T&aacute; a fhios agam, &oacute; thaobh Sinn F&eacute;in de, nach sin an dearcadh a bh&iacute; againne.  &Oacute;n ch&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, bh&iacute; muid ag iarraidh i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; cearta agus n&iacute;os m&oacute; iarracht a bheith ann sa Bhille oifigi&uacute;il.  Bh&iacute; an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh ag pl&eacute; na ceisteanna sin go luath agus ag r&aacute; go gcaithfear an Bille seo a l&aacute;idri&uacute;.<\/p>  <p>  T&aacute;imid ag fanacht i bhfad r&oacute;-fhada leis an Bhille seo.  Is deas an rud &eacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; againn ach l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn an moill sin an easpa t&aacute;bhachta a bh&iacute; ag baint leis an Bhille seo &oacute; thaobh leibh&eacute;al Rialtas de le tamall maith anuas.  T&aacute; s&eacute; luaite &oacute; a bh&iacute; 2011 ann go raibh leasuithe de dh&iacute;th.  T&aacute; s&eacute; tr&iacute; bliana anois &oacute; a bh&iacute; na ceannteidil againn.  N&iacute;l a fhios agam an bhfuil Bille ar bith eile thart ar an D&aacute;il a bhfuil muid ag fanacht an oiread ama sin f&aacute;choinne.  T&aacute; s&eacute; againn agus is &eacute; sin an jab at&aacute; againn n&aacute; an Bille chomh l&aacute;idir agus is f&eacute;idir a bheith againn.<\/p>  <p>  Mar duine a t&oacute;gadh agus at&aacute; i mo ch&oacute;na&iacute; i nGaoth Dobhair, tuigim an t&aacute;bhacht at&aacute; ag baint le taca&iacute;ocht reacht&uacute;il a bheith ansin &oacute; thaobh cearta na Gaeilge a l&aacute;idri&uacute; agus an teanga labhartha a neart&uacute;.  T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach go bhfuil cinneadh le d&eacute;anamh ag achan duine agus ag an phobal an Ghaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id.  T&aacute; cinneadh le d&eacute;anamh fosta ag leibh&eacute;al reacht&uacute;il &oacute; thaobh na taca&iacute;ochta&iacute; agus na cosaint&iacute; a chur i bhfeidhm &oacute; thaobh na teanga de.  Sin an obair a t&aacute;imid i mbun inniu.<\/p>  <p>  Tuigimid uilig na deacrachta&iacute; at&aacute; sa Ghaeltacht.  T&aacute; an easpa infheist&iacute;ochta, an imirce agus an laghd&uacute; at&aacute; tagtha ar deiseanna i gceantair Ghaeltachta le blianta anuas pl&eacute;ite anseo ar&iacute;s inniu agus le blianta fada.  T&aacute; m&eacute; f&eacute;in ag d&eacute;anamh r&eacute;idh don ch&aacute;inaisn&eacute;is D&eacute; M&aacute;irt agus t&aacute; a fhios againn go bhfuil pac&aacute;iste de &euro;12 billi&uacute;n le caitheamh ag an Rialtas.  Sin &euro;12 billi&uacute;n sa bhreis le caitheamh ag an Rialtas.  Sin an pac&aacute;iste at&aacute; s&eacute; ag caint air f&aacute;choinne 2021.  Sin &euro;12 billi&uacute;n agus beidh le feice&aacute;il c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad milli&uacute;n de sin a rachaidh isteach &oacute; thaobh an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht de.  M&aacute; t&aacute;imid d&aacute;ir&iacute;re &oacute; thaobh achan rud at&aacute; le cloiste&aacute;il againn sa Teach seo agus m&aacute; t&aacute;imid ag iarraidh go mbeidh an Ghaeilge mar theanga n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta a labhra&iacute;tear n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in sa Ghaeltacht ach taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, caithfidh muid an infheist&iacute;ocht a dh&eacute;anamh fosta.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ceart agus c&oacute;ir go bhfuil cosaint&iacute; reacht&uacute;la agus spriocanna agus a leith&eacute;id ann ach caithfear an infheist&iacute;ocht a dh&eacute;anamh i gceantair Ghaeltachta agus sa Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; Conradh na Gaeilge ag tarraingt le ch&eacute;ile na gr&uacute;pa&iacute; Gaeltachta agus Gaeilge ar fud na t&iacute;re le blianta fada anuas agus t&aacute; s&eacute; ag d&eacute;anamh &eacute;ileamh ar an Rialtas bliain i ndiaidh bliana &oacute; thaobh an infheist&iacute;ocht at&aacute; de dh&iacute;th.  Ar an drochuair, nuair a thagann an c&aacute;inaisn&eacute;is, n&iacute; fheicimid an infheist&iacute;ocht sin.  Le cuidi&uacute; D&eacute;, b'fh&eacute;idir gur seo an bhliain inar f&eacute;idir linn sin a dh&eacute;anamh.<\/p>  <p>  T&aacute; deacrachta&iacute; faoi leith &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta de agus t&aacute;imid ag feice&aacute;il sin.  T&aacute; staid&eacute;ar i ndiaidh staid&eacute;ar foilsithe agus l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn siad c&eacute; chomh dona agus c&eacute; chomh deacair agus at&aacute; na fadhbanna.  T&aacute; d&oacute;chas agam agus ag Sinn F&eacute;in nach bhfuil deireadh tagtha le saol na Gaeltachta agus go bhfuil athbheochan agus r&eacute; &uacute;r i nd&aacute;n don Ghaeltacht.  Caithfear an r&eacute; &uacute;r seo an taca&iacute;ocht ceart a bheith aici &oacute;n St&aacute;t.  Caithfear cusp&oacute;ir&iacute; soil&eacute;ire a bheith leagtha amach sa reachta&iacute;ocht seo.  Caithfear plean dearfach a bheith curtha i gcr&iacute;ch leis na cusp&oacute;ir&iacute; sin a bhaint amach.  Sin an pr&iacute;omhrud.  Caithfear plean a bheith ann fosta agus caithfear an plean sin a chur i gcr&iacute;ch.<\/p>  <p>  C&iacute;m i mo cheantar go bhfuil teaghlaigh ag bogadh ar ais, giota ar ghiota isteach san &aacute;it ar&iacute;s.  T&aacute; siad ag iarraidh a gclanna a th&oacute;g&aacute;il le Gaeilge ach n&iacute; bh&iacute;onn na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; St&aacute;it &aacute;balta tac&uacute; leo chomh maith agus go mba ch&oacute;ir d&oacute;ibh.  N&iacute;l sin maith go leor agus caithfimid aghaidh a thabhairt ar an fhadhb sin.  Chonaic m&eacute; i mbliana go raibh turas&oacute;ir&iacute; ag teacht chuig Ghaeltacht Th&iacute;r Chonaill, chuig na D&uacute;naibh agus chuig cheantair ar n&oacute;s Gleann Cholm Cille agus a leith&eacute;id.  Caithfidh an St&aacute;t maoini&uacute; agus pleananna cinnte a chur i bhfeidhm le h&uacute;s&aacute;id na teanga a chur chun cinn sna ceantair sin.  Bh&iacute; na turas&oacute;ir&iacute; seo ag teacht ar mhaithe leis an Ghaeilge agus ar mhaithe leis an chult&uacute;r, chomh maith leis an &aacute;illeacht at&aacute; againn sa cheantar sin.  Mar shampla, caid&eacute; an plean at&aacute; ann chun d&eacute;anamh cinnte de go bhfuil na heagrais phobail sna Gaeltachta&iacute; uilig ag cumars&aacute;id agus ag obair le ch&eacute;ile?  Sin ceann de na ruda&iacute; go gcaithfimid aghaidh a thabhairt air.  Caid&eacute; an plean at&aacute; ann &oacute; thaobh sin?  T&aacute; go leor eagrais ag d&eacute;anamh obair ar nd&oacute;igh.  N&iacute;l dabht ar bith fad&uacute;da sin.<\/p> <p>Rinneadh s&aacute;robair leis na hoifigigh phlean&aacute;la teanga ach an bhfuil plean ann?  An bhfuil c&oacute;ras ceart ann le d&eacute;anamh cinnte go bhfuil siad ag obair le ch&eacute;ile agus ag iarraidh na spriocanna c&eacute;anna a bhaint amach &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta?  Taca&iacute;m le reachta&iacute;ocht l&aacute;idir agus soil&eacute;ir a bhfuil f&iacute;s aici chun saol na Gaeilge agus todhcha&iacute; na Gaeltachta a chinnti&uacute;.  Sin an f&aacute;th a bhfuilim ag tac&uacute; leis na leasuithe at&aacute; luaite ag mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh, agus an chuid eile.  <\/p> <p> T&aacute; fadhbanna ansin agus t&aacute; siad luaite.  Is maith an rud go bhfuil spriocdh&aacute;ta ann ach t&aacute; s&eacute; gan maith ar bith spriocdh&aacute;ta a chur i reachta&iacute;ocht agus ansin cumhacht a thabhairt don Aire &eacute; sin a chur siar.  Is ionann &eacute; sin agus a r&aacute; ag t&uacute;s an phlean nach s&iacute;ltear go n-oibreoidh &eacute;.  Caithfidh an sprioc a bheith i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; 20% a bhaint amach.  Caithfimid f&eacute;achaint ar cad a tharl&oacute;idh ina dhiaidh sin.  Cad &eacute; an ch&eacute;ad ch&eacute;im eile - 30%, 40% n&oacute; 50%?  Caithfimid dul i bhfad n&iacute;os faide.<\/p> <p> Labhair an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v ar chosaint na Gaeltachta agus aonta&iacute;m leis ach, ag deireadh an lae, m&aacute;s sin an t-aon rud at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh, tiocfaidh creimeadh ar an nGaeltacht.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir a bheith ag cosaint an t-am ar fad; caithfimid dul amach ag ionsa&iacute; agus n&iacute;os m&oacute; taca&iacute;ochta a thabhairt don Ghaeilge.  Ag caint le daoine sa Ghaeltacht agus le daoine at&aacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; ar son na Gaeilge, is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil &iacute;omh&aacute; n&oacute; smaoineamh acu go bhfuil siad i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ag iarraidh cosaint a dh&eacute;anamh ar ionsaithe at&aacute; &aacute; nd&eacute;anamh ar an nGaeilge agus ar an nGaeltacht.  T&aacute;im ag caint ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; plean&aacute;la agus ar d&eacute;anamh cinnte go mbeidh coinn&iacute;ollacha plean&aacute;la i bhfeidhm.  Is t&aacute;bhachtach go mb&iacute;onn a leith&eacute;id de sin i bhfeidhm ach ar&iacute;s is cosaint &eacute; nuair a dh&eacute;antar cinnte go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag 80% de lucht c&oacute;naithe east&aacute;t tith&iacute;ochta agus go bhfuil siad in ann a n-obair a dh&eacute;anamh agus a teaghlaigh a th&oacute;g&aacute;il i nGaeilge.  <\/p> <p> Caithfimid amharc ar an taobh eile de.  C&eacute;n cine&aacute;l taca&iacute;ochta&iacute; breise a bhfuil muid chun tabhairt do dhaoine at&aacute; ag iarraidh c&oacute;na&iacute; a bheith orthu sa Ghaeltacht &iacute; f&eacute;in?  N&iacute;lim ag caint faoi chosaint a dh&eacute;anamh ar dhaoine le B&eacute;arla at&aacute; ag teacht isteach.  Ceann de na deacrachta&iacute; m&oacute;ra at&aacute; ag daoine at&aacute; t&oacute;gtha le Gaeilge sna Gaeltachta&iacute;, toisc gur ceantair iarg&uacute;lta iad den chuid is m&oacute;, n&aacute; nach bhfuil aon rud i bpleananna forbartha n&aacute; infheist&iacute;ochta na gcontaetha &oacute; thaobh t&uacute;s &aacute;ite a thabhairt do dhaoine a bhfuil Gaeilge acu chun iad a bheith &aacute;balta c&oacute;na&iacute; a bheith orthu ina gceantair f&eacute;in agus cur le tobar na Gaeilge.<\/p> <p> Luaigh m&eacute; rud sa dh&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht dheiridh.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go raibh muid ag pl&eacute; leis an Aire St&aacute;it agus feidhmeannaigh na Roinne.  Bhain s&eacute; leis na taca&iacute;ochta&iacute; do ghr&uacute;pa&iacute; agus, go h&aacute;irithe, don aos &oacute;g.  Caithfimid cinnti&uacute; go bhfuil an teanga ag an aos &oacute;g agus go dt&oacute;gann siad a gcuid clanna le Gaeilge nuair at&aacute; siad n&iacute;os sine.  Mar ph&aacute;irt de sin, caithfimid earn&aacute;il a bheith againn ina bhfuil an t-aos &oacute;g &aacute;balta am a chaitheadh i d&oacute;igh ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge thart orthu.  <\/p> <p> Is ceann de na ruda&iacute; at&aacute;imid ag iarraidh i gceantar Ghaoth Dobhair n&aacute; ionad buail-isteach don aos &oacute;g.  Bh&iacute;omar ag comhoibri&uacute; leis an Aire St&aacute;it a bh&iacute; ann cheana ina leith sin.  Bh&iacute; cruinni&uacute; aige liom f&eacute;in agus leis an iarTheachta, Pat the Cope Gallagher, anseo i dTeach Laighean.  D&uacute;radh linn go mbeadh plean ann chun ionad &oacute;ige nua a th&oacute;g&aacute;il i gceantar Ghaoth Dobhair agus go raibh plean ann na milli&uacute;in euro a chaitheamh i gceantar Ghaoth Dobhair, n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in ar ionad &oacute;ige ach ar neart rud eile fosta.  Bh&iacute; t&eacute;arma&iacute; tagartha ann do thuarasc&aacute;il agus bh&iacute;omar p&aacute;irteach leis sin.  Rinne an Roinn Cult&uacute;ir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta iad.  Bh&iacute; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta i l&aacute;thair.  Ceapadh comhairleoir agus bh&iacute; molt&oacute;ir ann.  Bh&iacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; eolais de dh&iacute;th agus a leith&eacute;id de sin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; d&eacute;anta anois leis na m&iacute;onna agus n&iacute;l a fhios ag an ngr&uacute;pa &oacute;ige ina bhfuil m&eacute; p&aacute;irteach, agus n&iacute;l a fhios ag na daoine eile at&aacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; go deonach, cad at&aacute; sa tuairisc sin.  <\/p> <p> B&iacute;onn iarTheachta Gallagher ag caint leis an Aire St&aacute;it agus mar sin beidh a fhios aige go bhfuil s&eacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach go gcomhoibreodh an Rialtas agus an St&aacute;t le gr&uacute;pa&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht at&aacute; ag iarraidh an rud is fearr a dh&eacute;anamh.  T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach go mb&iacute;onn teagmh&aacute;il, comhr&aacute;ite agus meas eatarthu.  T&aacute; an t-am caite anois.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go n-inseodh an St&aacute;t d&uacute;inn cad at&aacute; sa tuairisc sin.  An bhfuil plean ann anois le hionad &oacute;ige nua a th&oacute;g&aacute;il i gceantar Ghaoth Dobhair?  Moladh &eacute; sin sa staid&eacute;ar cuimsitheach a rinneadh i nGaoth Dobhair n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; deich mbliana &oacute; shin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite ag an aos &oacute;g f&eacute;in gur sin an rud at&aacute; de dh&iacute;th orthu.  Moladh &eacute; sa phlean a rinne coiste oireachtais.  T&aacute; s&eacute; molta i bplean &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta agus ag &oacute;ige na Gaeltachta go mbeadh ionad buail-isteach ansin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; mar ph&aacute;irt den phlean 20-bliain don Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh ionad &oacute;ige sa cheantar sin.  T&aacute; an staid&eacute;ar d&eacute;anta, t&aacute; an t-airgead caite, t&aacute; comhairleoir ceaptha, t&aacute; an tuairisc scr&iacute;ofa agus os comhair an Aire St&aacute;it, ach n&iacute;or inis &eacute;inne cad at&aacute; istigh ann n&aacute; an bhfuil fadhbanna ann.  Ag deireadh an lae, n&iacute;l muid, mar ghr&uacute;pa pobal, agus na gr&uacute;pa&iacute; deonacha at&aacute; mar ph&aacute;irt den togra seo ag iarraidh ach an rud is fearr do dhaoine &oacute;ige agus do dh&eacute;ag&oacute;ir&iacute; sa d&oacute;igh is go dtig leo am a chaitheamh in earn&aacute;il ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge timpeall orthu.  Cuideoidh s&eacute; sin leis an nGaeilge agus leis an aos &oacute;g.  Ba mhaith liom &eacute; sin a r&aacute;.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil teagmh&aacute;il &aacute; d&eacute;anamh leis an Roinn.  Molaim sin ach caithfimid a fheice&aacute;il cad iad na molta&iacute; at&aacute; ann sa phlean sin.<\/p> <p> Is &eacute; an rud deireanach a luafaidh m&eacute; n&aacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; na n-oile&aacute;n, go h&aacute;irithe c&uacute;rsa&iacute; ar Thoraigh.  T&aacute; fadhb mh&oacute;r maidir le Toraigh.  Bh&iacute; seo pl&eacute;ite sa D&aacute;il c&uacute;pla bliain &oacute; shin.  Bh&iacute; muintir Thora&iacute; taobh amuigh de na geata&iacute; mar gheall ar fhadhbanna iompair isteach agus amach go dt&iacute; an t-oile&aacute;n.  Mar ph&aacute;irt den r&eacute;iteach, moladh go mbeidh b&aacute;d gasta ansin.  Rinne an Roinn &eacute; sin a chur amach chuig tender ach, ar an drochuair, t&aacute; c&aacute;s c&uacute;irte ag dul ar aghaidh mar gheall air sin agus t&aacute; fadhb anois ag an Roinn an conradh sin a bhronnadh.  Mar gheall air sin, n&iacute;l b&aacute;d gasta anois ag dul isteach agus amach go Toraigh.  T&aacute; fadhbanna millteanacha ansin agus muid ag tabhairt aghaidh ar an ngeimhreadh.  Caithfimid d&oacute;igh a fh&aacute;il thart air seo.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil c&aacute;s c&uacute;irte air sin ar si&uacute;l agus n&iacute; f&eacute;idir baint a bheith againn leis sinn.  D&eacute;anfaidh na breithi&uacute;na cinneadh ar an gceist sin amach anseo.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil an t-airgead ann agus go bhfuil an Roinn s&aacute;sta an conradh sin a bhronnadh ar cib&eacute; duine a bhainfidh an tender amach ach t&aacute; fadhb f&oacute;s ann.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ag dul ar aghaidh leis na blianta.  T&aacute;im ag dul isteach ag an ngeimhreadh agus n&iacute;l b&aacute;d gasta ann.  N&iacute; hamh&aacute;in &eacute; sin, ach n&iacute;l an t-ingear&aacute;n a th&eacute;ann amach go dt&iacute; an t-oile&aacute;n &aacute;balta an tseirbh&iacute;s ch&eacute;anna a chur ar f&aacute;il de r&eacute;ir na srianta Covid-19 at&aacute; i bhfeidhm.  Caithfimid a bheith ag smaoineamh taobh amuigh den bhosca &oacute; thaobh an d&oacute;igh inar f&eacute;idir linn taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt do phobal Gaeltachta at&aacute; seacht m&iacute;le amach &oacute; ch&oacute;sta Dh&uacute;n na nGall agus nach bhfuil seirbh&iacute;s bh&aacute;id farant&oacute;ireachta gasta acu agus ba ch&oacute;ir.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh an tAire agus an tAire St&aacute;it &aacute;balta a gcloigne a chur le ch&eacute;ile.  T&aacute;im ar f&aacute;il.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir liom labhairt ar son na dTeachta&iacute; eile &oacute; Dh&uacute;n na nGall ach ceapaim go mbeidh siad ar f&aacute;il freisin.  Caithfimid r&eacute;iteach a fh&aacute;il air seo.  N&iacute; fadhb &iacute; seo a chruthaigh an Rialtas n&aacute; an Freas&uacute;ra ach t&aacute; fadhb ann agus, ag deireadh an lae, caithfimid r&eacute;iteach a fh&aacute;il uirthi.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800039#OO00200","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602171300,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Gabhaim mo bhu&iacute;ochas agus bu&iacute;ochas an Aire le gach Teachta le linn na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta inniu.

This matter is of great concern to tens of thousands of people.  I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Noonan, is here.  He will recall that we discussed this proposed EU regulation in a Topical Issue debate on 16 July.  During that debate, I requested that the Minister of State consult those who would be affected by the regulation, which proposes to ban the use of lead of gunshot bullets.  On that occasion, Teachta Clarke also raised the issue of the presumption of guilt, which would be introduced by the regulation.  She also referred to the definition of wetlands in the Ramsar Convention being intended for use at a global level, and not locally, regionally or nationally.  The Minister of State acknowledged the challenge that the regulation would pose to farmers and gun owners.  He also acknowledged the challenges presented by the Ramsar Convention definition, as well as the proposed buffer zones.  People were reassured when the Minister of State acknowledged and accepted those concerns.  On that occasion, the Minister of State stated: \"While the Commission has proposed to progress this measure, I believe it is time we received some support on this matter.\"  He also told us he was \"more than happy to meet with the lobby on this issue\".<\/p>  <p>  After that exchange, I emailed the Minister of State to formally invite him to meet groups, such as the National Association of Regional Game Councils, NARGC, but I did not receive a response.  On 3 September, Ireland voted in the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals, REACH, committee to support this regulation.  Despite several attempts to get clarification from the office of the Minister of State, it was only on 15 September, via a response to a parliamentary question that I had submitted, that we received confirmation that Ireland had voted to support this regulation.  All the evidence suggests that the Irish position was changed at the direction of the Minister of State.  If that is the case, I would consider it to be an act of bad faith, as would the thousands of farmers and gun owners who will be impacted.<\/p>  <p>  I have no doubt we will now hear that all will be well and any issues arising will be handled during the transitional phase.  I do not believe that will be the case.  I fear that it is the intention of the Government to overcome the challenges posed by the Ramsar Convention definition of buffer zones by banning the sale and use of lead gunshot entirely.  If that is not the intention, I invite the Minister of State to outline how it could possibly be workable to implement this regulation in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  I have a letter from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as it was known, dating from June, stating that \"the various issues raised by Ireland relating to a longer lead-in time for Member States without restrictions and issues surrounding buffer zones around wetlands do not appear to have been addressed by the Commission in the current draft of the regulation.  Accordingly, Ireland is unable to support the current regulation in its current form, unless changes are made to address these concerns\".  Will the Minister of State tell me what changes were made in the time since that letter was written?  Was it simply the case that the position of the Minister of State changed and then the Government's changed?  People will be interested in hearing his response regarding this issue, especially since I have emails from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, from just days before the September vote, indicating that Ireland would reiterate its concerns at the meeting on 3 September.  How did this current draft differ from the previous version?  On what date did Ireland formally change and reverse its position?  Did the Minister of State intervene to sign us up to a position that will create substantial difficulties and costs for Irish farmers and game club members without any consultation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800042#SS00300","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1602172200,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Carthy for bringing this matter up today.<\/p>  <p>  He is correct in saying that this issue was discussed as a Topical Issue matter on 16 July, when Deputies Carthy and Clarke raised this subject.  It is good for us to be able to discuss it again today.  I will update the House on the background to this issue.  As I indicated in July, the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds, AEWA, was developed under the UN Convention on Migratory Species.  Ireland signed up to the agreement in 2003 and it includes a commitment that \"Parties shall endeavour to phase out the use of lead shot for hunting in wetlands as soon as possible in accordance with self-imposed and published timetables.\"  I am happy that Ireland's position is to support the AEWA commitment to phase out the use of lead shot over wetlands.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, and directly related to our discussion here this evening, the European Commission published a set of draft regulations in early 2019 for consideration by member states on the use of lead shot in and around wetlands.  The draft regulation was discussed by member states at some meetings of the European committee on the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals, more commonly referred to as the REACH committee, as Deputy Carthy has said.  Following discussions at a meeting of the REACH committee last June, the European Commission submitted a draft set of regulations for a vote by member states by written procedure.<\/p>  <p>  The main proposals in the regulation involve a transitional period of 24 months for those member states banning the use of lead shot in guns in or around wetlands; for those member states with wetlands which exceed 20% of their territory, the transition time is extended to 36 months, provided member states also ban the purchase and use of lead shot in all their territory, not just on wetlands; fixed buffer zones of 100 m around wetlands where lead shot possession and shooting would be prohibited; and a definition of wetlands that is used in the Ramsar Convention.<\/p>  <p>  As I indicated to the House in July, I support fully the underlying thrust of the regulation and I am committed to phasing out lead shot in wetlands, given that lead is clearly undesirable and can cause harm to the environment and water birds.  Many member states have had restrictions on the use of lead gunshot in place for many years.  Ireland, on the other hand, has had no restrictions at all.  I know that we are not completely alone in that regard and that a small number of other member states also do not have restrictions, but we are in a minority.  It is true that for those member states which have some national regulation already in place, many gun owners would have guns with non-lead shot ammunition and any transitional challenges to meet the requirements of the proposed regulations would thus be mitigated.<\/p> <p>In the case of Ireland, as we currently have no restriction, statutory or otherwise, on the use of lead in gunshot, the regulations would pose a challenge to us in implementing and properly enforcing a new regulation in 24 months in a situation where member states are more advanced than us with regard to national regulation.  I understand that in Ireland, some farmers' and hunters' guns may not be capable of using lead shot substitutes and they may need to purchase new guns.  In addition, the definition proposed to be used for wetlands is that defined under the Ramsar convention, that is, wetlands of international importance, which includes peatlands, and this would cover relatively large areas around the country.  These Ramsar areas are not currently all mapped and given the scale of wetlands in Ireland, this would take some time and, therefore, enforcement would present us with challenges.<\/p> <p> My Department held consultations with interested parties including hunting and farming interests on this matter.  While the Department has always supported the underlying thrust of the regulations and is committed to phasing out the use of lead shot in and around wetlands, it made a case for a longer lead-in time to deal with the transitional challenges which I have outlined and, in that regard, submitted documentation to the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals, REACH, committee.<\/p> <p> As the Deputy may recall from when we discussed this on 16 July, the Commission has proposed that a vote on the draft regulations was to be taken by written procedure on the day before our discussion but then decided to terminate that voting procedure.  At the time of our previous discussion, we were awaiting further clarification from the Commission on how it intends to progress with this matter.  Since then, the issue was discussed at a REACH meeting held on 3 September.  Notwithstanding Ireland's reservations about the lead-in time, since we are committed to phasing out lead shot in and around wetlands, Ireland indicated at the meeting that we would support the draft regulation.  A vote was taken at the meeting on the draft regulation and it was passed by the necessary majority of member states with Ireland voting to support the measure.  The draft regulation will now be sent to the Council and European Parliament for scrutiny for a period of three months.<\/p> <p> While we recognise that there will be some challenges to us relating to implementation if this proposed regulation becomes law, Ireland, like all member states, will have to rise to the challenge and we will do this in consultation with stakeholders.  I am satisfied that the long-term implications of the regulation would be of benefit to Ireland, its citizens and the environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800042#SS00400","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602172800,"counter":319,"content":"<p>That is bizarre.  The Minister of State spent the bulk of his contribution reiterating the exact comments that he made during our previous debate, which outlined the concerns and challenges involved, then said that we will face down those challenges at a different stage.  He mentioned the consultation with some of the organisations that have an interest in this.  He did not state that the conversation took place after the vote, which is incredibly disappointing.  The Green Party spent some time at its online conference asking why people in rural Ireland do not like it.  Notwithstanding the suggestion from a Green Party Senator that it should just use smaller words, I can tell the Minister of State that it is actions, such as the one he has taken, that lead people in rural communities to think that his party is out of touch and deaf to their concerns.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State was presented with a regulation.  He was told that the regulation would create significant difficulties for farmers and game clubs, the very people who are needed to champion conservation measures and protect biodiversity.  He was simply asked to ensure that the full consultation process would happen and take place with them before he supported the regulation, and he could not do it.  I do not understand why that is the case.<\/p>  <p>  He has made a decision that will put a significant burden on a number of gun holders.  Will he commit to ensure that people who are out of pocket because they have to change or modify their guns will be compensated in full?  Will he commit to consult with those people who will be affected by the implementation of the regulation?  If he is, will he outline the process and nature of that consultation?  People will take a commitment to consult with a grain of salt.  In recognition of where we have been up until this point, will the Minister of State outline the form of that consultation?  Whatever needs to be done to protect our environment has to be done.  All I am asking is that the people who are on the front line in protecting biodiversity and the environment are consulted before decisions that affect them are made.  That is not too much to ask.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800043#TT00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1602172800,"counter":320,"content":"<p>As the Deputy said, I met representatives of the NARGC.  It was after the vote on 3 September.  I had a constructive meeting with them.  There were difficulties but it was constructive.  I recognise the conservation efforts and work that council members do around the country, including on grey partridge and other projects.  They do fantastic work in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  As a general principle, I am fully supportive of the proposals that led to the ban on the use of lead shot in and around wetlands, given the threats posed by lead in the environment.  At the same time, I fully appreciate that there will be challenges for hunters and other gun users to overcome to meet the requirements of this draft regulation should it eventually be passed by the European Parliament.  My Department has liaised directly with farming and hunting stakeholders over the past year or so and we are aware of the challenges involved.  There will be challenges for Government in this as well.  For example, the Commission's proposal for buffer zones of 100 m around wetlands is an added difficulty when trying to enforce any new restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  In following up on a commitment that I gave to Deputies when we discussed the matter in July, I met members of NARGC which represents the interests of the hunters, and we had a useful and frank discussion on the issue.  I will meet the Irish Farmers' Association separately, specifically about this.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has argued at the REACH committee for a transition period of more than the two years proposed by the Commission, especially for member states that do not currently have any restrictions.  My Department submitted written documentation to the REACH committee in that regard.  As I indicated earlier, notwithstanding our reservations on the transition arrangement in the draft regulation, the Commission put the proposal to a vote without a revised transition period.  Since we are committed to phasing out the use of lead shot in and around wetlands, which I strongly believe is the correct approach, Ireland voted in support of the draft regulation, which was passed by the necessary majority of member states, and would have been the case anyway.  We were aware that the proposal would have been carried irrespective of how Ireland voted, given the level of support.  In the circumstances, I believe Ireland took the correct decision to vote in favour to signal our support for protection of the environment and of health, not just for wild birds but for humans too.<\/p>  <p>  I outlined my commitment to the Deputy again and I will continue to hold consultations with the relevant stakeholders to try to address those concerns.

Obviously these things happen but the school was then told it would be closed until next week.  A consequence of this is that pupils returned home.  It is of particular consequence and anxiety to students and their parents who are studying for the leaving certificate to be sent home and to lose time, having already lost three to four months of the school curriculum in the lead-up to the leaving certificate in 2021.

A major building project has been under way at the Sancta Maria College since 2015, which is delivering major refurbishment works and an extension to the college.<\/p>  <p>  As part of this project, the heating in the system was upgraded to bring it to a modern standard and some further works were also done to ensure any outstanding snags in the heating system would be done in the summer break of 2020.  The main contractor for the contract, L&amp;M Keating, returned to the site after the national Covid-19 shutdown of construction sites but progress has been extremely slow since the resumption.  The main contractor ceased work in early July and has not returned to the site since.<\/p>  <p>  I am not sure if the Deputy is aware but in recent days, the main contractor has applied for examinership, which has been granted on an interim basis.

My Department's building unit is aware of the problem with the heating system in the school and was told at lunchtime on Tuesday, 6 October, when the school emailed, seeking approval to appoint an engineering contractor to resolve the issues.  That afternoon, the board of management at the school was authorised to have all necessary works carried out by the engineering contractor.

I am honoured to bring the Trade Union Representation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2018 before the D&aacute;il this evening.  Its purpose is to close a loophole in Irish law that has been exploited by some employers for many years.  This has to do with collective bargaining and the way employers have an effective veto over who represents workers in matters of pay and conditions.  This issue is of even more importance today in light of the effect Covid-19 is having on livelihoods and the nature of work itself.  It is vital that trade unions are allowed to do their job and negotiate these issues on behalf of their members.  That is not always the case under the State's voluntary system of industrial relations. <\/p>  <p>  Just last month in Drogheda, both the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union, SIPTU, and Unite the Union were frozen out of negotiations by management at Premier Periclase.  This dispute was not about a pay rise.  It arose from the company's proposals to lay off some workers and put others on reduced hours while transferring work to non-union labour and retaining contractors on site.  It was classic union-busting and workers had no choice but to take to the picket lines as management repeatedly refused to engage in talks at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, in any meaningful way.  Some four days into the strike the company issued letters to workers informing them that their long-standing collective agreement with SIPTU and Unite the Union was no longer valid.  It refused to sit around the table with these unions at the WRC to resolve this matter while at the same time speaking to other unions and staff associations.  Things have moved on and talks are now ongoing under new management, but the incident served to highlight the enormous power employers have in collective bargaining.  There are many other examples.  Each highlights the need for the law to change so that trade unions finally have legal protection that ensures they can represent their members when collective bargaining takes place.  <\/p>  <p>  This Bill does three things.  First, it enshrines in law a definition of an authorised trade union as a trade union in receipt of a negotiation licence.  A negotiation licence is a licence issued by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation allowing a trade union to legally engage in industrial disputes.  Second, the Bill introduces a definition of collective bargaining to the Trade Union Act 1941.  Third, it provides that where a process of collective bargaining is in place, the right of employees to nominate an authorised trade union to negotiate on their behalf shall be recognised by the employer.  In other words, when workers say they want a certain union to negotiate on their behalf their employer must accept that decision and get on with negotiations.  This is an extremely simple and straightforward addition to the current law which will be of significant benefit to workers and their unions. <\/p>  <p>  I will now say what the Bill does not do.  It does not make it mandatory for employers to engage in collective bargaining.  It does not force an employer to the negotiation table.  However, where an employer is already engaged in collective bargaining with either staff associations or employee representative committees, the employer cannot then refuse to engage with a trade union if members want that union to represent them.  <\/p>  <p>  Under this Bill, an employer will no longer be able to discriminate against trade unions by choosing to engage with staff associations only and not with unions.  An employer is still free to refuse to engage in collective bargaining, but under this Bill that refusal must apply across the board.  An employer cannot veto the right of workers to representation by trade unions where negotiations are already ongoing.  The right we are talking about here is the right to be heard.  That is what we want to give trade unions and their members.  This right exists in other EU countries, but such is the backwardness of our industrial relations system that even in the 21st century we are playing catch-up.<\/p>  <p>  It is well known that our Constitution gives everyone the right to join a trade union, but the laws underpinning that right are so weak that it is not always possible for workers to exercise it.  I will explain what I mean by that.  Trade unions are not social clubs, although they have a social function.  Their purpose is to allow workers to come together and bargain collectively with their employer for improvements in pay and conditions.<\/p> <p>If the right to join a union means anything, it means union members have the right to bargain collectively.  Collective bargaining is based on a recognition of the fact that employer enjoys greater socioeconomic power than individual workers.  Workers, therefore, need to act together to provide themselves collectively with sufficient power to bargain effectively with employers.  The current situation is that although the Constitution gives workers the right to join a union and, by implication, the right to bargain collectively, the law that underpins that right makes recognition of that right by employers voluntary.  That is obscene.  It is not worth the paper on which it is written.  It is like being told that one has the right to join a gym but not to use any of the equipment, or join a golf club but not play golf there, or bring a case to court but not choose one's lawyer.  The fact that this has been allowed to stand for decades by Fianna F&aacute;il and certain other parties is a sad commentary on those parties' time in government, but this is a moment when we can rectify that.<\/p> <p> I call on the parties in government to support the Bill and allow it to progress to Committee Stage.  If they have any legal or other issue with it, let us apply pre-legislative scrutiny to it.  Let us trust the committee system and allow the committee to do its job.  It is time to give workers and trade unions the right to be heard.  The current law states that workers have a legal right to be a member of a trade union and be represented by their union, but an employer does not have to recognise the union because there is no legal obligation on an employer to deal with a trade union for the purposes of negotiations on pay and work conditions.  It is high time that law was changed.  The Bill does nothing other than bring this State into line with the rest of the EU.  There is no point in having a right that cannot be expressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800045#VV00600","speaker":"1497","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602174000,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I thank Teachta Munster for bringing the Bill before the House and facilitating this important discussion.  It is timely that we are discussing organising, trade union membership and workers' rights because it is obvious to anyone who cares to look that this pandemic has shown up the way in which successive Governments have failed to safeguard workers' rights or ensure that workers' terms and conditions are protected.<\/p>  <p>  Indeed, the terms and conditions of workers have been diluted over time.  I refer to precarious work and zero hours contracts.  When I was growing up, such practices were something we thought might happen in America or somewhere else far away.  When Margaret Thatcher came to power, we thought that would be part of her agenda.  However, we now have precarious contracts in the public service.  Tutors, lecturers and nurses are hired but when they wish to turn up for work they are told to register with CPL or another agency.  Direct employment is becoming less and less the norm.<\/p>  <p>  It has never been more important for us to have a conversation about workers' rights because workers are facing the twin threats of the fallout from the pandemic, which we know will be substantial, and the threat of a no-deal Brexit.  In a statement released this evening, SIPTU stated that the time is now for us to have that conversation about workers' rights.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to be clear, because sometimes there can be some misunderstanding about these issues.  It is not our job as Deputies to organise or bargain for workers or do the job of a recognised trade union but it is our job to create the conditions necessary for trade unions to organise and thrive.  There is nothing to be feared from a well-organised and well-run trade union movement.  We, as legislators, must create those conditions.  We are not here to organise unions.  Rather, our job is to allow them to get on with their work.<\/p>  <p>  I would ask anyone who thinks there is something to be feared from the Bill two very simple questions.  Are they afraid of decent wages?  Are they terrified of fair practices in work?  Those are the only reasons I can think of for opposing the Bill.  If there are issues with the Bill that need to be teased out, the committee is the appropriate place for that to be done.  The Bill can undergo pre-legislative scrutiny.  It is extremely important that that be done and that engagement take place on the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Employers and their cheerleaders on the right tell us things such as workers want flexibility.  In all my years as a trade union organiser, I never met a worker who wanted a precarious contract, but I often heard employers state that workers love precarious contracts as they do not wish to be tied down by a contract.  The employers contended that workers do not want all of that; rather, they want the right to come and go as they please.  All Members know that is simply not true and that it is anti-worker and anti-trade union rhetoric, but it has been allowed to grow.  We need to challenge that.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is around strengthening the power of trade unions to organise and collectively bargain for their workers.  Trade union organisation is a matter all Members should stand behind and about which they should be concerned.  Members are aware of the disputes on big State projects such as significant construction projects.  I will not name the companies in question in the Chamber because some of them are run by people who are quite litigious.  Deputies are aware there have been recognition disputes.  The State is spending money on these projects but it is not safeguarding workers' rights.  Surely that is wrong and is something we must tackle. Is there any reason not to include a social clause in State contracts?  That is extremely important.<\/p>  <p>  As Teachta Munster outlined, employers can simply walk away.  The voluntarist system of industrial relations can and does work well in many instances but it does not always work well.  When a boss can simply shrug his or her shoulders and decide not to turn up at the Workplace Relations Commission, there is very little power left for workers, apart from taking industrial action.  The burden is on workers to do so.<\/p>  <p>  There is a role for the State in ensuring that the conditions are created to facilitate union organising and a growth in trade union membership because there is no better defence for a worker.   I do not think there is a worker in the State who thinks it is my job or the job of any other Deputy to go in and protect them at a workplace level, but there is no better defence against the race to the bottom than a union card.  A union card is a worker's best weapon in that fight but we need to be able to create a strong, vibrant trade union movement.  It is our job, as legislators, to facilitate that.  It is the job of the unions to organise.<\/p>  <p>  At a SIPTU conference I attended many years ago, Tony Woodley, the then general secretary of the Unite the Union, then known as the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union, stated that the choice for trade unions in Ireland is simple: they must ask themselves whether are they a partnership union or a fighting-back union.  That is the conversation trade unions need to have with their members.  They need to make the decision.  The conversation for Members of this House is whether the Government is on the side of workers and workers' rights and whether it is willing to facilitate a strong and well-organised trade union movement.  Will it stand up for workers?  Will the Minister of State, Deputy English, use his voice and platform and his powers as Minister of State to vindicate and stand up for workers' rights?<\/p>  <p>  I will conclude with this simple observation.  During the debate on the leadership election within the Minister's party, the man who now leads that party spoke about wishing to bring in compulsory recognition of Labour Court recommendations such that they would be binding.  We could spend all day debating the intention behind that statement, but I know a good old-fashioned Thatcherite strike ban when I hear one.  To workers, I say to join their trade union and get active in it.  To the Minister of State, I say that if his party wishes to lose its reputation as being anti-worker, it can do so by facilitating the passage of the Bill and by working with us to create the climate for workers to get organised, to be able to bargain and to have their rights at work vindicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800046#WW00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1602174000,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Munster, the proposer of the Bill.  I understand the motives behind it.<\/p> <p>We have had discussions here already in the past few weeks.  I note the Deputy is prominent in flagging the issues affecting local business.  It is not just that as in general, the Deputy wants to bring forward the discussion as well.<br\/><br\/>I listened carefully with interest to both Deputies Munster and O'Reilly.  I note that the Bill introduced by both essentially proposes an expressed statutory right for trades unions to have their representative duties to their members recognised for collective bargaining and disciplinary matters.  It is proposed that this could be achieved primarily through an amendment to section 10 of the Trade Union Act 1941.  The short Bill also proposes definitions of authorised trade unions and proposed that a new definition of collective bargaining be introduced to the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001.<br\/><br\/>I am not supporting the Private Members' Bill for the following reasons.  The approach to industrial relations in Ireland is one of volunteerism, whereby the law will not seek to impose an obligation or a solution on the parties to a dispute but will, where appropriate, assist them in arriving at a solution.  There has been a consensus that the terms and conditions of employment that exceed the statutory provisions of workers shall in general be determined by the collective bargaining process between an employer and employers' association and one or more trade unions or staff associations.  This process can cover the entire range of issues arising from the employment relationship and I believe that the trade union movement is very well protected by the Constitution and by our laws as well.<br\/><br\/>Contrary to Deputy O'Reilly's assertion, we have a strong trade union movement in this country.  It is very effective.  I am not sure why the Deputy thinks it is not.<br\/><br\/>Dispute resolution in Ireland is based on the structures created by the Industrial Relations Acts.  It is based on the concept of the parties voluntarily seeking to resolve their differences with the machinery being provided by the State.<br\/><br\/>The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 significantly changed the industrial relations landscape in Ireland.  It reformed the law in respect of employees' rights to engage in collective bargaining so as to ensure Ireland's compliance with judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.<br\/><br\/>The 2015 legislation provides a clear and balanced mechanism by which the fairness of the employment conditions of workers in their totality can be assessed in employments where collective bargaining does not take place and brings clarity and certainty for employers in terms of managing their workplaces in this respect.<br\/><br\/>The 2015 Act already provides a definition for collective bargaining as being voluntary engagements or negotiations between any employer or employers' organisation on the one hand and a trade union of workers or excepted body to which this Act applies on the other with the object of reaching agreement regarding working conditions or terms of employment or non-employment of workers.<br\/><br\/>The 2015 Act ensures that where an employer does not engage in collective bargaining, an effective framework now exists that allows a trade union to have the remuneration and terms and conditions of its members assessed against relevant comparators and determined in a binding way by the Labour Court.<br\/><br\/>The process in the 2015 Act is designed to be compliant with the Constitution.  It has been established in several legal cases that the constitutional guarantee of the freedom of association does not guarantee workers the right to have their union recognised for the purpose of collective bargaining.  The right of association does not place any requirement on an employer to recognise or negotiation with any union.  The implication is that although there is a right to form unions, this does not have the corollary right to recognition, negotiation or representation.  Engagement remains voluntary.  That system has served us quite well in most cases in our history.<br\/><br\/>The freedom of association and the right to organise and bargain collectively, as set out in Article 40 of the Constitution, is guaranteed in a number of international instruments which the State has ratified and which it is, therefore, bound to uphold under international law.  Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights protects the freedom of association, and this has been held to include the right to bargain collectively.  To this end, as some Deputies may recall, the previous programme for Government contained a commitment to ensure that Irish law on employees' right to engage in collective bargaining is consistent with judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.  Accordingly, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was granted access to the State's dispute resolution bodies, the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC and the Labour Court, in early 2020.<br\/><br\/>There is a limited right to representation arising out of international cases under the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is arguable that this right is restricted to representation in individual grievance and disciplinary cases and does not extend to the right of negotiation on terms and conditions of employment.  The Supreme Court has remained firm in its support for the individual right to disassociate as a corollary of the right to associate.  The comments of Mr. Justice Geoghegan in a 2007 Supreme Court case, Ryanair <i>v<\/i>. the Labour Court, indicate that it may not be possible to enact legislation obliging employers to deal with trade unions, certainly not in the manner proposed in this Bill.<br\/><br\/>The Government will continue to protect the robust measures that have already been put in place to support collective bargaining with a volunteerist industrial relations framework, which has served the State well to date.  We also intend to augment the existing protections by prioritising a series of reforms to improve workers rights, including the introduction of statutory sick pay and a living wage.<br\/><br\/>I recognise that the T&aacute;naiste has signalled - we discussed this in this Chamber yesterday, where the Seanad was sitting at the time - that he has already started that process to achieve the statutory sick pay scheme and has begun an engagement, through the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, with the relevant stakeholders, which will lead on to a more formal public consultation in November too.  The T&aacute;naiste is already acting in this area to progress conditions of work and protect the rights of workers.  That is something to which the T&aacute;naiste is strongly committed.  Of course, members of the Opposition will argue that the T&aacute;naiste is not but he will be proven by his actions.  He has already taken swift action when it comes to introducing statutory sick pay, which we all recognise is an area that we need to make progress on.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons outlined above, I will not be supporting the proposal that the Bill be read a second time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800046#WW00300","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602174600,"counter":334,"content":"<p>We now move into the list of speakers, each of whom has ten minutes but can share.

Often legislation comes through, IBEC steps in the way and the Government goes its way and not the workers' way.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, in a debate on child poverty, I spoke about the relevance of low pay in relation to the high levels of poverty in society.  One in every five workers is low paid.  In some sectors, particularly in hospitality, the minimum wage has become the maximum wage and is the norm across the industry.<\/p>  <p>  Two years ago, I was approached by a group of workers employed by the then newly-opened restaurant, The Ivy, in Dublin.  These workers were being denied their tips.  They had a contract of, say, &euro;12.10 an hour.  They were only getting paid the minimum wage and it was being topped up by the tips that the restaurant was taking from the customers.  A small group of the workers joined the Unite the Union.  The company refused to negotiate and then sacked the two workers who were the key advocates of joining the union.  In a follow-up campaign, every restaurant, caf&eacute; and hotel in Dublin city centre was visited by activists.  What we found was an interest by workers in unionisation and a campaign for a living wage but a real fear of speaking out, of standing up for their rights and joining the union.  There is a reign of terror out there and Covid is not helping.  Workers need a union to combat on their behalf.  Covid-19 has already exposed the draconian conditions facing workers in meat factories.  The Health and Safety Authority, HSA, does not have the resources, or, it seems, the inclination, to properly examine the conditions in meat factories or other problem workplaces.<\/p>  <p>  I also raised the issue of two female workers in Spike Island Tours who have been working as seasonal workers on that tour for the past three years.  They had not got toilet facilities or hand-washing facilities.  They used the hotels and the caf&eacute;s locally.  When the pandemic hit and they returned to work, they still had no toilet or hand-washing facilities.  They were told to use the tap on the pier to wash their hands by the board of Spike Island Tours.  These workers had to get their union involved.  They eventually got their toilet, and then they were sacked.  The company first spoke to the union and then refused to talk to them until the two workers and other activists launched a major campaign to name and shame Cork County Council and the board.  They eventually spoke to the union and they were reinstated.  I support those workers in their struggle and fight for their jobs.<\/p>  <p>  I also have been approached by driving instructors recently, who must go to Road Safety Authority, RSA, centres for their work.  They are being locked out of the RSA centre.  They cannot go in and use the bathrooms.  They cannot use any hand-washing facilities.  They cannot access a roof over their head against the elements.  They have gone to the Road Safety Authority.  They have gone to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who advised them to go to the HSA, which advised them to go to the RSA.  They are still in the situation where they are standing outside their places of work in the cold and rain.  They have joined Unite the Union to represent them.<\/p> <p>As yet, they have not had an opportunity to speak to the RSA.<\/p> <p> Trade unions need a right of access for health and safety reasons to go into workplaces and speak with workers.  This legislation would be a big step forward in assisting the trade union movement to organise.  A strong unionised work force is the key to ending low pay and to ensuring good working conditions, good health and safety conditions and good environmental standards.

The right to collective bargaining and the right to union representation is and should be a pillar in any civilised society.  The denial of such a right is the denial of freedom of association itself.  However, this right does not come about easily.  It was hard fought for in many countries, sometimes with violence as was the case in the Dublin Lock-out of 1913 or sometimes by peaceful means, but it is always at a supreme cost to working men and women such as the young South African medical student, Steve Biko.<\/p>  <p>  This fundamental principle brings about real, tangible change in workers' lives and working conditions.  It protects vulnerable workers against unscrupulous and exploitive employers.  I note recent examples of zero-hour contracts, 15-hour contracts and the recent magnanimous increase of the minimum wage by 10 cent an hour, which might purchase an extra sliced pan and a carton of milk at the end of the week.  <\/p>  <p>  There are 750,000 workers in the State on low wages.  The importance of this Bill cannot be overstated.  The Bill gives the labour force a strong hand in organising its future and in organising a decent wage capable of supporting and rearing a family.  Surely that is something that any government would want for its people.

The Covid crisis has opened many eyes as to whether their employers were one of the good, the bad or the ugly.  At the start of the crisis, my office was inundated with inquiries from employees, some about the pandemic unemployment payment but many on employment law issues, which would have been better dealt with by union officials.  This is a very simple Bill with one key objective, namely, to protect workers.  We have all learned, from the experience of Debenhams workers, how rogue employers can behave.  I have visited Debenhams workers in Newbridge several times.  I commend them and their colleagues around the country on sticking to their principles.<\/p>  <p>  The Government needs to intervene to help the Debenhams workers.  Many members of the Government wrung their hands after the Clerys debacle and said never again, enough is enough, but here were are again.  The Duffy Cahill report must be implemented immediately.  The shopping centre in Newbridge, of which Debenhams was the flagship shop, is assisting strike-breaking by facilitating the removal of stock from the Debenhams store.  Shame on those responsible.<\/p>  <p>  The main aim of this Bill is to give statutory footing to allow unions to represent their members in collective bargaining, including grievance and disciplinary issues.  Employment law case history show the consequences of disciplinary issues in particular can be far reaching.  There is a strong constitutional protection to the ability to earn a living.

It is timely because People Before Profit is putting a similar Bill before Stormont to repeal the anti-trade union legislation introduced by Maggie Thatcher many decades ago, which have been implemented by the Stormont regime.  I welcome that as it gives us the sense that the same problems face workers all over Ireland, on both sides of the Border.<\/p>  <p>  A war has been waged against working class people in this country for decades.  It is often not overt - it is not the kind of thing that a person might see - but it is subtle and often dressed in language that seems to suggest otherwise.  Partnership is often a word that is used, such as the social partnership model.  It is a war nonetheless, and one side has been winning, namely, the employers and their backers in the State bodies and Government agencies directly responsible.  The results of the war are seen in the headline rates and statistics of low pay, precarious contracts, the lack of sick pay schemes and pension entitlements.  They are seen in the decline in union membership over the years and the fact that a whole generation of workers entering the workforce has never known the very idea of a stable, pensionable, and secure employment.  It is like a pipe dream for those workers.  It is also evident in the poor provision of all our public services, the services that workers need, the provision of decent housing, a decent health service, proper public transport and so on.  On the front line of this war is the ability of workers to join a union and have their employers negotiate with it.  In this, the State pretends to be neutral - the Minister of State's response indicates that - but that neutrality contrives with employers to ensure the imbalance between the relationship of employer and employee remains.  A legal right by a worker to have his or her union recognised by his or her employer would be an important step forward to correct that imbalance, to give workers the confidence to look for the things that previous generations enjoyed and are being stripped away from them, such as decent pay, decent pension rights, sick leave entitlements and dignity and respect at work.  Another debate is to be had, albeit not in this forum, about the type of union we need and whether the ones we have are doing the job that is required. <\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise two groups of workers who illustrate the point I am making very well.  First, I raise the Debenhams workers.  Yesterday, a High Court injunction was issued to KPMG, a global corporate conglomerate, which often provides assistance to this State and others for consultancy and other matters like the carrying out of insolvency procedures.  That injunction has insulted those workers who will have been out on strike for six months tomorrow.  They are workers who have put their lives and those of their families on hold to achieve their just rights.  Other Deputies have spoken about the Duffy Cahill report.  The previous Government, of which the Minister of State was a member, failed to implement it.  Now 1,000 workers from Debenhams have been thrown on the scrapheap because of the Government's failure.  Instead of the Government moving to tell KPMG, the liquidators, to give Debenhams workers the priority in order of creditors, every time it is raised in the House, the Government responds with more legalistic jargon to say that it cannot be done.  <\/p>  <p>  I will cite Kieran Wallace, who went to the High Court yesterday.  He is a highly experienced, well-versed legal representative of KPMG, who is working on this job of liquidating Debenhams.  He told us at a meeting a couple of months ago that what is required is for the Irish Government to instruct KPMG that it will step aside as the primary creditor in the list of creditors for the liquidation.  The Government can do that and if it does so, then KPMG can push the workers up in that list of priority.  The Government is refusing to do that and is trying to bamboozle Deputies and parties here with legalistic jargon that we are not in a position to prove wrong.  <\/p>  <p>  At this point, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions needs to step up to the plate and demand an immediate and urgent meeting with the Government to make these points.  I remember well how in 2005, as will others of my vintage, nearly 80,000 to 100,000 workers took to the streets for an afternoon.  They went on strike - but it was not called that, it was called a day of protest - to defend the rights of workers in Irish Ferries, to stop the race to the bottom.  It was an incredible occasion.  ICTU should think very strongly about doing something similar and while we cannot breach public health and safety guidelines, we could organise a few hours or a half-day strike to demand justice for the Debenhams workers.<\/p> <p> I wish to refer to Ryanair, the notoriously and proudly anti-union company.  Last year, it was forced to recognise unions across Europe.  I have with me a letter from a group of Ryanair trade union representatives from approximately seven European countries.  According to it, eight workers were dismissed during their strikes - four union representatives and four cabin crew members.  The base chief in Tenerife who was part of the strike committee was demoted in the afternoon after a mediation took place to avoid a strike.  Three union representatives were dismissed in Prague.  Cabin crews in Europe describe the \"brilliant\" model of Ryanair as being based on continuous disrespect for the most basic laws around union rights - an illegal model that is used to hire agency workers - as well as an ongoing atmosphere of threats to workers and poor working conditions.<\/p> <p> Their question to us is how can Ryanair ask for state aid for its industry during Covid when it has used Irish labour law to employ workers in many countries and benefit from and take advantage of that market for 30 years.  These are workers who are not based in Ireland, yet Ryanair cherry-picks the most beneficial laws and often ignores local laws in many countries.  Now that Ryanair comes holding out its hand to the State, Ireland rewards it by appointing the former CEO of Malta Air, a subsidiary of Ryanair, as Aviation Regulator with the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA.  The appointment of Mr. Diarmuid &Oacute; Conghaile to the IAA is a disgrace.<\/p> <p> I will finish by citing a famous clarion call for all workers: \"An injury to one is an injury to all.\"  That call must ring for us all when we attempt to redress the imbalance between employer and worker in this country.  The Bill deserves all our support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800048#YY00400","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602175800,"counter":341,"content":"<p>We have 37 minutes left in the game and five Deputies offering.

They have brought us weekends, paid leave and protections of all kinds.  They did so through the struggle and toil of thousands, including in this country.  It is not the case that the trade union movement in Ireland or anywhere else is beyond criticism, but the fact remains that, anywhere one cares to look, strong trade unions and a high percentage of workers in them mean better pay, better conditions, more security and better standards.  That is an objective fact, not only across the developed world, but everywhere.  I urge people to join a union.  Unions are undoubtedly imperfect and people may have frustrations with them, but a union offers protections and the chance of advancement along with fellow workers.  There is power in a union.  Of that there is no question.<\/p>  <p>  Every country has its own labour history.  At the heart of ours is the fundamental point of the right to join a union in and of itself and to be represented by same.  Some 107 years ago, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, ITGWU, took to the streets of Dublin in opposition to Mr. William Martin Murphy's locking union workers out and his attempt to blacklist them on the basis of not recognising them.  It is ironic that when Larkin is now revered as a hero of Irish trade unionism, it is still acceptable and legal to ignore and not recognise a union chosen by workers to represent them and instead to negotiate only with associations that employers have set up themselves.  These associations are basically yellow-pack unions.  People might dispute that, but it is often the case.  When any legislation establishing a structure is before the House, the question arises of whether the structure is truly independent and who appoints it.  If a structure is set up by an employer, how can we be confident that it has the ability to oppose an employer independently and powerfully when the employer is choosing a course that is not favourable or fair to the workers?  Employers' associations are all well and good, but let us not kid ourselves.  They are not trade unions or anything like them, and they are not capable of representing workers the way that unions are.<\/p>  <p>  If an employer is engaging in collective bargaining, it should be obliged to engage with a legislatively recognised trade union with a permit for negotiating.  There is no logical reason for an employer to be unable to do so, nor is there a good constitutional reason.<\/p>  <p>  As matters stand, an employer can lock the gate against a rightly and legally constituted union in favour of its own structure.  Our infrastructure for the enforcement of labour law is feeble.  There have been issues with many employers down the years.  I salute the workers in Ryanair who, over the course of many years, broke down its resistance to trade union recognition.  That was a significant advancement and put workers in Ryanair in a much better position to fight for their rights.  Many other employers in the retail, hospitality and financial sectors recognise staff associations but will not negotiate with trade unions.  That is not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Bill, the right of a trade union to represent its members for the purpose of collective bargaining shall be recognised by an employer, and where a worker declares that he or she wants a union to negotiate pay on his or her behalf, the employer will have to accept that decision and get on with the negotiations.  It is perfectly reasonable.<\/p>  <p>  There is also an obligation on the State.  For example, the HSE is refusing to recognise the National Ambulance Service Representative Association branch of the Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland.  This is based on the ludicrous argument that it is not a member of ICTU.  That is the branch's right and entitlement, but it has a valid negotiating licence.  There is no good reason that the HSE cannot negotiate with the union that workers, including ambulance drivers, paramedics and related staff, want to represent them.  This situation needs to be addressed, as there is no good reason for the HSE to adopt such a position.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State's objections do not stand up to much scrutiny.  There is no constitutional or logical obstacle to the Bill.  If an employer is happy to engage in collective bargaining, then why can it not be with a union, an organisation that is truly independent?

It is not just our perspective, as the facts speak for themselves.  It will always put big banks ahead of struggling mortgage holders, the greedy landlord ahead of the hard-pressed rent payer, and an unscrupulous employer ahead of a disadvantaged and victimised worker.  Over the past ten years, worker after worker has fought for his or her rights.  In terms of legislation, what did the Government do after the Vita Cortex dispute in Cork?  Nothing.  After Waterford Crystal workers had to take the Government through the courts for their pension rights, no changes were made.  Think of workers in La Senza, GAME and Clerys.  The Government set up a review panel to consider what to do.  We had to produce legislation, but the Government voted it down despite the fact that it was the Government's review panel that made those very recommendations.  Recently, Debenhams workers have become the victims of a weakness in legislation and the base instincts of Fine Gael, which are Toryism and Thatcherism.  Fine Gael will always side with big business, banks, landlords and unscrupulous employers against ordinary working people.<\/p>  <p>  There is only one thing worse than a Tory Fine Gael Deputy, and that is a two-faced Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy.  Many Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies have stood on picket lines with Debenhams workers in recent weeks.  They had selfies taken with them.  The same thing happened during the earlier Clerys dispute and many other disputes.  They had the brass neck to turn up at those disputes time and again to give tea and sympathy only to enter this Chamber when legislation was proposed and vote it down.  That is the harsh reality of what Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have done.<\/p>  <p>  Time and again, I have produced legislation, as has my party.  In this instance, Deputy Munster has introduced a Bill to improve the lot of workers.  Every time I come to the Chamber, I have some hope that Fine Gael will do something for workers, but every time there is a reason it cannot.  The Minister of State referred to the voluntary system.  This Bill would not change that.  Rather, it would give someone the option to be represented by the trade union of his or her choice.  That is all it does.  Imagine if a party in this House were to say that someone could not have the right to be represented by a solicitor or barrister of his or her choice.  There would be an uproar, yet the Minister of State and the Government believe it is okay for some workers not to be represented by a trade union of their choice.<\/p> <p>That beggars belief but it is only more of the same old, same old from Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  I came to the conclusion a long time ago that the Minister of State's party represents a cosseted and privileged class.  That is why I could never vote for Fine Gael and would never give the party a transfer on the ballot paper, because I know what side it is on.  Politics is about division and choices and whose side one is on.  I know what side the Minister of State's party is on.  I am firmly of the view that nothing will change until we have a different type of government and a Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation like Deputy O'Reilly, who fought for workers' rights in the trade union movement for many years.  Unless we have a Minister of her calibre, or one from among the progressive parties of the left in this House, we are never going to get the changes that are required for workers.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State needs to explain to us in clearer language why he cannot support this Bill.  The speech he gave tonight is the same speech I have been listening to for the past five or ten years.  It is hollow.  Some time ago, I brought forward a Bill - into which I had put a lot of effort, working with the Mandate trade union - which sought to address the issue of if-and-when contracts.  I recall a similar response from the Minister of State's party in government at that time, namely, that it could not be done.  However, in that instance, when the pressure was put on, something was eventually done, although it did not go far enough and was the typical half-baked response from Fine Gael.  The party was shamed into acting, which is what happens all the time.  Shame on the Minister of State and his party for letting workers down again by not supporting a fair and reasonable Bill that would improve their lot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800049#ZZ00400","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602176400,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I advise Deputies that there are 37 minutes left, into which I must fit four remaining speakers, five minutes for the Minister of State to respond and ten minutes for the proposer to conclude the debate.

It is timely and incredibly appropriate that we should be debating it today.  I will use some of the short time available to me to acknowledge the passing away today of Fergus McCabe, a trade unionist, organiser and man of immense standing in Dublin's north inner city.  If colleagues do not know him by name, they certainly will know him by his work.  Fergus was one of the architects of the Gregory deal and was involved in every single organising capacity in the north inner city, right up to his recent involvement in the Mulvey report.  I expect the Minister of State may have met him in that capacity.  Fergus was involved in the founding of Belvedere Football Club.  He developed, enhanced and brought to the fore the very idea of community organising.  His work did not just have an impact in the north inner city but set a standard that was replicated throughout the country, in drugs task forces, community policing forums and in organising communities to stand up against the oppression of drugs and the indifference of the State.  Fergus will be remembered by many people.  He taught me and many others in the north inner city the ideals and concepts of collectivism.  He encouraged us to educate ourselves, he was there when we needed to agitate and he was to the forefront whenever there was a requirement to organise.  It is incredibly appropriate, during a debate on trade union rights and collectivism, that I get to pay tribute to the man who created many of the structures that have enhanced and fortified the community in which I grew up.  I pay homage to Fergus McCabe.  He will be remembered and carried in the hearts of everybody he helped and encouraged along the way.<\/p><p>Ireland has the second highest incidence of low pay in the EU, affecting 23% of workers in 2019.  By contrast, last year also saw Ireland register the highest growth in domestic product in the Union for the third year in a row.  Recent research by Oxfam indicates that Ireland has the fifth largest number of billionaires <i>per capita<\/i>in the world.  These statistics are not unrelated to the fact that we have such a poor level of trade union rights.  Rather than damaging our economic competitiveness, collective bargaining enhances it.  Ireland is ranked 24th in the global competitive index, lagging behind countries such as Austria, Belgium, France, Denmark, The Netherlands and Finland, to name but a few, in which there are much higher levels of collective bargaining.  Ireland is unusual in the European context in that employers are not legally obliged to engage with trade unions to negotiate pay agreements or other conditions of employment.  This explains our much lower levels of collective bargaining coverage.  We are simply way out of line with European norms in this area.<\/p><p>Article 40.6 of the Constitution sets out the right of citizens to form trade unions or associations.  Unfortunately, this only protects an individual's right to join a trade union; it does not confer a right to be represented by one for collective bargaining purposes.  The Social Democrats are proud to give our support to this Bill.  We hope that it passes but, if not, we will continue to fight to ensure its provisions are enacted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800050#AAA00300","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1602176400,"counter":347,"content":"<p>It is refreshing that a number of Private Members' Bills and motions dealing with the issues we are discussing this evening have been put forward by Opposition parties and groups, including the Social Democrats, Sinn F&eacute;in, Solidarity-People Before Profit and the Labour Party.  I have made a number of speeches on these issues in the House in recent months.  That is to be welcomed.  As previous speakers noted, there is a direct correlation between the fact that our economy is underpinned by poverty pay - with 23% of Irish workers on low pay, according to the OECD, and 40% of young people in insecure work - and the fact that collective bargaining regulations in this country give employers a veto.  The current provisions have been described by the trade union movement as offering the possibility of joining a golf club without being allowed to play golf.  I wish the Government would understand that there is a direct link between poverty pay, poor pay, exploitation and vulnerable work and the lack of trade union rights and collective bargaining rights.  The two absolutely are linked and that is why we will continue to bring forward motions regarding sick pay, insecure work, poverty pay, low pay and collective bargaining.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State's party leader became leader of Fine Gael on the strength of his view that the rights of essential workers to engage in industrial action should be restricted.  Some time later, he is leading the cheering for those same workers when it has been proven how important they are.  It is not necessary to have these adversarial, over-and-back debates in this House between Government and Opposition.  We do not have to drive a wedge between us and play the pantomime villain and pantomime hero on the issue of workers' rights.  What is at stake is extremely important.  People in this country are going to work even if they are sick because they are worried they will otherwise lose their jobs.  We do not have statutory provisions in this country that other European countries take for granted.  In fact, Ireland is one of only five European countries that does not offer statutory sick pay.<\/p>  <p>  Even though it may be imperfect, we support the Bill that is before the House this evening.  I know Ministers are handed scripts by civil servants or from the Attorney General's office that poke holes in things.  The Government needs to understand that trade unionism is good for living standards and for business.  It is good for the economy that workers are protected and empowered in their workplace.  We cannot go back to an economic model under which too many workers are poorly paid and vulnerable.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Gannon spoke very eloquently in his tribute to Fergus McCabe.  Given the issues we are debating, it was my intention, in coming to the Chamber, to speak about Fergus and his legacy.  I have spent time in the north inner city and I know he was the type of man whose trust one would never want to lose.  If one ever did lose the trust of somebody like Fergus, one would know one was doing something wrong.  He had an interest in everything, including music and football.  As Deputy Gannon noted, Fergus was one of the founding members of Belvedere Football Club and he was also a fan of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.  It would be wonderful if Matt Doherty, a former Belvedere footballer and current Spurs player, were to do the business tonight for the Republic of Ireland in Fergus's memory.<\/p> <p>There was not a cause he ever gave up on.  There was no individual he ever gave up on.  He spoke passionately about the drugs issue for generations.  He wrote the Gregory deal some 40 years ago and still spoke as passionately this year as he did in the early 1980s about housing, employment, drugs and education, as Deputy Gannon said, and always with a glint in his eye, always close to having a chuckle on his lips.  Fergus was always articulate and forthright.  It was his birthday this week.  He was 71 years of age.  It breaks my heart to think that we have lost so many good, decent and articulate people in that part of the world who were speaking to a better future.  More recently, Fergus spent much time with young people from immigrant backgrounds, speaking to their reality and trying to find ways to empower them.  It is appropriate, on a night like this, that the national Parliament would hear of the memory of Fergus McCabe.  We will not get a chance to go to his funeral.  We will not get a chance to say these words in a church or other place where normally we would do these things.  When a person has worked so hard for those who needed him so much, for so many years, then D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is an appropriate place to speak of the name Fergus McCabe.  I am delighted that Deputy Gary Gannon did so and I am delighted to join with the Deputy to pay tribute to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800050#AAA00400","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602177000,"counter":349,"content":"<p>We can all empathise with the words just expressed.

From my perspective we are also dealing with the realities of the Border.  I call on the Minister of State to bring again to Government the fact that there will be a need for an all-Ireland response in the very short term.  We will also need to ensure that we have the supports that businesses, families and everyone require into the future.  We do not know exactly what the future will hold with the pandemic.  We have had a changing narrative in the last days.<\/p>  <p>  I commend Deputy Munster on the Bill.  Collective bargaining and union recognition is an absolute necessity.  Deputy Munster has been absolutely to the fore with regard to the workers at Premier Periclase where we have an almost William Martin Murphy-esque busting of trade union-type operations.  This Bill is what we need to give protections to workers.<\/p>  <p>  In May in my town of Dundalk there was the announcement by National Pen of more than 170 job losses.  The problem was that some of these jobs were actually being advertised on Tunisian websites before the job losses were announced.  This is the reality that some workers have to deal with.  As it relates to this Bill, those workers who dealt with management from the point of view of negotiating their exit were not allowed to be represented by union representatives.  People were being dealt with on an individual basis.  These were people who may not have been greatly experienced in negotiations and they were going up against an American multinational with a top-tier management team with years of experience.  That is the disparity and the weakness.  It is the David and Goliath.  I call on the Government to see right by these workers and to give them that little step up and that little bit of protection.  Otherwise, we will have what we have, which is the memory of William Martin Murphy in operation.  We need those protections that have been fought for in the State, and long before the State was ever created, by the likes of Jim Larkin and James Connolly.  That is what we need to see.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800051#BBB00300","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1602177000,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Imelda Munster and her team for putting forward the Bill and for the discussion around it.  While I might not agree on the necessity for it, it is still no harm to have the discussion and to go through it.<\/p>  <p>  It is wrong, however, to portray this Government, including my party and our role in the Government, as being against improvements in workers' rights and conditions.  That is absolutely not the case.  There is a consistent effort by Sinn F&eacute;in and other speakers to portray the T&aacute;naiste, my party leader, as someone who does not believe in improving workers' rights when all his actions have proven the opposite to that.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste has consistently made the right progress when it comes to parental leave, parental benefits, illness benefit and the changes that were driven during his time as Minister for Social Protection and during his work as Taoiseach working with other Ministers for social protection.  In the T&aacute;naiste's first few weeks in the job in this Department he very clearly set out that the State's role would change when it comes to implementing a statutory sick pay scheme.  All of us have called for it for years and we have all talked about it, but he has stepped up, is going to do it and has started the process.<\/p>  <p>  This portrayal or some other impression of the T&aacute;naiste is the wrong one.  It is a dishonest one that Sinn F&eacute;in keeps peddling.  The public will judge that and will recognise the T&aacute;naiste for the work he is trying to do and the efforts he makes.  I look forward to working with the T&aacute;naiste on this agenda in the years ahead and we will make progress in improving workers' rights and conditions, while also recognising the balance and the importance of being able to create jobs and to have an environment in the State where jobs can be created and which attracts investment.  It is about the balance.<\/p>  <p>  Members of Sinn F&eacute;in repeatedly and consistently, and certainly Deputy Cullinane, try to portray my party as being on one side or the other, and we are not.  We are about balance and working for people's rights in this country and for the public interest.  As a party we have consistently proven that through all our history.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Durkan, would be much better than I at portraying our party's history, but I can certainly say that when in government and on behalf of our party that is what we aim to do, and we work constantly to improve getting the balance right.<\/p>  <p>  This constant thing that we are pro-landlord and against the tenant is not true.  It is not borne out by work over the past four or five years, which I worked on with the former Ministers, Deputies Coveney and Eoghan Murphy, on the housing agenda.  Nearly every piece of legislation we brought into the House was more pro-tenant than anything else, and tried to strengthen tenants' rights, and rightly so.  Deputies should not come in here and tell me it is the opposite and that we are pro-landlord.  That is not the case.  Housing is a work in progress.  I never claimed that it was completely fixed.  It is certainly in a much improved space than it was four or five years ago, and is on the right track to being fixed permanently once and for all.  That was led by a Fine Gael-led Government.  This portrayal that we are against the tenant is not true.  Repeatedly the accusation is made that we are against housing, social housing or affordable housing.  Again, the track record does not prove that.  Fine Gael brought the delivery of social housing to the highest it ever was in the State.  This is on record and is proven.  We were committed to it and we committed taxpayers' money to it.  I recognise the taxpayers' role.  It is their money and our job is to make sure it is spent in right way and under the right conditions.  Of course we would like to do more but the constant portrayal that we are against that is not borne out by fact.  People are beginning to see through that also and we will work on that.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to banks, mortgage holders and protections for people's homes, I have listened for many years to claims that there was going to be tens of thousands of people shoved out of their houses by the banks.  That did not happen because Fine Gael-led Governments did not let it happen.  They put in place many protections to protect the family home for those who could not pay but wanted to pay and who made every effort.  They were protected but consistently in here the opposite impression was given.  The facts do not bear that out.  This does not mean that there were not some sad cases that came through the courts, of course there were.  I wish there was not.  The portrayal that tens of thousands of people would be put out of their houses did not actually happen under our watch, because we did not let it.<\/p>  <p>  The current Government and its programme for Government is committed to strengthening that position again for workers' rights.  It is about getting that balance right because we also want investment and we want people to be able to get mortgages at the right price.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to add to the comments on Fergus McCabe, who was well recognised for his role in Dublin's inner city.  Most Members in the House would have known him and dealt with him.  I extend my condolences to his family and friends and, importantly, to his community which he served for many years.  I remember when he challenged the then leader of Fine Gael, former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, to really deliver long term for the north inner city.<\/p> <p>Enda Kenny responded to that with the Mulvey report, the implementation body and a commitment to long-term intervention.  Fergus McCabe acknowledged that there were some short term improvements but he demanded there be medium and long term commitments too, and rightly so.  That is now happening in the north inner city.  I remember being at events and repeating that it was important that we did not just have two or three years of quick wins and that long-term intervention was needed.  Fergus McCabe and many others have worked for that over a long number of years.  I am not saying that the Mulvey report will solve everything but it certainly focused many Departments on an area that needed extra focus.  Many have come into this House and called for similar approaches to be taken in other towns and villages, including Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan and elsewhere.  That is what we are trying to do but Fergus McCabe and many others led the way in terms of that work and were ahead of many people in terms of what they were calling for in their area.  <\/p> <p> Lastly, I am not sure what is behind it but there have been some veiled attacks here on our current unions and the work they are doing.  Those unions have served our country quite well and I am not sure what Sinn F&eacute;in and others, including Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, are at in that regard.  They are trying to sneakily undermine the work of the unions.  I am not sure of their agenda, and that is up to them, but I want to call it out for what it is.  There have been veiled attacks on the unions by some in here tonight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800051#BBB00400","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602177600,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Not by Sinn F&eacute;in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800052#CCC00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1602177600,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I am going just to nail this; there is nobody on the Sinn F&eacute;in benches that is anti-trade union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800052#CCC00300","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1602177600,"counter":355,"content":"<p>The Deputy should check the speeches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800052#CCC00400","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1602177600,"counter":356,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is looking at a lifelong trade union activist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800052#CCC00500","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1602177600,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I know that.

It is never the right time to legislate to facilitate trade union recognition.

When the Minister of State talks about balance, is he referring to &euro;2,000 for Deputies and ten cent for low paid workers?  Is that his idea of balance?  That is not balance.  We live in a very imbalanced society and we can see that clearly.  One of the most shocking statistics arising from this pandemic is the fact that when tens of thousands of people were laid off from their jobs there was not a massive decrease in the tax take.  What does that tell us?  It tells us that people are not earning enough to pay tax.  They are working all the hours God sends in the country that the Minister of State governs but they are not earning enough to pay tax.  They are trying to keep body and soul together.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in says that Fine Gael is on the side of landlords because all of the evidence suggests that.  We say that the Government is not on the side of workers because all the evidence suggests that too.  We make no apologies to the Minister of State, to his leader or any member of his party or his Government for standing up for workers' rights.  It is wrong to say that we have characterised trade unions as weak because we have not done so.  There is no disputing the fact, however, that trade union density is declining and that suits the Minister of State, his Government and people on the right.  It does not suit us and it does not suit workers so we will work to create the conditions to ensure that trade unions can organise and that the voluntarist system, where it does not work, is strengthened.  We will also work to ensure that where there are to be legal protections, those protections work in favour of working people.  We will not apologise to the Minister of State, his leader or members of his party or his Government for doing that.  We have been consistent; consistently on the side of workers and those who have been battered by the policies of this and previous Governments.  The evidence is all around us.  When the Minister of State goes outside he will see people racing to a drop-off with refrigerated bags on their backs.  This is happening in  modern Ireland - imagine that.  People are racing to the next drop but they are entrepreneurs, they are self-employed.  They can just download an app and will be like Michael O'Leary one day.  They are starting their own one-man businesses.  The Minister of State should look around him and see what is happening.  We need strong trade unions and it is our job, as legislators, to create the conditions for trade unions to organise, not to organise for them.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Funchion and I are two of the few Deputies in this House who have worked with the Industrial Relations Act but if the Minister of State does not want to take our word for it, he should talk to the trade unions.  They will tell him what they need.  They will tell him where the Act needs to be strengthened.  That is what we are doing; we have begun and are continuing the process of speaking directly to trade unions and workers.  It is disingenuous to suggest that we came in here to attack trade unions or trade unionists because we have not, would not and do not.  The Minister of State knows that and to suggest otherwise is extremely disingenuous.  I would have expected it of other people in his party but not of him.

The suggestion is always that the sky will fall in upon us and there will be economic chaos.  The response is always overblown when it comes to anything that might, God forbid, help ordinary people to help themselves.<\/p>  <p>  When one looks at every single social and economic crisis in this State over the past 80 years, one must ask how many have been caused by trade unions or by ordinary people.  The answer is none.  We stand here in 2020 in the middle of a whole series of crises.  There are crises in housing, health, child support and cr&egrave;ches.  There is a crisis in the provision of services for people with disabilities and of home care packages and home help hours.

How many of these crises were caused by trade unions?  Again, the answer is none.  Our problem lies with this State and successive Governments bending over backwards for developers, landlords, tax avoiders and bankers who are allowed to do whatever they want while the rest of us suffer the consequences.  <\/p>  <p>  The truth is that no employer ever went broke by talking to trade unions.  Support for this Bill would not cost the Government one cent of public money because this is a rights issue.  The Minister of State knows that it is a rights issue and that it would not cost the Government a single cent to support this legislation.  The fact that it is a rights issue is the reason the Government will not support it.  Does the Government consider it important for ordinary workers to have the same rights as every other worker across the EU or does it want to continue to deny workers the right to have their employer recognise their union through collective bargaining negotiations?  It is that simple and the Minister of State's answer tells us that the Government wants to deny workers that right.  The Minister of State seems to think that the Irish people do not keep abreast of the laws that the Government passes or the rights that it rejects but he is wrong because they do.  Last February was a clear indication that they do pay attention to the laws the Government passes, the rights it grants and the rights it rejects. <\/p> <p>If ever there was an appetite for change, if last February told the Government anything, it should be to listen to the people.  The people out there, workers and their families, clearly see that the Government is refusing tonight to give workers the same rights as other workers across the EU.  To them, that sends a chilling message that the Government wants to keep workers down.  There is no point in having a right that cannot be expressed.  It is time the law was changed fully.  Sometimes, it is good to give this Government the benefit of the doubt in the hope that it will actually do the right thing.  As I said, it would not have cost one single cent to support them but the Government could not bring itself to do it.  Why?  It is because it is a rights issue, in particular a workers&rsquo; rights issue.  If it was bankers, developers, tax avoiders and landlords, the Government would be tripping over itself to say, &ldquo;How can we help you?  What can we do?  What legislation can we bring in to assist you?&rdquo; <\/p> <p> The Minister of State said earlier the Government is working to improve rights.  How can he seriously stand there and say that?  It is costing the Government no money to support this but it would give workers the right to have their trade union involved and be recognised in collective bargaining.  It would ensure that the employer recognised the right of a worker to say, &ldquo;I want that trade union rep to represent me in my workplace.&rdquo;  However, the Government cannot even bring itself to do that.  It begrudges something that costs it nothing.<\/p> <p> If people are watching in, they will just say it is the same old same old.  The Government just does not have it in itself to stand up for workers.  They are not on its radar.  We know who is on its radar, but Irish workers and their rights to trade union representation, collective bargaining and ensure the employer recognises their rights is not on its radar.  It would not help the big boys in business, would it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800052#CCC01100","speaker":"1497","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602178200,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1602178200,"counter":365,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 80(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Tuesday, 13 September 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800053#DDD00300","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602178200,"counter":366,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 7.23 p.m. and resumed at 7.43 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Covid-19: Statements","time":1602178500,"counter":367,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800054#FFF00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1602178500,"counter":368,"content":"<p>T&aacute;imid chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le Uimh. 12a, r&aacute;iteas &oacute;n Aire Sl&aacute;inte agus ceisteanna agus freagra&iacute; maidir le Covid-19.

This came into effect at midnight on Tuesday for three weeks.  The decision was not made lightly.  I am acutely aware of the costs of these decisions to individuals, families, communities and businesses.<\/p>  <p>  The level 3 measures in place are the same as those in place in Donegal and very similar to those put in place in Kildare, Laois and Offaly in August.  I will now outline the measures under level 3 of the framework.  People may meet up with no more than six others from one other household.  A maximum of 25 guests are allowed at weddings.  There are to be no indoor organised events although gatherings of up to 15 for outdoor events are allowed.  Groups of up to 15 may engage in outdoor non-contact training and individual training is allowed indoors.  No matches or other sporting events may be held with the exception of professional, elite and intercounty sports, club championships and horse racing.  All must be held behind closed doors.  Individual training in gyms, pools and leisure centres is allowed.<\/p>  <p>  Religious services are to move online and up to 25 people may attend at a funeral.  There is to be no indoor dining or service in restaurants or pubs while up to 15 may be served outdoors.  The one exception to this is wet pubs in Dublin, which are to remain closed.  Hotels, guesthouses and bed and breakfast accommodation must limit services to residents.  Indoor cultural venues are closed.  <\/p>  <p>  People should attend work only if absolutely necessary and work from home where possible.  People should stay within their own counties except for work, education and other essential purposes.  Public transport should only be used when necessary.  Schools, colleges and childcare facilities are to remain open.  Healthcare facilities also remain open.  Visiting in care homes is suspended except in critical and compassionate circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  These are difficult measures to follow.  For a number of weeks in August, the people of Kildare, Laois and Offaly lived with a set of measures very similar to those under level 3.  This was not easy but because of their work, commitment, solidarity and determination, Covid-19 was pushed right back down in these counties.  The people of Donegal and Dublin have been living with level 3 measures for several weeks and they too will attest to these measures being difficult.  It is too early for the measures to have reduced the number of identified positive cases in Donegal but we are seeing an impact in Dublin, where the growth rate of cases has been brought right down.<\/p>  <p>  The Government and agencies across the State are acting in many other ways in response to Covid as well.  Additional funding has been sanctioned for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to support enforcement.  Testing and tracing is being further strengthened.  Additional technologies, including antigen testing, are being examined.  Remote learning is being increased for higher education.  Additional business supports have been introduced and additional funding for nursing homes has been sanctioned.  We have a launched a &euro;600 million winter plan to help protect patients and our health services.  This plan includes funding for approximately 900 hospital or acute beds, 500 sub-acute beds, 5 million home care hours and much more.<\/p> <p>We are doubling the public health workforce.  The Government has followed much of the advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, including the framework itself, the recommendations for additional enforcement, the recommendations for additional inspections and communications and, indeed, the recommendation to increase nationally from the level we were at.  Colleagues will be aware that while the Government decided to move to level 3, NPHET recommended moving to level 5.<\/p> <p> Correspondence from and public statements by most political parties are in line with the decision by the Government not to move to level 5 from midnight on Monday last.  The Government believed that the conditions in the framework for moving to level 5 had not all been met.  Three days earlier, which was the Thursday, NPHET had met and advised the Government to keep Dublin and Donegal at level 3, and the rest of the country at level 2.<\/p> <p> The HSE confirmed to the Government that it has sufficient capacity to manage existing cases of Covid-19 and it is not projecting any immediate difficulties in this respect.  The Government would also like to see more detail on options for the end of a four-week period at level 5.  In its decision, the Government considered the health, social and economic consequences of a move to level 5 at this time.  We noted that Israel is the only country currently following such a strategy.  We concluded that the best way forward was to follow the advice from NPHET on enforcement, communications, and increasing nationally the framework level, and to do so at level 3 rather than level 5.<\/p> <p> Countries across Europe are seeing an increase in cases, and these countries are also taking action.  Ireland is currently mid-table in Europe.  European countries with higher rates include Spain, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and Denmark.  As colleagues will be aware, cases are rising fast in Northern Ireland.  We are in communication at official and political levels on how best to co-ordinate our responses on the island of Ireland.<\/p> <p> There has been discussion today about the chronology of events over the weekend.  I received a text message around lunchtime on Saturday from the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, to say he had called a meeting of NPHET for the following day.  I texted the Taoiseach to let him know.  Early Sunday morning, I texted the CMO requesting a call before NPHET met.  On the back of that, the CMO and I spoke.  We discussed the current situation and the possibility of moving to level 4.  I conveyed my belief that it was important that NPHET adhere to the parameters set out in the framework for each level.  I contacted the Taoiseach afterwards.  Around 7 p.m., I took part in a video call with the CMO, the deputy CMO and the Secretary General.  That is when I was informed of NPHET's recommendation to move to level 5.  I updated the Taoiseach after that call.  A Cabinet Covid-19 committee was convened for noon the following day, and the Cabinet also met later on that Monday.<\/p> <p> I would like to provide my colleagues with an update on the epidemiology.  As of today, the 14-day prevalence rate per 100,000 of the population is 128.  Just two weeks ago, it was 76.  Counties with the highest rates now are Donegal at 319, Monaghan at 257, Clare at 183, Longford at 169 and Roscommon at 166.  A total of 506 cases were notified today, with 35% coming from a close contact of a confirmed case.  A total of 492 new clusters were notified in the past week, to 3 October.  The latest estimate, calculated yesterday, for the R-nought number is 1.2.  It is important to note that regardless of what level Ireland had moved to this week, case numbers and hospitalisations would continue to rise for several weeks.  This is because it takes several weeks for the measures to impact on confirmed cases and hospitalisations.<\/p> <p> We now have the opportunity to arrest the spread of Covid-19 throughout our country.  This means all of us must follow the measures in the framework.  It means following the basics of hand washing, face coverings and social distancing.  It means reducing our contacts.  Earlier this year, we flattened the curve right across Ireland.  In August, the people of Kildare, Laois and Offaly did the same.  Right now, people in Dublin and Donegal are working hard to do it again.  Our request is that, once more, we all step up, we all follow the measures, and we suppress this virus.  I believe that, once again, we will be more than up to the challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800054#FFF00300","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602178800,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his contribution.

I am assuming that call was not about the sporting events that took place the day before.  That call was about the CMO's serious concerns regarding the spread of Covid-19, his deep concerns about the contraction of the virus and the number of cases throughout the State.<\/p>  <p>  For the first time, today in the D&aacute;il, we have learned that on that phone call the CMO and the Minister did have a discussion regarding added restrictions.  What the Minister said is that he and CMO talked about the possibility of moving to level 4.  That is the first time I have been made aware of that fact, and I assume that it is the first time that people in this House have made aware of it as well.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to ask the Minister to respond briefly to my questions.  When the CMO put it to him that he was so concerned that he might recommend going up one level or more, was there any pushback from the Minister?  Did the Minister say to the CMO at that stage that that would be unacceptable or problematic?  Did the CMO have any sense that doing that would be a difficulty or a challenge for the Government?  I ask that because the impression that was given for 48 hours after that phone call was that NPHET had gone on a solo run and had bounced the Government.  From the Minister's statement tonight, it clearly looks like that was not the case.<\/p>  <p>  In fact, the Minister went on to state that in his response to the CMO he asked that NPHET stick to the parameters set out in the framework for each level.  The Government's plan and the framework allows for five levels.  Did the Minister, therefore, at any time during that call on Sunday morning, before the NPHET meeting, say to the CMO, when there was talk of added restrictions, that that was going to be a big difficulty for the Government?  Following that phone call on Sunday morning, did the Minister inform the Taoiseach of that call?  Did he inform the Taoiseach that there was a discussion in the call about added restrictions and the possibility that NPHET might recommend going to level 4 or level 5?  I will give the Minister a minute to respond to those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800055#GGG00500","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1602178800,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Deputy Cullinane cannot decide what length of time that the Minister is going to have.

The meeting of NPHET was convened by the CMO on Sunday, out of the normal cycle of NPHET meetings on Thursdays, something which the acting CMO had done from time to time when the CMO was away.  That is what the CMO did, and he was absolutely within his rights to do that.  Indeed, if he chooses to convene NPHET again this Saturday, Sunday or Monday, that would be his right.  Nobody tries to influence when NPHET meets other than the CMO and NPHET itself.<\/p>  <p>  I outlined what the CMO and I discussed.  Did I try to influence the recommendations coming from NPHET?  Of course I did not.  I would never have done such a thing.<\/p> <p>NPHET's job is to provide the best public health advice it can to the Government.

The Minister is now telling the D&aacute;il that on Sunday, before NPHET met, there was a discussion about going to level 4 and possibly further.  The Minister says he did not try to influence NPHET, which is right, but the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste said that they were caught on the hop and that the first they heard of it was when they received the letter after the meeting on Sunday.  That is patently untrue.  The fact of the matter is that the CMO did everything possible, as far as I can see, by relaying the information to the Minister for Health, being very clear about the situation of the spread of the virus, and talking to the Minister about the possibility of added restrictions.  Yet the following day, on national television, the T&aacute;naiste talked about being bounced.  Today in this Chamber he said, in response to my colleague Deputy Doherty, that he had no inkling about added restrictions until he got a briefing after the NPHET meeting.  That is clearly not the case.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister did not answer the question I put to him.  When he and the CMO had the discussion on Sunday morning, prior to the NPHET meeting, and talked about added restrictions and the possibility of going to level 4, did he relay that information to the Taoiseach at that point and was it given to the T&aacute;naiste?  When we had all the controversy surrounding the T&aacute;naiste's interview on RT&Eacute; and the perception that NPHET went on a solo run ahead of the Government and had not briefed it on what it was doing, why did the Minister not put these telephone calls with the CMO into the public domain for 24 hours?  We are only hearing today in the Chamber that the Minister did have a discussion about added restrictions.  That was a failure on the Minister's part and a fracture has occurred over recent days between the Government and public health officials because of the mishandling of the situation.  Reference has been made to there being poor communication between the Government, the CMO and NPHET, but it strikes me that that was not the case.  The poor communication was on the Government's side, between the Minister and the Taoiseach, the Minister and the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister and his partners in government.  Will he answer the question I have put to him?

We are living under very serious level 3 designations throughout this country and have been living with them in Dublin and Donegal for some time.  There are serious restrictions in place and we understand that.  Paul Reid was on the \"Six One\" news tonight and NPHET, the Government and the HSE are all in agreement that this is a time of great concern.  The public are also greatly concerned.  Since cases started to creep back up in mid-August, there has been a sense of impending doom and dread that we are being pulled back towards a number of cases that will lead our health service into real distress, if not crisis.  Many people have been tested and many have been found to be positive.  People have again started to die in increasing numbers.  Yet here we are at the last knockings of a weekly D&aacute;il sitting, discussing the fallout from yet another episode of absolute calamity based on the failing or flawed relationships at the top of our Government.  We are partaking in some kind of Agatha Christie type mystery as to who said what, when, to who and why.<\/p>  <p>  As I was preparing for this debate today, I wondered whether we needed to discuss this because my constituents, family and friends are all looking forward and asking where are we going next.  However, we need to discuss what happened last weekend and get some answers because it will have massive implications for the confidence the people have in the Minister, NPHET, the Taoiseach, and the T&aacute;naiste, who I believe has played a particularly foul role in this sad mini-affair in the midst of this awful crisis.  The credibility of those at the peak of the Government is at stake.<\/p>  <p>  In the Minister's statement, he said he received a text from the CMO around lunchtime on Saturday saying he was calling a meeting for Sunday.  The Minister then texted the Taoiseach.  However, he did not call the CMO until Sunday morning.  He says it is not unusual for NPHET to call unscheduled meetings but this was Tony Holohan, coming back to work two days early.  He is a titan of this pandemic who has more trust from the public than all of us in this Chamber, present or absent, put together.  He was coming back and he was calling a meeting.  Why did the Minister of State not call him on Saturday?  My inclination would have been to pick up the phone and have a conversation with him.  It sounds like the Minister got that text and texted the Taoiseach.  That might seem a relatively minor thing but it is an important point.  Then, late Sunday afternoon or in the evening, the Minister was informed through videoconference that NPHET was recommending level 5.  When did the Minister see this infamous letter?  Was it before, during, or after that video call?  It was the leaking of that letter that caused absolute panic among the public, as whoever leaked it should have known.<\/p>  <p>  In a press conference today, the Taoiseach gave the Minister the dreaded vote of confidence.  We all know what that means in a sporting framework.  He also said, as regards the leaking of this letter, that NPHET is a large committee made up of many people.  He basically said that someone from NPHET leaked the letter.  NPHET is a wide committee with many people on it, which is why I believe that not many people on NPHET would have seen that letter.<\/p> <p>There is no way, in that time, that that letter was drafted and circulated to more than 40 people for approval before it got to the Minister.  That is just not credible.  That letter would have been drafted by the CMO and perhaps one or two other people and sent to the Minister and perhaps his senior staff.

He described what happened over the weekend as an absolute calamity.  It is important that the Irish people hear a different response to that, if I may.  NPHET met on Thursday and made a recommendation to Government to stay at level 2.  On Saturday, the Chief Medical Officer was talking to various people.  He decided to call NPHET together on Sunday.  He informed me and I informed the Taoiseach.  The Chief Medical Officer and I spoke before the meeting.  I spoke to him on Sunday rather than Saturday because he had more information on Sunday.  When he texted me at around lunchtime on Saturday, the numbers for the day were not in.  I was going to talk to him and was better off waiting until he had as much information as possible.  The Chief Medical Officer and I spoke.  As soon as we spoke, I informed the Taoiseach.  NPHET met for many hours.  Afterwards, it informed me and we had a long, detailed discussion about the recommendation and why it was made.  After that, I informed the Taoiseach.  The next morning, the Cabinet Covid committee met.  Cabinet met later that day.<\/p>  <p>  We need to be careful with our words because we are asking the Irish people to make many sacrifices to suppress this virus, and I respectfully suggest to the Deputy that the sequence of events I have laid out are a reasonable account of Government and public health teams working through difficult issues over the weekend, at pace, and coming to reasoned conclusions on them.  I suggest that that is a more reasonable view of what happened.  The Deputy's first question was why I spoke to him on Sunday and I have answered that.  I can find out for the Deputy when I saw the letter.  It would have been emailed to my private secretary.  The Chief Medical Officer, the deputy chief medical officer, the Secretary General and I spoke by video call at approximately 7 p.m., at some length.  The letter is a written account of the recommendation.  We talked through all of that.

Why is it the Taoiseach has not taken up the suggestion that an all-party forum should be established so we can have across the board agreement on the right way to deal with the pandemic?  This should not be a matter for political disagreement, and the approach and strategy should be based on evidence.<\/p>  <p>  Is the Minister of the view that we need a cross-party approach?

We held that view because after fairly intense discussions with public health and infectious disease experts, they predicted where we are now, with rising infection rates all over the country.  They indicated that regardless of what the Government said, we would need to increase restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  I want to get to what annoys me about what unfolded at the weekend.  It is the manner in which the T&aacute;naiste and the Government in general tried to trash the Chief Medical Officer and undermine his credibility in a very cynical way when it was clear he was simply offering a view about the need for greater restrictions based on his fears that if those restrictions were not introduced quickly, the health position would deteriorate but so would the social and economic position.  Both employment and the wider economic position would become a bigger problem in three weeks if we did not act at that stage.<\/p>  <p>  I point this out because the T&aacute;naiste, in the most cynical way, suggested that the Chief Medical Officer did not give a damn about economic impacts, loss of employment and loss of income.  It was the really dastardly part of the attack.  The suggestion was that the Chief Medical Officer had no right to say what he did because he would not have to suffer on the pandemic unemployment payment.  That is quite ironic from a T&aacute;naiste who is part of the Government, which is cutting the payment.  He was pretending it was his concern.<\/p>  <p>  This was fundamentally dishonest because the T&aacute;naiste and the Government knew that the view of NPHET and the Chief Medical Officer, whatever one thinks of it, sought to minimise economic, social and health damage.  The Government might not have agreed with that view, and we could have an honest argument about that.

This is clearly a Government decision.  The Government cannot hide behind NPHET.  It is ignoring the public health advice.<\/p>  <p>  It struck me that in his interviews and press conference the Minister was asked if he and the Government would take responsibility for this.  He is the Minister for Health during a pandemic.  He has made a decision not to go along with the advice of public health experts.

I know the Deputy wants to ask another question but I will give him one brief example.  If we had moved to level 5 this week, it is clear that the number of cases would be lower in six weeks than if we stay at level 3.  That is the whole point of the framework.  We agree on that.  We probably also agree that if we move to level 5 for four weeks, six weeks or whatever period, there would be very serious economic consequences.  Just before coming to the Chamber I had a meeting with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform about next year's health budget.  That budget, and what the HSE and health workers around the country will do with it, will definitely save lives.  There is no simple trade-off.  The Deputy will forgive me if I misquote him, but I believe I heard him suggest that this was a trade-off between economic benefit and public health.  I promise him it is not.

Magnanimous, I know.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister and I, along with other colleagues in the House, have engaged in hearings of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  Unlike other Deputies here I am not interested in what happened last weekend.  I am interested in our strategy and where we go from here.  Without going back over where we were, the committee was very important and I am personally sorry to see it conclude without some continuing platform for the interpretation and interrogation of Covid-19 strategy.  I know this function might be taken over by the Committee on Health, but I thought we were doing a pretty good job.<\/p>  <p>  We have learned that testing and tracing are key.  In that regard, I will give the Minister a synopsis of where I think we are at the moment.  Earlier this evening I was looking at some data about the R number.  In Dublin it is probably about 1.2 and for the country at large it is about 1.5.  On that basis, incidence of the disease will double within two weeks.  We know that testing and tracing are key and that we can individually test based on symptoms, which is what we are currently doing.  We could screen test based on the indices, but we would need more capacity.  If the disease keeps on rising we cannot continue to do either without adequate testing capacity or tracing resources.<\/p>  <p>  NPHET has persevered with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR, testing only.  It has refused to look at loop-mediated isothermal amplification, LAMP, testing or antigen testing, despite it being used everywhere else in the First World.  Our border is open and air travel remains unrestricted.  Our intensive care unit, ICU, capacity is fast diminishing and other diagnostic procedures such as breast cancer and cervical cancer screening are being deferred.  As I have already told the Minister, my own hospital, University Hospital Waterford, has just one cardiac care isolation room.  The Minister kicked that question on to the HSE, which has not bothered to answer me yet.<\/p>  <p>  On top of this, numerous business sectors are also in need of intensive care and cannot continue to endure on-again, off-again business.  The T&aacute;naiste has suggested a circuit-breaker for the country in the form of a national lockdown.<\/p>  <p>  What plan does the Government or NPHET have to deliver screen testing or asymptomatic targeting as a strategic move to isolate disease clusters in individuals?  I brought antigen testing information to NPHET 13 weeks ago.  All evidence shows it could seriously augment our national testing capacity.  Why has this testing not been considered or used?  Why has NPHET not considered the use of LAMP testing, which is now in use in Germany, France and Italy?  Will the Minister commit to providing a pathway for outside medical opinion leaders to engage with NPHET on a regular basis regarding the ongoing modelling and testing it approves?<\/p> <p>Will he provide a platform for private industry to engage with NPHET on the possible roll-out of new technologies and to ensure a structured platform is developed such that follow-up analysis is communicated by NPHET to these industry leads?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800059#LLL01300","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602181800,"counter":451,"content":"<p>The latest update I have from the Chief Medical Officer tonight is that the R-number is 1.2 for the country.  Cases are continuing to rise but the R-number has come down.  On mass screening, which is also referred to as serial testing, there are several programmes under way.  There is serial testing in nursing homes, the meat processing industry and direct provision centres.  The positivity rates are very low.  The latest data indicates approximately 0.3% positivity, which is very positive, if the Deputy will excuse the pun, because it means very few of those people have it, but the  testing is catching cases.  It is catching staff who are asymptomatic and have no idea they have Covid.  It is not catching everybody who has Covid.  It cannot do so.  There is a very serious case in one nursing home which was reported in the past 48 hours.<\/p>  <p>  On antigen testing, I am delighted to be able to provide some good news.  We asked HIQA to do a technology assessment on rapid testing technologies.  That paper was considered by NPHET today.  The Chief Medical Officer, the deputy chief medical officer, the Secretary General and I met soon after the NPHET meeting and discussed this exact issue.  Where it is at now is that it is the view of NPHET that the technology must be validated.  That means that pilot schemes will be set up in which antigen testing will be run in parallel with PCR testing, which is seen as the gold standard.  I believe HIQA, NPHET and the HSE will work together to validate that.  I would like it to be very quickly validated and for our experts to believe there is a role for antigen testing.  We discussed antigen testing used in other countries.  Their view or understanding is that although other countries are using it, they are not using it as their primary test.  The PCR testing is still the way to go in that regard.  I am delighted to be able to report that progress as of today.  <\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's question regarding companies, companies do not engage with NPHET.

I raised the issue again and again with the former Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  I have called for rapid testing at airports to try to keep the country open.  According to an article published on TheJournal.ie on Wednesday, 7 October, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, stated it would take \"some time\" to adopt the so-called traffic light system after it is agreed by the European Council of Ministers on 13 October.  This is alarming.  EU Governments must work together to safely open borders and adapt their health strategies.  When that policy is approved, it should immediately be widely implemented throughout Europe so as to streamline enforcement measures, mitigate the risk of spreading Covid-19 and allow international travel within the EU in a safe and controlled environment.<\/p>  <p>  A rapid test currently available on the market gives results in just 15 minutes.  Some countries have tested these tests and approved them for use.  This is another issue I have repeatedly raised with this Government and the previous Government, but it has apparently fallen on deaf ears.  Airports can be equipped with a facility in the departure hall to test passengers before they proceed to check-in desks or security.  In the 15 minutes it takes to get a result, a temperature check and a track and trace questionnaire could be completed before the passenger leaves the facility.  If this procedure is advertised at the time of booking and the cost of the test is included in the ticket price, it would be a clever way to make people aware that they must stay at home if they show symptoms.  In addition, it would instil confidence in people that air travel has been made safer.  More and more educated people, professionals and experts, will migrate to other countries, which will deprive Ireland of knowledgeable and skilled workers with Brexit looming.  Ireland will be even more isolated from the rest of Europe and will soon be an outlier and an exception in the EU.  We do not want that to happen.  Solutions have been readily available for some time and can be implemented in days.  Putting them in place only requires a bit of vision and goodwill.  We cannot afford to discuss this any longer.  Actions need to be taken immediately.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the level of lockdown that was forced on businesses in the space of days.  I have my own thoughts about this fiasco.  In my view, the recommendation to go to level 5 was leaked so that when the level 3 restrictions were announced by the Government they would be accepted.  What is the Government doing?  It sounds like it is codding genuine people whose businesses are simply going under.  Staff in pubs, caf&eacute;s, restaurants and hotels, some of which had just reopened, are losing their jobs.  The businesses were again closed nearly two weeks to the day after their reopening.  Bars received bills for television licences, insurance and rates but they had been forced to close their doors.  Bars, restaurants and coffee shops are now being forced to close again.  Many of them will disappear.  What advice would the Minister give to business people who phone him in the early hours of the morning to tell him they cannot afford to pay any of their bills, never mind their mortgages?  The banks have put two fingers up to the Government and will not continue the moratorium.  Covid-19 is killing people who have never contracted the disease.  NPHET needs to be disbanded and reformed, with a wider variety of specialised people appointed to it in order that it understands every walk of life.  All Members know the virus can be a killer if contracted, but what NPHET and the Government do not understand is that Covid-19 is killing more people who have not contracted it than people who die from it directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800060#MMM00400","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1602181800,"counter":454,"content":"<p>A report from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, indicates that 0.0002% of all outbreaks occur in hotels and 72% occur in private homes.  I spoke this evening to the president of the Irish Hotels Federation.  It wishes to meet the Department of Health and the Department of tourism.  It is seeking an overall plan and for the Minister to tell it what it is missing, if anything.  I spoke to various hoteliers from a business point of view.  I am in business myself.  One hotelier told me that the money the hotel took in that week was only enough to cover staff's wages and that if it had not been for the wage subsidy scheme that is in place, there would have been no money to pay for food, the ESB, phone bills and the other expenses that need to be paid to keep the hotel open.  That indicates how important it is to subsidise these businesses.  When the pubs reopened there was a big scare that there would be many outbreaks within the pub system, but pubs are a controlled environment and the HPSC has indicated that more outbreaks come from private homes.  The Government is again driving people back into their homes.  A couple from County Tipperary were due to get married this Saturday in County Limerick.  After the level 3 announcement, the hotelier had to try to book the couple into a hotel in Tipperary to make sure they can get married on Saturday.  Between them, they managed it.  The hoteliers are working together.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, stated on television a few nights ago that there are 40 medical people on NPHET.  When I spoke on television afterwards, I asked how many members of the Cabinet are self-employed or from a business background.  People from the hotel, music sector and travel agency sectors wish to sit down with a member of the Government for a meaningful conversation to give their day-to-day experience.  Ministers, with their experience of being in Cabinet, could then work together to get them what they want.<\/p>  <p>What I want from the Minister this evening is a commitment that in the short term he will meet with the hotels federation.  Its president, who is from Limerick, is Ms Elaina Fitzgerald Kane of the Woodlands House Hotel.  I want a commitment that the Minister will meet and listen to them.

The <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>talks about level 4 and the Minister has talked about level 4 in his own statement.  It seems the leaks came from somewhere within the Government.  The Minister stated in response to a question earlier on that it was not him or any of his staff, but the Minister was not asked if he spoke to any journalists between the phone call from the Chief Medical Officer and 5 p.m., when the ongoing reports then started to appear, and particularly where they mention level 4 and that seems to be the only time that it has been mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800061#NNN01100","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1602182400,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I can cut to the heart of the Deputy's question and allegations.

I believe that we should have gone to level 5 and things look like we will go to level 5 in the next week or so anyway, with schools closing early for Hallowe'en.  Maybe that will not happen.  I want to tease out what the Minister said.  What are the detailed options on carrying on as we are?  I was at a meeting last week when very prominent medical people outlined what happens in Africa and so on with virus outbreaks etc. where peaks and troughs are ongoing.  They said this pandemic would be ongoing for at least two to three years.  We are looking at another two or three years at least of this cycle of lockdowns and reopening.  How is that good for our society or for the businesses that many Members have mentioned this evening?  How can we sustain things into the future like that?  Maybe NPHET has modelled it differently and the Minister thinks that this will break the back of the pandemic now.  If that is the case I would like to hear it.  That is the crux of the matter.  If we went for a full lockdown now and closed the whole thing down we could close the numbers down and then open everything back up by having proper testing and tackling the instances as they arise.  We would have to do that on an all-island basis, that would be very important.  Those are the options and that is what we should be talking about.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800062#OOO01500","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1602183000,"counter":481,"content":"<p>My apologies for interrupting Deputy Pringle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800062#OOO01600","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1602183000,"counter":482,"content":"<p>On the leak, the Deputy and I have worked together for many years and he knows I have the height of respect for him but I think the comments about the Taoiseach are unfair.

I thank all of the Deputies for their various questions.  I will finish with this.  While there has been a great deal of debate, as there always will and should be in this Chamber, none of us wants to see the country moving to level 4 or 5 because we understand the consequences of that.  We know it is possible, but I do not believe it is inevitable.  We will have an opportunity over the next few weeks to push the R number below 1.  If we do that, the virus will begin to shrink.  We will then keep pushing it back.  However, it will take every one of us embracing what level 3 means.  The vast majority of people are following the measures the vast majority of the time.  If any of us can find an extra little way of pushing that a little more, then let us do that and help one another do that.  For example, if staff really do not need to be at work, employers can work with their employees to help them work from home.  During training, let us be sure that those who need to be present are socially distanced.  Obviously enough, this means the people who are training, but also parents and others.<\/p>  <p>  To this day, the best and clearest advice I have heard came from Dr. Ronan Glynn at a press conference a few weeks ago.  He made it simple.  We have tried to keep the framework as straightforward as possible, but we are laying out five levels of measures across our entire society and economy.  With the best will in the world, that cannot be captured in a single message.  We each must look at the measures and see what we need to do at this level for our counties.  Dr. Glynn summed it up well.  At the time, the R number was 1.6 or 1.5.  He said that we had to get it below R-1 and then told us what to do, namely, to have a think about tomorrow and the coming week and where in that week we would meet people, because that is how this bloody virus spreads.  It spreads from one person to another when we are together.  The framework is in place to stop the virus.  Dr. Glynn said that, whatever number of people we were planning on meeting, be it in a friend's house, at training, at work or wherever, we should try to reduce it.  At the time, he suggested trying to halve it, which he said would bring the R number down from 1.6 to 0.8.  That would be a drop from rapid growth to negative growth.<\/p>  <p>  Before I came to the Chamber this evening, I sat down with Dr. Holohan, Dr. Glynn and the Secretary General to discuss the latest NPHET advice from today.  As I was leaving, I told Dr. Holohan that I was going to the D&aacute;il for an hour and a half of good debate and that, hopefully, some people would be watching.  I asked him whether there was any message he wanted me to try to get out from the D&aacute;il to anyone who might be watching.  He told me to just ask people to double down on this.  We are at level 3.  We all know and accept that he wants to go to level 5, which I fully respect.  He told me to ask the nation to double down on level 3.  We saw this working in the Ceann Comhairle's constituency and county.  It worked in Kildare, Laois and Offaly.  It should be more effective now, given that the entire nation is at level 3 rather than just those three counties, Dublin or Donegal.  It was harder for them because other counties did not have the same restrictions.  Level 3 applies to the full Twenty-six Counties right now.<\/p>  <p>  That is the note on which I would like to end.  There has been much talk about text messages and so on.  I firmly believe that what happened over the weekend was entirely sensible and reasonable and was the Government functioning.  When we are all considering decisions of the magnitude of moving our country to level 5 - asking people to stay at home and shutting down businesses across the country &ndash; or even level 3, there will inevitably be disagreements.  Sometimes, there will be robust debate, and there was in this instance.<\/p> <p> If we embrace the current restrictions for a few weeks, do as Dr. Holohan said and double down on the level 3 measures - the people of Kildare, Laois and Offaly showed the way and the people of Dublin are showing it now, because the infection rate has flatlined there - I believe that we can do this and we can push the virus back down.  A total of 1 million students have gone back to school and continue to go to school.  Some 250,000 students have gone back to higher education.  A lot of that activity has moved online but they are back in higher education or in it for the first time.  Something north of 400,000 people have gone back to work and moved off the PUP since the height of the first wave and since we began to open things up again.  These are things of which we should all be proud.  The hospitals are open and screening services are back up and running.  What our doctors, nurses, therapists and disability service providers are having to do to get those services back up and running is not easy but, by God, they are doing it.  We should be incredibly proud of our teachers, clinicians and business people.  Indeed, I know all of us are proud.<\/p> <p> We are capable of pushing this virus back with the current measures.  Kildare, Laois and Offaly gave us hope and showed us the way.  Dublin is doing the same now and the rest of us are more than capable of doing likewise.  Notwithstanding the debate this evening, everyone in this House wants the same thing.  We have a common enemy in Covid.  We need to work together to push the virus back, keep schools, colleges and businesses open and get the remaining businesses open, and keep the hospitals and primary care centres open.  We must work together through the winter, because it will be a hard winter in many different ways for the people we represent.  People are going to feel isolated and scared.  Businesses will struggle.  Our public services and public servants are going to struggle.  It will be a hard winter and we need to help and support each other to push this godawful virus back and open up our country, society, economy and communities as much as we possibly can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800063#PPP02000","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602184200,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I thank Members for their contributions and the Minister for his motivational remarks.
