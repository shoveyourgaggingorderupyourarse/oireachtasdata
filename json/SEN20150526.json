As line Minister for this important policy area, I look forward to his response.  I have expressed the view on more than one occasion that the bioenergy sector has been the poor relation or Cinderella of the broad renewable energy industry.  There is an apparent disregard at Department level and within the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, for the role bioenergy can play in achieving our renewable energy targets, displacing CO2 emissions, reducing imports of fossil fuels and creating jobs.<\/p> <p>For two years, the Department dragged its heels on publishing a bioenergy policy perspective.  While I am glad it has finally been produced, the delay has led to certain problems, particularly with regard to the introduction of a renewable heat incentive, RHI.  It is important for the industry to know what supports will be provided and the infrastructure around the transfer from fossil fuels, namely, oil and gas, to renewables, including biomass and bioenergy.  However, the start-up date for the scheme is given as some time in 2016.  This uncertainty and delay has had the unforeseen consequence of impeding and stalling the sector and bringing about a chilling effect.  I could refer to numerous large-scale projects that were cancelled, put on hold or are in limbo because the developers are not willing to proceed without knowing at what stage the RHI will be implemented and what terms and criteria will apply.<\/p> <p>It is in the Minister's gift to address this issue and bring some clarity to the situation, either by bringing forward the date of implementation, actually fixing an implementation date or, even at this juncture, outlining the criteria and standards that will apply when the scheme is introduced.  That would enable people to proceed with investment and advance planning for such developments.  The current uncertainty is having a negative impact on the sector and obstructing job creation in rural areas and within the regions.  The bioenergy sector has a large contribution to make.  In fact, an as yet unpublished SEAI report indicates there are 5,000 sustainable jobs to be created in the sector if it is given its head and the opportunity to grow and prosper.  Unfortunately, many of the relevant companies have relocated to the United Kingdom, which is light years ahead of us on this.<\/p> <p>We must take a more vigorous and committed approach to the sector.  We need, in the first instance, a domestic equivalent to the UK's RHI scheme.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Whelan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2361\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2361&amp;amp;pid=JohnWhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Why should we be subsidising oil and gas furnaces through the Better Homes scheme when we should be subsidising bioenergy?  As the Minister knows, once families install boilers and heating systems, there is a 20-year commitment over a system's lifetime to importing oil and gas.  This is counterproductive to the Government's objective of reaching our 2020 renewable targets, making our contribution towards addressing climate change, removing carbon from the system and creating sustainable jobs instead of importing fossil fuels.<\/p><p>As the Minister is aware, the commitment in the policy is to replace 200,000 tonnes of oil per year by 2020.  It would be a major boon to the economy if we were to do so via investing in bioenergy systems.  Will the Minister intervene in this matter?  It is within his gift.  Were clarity brought to the situation, it would help.  This has the added benefit of helping the Minister to achieve his objectives as regards the 2020 targets on renewable energy and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#C00100","speaker":"1143","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Whelan for raising this issue and I welcome the opportunity to address Senators on the topic.<\/p> <p>The Senator referred to Ireland's national renewable energy action plan, NREAP, which states that we aim to meet our overall 16% renewable energy target by 2020 by achieving 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources, as well as 10% in transport and 12% in heating.  I agree that energy from biomass has a critical role in meeting these ambitions for 2020 and beyond.  It may interest the Senator and colleagues to know that provisional figures for 2014 show that biomass accounted for 3.6 percentage points of the 8.6 percentage points delivered by renewables, representing something in the order of 40%, which is not insignificant.<\/p> <p>Recognising the potential to develop the bioenergy sector significantly and to address the challenges involved, I published a draft bioenergy plan last October.  Analysis underpinning the draft plan demonstrates that an additional bioenergy-focused measure in the heating sector would represent the most cost-effective means of meeting a number of our policy goals.  It is therefore my intention, subject to further Government approval and state aid clearance, to introduce a renewable heat incentive, RHI, in 2016.  This would encourage larger heat users to change to systems that produce heat from renewable sources.  The scheme is being designed to increase the amount of heat generated from renewable sources, including biomass.<\/p> <p>There has been no delay in developing the scheme.  Work is under way on developing its terms and conditions, the criteria and so on to which the Senator referred, including those relating to support tariffs and eligible technologies.  These must be designed appropriately in order to ensure that the objectives of the scheme are met cost-effectively.  It is important that the scheme provide maximum value for money and minimise cost to the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>The first of three public consultations which are required to be held during the development of the RHI will commence shortly.

I urge the Minister to put in place interim arrangements such as the triple E register standard, which is already in operation and approved by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, to ensure that people do not need to wait until 2016 before they can start the process of planning and seeking finance to prepare for such installations.  As the Minister stated, many commercial and industrial operators would gladly embrace this technology, which is of considerable benefit in terms of job creation.  We could embark on exemplar projects that would need to spend a great deal of time in the pipeline, such as district heating systems for clusters of buildings, hospitals, prisons and schools in Portlaoise.

I am sure work has been going on but it is a year and a half since the then Minister published draft guidelines, which were unacceptable, and there was a public consultation process after that.  Little has happened with the exception of two applications being made to the board relating to north Meath.  One is on appeal from the county council for a small development of large turbines near Nobber while the other application is by the Element power company for a massive development across north Meath.<\/p> <p>What will be in the guidelines?  RTE radio knew the other day and it had a good wind of what was happening.  It is important that Parliament should know before a leak to RTE to try to help the Government parties and the Labour Party, in particular.  We need to know whether the guidelines will be acceptable to local communities.  What I hear about 700 m will not be acceptable and there are other issues surrounding the guidelines.  What is the position on applications currently before An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  Should the developers not withdraw them, presumably to comply with the revised guidelines, or is it the case that the old guidelines will continue to apply?  No one will give a straight answer on this.  One Fine Gael Deputy in Meath East says they will not apply while another Fine Gael Deputy says they will.  The people deserve to know exactly what is going on in this regard because there should be fairness in planning.  People should know what rules will apply.  Will the Minister change the rules in the middle of the game to suit residents or will he leave the guidelines as they are to suit developers?  That is the choice the Government has to make.<\/p> <p>The 2006 guidelines are out of date and there has been criticism that Fianna F&aacute;il should have revised them previously, but the reality is the turbines proposed for north Meath did not exist during the lifetime of the previous Government.

Anyone who will speak at the hearing will have to know what are the relevant planning guidelines.  There is a planning application for another project before An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which is probably nearing decision.  We need to know and there needs to be fairness.

Planning authorities, including An Bord Plean&aacute;la, are required to have regard to my Department's wind energy development guidelines, which were published in June 2006, in making determinations on wind farm development proposals.  These guidelines provide advice to planning authorities on catering for wind energy through their development plans and the development management process.  The guidelines are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy developments and the treatment of planning applications relating to such developments.<\/p><p>As the Senator noted, in December 2013 my Department published proposed draft revisions to the noise, setbacks and shadow-flicker aspects of the 2006 wind energy development guidelines.  These draft revisions proposed the setting of a more stringent day-and-night noise limit of 40 decibels for future energy developments, a mandatory minimum setback of 500 m between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling - for amenity considerations - and the complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings.  A public consultation process was initiated on these proposed draft revisions to the guidelines and this ran until 21 February 2014.  My Department received submissions from 7,500 organisations and members of the public during this public consultation process.  It is intended that the revisions to the 2006 wind energy development guidelines will be finalised as soon as possible.  In this regard, account must be taken of the extensive response to the public consultation process in framing the final guidelines.  Further work is also advancing to develop technical appendices to assist planning authorities with the practical application of the noise measurement aspects of the wind guidelines.  The revisions to the wind energy development guidelines 2006, when finalised, will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  In the interim, the 2006 guidelines will continue to apply to existing planning applications, including those currently with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p><p>It is a matter for the relevant planning authority to make the appropriate determination in respect of a planning application or appeal, having regard to relevant planning guidelines issued by my Department.

I tabled this Commencement motion last week and coincidentally, there was a report on Newstalk this morning by Kieran Cuddihy, who obtained figures through a freedom of information request regarding national waiting times for children with mild to profound intellectual or physical difficulties who were waiting for assessment.  They showed that 12,650 children nationally are waiting for assessments of whom 3,300 are waiting for longer than the three months that is the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the Government's own benchmark.  As for children waiting for treatment, 4,500 are waiting for longer than three months, while 7,908 are waiting for treatment.<\/p> <p>At present, I am dealing with a number of families and I wish to give the Minister of State a flavour of their stories, because each individual case has its own personal story to it.  These are parents who are battling to get services for their child, who may suffer from a mild to a severe disability, be it intellectual or physical.  One such story concerned a child called Harvey, whose general practitioner, GP, referred him to the early intervention team in September 2013.  On 19 September 2013, the parents received a letter from the speech and language therapist regarding the referrals with a questionnaire attached.  On 29 November 2013, Harvey was assessed by the speech and language therapist and the conclusion in her report pertaining to autism stated that Harvey was demonstrating some clinically significant markers for autism, that this would be monitored in subsequent sessions and onward referral would be made to the autism team, as required, and with parental consent.<\/p> <p>The occupational therapist's report, which was based on an assessment carried out on 11 March and 14 April 2014, again referred Harvey on to the autism spectrum disorder, ASD, team for a diagnostic assessment.  The family was told this would happen in February or March 2014 but that date came and went.  It is now approaching June 2015 and the family still awaits that diagnostic assessment.  It had a private assessment carried out, which is accepted by the Department of Education and Skills but not by the HSE, which is the provider of the child services.  I have to hand another e-mail from other parents stating their child did not get proper support due to a significant delay in diagnosing and assessing their child.  Their son has ASD and received a private diagnosis when he was two.  While he receives appropriate resources in school, he is almost seven and the HSE only diagnosed him this year after a long road and battle.<\/p> <p>As Members are aware, early intervention is hugely important and these children have complex needs and need multiple therapies.  The question I specifically asked the Minister of State, because this is also relevant to where I come from in Waterford and is a national issue now it has been highlighted, is how many speech, language and occupational therapists are in the public system in County Waterford?  How long are children with mild to profound intellectual or physical disabilities in Waterford city and county waiting to be assessed?  There appears to be a problem with assessment waiting times and these are stories from parents of children who do not deserve to be obliged to battle the State to get support for their children.  They simply do not deserve that, as these resources should be provided as quickly as possible and under the timeframes to which the Government itself has committed.  Consequently, I raise these issues on their behalf as they have asked me to so do.<\/p> <p>Last year, 80 speech and language therapy posts were announced, not all of which were filled and none of which went to Waterford.  As another 120 further posts are to be announced, how many of those posts will be delivered in Waterford?  It is not just therapists as there also is a need for both child psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, as this is a joined-up system.<\/p> <p>The final point I will make is I visited the Sacred Heart Centre in Waterford city, where the staff provide fantastic support.  It is a joint venture between the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE but the building is dilapidated.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Cullinane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The children have complex needs and the building is not fit for purpose.  There is a real need for resources to be put into this area.  Unfortunately, due to waiting times and the lack of therapists, staff and capacity in the system, children are waiting longer than they should.  The children in question have complex needs and we should not fail them.  We should provide parents with every possible support because, as the Minister of State and I are well aware, early intervention is critical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#G00400","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I agree with most of what Senator Cullinane said, but it is important to read out his exact question, because what he said in his contribution is not exactly what he asked in writing, so I do not have the entire answer to the issues raised.  The Senator inquired about<blockquote><br \/><br \/>the need for the Minister for Health to outline how many speech and language therapist and clinical psychologist posts exist in the public system in Waterford city and county, how many are vacant, how many of the 80 posts announced last year were allocated to Waterford and how many of the additional 120 posts will be allocated to Waterford and to outline waiting times for assessment for children referred with a mild to severe intellectual or physical disability.<\/blockquote>There is no reference to the other areas of psychology to which he referred in his contribution.  That is by way of explanation, because I do not wish Senator Cullinane to say subsequently that I did not answer the entire question.<\/p><p>I thank Senator Cullinane for raising the issue.  The Government is committed to the development of therapy services for children with a disability, including speech and language therapy and psychology services.  Health-related therapy supports and interventions for children with a disability can be accessed through both the HSE's primary care services and its disability services, depending on the level of need.  Speech and language therapy services in Waterford are provided by HSE teams in primary care and disability services, as well as by the Brothers of Charity and the Central Remedial Clinic regional service.  There are currently 15 approved speech and language therapists, or 14.81 in whole-time equivalent terms, in the Waterford service overall.  Six speech and language therapists provide services to the general population of children in primary care.  Five speech and language therapists are assigned to the children's specialist disability services in Waterford.  The remainder look after adults, mental health and other needs.<\/p><p>In addition to these dedicated posts in Waterford, the Central Remedial Clinic regional service provides more specialised speech therapy for particular children with physical and sensory disability across the whole south-east region.  I understand three of the 15 speech and language posts are vacant at present in Waterford.  The filling of a permanent replacement post has been approved and a new post holder is due to take up duty next month.  The local HSE community health organisation management in Waterford has prioritised the filling of the other two posts which are temporarily vacant due to maternity leave.  I understand, however, it has proved difficult to secure appropriately qualified staff to take up these temporary positions.<\/p><p>I also understand there are currently three psychologists employed in Waterford disability services.  In addition, a number of psychologists are employed in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and in primary care services in Waterford.  The HSE has advised that 13 assessment of need applications under Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 were received in Waterford for the first quarter of 2015.  A total of 12 of those were commenced within the statutory timeframe.  A total of 22 applications, which have been on hand for over six months, are overdue for completion in Waterford.  On this point, I wish to stress that while any delay in the assessment of a child is not desirable, the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any interventions deemed necessary, and guidance to this effect has been issued to front-line staff.  I would be interested to hear from Senator Cullinane whether that is happening.  I will explain the situation in a little more detail later.  Importantly, the HSE has commenced the reconfiguration of children's disability services into geographically based children's disability network teams as part of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People programme.  The objective of the programme is to provide one clear referral pathway for all children from zero to 18 years old, irrespective of the nature of their disability or where they live or attend school.  The transition to this service delivery model is governed by a consultation and engagement process with all stakeholders, including service users and their families.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> A number of HSE community health care organisations are successfully implementing this programme, which requires significant preparatory work in engaging with families, schools and local communities.  It also involves implementing new policies, procedures and protocols in respect of multidisciplinary and multi-agency working.  Once this preparatory work has been completed, additional posts will be provided to support the implementation of the new model of service.  Waterford, which has been working with the other counties in the local HSE community health organisation area, has put in place the required governance structure to allow for the provision of additional posts in 2015.  Additional funding of &euro;4 million has been allocated to the programme in 2015, equating to &euro;6 million in a full year.  In all, 120 new therapy posts will be provided across the country in 2015 and work on finalising the specific allocation of these posts is nearing completion.  The HSE has informed me that, in this context, Waterford and the south east are being prioritised for therapy posts in 2015.<\/p><p>I will explain the reason for the parallel operation of services that sometimes occurs.  Strict compliance with the law would require a diagnosis before an intervention may take place.  It has been made clear to front-line staff - I have stated this several times in this Chamber and elsewhere - that intervention at an early age should not be delayed because a diagnosis has not yet been provided.  When a child has a difficulty with speech it should not be necessary to wait for a diagnosis before speech therapy services are provided.  Similarly, physiotherapy services should be provided to a child who lacks balance or cannot sit up.  I could rattle off a list of difficulties children may experience but it is not necessary to do so.  The necessary interventions should not hinge on the provision of a diagnosis, as occurred in the past.<\/p><p>The progressing disabilities programme for children aged from birth to 18 years has been rolled out in several areas.  It is an incredible programme which does exactly what I have described.  For example, children are not required to be signed up for a specific service or visit a particular service provider and intervention takes place in the community.<\/p><p>Once the 120 posts in this year's allocation have been provided, we will identify gaps in services and assess what further supports are needed to fill these gaps.  We have already done this in the area of mental health.  While no one denies that we are still far from where we should be, we should be able to do things better and in a more smooth manner.  The progressing disabilities programme is the way forward in this regard.  I fully agree with the approach of ensuring governance is in place before assessing which areas have the greatest need.  In that context, Waterford has been prioritised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#H00200","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State's response and the decision to prioritise Waterford city and county once the 120 new posts have been delivered.  I am concerned, however, that 22 applications have been on hand for more than six months and their completion is long overdue.  Perhaps some of the cases I cited are among this group of 22.  If I may, I will forward to the Minister of State e-mails I have received asking questions and expressing concern as they provide evidence of the heartbreaking struggle of parents.  They would also allow her to make up her mind as to whether children are receiving the treatment they need while assessments are ongoing.  From my contact with parents, including e-mails I have received, it is clear that this is not always the case on the ground.<\/p> <p>I do not wish to make a political football of this issue.  My only objective is to ensure the necessary capacity and posts are in place and the children in question receive the supports they need.  When people contact with me to tell me these types of stories I have a duty, as a public representative, to raise the issues directly with the relevant Minister. <\/p> <p>I appeal to the Minister of State to consider the case of the centre in Lady Lane, Waterford, which provides a fantastic service for children.  My view, which is one shared by many parents, is that the building in which the service is located is not fit for purpose and a new, state-of-the-art facility is required.  I am informed that children receive early intervention and support until the age of six years, at which point they lose their supports.  A holistic review of services is required and the centre in Waterford should be replaced with a state-of-the-art facility to ensure children have all the resources they need in the best possible setting.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#J00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I will examine any information the Senator forwards to me.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am not in the habit of making promises which, I suppose, the Senator knows.

I remind Members that 15,000 pensioners and members of the IASS pension scheme are suffering savage cuts to their pension benefits, which allowed Aer Lingus and the airport to wipe away a &euro;740 million pension deficit in order to fatten the company up for sale.

On 7 May, the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions produced a report stating that the direct provision system must be made subject to the Ombudsman for Children and the Freedom of Information Acts.  On 22 May, the Ombudsman for Children's report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, which will be looked at the week after next, raised specific concerns about mental health services for children in direct provision.  Yesterday, HIQA published the report of its inspection of child protection and welfare services for children living in direct provision centres.  We heard very startling reports.  Today, at the ISPCC inaugural lecture, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, talked about the cultural norm we must have of protecting all children.  We have, in a way, accepted that these children are treated differently.  In this era of equality, we need to say it is no longer good enough.  Given this focus on direct provision - I know we have a cross-party group and our group of nominees has put forward many motions on the issue - I ask the Leader to seek a commitment from the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, to introduce the working group report on improvements to the protection process, including direct provision and supports to asylum seekers, into the Seanad for debate, given our cross-party work on this issue.

Angus MacNeil, the transport spokesman, said that British Airways neglects Scotland.  It has no routes to North America.  We are trying to develop this country, yet we are handing over the national airline to an airline whose track record is not to provide services from Belfast, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham or any other region of the UK to North America.  We need that North American investment.  I am calling for the suspension of Standing Orders to make the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, come to the House and say what he is doing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sean D.

Why is a 21% share in an airline which we, the citizens, owned being given away for a paltry sum by the Cabinet today?

This is something on which Senator van Turnhout and I have been working.  It was also the subject of a Commencement debate in the House.  The Minister and the departmental officials met with Senator van Turnhout and I to try to move this forward.  Last night I was delighted to hear that the Minister had announced funding of &euro;1.3 million to provide security for at least 12 months.  However, I believe these organisations should be put on a more sustainable footing.  The Department of Health must move into this area and take over the disability and health organisations that should come under its remit.  It should put proper funding in place for them to give them security, rather than have them not knowing whether they will be in their jobs in a year's time or whether they will be able to provide a service.  Perhaps the Deputy Leader would invite the Minister for Health to the House so we can discuss it in detail.  Otherwise, this will be before the House again this time next year.  Some of us might be back here again too, although some of us might not, and we will be seeking funding again for these organisations for the future.  Now is the time to act and to put it on a more sustainable footing before then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#Q00600","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I congratulate Deputy Aylward on his re-election to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.

I also second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Barrett.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the tsunami victory that the \"Yes\" campaign achieved over the weekend.  I was very interested in the remarks made by the Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin.  As a practising Catholic, I believe that unless the Catholic Church takes heed of the seismic shift in Irish society it will decline further into the abyss.  His remarks were encouraging and acknowledged the situation in which we find ourselves.  It is important that this is done because, historically, the Catholic Church has buried its head in the sand.  I would like to see a move in the Catholic Church to a more centrist position and to an acknowledgement of how society is evolving.  If it does not do that, unfortunately, the church to which I have been attached since my childhood, and as a practising Catholic I will probably die a member of it, is certainly going nowhere and on a hiding to nothing.<\/p> <p>I also rise to acknowledge the tremendous work done by my colleague, Senator David Norris.

I admire his tenacity and his courage in holding out.  He won a very successful court case in Europe, which led to the then Minister, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, taking on board the decriminalisation of homosexuality.  At the request of the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, in 2002 and 2003, I chaired a committee on the Constitution, which was the first group to examine the whole area of the family and to recommend civil partnership.  It was a big step in that direction.  At that time I had many discussions with Senator Norris both on and off the record.  It was my view then that a referendum to change the situation at that time would probably have failed.  That was my view and it was the majority view of the committee.  It was a large committee.  I specifically requested the Taoiseach to bring on board the Independents, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Green Party.  Our work was acknowledged, but it would be remiss of me today, as the deputy leader of this group and on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il, not to congratulate the \"Yes\" side.  If any person in this country was the catalyst for change who often ploughed a lone furrow, that is Senator David Norris, and I bow to him here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#Q00700","speaker":"1127","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Before I ask for a debate, I congratulate Senator O'Donovan and the Seanad Public Consultation Committee on the farm safety report, which will be very useful.  We look forward to debating it in the House.<\/p> <p>It is less than 100 years since this country gained independence.  The momentous decision at the weekend shows how much we have moved on in that 100 years.  It has vindicated the work done by Senator Norris, Senator Zappone and many other people in this House.  With regard to the result of the by-election in Carlow-Kilkenny, I wish to congratulate my old adversary from Kilkenny County Council, my good friend Bobby Aylward, on his election to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I look forward to working with him as a constituency colleague.  I also congratulate my colleague, Councillor David Fitzgerald, who put up a good show on the Fine Gael ticket.<\/p> <p>It is with regard to the by-election and the referendum that I raise this matter.  I ask the acting Leader to request a debate on the electoral system.  It can be seen that the referendum captured the imagination of the people when one notes that more than 65,000 people registered to vote and more than 2,500 of those were in Carlow-Kilkenny, whether for the by-election or the referendum.  However, what concerns me is that in the Carlow-Kilkenny by-election there were 2,066 spoiled votes, that is, 3% of those who voted, whereas in the referendum vote the proportion of spoiled votes was 1%, over 600 votes, which is the national average.  I saw the boxes being opened because I was helping with the tally, and I saw the spoiled votes being counted and sorted.  More than 1,000 of those spoiled votes had no preference marked on the paper.  Therefore, there were people who wanted to vote in the referendum but did not offer any preference as to whom they wanted as their representative for Carlow-Kilkenny.  Besides the 1,000 papers which showed no preference, there were also spoiled votes that had the usual comments written on them.  Perhaps people are entitled to do as they wish with their vote, but in my view, young people need to be educated on how our PR system works.  As seasoned politicians, we are often baffled as to how voting preferences work.  I noted that some voting papers had 12 preferences indicated for 13 candidates.  It is important that people vote down the list on the voting paper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#R00200","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Time, please, Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#R00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Other speakers were given liberty today because it is a momentous day for this country.<\/p> <p>The elimination of the Sinn F&eacute;in candidate resulted in 9,990 non-transferable votes.

I acknowledge, too, all the citizens who voted, whether \"Yes\" or \"No\", for their engagement and the depth of their reflection on their values and on the arguments from both sides.  My Dublin South-West Yes Equality team visited approximately 25,000 households in the course of the campaign and had at least 10,000 conversations with residents on the doorstep.  I was deeply moved, time and time again, by how Irish people engaged in those conversations and showed their care for this State.  I had the wonderful opportunity yesterday to speak with our former President, Mary Robinson, about the referendum.  One of the things she said to me was that it feels like we are back to the early years of her Presidency, when there was great engagement, hope and a vision for change for Ireland, and a consideration of how we might offer that example of change to the rest of the world.<\/p> <p>I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the spokespeople for the \"No\" side, particularly those who sit on the opposite side of this Chamber.

I take this chance to express, one final time, our profound gratitude to that legal team.  It included Senator Ivana Bacik, who sits in this Chamber with me today.<\/p> <p>When we saw that the decision on this fundamental right was to move from the courts to the people, it was not easy in the beginning.  However, we came to the view that if the majority of the people were to say \"Yes\" to equality, freedom and love, it would far outweigh the import of any judicial decision, even that of the highest court in the land.

She intends to seek Government approval for the final draft of the Bill in June and the aim is to introduce it into the Oireachtas immediately thereafter so it can be enacted before the end of this term in July.  The Bill will include a provision to enable couples to convert a notification of intention to enter a civil partnership into a notification of intention to enter a marriage.

The purpose of the Bill is to consolidate, revise and modernise Ireland's existing national customs legislation, some of it dating back to the Customs Consolidation Act 1876.  The Customs Bill can thus be seen as another significant milestone in the Revenue Commissioners' comprehensive programme to consolidate and modernise our tax and duty legislation.  Senators should note, however, that this is not a standard statutory consolidation of the existing customs legislation.  Instead, it includes the two additional elements of revision and modernisation, both of which were necessary to cater for developments in trade and technology that have taken place over nearly 140 years.<\/p> <p>The principal domestic legislation under which Irish customs currently operates is the Customs Consolidation Act 1876.  This Act has been extensively adapted over the years to take account of various events and developments - for example, the foundation of the State in 1922, Ireland's joining the EEC in 1973, and the introduction of the EU Single Market in 1993.  As a consequence, many of the provisions in the 1876 Act are now of doubtful validity, yet they remain on the Statute Book.  In addition, a number of other Acts concerning customs matters were also passed in the intervening period, including the Customs Act 1956 and the Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1988.  Numerous Finance Acts have also, over the years, introduced customs measures, as have a number of ministerial regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972.  The result is a complicated, overlapping structure of both old and newer national customs legislation, which can be difficult to follow and understand.  The Customs Bill is designed to address this.  When enacted, the Customs Bill will repeal the old structure with a single, very much shorter Customs Act, which will be clear, easy to understand and easy to access, which is what we should strive for in all legislation.  This consolidated approach, which is in accordance with the requirements of Better Regulation, will result in much clearer legislation in the customs area, to the benefit of all.<\/p> <p>Senators should be aware that there is also a European dimension to this.  The European Union customs legislation - currently known as the Community Customs Code - now directly provides most of the legal framework for customs, including the rules relating to rates of customs duty in different circumstances, customs valuation, the form of declarations, and so on.  As a consequence, national legislation is needed only in respect of those areas that are not already covered by European Union legislation.  Typically, these areas include certain control provisions, enforcement powers, and sanctions for breaches of the various customs provisions. This trend can be seen in the structure, and the very much smaller size, of the Customs Bill.  The bulk of the material in the Bill reflects a small core of existing legal provisions in relation to customs, now updated to reflect modern language and terminology.  This includes certain controls and procedures that are not included in Community legislation, mainly related to arriving and departing vessels and aircraft; specifying the various offences that arise in a customs context, for the most part involving smuggling; specifying the penalties associated with these offences and the procedures to be followed in court proceedings; and providing the necessary powers to customs officers to enforce customs law.<\/p> <p>The Bill also includes a number of administrative and housekeeping provisions, among them the repeal and revocation of a large body of existing legislation, much of it of old vintage, which will become redundant upon the enactment of the Bill and its subsequent commencement as the Act.  Similarly, the Bill provides for the meeting of a number of specific EU and international customs obligations relating to mutual assistance between Ireland and other member states, to controls of cash entering or leaving the European Union through the State, and to centralised customs clearance.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Bill also carries forward the existing customs appeals procedures.  The new legislative provisions are simply a reiteration of the procedures that currently apply and any subsequent changes applied to the tax appeals procedures will have appropriate application to customs appeals.<\/p><p>The Bill also restates and modernises the existing legislation applying customs law to prohibited or restricted goods on their import into, or export from, the State.  The Bill sets out the rate of interest to be applied on customs duties that are not paid on time.  Lastly, the Bill updates the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of Revenue offences.<\/p><p>Before I go through a Part-by-Part explanation of the Bill, I ask Senators to try to imagine the environment for which the original 1876 Act was designed to cater and the social and political mores of those times.  I like to think that we have moved on considerably from then and that, for example, we no longer have a need for some of the more extreme powers with which customs were conferred at that time.  However, we will always have those who will try to outwit our customs rules and, therefore, not everything has changed in the Customs Bill before the House.  Senators might wish to be reminded of the scale of the customs operation in modern day Ireland.  For example, Irish customs annually process, on the automated entry processing system, approximately 1.1 million customs declarations in respect of goods being imported from, or exported to, non-European Union countries.  This breaks down into roughly 600,000 declarations in respect of imports and roughly 550,000 in respect of exports.  Customs duty collected on such imports was &euro;277 million for 2014.<\/p><p>However, it is not just the scale of the customs operation that should be noted.  Irish customs also have an enviable reputation regarding the way that they do this business, and it is important to acknowledge that.  Senators might like to note that in recent reports from respected international bodies such as the World Bank, the World Economic Forum and the Swiss-based Institute for Management Development, Ireland, and in particular Irish customs, has scored highly in terms of ease of doing business with them.  Some of the rankings achieved by Ireland, in categories in which Irish customs have a direct involvement, are as follows.  In the category \"trading across borders\", Ireland scored fifth in the world and second in the EU.  In the category \"burden of customs procedures\", Ireland scored eighth in the world and third in the EU.  In the category \"efficient transit of goods\", Ireland emerged as the leader in the world, beating Singapore into second place.  Senators will agree that these rankings paint an excellent picture of the way that Irish customs go about their business and that the Revenue Commissioners are to be congratulated on this.<\/p><p>With that in mind, I will now go through the Customs Bill and describe the main provisions contained therein.  Part 1 includes the usual preliminary and general provisions that apply to legislation of this type.  Thus, it provides for the Short Title, collective citation and commencement of the Act; for the interpretation of certain words and expressions used in the Bill; for the repeal of certain statutes and the revocation of certain statutory instruments; and for a number of technical linkages to provide for legal certainty and for legal continuity in the operation of the law.<\/p><p>Part 2 of the Bill deals with customs controls.  Accordingly, it provides for the appointment of customs ports and airports for the arrival and departure of vessels and aircraft into, or out of, the State; for the approval of places within customs ports and airports for the arrival of vessels and aircraft, for the loading and unloading of goods and stores, for the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers and for the storage of goods awaiting customs clearance; for the control by customs of movement of vessels and aircraft into and out of the State; for the reporting on vessels and aircraft, respectively, arriving in or departing from the State; for the control by customs of persons entering or leaving the State and of their baggage; and lastly, for the continuation of the existing control by customs of postal traffic into and out of the State.  Each of the relevant sections provides for an offence for contravention of the provisions of the section and for the penalty that applies.  <\/p><p>Part 3 deals, in the first instance, with customs offences and penalties.  Thus, it provides for offences relating to improper import or export of goods, that is to say without payment of any duty or contrary to a prohibition or restriction on their import or export, and for other customs-related offences, primarily related to non-compliance with a requirement imposed by a customs officer performing his or her duties, or interference with customs property or equipment, or adapting conveyances for smuggling purposes.<\/p><p>In both cases the sections reflect provisions in current legislation and they provide for the penalties that apply.  Part 3 also deals with various aspects of customs-related court proceedings.  As such, it provides for determining whether a customs offence is to be tried summarily or on indictment; for the forfeiture of goods which have been illegally imported or attempted to be illegally exported, that is to say without payment of duty or contrary to a prohibition or restriction; for a notice of seizure to be given to the owner of goods, where the goods are seized by a customs officer; for a notice of claim to be made by a person who claims that something seized as liable to forfeiture was not so liable; for court proceedings for condemnation of seized goods; for the rules for court proceedings in relation to customs offences; for the question of damages and costs in civil or criminal cases where judgment is given against a Revenue official as the defendant, on account of the seizing or detention of any thing; and lastly, for presumptions and onus of proof in proceedings under the Customs Acts, that is to say where certain things may be presumed to be true until the contrary is proven.  In all these areas, the sections are a restatement and modernisation of existing customs provisions and no changes of substance are involved.<\/p><p>Part 4 deals with customs powers.  Thus, it provides customs officers with powers to enter, inspect and patrol certain places without a court warrant; to stop vessels, aircraft, vehicles and other means of transport in different circumstances; to board and search conveyances that are entering or leaving the State, as well as away from ports and airports and the land frontier; to examine goods under customs control; to enter and search a specified premises or land under a search warrant issued by a judge of the District Court, and to seize and detain anything found in the course of the search which might be required as evidence in proceedings for an offence under the Customs Acts or any other enactment; to search persons in certain circumstances and subject to certain safeguards; to stop and question a person entering or leaving the State as regards their journey and their baggage and, if necessary, to search that baggage; to arrest without warrant a person who a customs officer suspects is committing, or has committed, certain offences, or where the person has obstructed or assaulted a customs officer; to detain goods being imported or exported, pending the outcome of inquiries and investigations into whether the goods in question are in compliance with the Customs Acts; and lastly, to seize any goods that are liable to forfeiture under the Customs Acts and to deal with seizures, whether before or after the goods have been condemned by the courts.  Such powers are essential control requirements to ensure compliance with both EU and national customs legislation and, crucially, to prevent smuggling.<\/p><p>Part 5 deals with general customs administrative matters.  Most of the sections are standard provisions in legislation relating to the Revenue Commissioners.  They provide that the duties of customs are under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners; that the commissioners may authorise customs officers to carry out various functions; that certain powers, functions or duties may be delegated to an officer of the commissioners; and that the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister for Finance, respectively, may make regulations for the purposes of giving effect to the Customs Act and of giving full effect to the community customs code.<\/p><p>Part 6 deals with EU and international customs obligations.  As such, it provides for a system of penalties for contravention of certain customs rules and procedures; for the continuation of the force of law in respect of the Naples II Convention, which governs mutual assistance between EU customs authorities in relation to criminal matters; for the application by Ireland of the 2009 EU Council decision on the use of information technology for customs purposes; for controls of cash entering or leaving the European Union through the State; and lastly, for the ratification by Ireland of the EU Council convention of 10 May 2009 on centralised customs clearance, concerning the allocation of national collection costs when customs duties are made available to the EU budget.<\/p><p>Part 7 provides for the appeal procedures in relation to customs decisions and assessments of customs duty.  As I stated earlier, these sections are a restatement of the existing legislation.  Part 8 deals with a number of miscellaneous provisions.  The first of these restates and modernises the existing legislation applying customs law to prohibited or restricted goods on their import into, or export from, the State.  The second provides for the charging of interest arising from late payment of customs duties.  Lastly, the Bill amends section 1078 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of Revenue offences.<\/p><p>I commend the Bill to the House.  I look forward to the debate on Second Stage and to teasing out any issues on Committee and Remaining Stages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#HH01800","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for outlining the main sections of the Bill and presenting it in the House.

Our criminal gangs are becoming more sophisticated and are operating internationally.  With that in mind, it is important the Government and the Oireachtas support the work customs does every day.  Many times this House, as well as the other House, has discussed fuel laundering and alcohol and tobacco smuggling, activities in which the State loses hundreds of millions of euro of revenue.  People need to understand that by participating in this, they are effectively taking money away from the State that could be used for important services such as health and the Garda while lining the pockets of criminals.  People should not support the black market in any way, shape or form, particularly in purchasing white goods, tobacco, alcohol and fuel.<\/p><p>The Minister of State outlined the record of our customs teams against international standards.  How well they have performed against those international benchmarks shows what a good job they are doing.

I have several queries relating to conflicting provisions in the Bill, which I wish to flag.<\/p> <p>Part 4, dealing with customs officers&rsquo; powers, provides them with powers to enter, inspect and patrol certain places without a court warrant.  Another Part, however, provides officers with powers to enter and search specified premises or land under a search warrant issued by a judge of a District Court.  Why are we allowing for powers to enter and search where a court warrant is needed and for other occasions when it is not needed?  Will the Minister of State please define this provision?<\/p> <p>One section provides for a customs officer in uniform but another section refers to somebody who is not a Revenue official.  Is Revenue thinking of outsourcing?  What comes to mind here is a Revenue Commissioner doing his or her job with, say, the Viper.  As it stands, if a garda enters a house, he or she will not have Joe Bloggs with him or her.  This provision, however, will allow a customs officer and other people Revenue sees fit to, say, enter a premises.  What category of person does this involve?<\/p> <p>Section 22 provides \"that in civil or criminal cases where judgment is given against a Revenue official as the defendant on account of the seizing or detention of any thing, the plaintiff will not be entitled to any damages or costs, besides the thing seized or the value of such thing, and the defendant will not be liable to punishment or penalty, providing the court finds there was probable cause for the seizure or detention.&rdquo;  I would just be a bit c&uacute;ramach that this could be abused.  Writing into the legislation that an official &ldquo;will not be liable to punishment or penalty, providing the court finds there was probable cause for the seizure or detention&rdquo; is strong talk.  I know it does not change the legislation but it is a measure with which we should be careful.  It might be the language used that is the problem.<\/p> <p>Section 23 provides that in proceedings under the Customs Acts, certain things may be presumed to be true until the contrary is proven.  This allows cases to proceed without presentation of proof of certain specified matters, that is, that a person is or was a properly appointed and authorised officer of customs.  Following on from my earlier question, what happens in cases regarding a person assisting a customs officer?  If the Minister of State could clarify these issues, it would allay my fears.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#KK00200","speaker":"1163"},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":250,"content":"<p>The Customs Bill 2014 seeks to consolidate and modernise national legislation relating to the administration of customs into a single Bill.  As we saw in the legislation itself and from the Minister of State&rsquo;s comprehensive statement, bar two particular sections, the Bill seeks to rationalise and improve existing legislation.  It also seeks to consider the European dimension to customs, particularly the EU customs code and its implementing provisions which set out the rules and regulations relating to the import and export of goods and impose legal requirements and obligations on importers and exporters.<\/p> <p>It is important to acknowledge that Ireland is a small island nation with an extensive coastline which is difficult to police.  We also maintain a common external border with the UK.  We are separate from a number of European countries in this regard in that we are not members of the Schengen Agreement.  Accordingly, we have greater difficulties in monitoring and maintaining customs services than a number of other European jurisdictions do.  The cross-Border illegal activities of the past several years, the active part taken by Revenue in combating some of the more nefarious activities of petrol-stretching, cigarette trading and so forth, as well as the extensive fines imposed for customs offences, all show the challenges our customs service faces every day.  It is to its credit that we do not hear more about them.  One is more likely to hear about a service that is causing a problem than one is to hear about a service that is not.  Given the extensive difficulties the customs service has, including difficulties with illegal activities, north and south of the Border, it is noteworthy that it rates so highly when compared internationally.  The Minister of State mentioned that it is has achieved high honours in a number of international reviews of custom services.  According to the 2013 annual report of the Revenue Commissioners, Ireland is ranked fourth in Europe for efficiencies of customs administration and fifth in the world.  It is clear that when one wants to have a good and well-functioning business environment, the efficiency and civility of a customs service, as well as one that is as first rate as ours, contributes to the overall business environment in a way that we sometimes do not recognise.  It should be placed on the record that the functioning of our customs service contributes significantly, not just in financial terms, but to the overall efficiency of business in this country.<\/p> <p>At European level, the extent of the role of the customs systems in contributing to the running of the European Union is sometimes forgotten.  The quantum of value that import charges contribute to the overall EU budget is calculated to be &euro;13.6 billion.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aideen Hayden:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2384\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2384&amp;amp;pid=AideenHayden&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is no small or insignificant amount of money, and it is very important that we recognise that for Europe to be successful the European budget itself needs to have other forms of income rather than direct levies on the member states.<\/p><p>I was also struck to discover that we have approximately 2,000 staff in this country engaged through the Revenue Commissioners with customs activities and that they are dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance.  There has been evidence in recent months that they do that effectively, given the significant fines levied.  They are very active in the prevention of smuggling and evasion, investigations and prosecution and audit assurance checks, among other areas.  It was news to me that we have two cutter boats in service.  They are managed and operated by the Revenue maritime unit.  It is important that the customs service is well funded.  I echo the views of my colleagues on that point.<\/p><p>I also echo Senator Sheahan&rsquo;s view that the powers that are conferred on customs officials are extensive.  Reference was made to the burden of proof, particularly under Part 3 as an example of where those powers are being extended.  It does behove us when we extend powers on any organ of the State to do so with care.  It is a testament to the Customs and Excise service that we have heard so little in terms of extending additional powers to them.  They are held in high esteem and I do not think their competence or honesty has ever been called into question.<\/p><p>We support the Bill.

It is very interesting to reflect on the proposals being repealed.  It shows the history of regulation in the customs area, from the Smuggling Act 1805 and subsequent legislation in 1807 up to the present day.  Consolidation of the legislation is necessary.  However, reflecting on what needs to be repealed reminds us that customs, barriers to trade and control of imports and exports have been a feature of world economic activity or non-activity for hundreds of years.  We must all welcome the Bill.<\/p> <p>I noted from the Minister of State&rsquo;s opening speech that, in the lingo of our administrative masters, it is another significant milestone in the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; comprehensive programme to consolidate and modernise our tax and duty legislation.  When the public at large hear such a reference, they will be reminded of what Ronald Reagan deemed to be the most feared words in the English language, namely, \"I'm from the government, and I'm here to help.\"  Notwithstanding that, I welcome the legislation.<\/p> <p>I have one or two observations which may be relevant.  Section 28 concerns the power to examine goods, which is a necessary power.  We are advised that a customs officer may examine goods that have been imported where he or she considers that there are grounds for certain suspicion.  I might be on the wrong page, dealing with the wrong legislation or even addressing the matter to the wrong Minister.  Reference has been made to smuggling, fuel laundering, petrol stretching, which is the new lingo, and diesel laundering.  I have been asked by a number of persons in the trade to pose the question of why it is possible for a motorist driving a diesel car to be stopped by the Garda or customs officers so that they can check whether the appropriate diesel is being used.  I do not think we can object to that, but it appears that such inspectors are not able to visit a fuel depot or filling station to sample the product stored on the premises.  Perhaps I am incorrect, but the argument has been presented to me that while an inspector can sample diesel in a car tank, he or she cannot sample diesel in a filling station.  If that is correct, could such a power be granted under section 28?  Could the Minister of State clarify the position?  It might have been clarified already for him.<\/p> <p>The broader aspects of the Bill cause us to reflect on the fact that we have moved significantly over the past 30 to 40 years to a Europe of very free trade.  We are progressing in some ways towards a world of even more free trade.  Once we reach a better destination in that regard, customs and trade barriers will become less of a problem.  We must also be cognisant of the debate that will take place in the United Kingdom in the next 12 months or two years on its relationship with the European Union.  It is quite frightening to think of what might be the case along the northern borders of this island if the UK exits the European Union.  One must pose the question of whether we will again be facing customs controls and Border checkpoints.  It is so much in our interests economically and politically that the UK remain in the European Union.  We are discussing the need for consolidation and progress in terms of our customs legislation, yet, from a North-South perspective, if the UK leaves the European Union, which hopefully it will not, the question of customs control will be very much back on our agenda.  There is an obligation on all of us to ensure in particular that the sizeable Irish electorate in the United Kingdom who will vote on this referendum next year or the following year are very much aware of what a negative impact it would have on the economy of this country and the entire North-South project if Britain were to leave the European Union.<\/p> <p>Senator Hayden presented an interesting figure in terms of staffing levels - namely, that there are 2,000 people, all of whom are no doubt busy.  It must cause us to focus a little on the general cost of administration of taxation, with 2,000 people in the customs service, the people in charge of calculating, arguing and collecting property taxes, local authority motor taxation staff, those involved in collecting water charges and people checking for compliance with television licence regulations.  Many of our taxation measures are hugely expensive to monitor and administer.  If we drew up a balance sheet and came up with the cost of collection compared to the revenue that accrues, we would conclude that we must consider ways of introducing smarter taxation.  The obvious one is motor tax, but that is a debate for another day.  According to Senator Hayden, 2,000 people are employed in the customs unit.  I am sure they are all very busy, but we must focus on the balance between the cost of administration and income generated.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State might be able to answer my question.  The question on diesel laundering might not be a valid one.  I welcome the consolidation legislation, which is obviously necessary.  Could the Minister of State ensure that the Government remains committed to ensuring that we will not have to reintroduce border controls on this island?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Bradford:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=73\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=73&amp;amp;pid=PaulBradford&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In so far as we can play any role in ensuring that the UK remains in the EU, we should do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#LL00200","speaker":"1189","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":254,"content":"<p>Cuirim c&eacute;ad f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.

Tuigimid gur Bille teicni&uacute;il go leor &eacute; ach go bhfuil s&eacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach ag an am c&eacute;anna.<\/p> <p>My party will support the Bill.  It is technical in nature, but we should underscore its importance.  I join others in commending the work of Customs and Excise and the Revenue Commissioners in carrying out their job in a professional manner.  Yesterday, I attended my local city joint policing committee.  The issue of the amount of drugs entering some of our urban areas was raised again.  There has been an increase in Galway recently, particularly in heroin.  The work done by Customs and Excise in trying to stamp out these practices is important and sometimes precarious.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in tabled amendments in the D&aacute;il because we believed the Bill could be improved.  It should be obvious to all that the way to tackle smuggling and laundering is through cross-Border policies and co-operation.  I note Senators' comments about the Brexit, as it is being termed.  It would cause major difficulties on this island.  Ironically, we are concerned about the voting rights of Irish expatriates in Britain, who will vote on the Brexit, when we do not seem too concerned about making them return on boats, trains, aeroplanes and automobiles to vote in our referendums.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in is on the record as having raised some concerns about the Bill, such as the measures empowering the holding of goods on what could be an indefinite basis and the legal exceptions that could be read as providing immunity for customs officers in some cases.  However, I recognise that this is not the intention and that the Bill is a good one.<\/p> <p>Our customs system is part of an EU system, which raises other important issues, such as the importing of goods that are labelled as Israeli and are therefore given preferential treatment under EU-Israel agreements but which originate in the illegally occupied territories of Palestine.  Neither the EU nor the Irish Government seems to have any interest in dealing with this issue.<\/p> <p>The transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, will come down the tracks quickly unless progressive forces can organise to defeat it.  It is a customs agreement with the USA.  There are serious concerns.  I have attended meetings with farmers, small business owners and so on about these issues.  There are grave concerns among these groups in particular about the impact of TTIP.  The European Commission has a free hand in these negotiations due to the Lisbon treaty.  The most damaging element of TTIP is the investment state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism, which has been used in other jurisdictions such as Australia, under which multinational corporations can take a state to court if they believe that treaties are not being adhered to in a way that is feasible for them.  From what we know of the mechanism, it is designed to allow corporations to sue states for having rules that hamper their profits.  A foreseeable example is a corporation suing Ireland if the Government bans fracking.  Environmentalists, trade unionists, farmers, many civil society groups and Sinn F&eacute;in MEPs have raised major concerns about what TTIP will mean for Ireland and the rest of Europe.<\/p> <p>Something we cannot forget is how the Bill will affect citizens and others.  My colleagues were contacted by Belfast residents who, on arrival back from a holiday in New York, were shocked to be fined and to have goods impounded.  The law is clear, but a more humane approach at times would be welcome.  My party has suggested that the people affected should have the right to receive in writing an explanation of the reasons for which they were stopped so as to prevent recurrences.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Bill, and Sinn F&eacute;in will consider whether to table amendments on Committee Stage where appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#MM00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for the welcome given by all sides of the House to the Bill and for their considered contributions on Second Stage.  As I have stated previously and as Senators on all sides have reiterated, most of the customs legislation has stood since before the State was founded, in the form of the Customs Consolidation Act 1876.  That Act has been extensively adapted and amended in the past 140 years.  While its provisions are still on the Statute Book, many are redundant or of doubtful validity.  From a wider perspective, the complicated and overlapping structure of the resulting legislation can, at times, be difficult to understand.  I enjoy Ronald Reagan quotes, but this Government is here to help.  There is an onus on all Oireachtas Members to ensure that the laws that we pass are accessible, understandable and relevant to our constituents and citizens.  The Bill will go some way in that regard.<\/p> <p>The Bill's purpose is to repeal, consolidate, revise and modernise customs legislation into a single Act.  The new legislation is more in keeping with developments in trade and technology and better reflects the social and political landscape in Ireland.  This legislative approach is at the core of the wider better regulation initiative.  It will provide greater clarity and transparency and, in doing so, make our legislation more accessible.  I hope it will reduce the administrative burden and red tape that is often perceived and encountered by those involved in complying with customs legislation and regulation.<\/p> <p>There are approximately 1.1 million customs declarations per annum, and &euro;277 million in customs duty is collected.  This is a sizable amount.  The scale and context of the customs operation in modern Ireland necessitate the modernisation of the underlying legislation.  I thank Senators for expressing their gratitude to our Revenue and customs officials and the front-line work they do on a daily basis.  It is only right and proper that the Houses support them in their work by putting in place modern and relevant legislation.<\/p> <p>On a point of clarification, the figure of 2,000 staff refers to all of the Revenue Commissioners' enforcement operations.  I am sure that Customs and Excise would love to have 2,000 staff on its own.  I thank the 2,000 staff for the job they do.<\/p> <p>Senator Sheahan raised a point about how the Bill referred in some places to the need for a warrant but, in others, to there being no need for a warrant.  To clarify, the measures where a warrant is not needed refer to those under which actions are taken in a customs-controlled environment, such as an airport or port.  The measures where a warrant is needed refer to the standard procedure of accessing private property or businesses.  Persons other than the Revenue Commissioners - this was an important question - means locksmiths, drivers or anyone who will be needed to accompany an official in carrying out his or her function.  If the Senator has more concerns about these matters, we can tease them out further on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p>Senators referred to section 20.  It is important that the court provide protections to our citizens, but customs officers also need protection when carrying out their functions.  This is what section 20 endeavours to do.<\/p> <p>Senator Bradford asked for clarity on whether it would be possible for an enforcement officer or inspector to carry out inspections of diesel samples at a depot or anywhere else.  The answer is \"Yes\".  Under our excise law, there are extensive powers to carry out such inspections.  This is a useful clarification, as the issue always arises in the Seanad in terms of fuel laundering and petrol stretching.  It is worth putting on the record the fact that significant additional powers have been made available to tackle these problems.  A comprehensive strategy to tackle illegal diesel laundering has been put in place.  The licensing regime for auto fuel traders was strengthened with effect from September 2011 to limit the ability of criminals to get laundered fuel onto the market.  A new licensing regime was introduced for marked fuel traders in October 2012, designed to limit the ability of criminals to source marked fuel for laundering.  New requirements in respect of fuel traders' records of stock movements and fuel deliveries were introduced to ensure that data were available to assist in supply chain analysis.  Following a significant investment in the required IT systems, a new supply chain reporting regime was introduced from January 2013.  This requires all fuel traders to make monthly electronic returns to the Revenue Commissioners of their fuel transactions.  The Revenue Commissioners are using these data to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution for further investigation.  There is intensified targeting and co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the Border in terms of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations.<\/p> <p>The strategy of the Revenue Commissioners has yielded considerable results.  The number of oil laundries detected and closed down in the period 2010-14 was 35.  None has been detected in 2015 to date.  Since mid-2011, 134 filling stations have been closed for breaches of licensing conditions and more than 3 million litres of fuel have been seized.  To the end of March this year, two filling stations have been closed down and, to the end of April, 22,205 litres of fuel have been seized.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Industry sources indicate a much reduced incidence of laundered fuel on the market and increased road diesel consumption.  Obviously, other economic factors have contributed to this growth, but reduced fraud is an important factor.  Last year there were four summary convictions and one on indictment for offences related to fuel fraud.  In addition, there were 283 summary convictions relating to the detection of marked fuel in the fuel tanks of motor vehicles.  I thought it was useful to take that opportunity to update the Seanad.<\/p><p>Senator Bradford also raised a very important point, which goes well beyond the debate on this legislation but certainly has an impact in the area of customs, namely, the possibility of a UK exit from the European Union.  It is well known by all Senators that the Government intends to take a proactive stance in respect of wishing to see Britain remain in the European Union.  The Irish Government remained silent on the issue of a Scottish referendum because we were not part of that union.  It did not mean that we did not care, but we stayed silent so as not to interfere.  We are part of the European Union and, therefore, there is no intention to stay silent on that debate.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has already articulated on a number of occasions the Government's position and its desire that Britain remain within the European Union and has delivered speeches in London on that issue as well.<\/p><p>It is very important that we see what the British Government wishes by way of reform of the European Union.  I notice comments regarding a desire to make it easier to do business in Europe and reducing red tape, which are aspirations all European citizens can subscribe to, but it is important that Ireland and all member states see the details in that regard.  <\/p><p>It is important to acknowledge in the context of a customs Bill that many of the repercussions for Irish customs if the UK were to exit from the EU remain unknown or are speculative at best.  The full implications would only be known once the details of any new agreement or arrangement negotiated between the UK and the European Union are finalised and published.  There is much speculation, but that is all it is, that if the UK exited the European Union, and we hope it does not, it would enter a European free trade agreement with the EU, similar to that currently in place for Switzerland and Norway, or enter a customs union with the EU, similar to that currently in place for Turkey.  Regardless of the final agreed position, the exit of the UK from the EU would have significant fiscal and logistical implications for Irish customs and, therefore, it is appropriate that it is raised in the context of this debate.  Following the results of the recent UK general election, it now seems certain that there will be a referendum in the UK on EU membership within the next two years.  If the UK public voted to exit the EU, this would have a significant effect on trade between the UK and Ireland.  The volume of trade country imports into Ireland would double in value.  The increase in imports of third country goods and the increase in the volume of exports to third countries would put significant extra pressure on Irish custom resources and infrastructure.  This is something we are monitoring very closely.  Ireland is willing to play a very constructive role in respect of the debate and the reforms Britain seeks and will approach that debate in a constructive manner, as a neighbour and a friend, but it is important we see the detail.  I am sure this is something that this House and, indeed, the other one will consider and debate further over the coming months and years.<\/p><p>I thank Senators for their views and their considered response to this legislation.  I look forward to Committee Stage, on which we can further tease out this Bill, and to getting this legislation enacted quickly as possible, so that we can give our customs officers the powers they need and deserve to effectively deliver the customs and excise system our citizens expect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#MM00300","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1432647000,"counter":257,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":258,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#NN00300","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":259,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#NN00400","speaker":"1163"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1432647000,"counter":260,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 2 June 2015.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1432647000,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 6.15 p.m. and resumed at 7.07 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"National Drugs Strategy: Statements","time":1432647000,"counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#SS00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#SS00150","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I apologise for the delay as I was responding to a debate in the D&aacute;il.  I am pleased to address Members of the Seanad on my new role within the Department of Health, aligned to my responsibilities in the Departments of Justice and Equality and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, in regard to the national drugs strategy.  I wish to update the House on my priorities in advancing this agenda.<\/p> <p>I am delighted to be afforded the opportunity to undertake this role.  I see it as a vital role that needs the attention of a dedicated Minister.  My experience as a teacher and principal in Dublin's north inner city taught me all about the horrors of drug abuse and the need to tackle the effects that it can have on the individual, their families and communities.  I am deeply committed to doing all I can, as Minister of State, to reduce the damage that drug use causes to individuals and to wider Irish society.  Problem drug use continues to be one of the most significant challenges facing our country.  It results in damaging consequences for the individual concerned and for their families and it also impacts the wider community and society on multiple levels.  Directly or indirectly, every community is affected by drug abuse and addiction.<\/p> <p>Those struggling with drug problems are often the most marginalised in our society.  They may have multiple, complex and interlocking needs, such as poverty, housing, poor health and education, which require multiple interventions involving a range of different agencies.  Consequently, the national drugs strategy aims to promote inter-agency working in a difficult cross-cutting policy and service area.  Its overall objective is to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on the five pillars, which are: supply reduction; prevention; treatment; rehabilitation; and research.  The strategy is based on a co-ordinated approach across many Government Departments and agencies, in conjunction with the community and voluntary sectors.  We are beginning work on a successor to the current strategy, about which I will speak in more detail later.<\/p> <p>The national drugs prevalence survey 2010-11 provided key data on drug prevalence in Ireland.  For example, levels of illegal drug use were mainly stable in Ireland between 2006-07 and 2010-11.  Some 7% of all adults reported using any illegal drug in the year prior to the survey; cannabis was the most commonly used illegal drug and 6% of all adults reported using the drug in the year prior to the survey; 6.5% reported using sedatives and tranquillisers in the year prior to the survey; and 5% reported using anti-depressants in the same period.  This survey is currently being repeated and the information gathered will inform future policy direction and contribute to the development of the new strategy.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2301\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Unfortunately, because of the nature of the particular issue, we do not have good data on heroin usage in Ireland.  The national advisory committee on drugs and alcohol is currently undertaking a survey which will provide us with useful estimates of heroin usage.  Even without this data, I am satisfied that heroin represents a substantial element of our drugs problem and I am determined to find the most effective ways to address this scourge.<\/p><p>The scale and nature of the drug problem in Ireland is constantly evolving.  We need to maintain our focus on combatting this serious problem.  It is also useful to acknowledge some areas where significant progress has been made in recent years.<\/p><p>Prevention and awareness programmes constitute a significant part of the Government's response to the drug problem.  The social, personal and health education programme is the foundation for developing awareness of drug and alcohol issues in schools.  I know from my own experience as a teacher and principal that maximising school completion rates is central to the prevention of potential problem drug and alcohol use.  In addition, research shows that having a positive experience of school and learning is a major protective factor that reduces the risk of substance use.<\/p><p>As well as providing substance use education in schools, young people at risk of drug misuse are supported through diversionary programmes providing facilities and services and are offered family support.  Very significant investment is being made in the Garda youth diversion programme.  It seeks to divert at risk young people from becoming involved in criminal behaviour, including drug-related crime, and in preventing their succumbing to drug misuse.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, recently announced that an additional &euro;2.8 million has been secured under dormant assets funding.  The funding will enable a further ten new Garda youth diversion projects to be established in targeted areas.  This will bring to 110 the total number of youth diversion projects in operation nationwide.<\/p><p>Achieving improved health outcomes for people with addiction issues is a key priority in the HSE service plan for 2015.  In recent years, the HSE has placed a particular emphasis on ensuring that appropriate treatment services are provided, on a timely basis, to service users.  <\/p><p>Waiting times for access to services, particularly outside Dublin, have been considerably reduced.  At the end of December 2014, over 97% of clients over the age of 18 accessed treatment within one calendar month of assessment, while 100% of those under 18 received treatment within one week.  Additional funding of &euro;2.1 million has been provided in the HSE's budget for 2015, which includes an additional 53 beds, creating 439 new treatments.<\/p><p>There is now comprehensive coverage of needle exchange services across the country.  The expansion of needle exchange outside Dublin, with the support of funding from the Elton John Aids Foundation, has resulted in the recruitment and training of over 130 community pharmacies.  I recently attended a presentation by the HSE on how this programme is operated and I was impressed by the success of the initiative to date.  In fact, during 2014 over 42,000 packs which contained over 240,000 needles were given out.<\/p><p>Approximately 9,800 people are availing of opioid substitution treatment.  The number of new entrants to treatment, whose main problem drug is heroin, is in decline.  However, in recent years the rise in polydrug use, including alcohol and prescription medication, has become an increasing cause for concern.<\/p><p>I welcome the HSE-led project on naloxone which was launched in recent days.  Naloxone is an antidote used to reverse the effects of opioid drugs like heroin, morphine and methadone in some overdoses.  This innovative project involves training lay persons, such as the family and friends of a drug user, in the administration of a naloxone injection to overdose victims.  Research shows that providing increased access to naloxone for people likely to witness an overdose is an effective way of reducing overdose deaths.  I have no doubt that lives will be saved as a result of this initiative.  Every drug-related death is a tragedy for the families and friends of the person involved and has a considerable impact on communities and society as a whole.  The provision of naloxone to those most at risk and their families is a real step in the right direction.<\/p><p>I believe that we also need to consider the introduction of medically supervised injecting rooms.  There is a problem with street injecting in Dublin and elsewhere.  This creates a public nuisance and is unhygienic and unsafe for drug users.  Supervised injecting facilities exist in a number of other countries and it is a policy I am very interested in.  Last week, I received a draft legislative proposal from Ana Liffey and the Bar Council's voluntary assistance scheme which would allow for the provision of such services.  I welcome the initiative and I have asked my officials to examine the practical and legal issues surrounding the proposal.<\/p><p>A longitudinal drug treatment outcome study measuring the effectiveness of opioid treatment, called the Research Outcome Study in Ireland or ROSIE study, showed that drug treatment works.  Significant reductions are shown in the key outcome areas of drug use, involvement in crime and in injecting drug use.<\/p><p>In terms of drug supply reduction, the drug market and associated crime has a particularly corrosive impact on Irish communities, whether that is by virtue of gangland crime and related murders or through the intimidation imposed in local communities by those involved in drug crime.  Our criminal justice agencies continue to play a significant role in seeking to address the many challenges faced in tackling such drug-related criminal activity.  Our law enforcement response in targeting those involved in drug trafficking remains an important feature of our overall approach in addressing the drugs issue.  The continued disruption of the supply of illicit drugs remains a key priority area which is reflected in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's policing plan for 2015.<\/p><p>Work in this area is being led by the recently merged Garda Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  The bureau works with dedicated drug units across the country and other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau and targets those involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.<\/p><p>The specific strategies put in place by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to address drug supply include the operation of targeted intelligence-led initiatives focused on particular aspects of the drugs trade.   A further feature of our policing response is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's ongoing close co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners' customs service and with other national drug law enforcement agencies, such as the Health Products Regulatory Authority, in tackling drug supply.<\/p><p>At an international level, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has strategic partnerships in place targeting drug trafficking, including working closely with relevant law enforcement agencies such as Interpol and Europol.  Last November, I was delighted to attend and speak at a successful major global conference that was held in Dublin which focused on tackling pharmaceutical crime.  The conference was jointly hosted by Interpol, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health Products Regulatory Authority.<\/p><p>In addition, the national drugs strategy includes a number of specific actions which target related aspects of drug crime.  For example, the problem of drug-related threats and intimidation has been the subject of increasing concern.  The Government is determined to tackle this form of criminality which has a detrimental effect on families, communities and society as a whole.  Under the strategy, a framework for tackling this particular problem has been put in place by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The drug-related intimidation programme has been established by the Garda national drugs unit in conjunction with the community based national family support network.  The purpose of this programme is to respond to the needs of drug users, their family members and-or friends who experience drug-related intimidation to repay drug debts.<\/p><p>While good progress has been made, much work remains to be done.  Problem drug users are individuals with their own individual needs.  We must focus on their health needs and continue to promote the recovery of problem drug users, help them reintegrate into society and reach their full potential.  This means services having a common vision on recovery and working together through a client-centred approach to foster client progression.<\/p><p>All services need to get behind the national drugs rehabilitation framework which is being rolled out across the country, with the support of the drug and alcohol task forces.  The  framework aims to ensure a continuum of care for the recovering drug user through promoting a client centred approach to rehabilitation across the spectrum of services and based on shared care planning.<\/p><p>Drug misuse is associated with a wide array of negative physical and mental health outcomes that are exacerbated with advancing age.  Ireland has an aging population of people in opiate substitution treatment.  The needs of this cohort pose unique challenges for services and underline the need for joined-up interagency working.<\/p><p>In 2012, there were 633 drug-related deaths in Ireland, which is a small decline in the overall number of drug-related deaths when compared with the 2011 figures.  The number of deaths in which heroin was involved also continues to decline.  Nevertheless, drug-related deaths still remain at an unacceptable level and every death is a tragedy.  Evidence shows that those who are out of treatment are approximately three times more likely to die than those who are stable in treatment.  Accordingly, we need to redouble our efforts to get people into treatment and on a recovery pathway.<\/p><p>Alcohol causes significant damage across the population, in workplaces, to children and creates a substantial burden on all in Irish society.  The Government is committed to taking action to protect the health and well-being of the wider public, especially children, from alcohol use.  A comprehensive and detailed package of measures has been approved to address the problem.<\/p><p>The general scheme of the public health (alcohol) Bill was published last February and the Bill is being drafted.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2301\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister for Health intends to have the Bill before the summer recess and to introduce it in the Houses of the Oireachtas in the autumn.  The legislation is the most far-reaching proposed by any Irish Government, with alcohol being addressed for the first time as a public health measure.  The Bill is part of a comprehensive suite of measures to reduce excessive patterns of alcohol consumption, as set out in the steering group report on a national substance misuse strategy.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is leading the implementation of this strategy.<\/p><p>In March of this year, the Minister for Health brought forward emergency legislation to deal with an adverse Court of Appeal decision regarding the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  The purpose of this Act is to prevent the misuse of dangerous or otherwise harmful substances, and it does so by declaring substances to be controlled under the Act and then imposing a range of controls on substances depending on their therapeutic or other value and their potential for misuse.  The type of control provided for includes controls on possession, supply, importation and exportation, cultivation, licensing, administration, record-keeping, prescription-writing, destruction and safe custody of controlled drugs.  The Act also establishes offences and penalties for non-compliance.  Substances may be controlled by two mechanisms: either by being listed in the Schedule to the Act, or by being declared controlled by means of a Government order made under section 2(2).  It was this section which the Court of Appeal ruling declared unconstitutional.  The Court found that while it is appropriate for the Oireachtas to delegate the power to the Government to declare substances to be controlled, the Act did not offer sufficient guidance to the Government in its exercise of this power.  The ruling had the effect of decontrolling all substances that had been controlled by Government order, including ecstasy, new psychoactive substances and benzodiazepines.  This meant it was no longer an offence to possess these substances.  The Oireachtas passed emergency legislation on 11 March to restore the controls on such substances by placing these in the Schedule to the Act.  In addition, emergency legislation, namely the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2015, confirmed a number of ministerial orders and regulations made under the Act.  This means that those orders and regulations are as if they were an Act of the Oireachtas and cannot be amended or revoked without primary legislation.<\/p><p>My aim over the coming months is to bring forward another Bill to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act so as to allow the Government to control substances anew, thereby meeting our EU and international obligations to control substances that are dangerous and have the potential for abuse. Furthermore, the Bill will clarify the provisions under which Ministerial orders and regulations are made.  This will once again allow regulations to be made and, if necessary and appropriate, to impose stricter or less strict controls on substances which are already covered under the legislation.<\/p><p>As Minister with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, I will be leading the development of the drugs strategy for the period after 2016.  My intention over the coming months is to lay the groundwork for a concise and focused policy, placing a clear emphasis on the practical implementation of actions.  The other consideration is the optimum timeframe for the new strategy, bearing in mind the evolving nature of the drugs phenomenon.  This work will include an assessment of the extent to which the current strategy has provided an effective policy response to the drug problem.  An examination of the approach to drugs policy and practice in other jurisdictions will also help to identify any additional evidence-based approaches that might be considered in an Irish context.  I intend to consult widely and to meet with all groups and stakeholders concerned with the drugs issue.  I want to listen to the concerns of those affected, and I am particularly keen to hear from young people, service users and their families.  I also want to hear from people in this House who have an interest in and concern about this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#SS00200","speaker":"1018","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I wish the Minister of State all the best in his new role, which involves responsibility for drugs.  However, given the delivery of his 16-page speech and the fact it was printed beforehand, he might as well have posted it out to us and we could have read it at our leisure.  I did not see the fire and passion we need and which, in fairness, the Minister of State shows in many other areas.  I want him to take my remarks constructively.  He displays excellent resolve in many areas and needs to do so in this one.  Some original thinking is required.  Many of the previous approaches have not worked.  If the objective is for us to eliminate illegal drug use, which I presume it is, as a society and a Government we have failed miserably in that.  My party was in government for many of those years and I do not exempt us from criticism on this issue.<\/p><p>The appointment of the Minister of State was very welcome.  It was late, which was not his fault but rather that of the Government.  There seemed to be complete forgetfulness in this area.  On one of the few occasions on which I saw Leaders' Questions on the television, I saw Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan ask the Taoiseach about a drugs issue.  His answer was, essentially, that he would get back to the Deputy.  It struck me at the time that for a Taoiseach of the country not to be completely <i>au fait<\/i>with this area was disappointing, to be quite honest.  <\/p><p>Earlier this year Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward new policy proposals seeking to address the challenge of the prevalence of drug abuse in society.  It is a challenge and there is no point in denying that.  The people who advocate legalisation strategies cannot deny that there is a problem.  The problem is not simply the illegal distribution of drugs; rather, the problem is the effects many of the illegal drugs have on people in terms of addiction, and the long-term effects some non-addictive drugs appear to have on people.  We all know people who smoke a lot of cannabis and - let us be honest - it has an effect on them.  The idea that cannabis is a harmless drug or does not cause problems is not correct.  We know people who smoke it on a very regular basis and are not fulfilling their normal roles in society, as far as I can see.  <\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il pledged to appoint a Minister for drugs because at the time we saw that there was a clear gap and that a Minister with specific responsibility for this problem was needed.  There are also health and justice issues, as well as how we deal with people in communities where drug abuse is rampant.  We welcome the fact that the Government has finally appointed the Minister of State.  Fianna F&aacute;il is often accused of having no policies, but this was one policy that was adopted.  We had such a policy when in government, and we felt it needed to continue.<\/p><p>We want to build on the national drugs strategy, and the Minister of State is considering that.  We hope that is done relatively quickly.  The Minister of State referred to the period after 2016.  We want to implement a new national substance misuse strategy which is inclusive of all drugs, including alcohol and cannabis.  In fairness to the Minister of State, there was substantial discussion of alcohol in his speech.  <\/p><p>We need to address antisocial behaviour experienced in cities as a result of drug abuse.  Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell famously did a slot on the &quot;Today&quot; show on RTE about O'Connell Street and the difficulties encountered by people walking on it, and there is no doubt that a lot of the difficulties are drug-fuelled.  Fianna F&aacute;il also believes that after-care services need to be improved.  There is no point in pretending that things in this area are static.  The landscape of drug use in Ireland has changed dramatically and there are emerging needs regarding the nature and prevalence of drug use throughout the country.  <\/p><p>We once thought heroin was a problem of inner-city Dublin.  Everyone's eyes have been opened to the heroin problem.  Substance misuse is complex and cuts across other issues, including poverty and a lack of resources in communities.  It has a major impact, and the problem can be caused by various social and personal factors.  The drugs issue causes other problems.  There is a chain reaction.  <\/p><p>Alcohol and cannabis misuse is prevalent.  I understand that alcohol misuse among young people is decreasing overall, about which I am glad, but it may not be enough compared to the situation ten years ago or more.  That may have something to do with the financial situation and the price of alcohol.  Many people drink less now than they did when economic times were better, and maybe that is a good thing.  There seems to have been a lack of urgency on the part of the Government to address the issue, which has resulted in an inadequate response.  We would say this was symbolised by the negligence of the Cabinet, which has responsibility for appointing Ministers of State, in appointing a Minister of State with responsibility for drugs.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Thomas Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2203\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2203&amp;amp;pid=ThomasByrne&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A former Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, Pat Carey, helped to tie things together between different Departments and agencies in order to bring forward a strategy.  <br\/><br\/>My party has published its national drugs action plan, but I was not involved in its production as I was not the spokesperson on drugs at the time.  My colleagues who produced the plan had extensive consultation with various groups.  My colleague Senator Darragh O'Brien is chairman of the drugs task force on the north side of Dublin, so he has great experience of this issue.  My colleagues spoke to the groups who are working to tackle the abuse of drugs at community level.  People had an overwhelming sense that the drugs crisis had slipped off the Government's agenda.  I encourage the Minister of State to show the same passion he has displayed when debating other issues such as asylum seekers.  His personal commitment to the marriage equality referendum has been second to none.  On certain issues he might not get the result that he wants from the Cabinet.  I ask him to give a personal commitment to tackle this issue, because he is capable of making changes and getting a better response from the Government.<br\/><br\/>My party's first proposal was to appoint a Minister with responsibility for drugs.  Communication between the various services in the Department of Health, the Department of Justice and Equality, social services, Tusla, local government and community services can be conducted on an <i>ad hoc <\/i>basis, and services often operate in isolation.  There is a genuine and urgent need for political leadership, which the Minister of State has the potential to provide, in order to create workable structures and to close the gap that has emerged between the Government, which is the maker of policy, and the providers on the ground.<br\/><br\/>There is an escalating crisis in polydrug use and the increasing use of cannabis.  I do not favour any legalisation of cannabis, even in other forms, because it changes one's personality.<br\/><br\/>As the Minister of State has mentioned, the sale and abuse of prescription drugs has infiltrated communities across the country.  I have a lot more to say on drugs, but I only have eight minutes.  Let us be clear.  The Minister of State has an important role to play.  Other matters have gone off the agenda because they have been dealt with.  It is now time for him to grasp this nettle and do what he can.  I urge him to get his house in order, get the strategy laid down and get the agencies to work together to curb drug abuse.  The problem is increasing in areas where it would not have been in existence ten years ago.  Heroin use is a relatively static phenomenon but it has caused huge problems for a lot of people.  The drugs landscape has changed so much, as the Minister of State acknowledged in his speech.  My party will support him once he is seen to be tackling the issue and making a genuine effort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#UU00200","speaker":"1116","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for the work that he has done in this area.  I compliment him on the way he has dealt with the media.  He has conveyed a positive message on the new approach being taken to tackle this issue.  We need a new approach to certain ways we have of dealing with the matter.<\/p><p>Let us look at an interesting study produced by the European School Survey Project, which interviewed 2,200 children aged under 16 years and found that 19% of them reported using an illicit drug in their lifetime.  The figure is quite high, but it is still lower than the figure of 22% obtained from a similar survey.  The National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol, NACDA, also carried out research which showed that 27% of participants reported using illegal drugs in their lifetime.  The percentage was broken down into the following categories: in the 25 to 34 age group, 42% of participants confirmed they had used illicit drugs; in the 35 to 44 age group, it was 29%; and in the 15 to 24 age group, it was 27%.  Those figures highlight the fact that there is an important job to be done in education and trying to steer people away from ever touching illicit drugs. <\/p><p>The National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 sets out 63 different objectives, and we have made progress in those areas.  The five pillars of the strategy are supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.  <\/p><p>The Joint Committee on Health and Children recently heard a presentation on drug addition and recovery.  One of the speakers was a project leader from a HSE-run project in Dublin.  He talked about the principles that reflect recovery and said:<blockquote>Recovery is self-directed and empowering.  Recovery involves a personal recognition of the need for change and transformation.  Recovery involves rejoining and rebuilding life in the community.  Recovery involves addressing discrimination and transcending shame and stigma.<\/blockquote>Those are some of the issues that need to be highlighted.  Recovery for a person who has a drug problem, which involves personal recognition of the need for change and transformation, requires a lot of support.  When people arrive at that stage, a large number of them know that abstaining from drugs is the way they want to go, but it is difficult for them to succeed unless they have support.  A survey of 1,007 drug users in Scotland showed that 56.6% identified abstinence as their main aspiration.  To achieve that they need every bit of support, not only from friends, but from family and the health service.<\/p><p>An interesting report entitled Addiction Recovery: A Contagious Paradigm! was presented to the Joint committee on Health and Children in 2014.  I shall quote one of the people cited in the report, who said:<blockquote>I saw the good life of those in recovery, began to buy into the process. ... Started to put on iPod and had a watch the time going to clinic and avoid speaking to others who were using drugs.  I started seeing a counsellor, talking about self, stuff and family (once per week).  Starting going out walking to mountains with non-using friends, every fortnight for full day.  I also played soccer every Monday night.  Began to write, keeping a diary.<\/blockquote>He continued by stating that the supports that he received were the key to his recovery.  The report just shows that we need to ensure support services are available.<\/p><p>In the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 we set out 63 objectives, but we need to continue to review the processes that are in place and see what changes must be made.  The Minister of State has already identified a number of changes to be made in the comprehensive speech that he delivered here this evening, which were also mentioned in his broadcasts.  <\/p><p>It is important that we look at alternatives.  I was approached by one of the people who provide alternatives to methadone.  We have had a high reliance on methadone as a heroin substitute and as a way to get people out of their difficulties.  I apologise, but I cannot pronounce the name of the alternative drug that is available. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#VV00200","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":270,"content":"<p>Is it naloxone?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#VV00300","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Yes.

My figures are from 2012, when the latest data on drug related deaths implicated methadone in 86 deaths, be it alone or with another drug.  They also noted that 68% of those who died in similar circumstances in 2011 accessed diverted methadone illegally, as they were not in treatment at the time.

I have first-hand experience of dealing with drug and alcohol addiction close to home.  It is not just a question of dealing with the addiction, but also the societal, familial and economic issues involved.  The national drugs strategy has been running since 2009 and is to conclude in 2016.  While it aims to cut across public policy and service delivery to tackle the drug problem, it is recognised by many as having failed to achieve that in any meaningful way.  The numbers of those addicted to heroin is increasing and drug related deaths have increased by 50% in the past decade.  At a joint policing committee meeting that I attended in Galway yesterday, the superintendent reiterated her concerns about the alarming increase in the misuse of heroin.  Ecstasy tablet use everywhere has also increased.  A councillor who was a taxi driver stated that he regularly had to clear ecstasy tablets out of the back of his cab on Saturday evenings.  This indicates how much misuse there has been among our young people.  The terrible and tragic death of Ana Hick in Dublin recently indicates that drugs are available not just in Galway, Dublin and so on, but also in any rural town that has a disco on a Saturday night.  One is probably likely to find that some drugs are available quite handily to young people.<\/p> <p>When one understands that funding to local drugs task forces has been cut by almost 80% in the past five years, the reasons for these issues as well as the societal issues become clear.  In rural areas in recent years, health, support and social services have been cut back drastically.  This has not helped the situation.  My colleague, Sinn F&eacute;in's health spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, recently welcomed the Minister of State's appointment, as did I.  Prior to that, we had the unfortunate circumstance of the current Government being the first in 21 years not to have a Minister of State with responsibility for drugs.  However, I must ask what the Minister of State's main priority is, as he also has responsibility for equality, new communities, culture and commemorations.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State has stated that the current national drugs strategy is too old and has lost energy and focus.  We are happy with some of his statements so far and that he is willing to engage new methods in the fight against drugs.  He stated that he would be supportive of the introduction of injection centres for addicts.  We should not rush to rule that proposal out before discussing it, as it seems to have some merit.  There were issues with the dumping of drug paraphernalia in Galway recently, particularly in Westside, Ballinfoyle and Ballybane.  This major problem must be addressed.<\/p> <p>The alternative to injection centres for addicts is a continuation of the current dangers and problems with which we are all too familiar, including carelessly disposed of needles and the health risks of injecting in non-clinical settings.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who has met representatives of the Ana Liffey Drug Project, has stated that we should be open to discussing the proposition, including its benefits and down sides, and making an informed decision based on all of the facts.  I note the Minster of State's comments to the effect that methadone maintenance is not working for a cohort of drug addicts.  There are more than 10,000 registered methadone users in the State, a large number, so we must ensure that we examine all options.  I understand that some of those being considered may be more expensive, but perhaps the Minister of State might comment on the small group of people who are receiving suboxone, how they are doing and whether consideration has been given to extending this project.  The Minister of State has provided details on naloxone, but perhaps he could give more detail on that project.  Naloxone has been made available for prescription to opioid drug users, the aim being to reduce drug related deaths.  How will this be monitored and what is its end point?<\/p> <p>Last month, the Minister of State told us that there were a number of addiction counsellor posts vacant in the Dublin region.  Where are there vacancies in other regions?  What has been done to ensure recruitment?<\/p> <p>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children recently agreed to address the issue of legal highs, mindful of the deaths that had occurred consequent on the use of those substances, not only in Ireland but on a European basis.  A new strategy must address any legislative loophole and ensure that repeats of inadvertent legalisation do not occur.  We as legislators, and the Government in the first instance, must address the damage being done to society by drugs.  This problem faces every town and disproportionately affects communities that have been hardest hit by the current and previous Governments' austerity policies.  A new national drugs strategy must recognise this and be adequately resourced for its duration so that the number taking drugs, and taken by drugs, does not continue to increase.<\/p> <p>Today sees a work to rule in University Hospital Galway by the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, which told me that two of the problems were overcrowding and the pressure on its members as a result of cutbacks in addiction services and so on.  Obviously, this is a broad problem.  I wish the Minister of State well in his efforts to tackle it, but I am concerned that he has a great deal on his plate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#WW00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and his appointment to this new role with responsibility for the national drugs strategy.

I am glad that he has this role.  I welcome the initiatives that have been taken and on which he has addressed the House, particularly those relating to SPHE, youth diversion projects, the extra funding for same and the interagency approach that has been adopted in the national drugs strategy and will be continued in the new strategy for the period after 2016.

The Minister of State mentioned a figure of 633 drug related deaths in 2012.  From my background as a criminal justice practitioner who has represented many people before the criminal courts down through the years and often defended people with serious opiate addiction problems, I am well aware of the harm that can be caused by the misuse of drugs, but we need to bring to the debate on a national drugs strategy a measured and rational approach that is based on a harm reduction model.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am glad to hear the Minister of State say he is looking at evidence-based approaches that have been taken in other jurisdictions, because that is something we need to consider in devising a new national drugs strategy.<\/p><p>There are three things I would like to see us adopt in the new national drugs strategy.

We recognise that addiction is a medical issue.  I am glad to hear the Minister of State speak about the expansion of the needle exchange programme and I absolutely support him on the idea of the medically supervised injecting rooms.  That is a hugely positive development in dealing with the harms associated with addiction.  \"Positive\" is perhaps the wrong word to use in the context, but it would certainly be an improvement on the sort of street injecting that causes other problems around public order, intimidation of the public, and so on.<\/p> <p>We also need to look in a rational sense at the way in which certain drugs that are controlled, particularly cannabis, may be used for medicinal purposes.  There is a growing debate on this internationally.  I have spoken to the Minister of State about this and I know of many people who, for example, have small children with very serious medical conditions which they believe can be improved or better managed through medical marijuana.  We have seen a great deal of use of that and development of that in the US.  I would like to develop that conversation with the Minister of State, because we should not be fearful about it.  If there is an evidence-based rationale for prescribing cannabis or a cannabinoid for medical reasons, we should look at that.<\/p> <p>We need to look more broadly at our drugs policy from a harm reduction perspective.  I am glad to say that other members of the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which I am also a member, will be travelling to Lisbon in June, in a few weeks time, to look at the model that has been adopted in Portugal.  This is of great interest as an alternative model very much based on harm reduction, as opposed to the prohibitionist model with which we are, unfortunately, more familiar.  I have said before that if we use a sort of \"Boston-Berlin\" argument about policies generally on the economy and society, then in Ireland we clearly follow a Boston model on drugs.  That is unfortunate because it is based on the simple, crude and wildly unrealistic idea that criminal law can stop people from using drugs.  In other words, if drug possession is a criminal offence, this will deter people from taking drugs and eliminate drug use.  We know this prohibitionist approach does not work.  The war on drugs has not stopped people using drugs, just as asking people to abstain from sex will not prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases or HIV.  We must take a more realistic and rational evidence-based approach to this.  The Berlin model, which is more common in some European jurisdictions, recognises that the elimination of drug use is impossible.  It seeks instead to reduce or prevent the harms that can arise from drug use, through medical means predominantly rather than through criminal law.  This involves taking on the approaches the Minister of State talked about through seeking to educate people about the dangers associated with harmful drug use.<\/p> <p>We also need to acknowledge the class issue in terms of drug use.  This is rarely spoken about but is very obvious for any criminal justice practitioner.  Broadly speaking, in any society, there are two different groups of drug users: those from disadvantaged backgrounds, who are more likely to be criminalised for their drug use, and middle class users, who use drugs recreationally and who tend to go undetected and remain outside the criminal law.  We see that class difference in Ireland broadly and tragically holding true for the consequences of drug-taking.  Heroin addiction has caused terrible tragedy and devastation within many disadvantaged communities, but middle class ecstasy and cocaine use does not have, or certainly has not been perceived to have, those terrible social and economic consequences in different societies.  This phenomenon is not exclusive to drug offences.  I have written more generally about class in the criminal justice system, because we know there is a deep-rooted class bias in our criminal justice system more generally.  However, it is important that any rational drugs policy would take into account the class difference and the fact that there are different means of using drugs and different sorts of harm caused by the use of drugs.  Also, from a criminal justice perspective, we must all be very conscious of the huge harm caused by the criminalisation of drugs, the growth of criminal gangs and the huge damage done to communities by the prevalence of those criminal gangs.  That is another reason to look in a more rational and measured way at how we develop drug policy in Ireland.  I hope the Minister of State will take some of those comments and concerns on board in working with other agencies and Departments on devising the new national drugs strategy for the period after 2016.  I look forward to working with him on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#XX00300","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister of State on the excellent result of the marriage equality referendum at the weekend and his efforts in that regard.  I also welcome his new role as Minister of State with responsibility for drugs.  I was heartened to see the frank, open and honest interview he gave on national television a few weeks ago.  It was a breath of fresh air into this debate.  I am glad he seems to be the right man for the job.  The issue of drugs in our society is quite big.  It can often go under the radar and it is something that many of us in Leinster House are a bit afraid of talking about.  Talking about drugs and other issues and dealing with them can often be seen as a big taboo.  Raising the issue and proposing a debate on alternative ways to deal with drugs, recreational drugs in particular, is something that might not be seen as very popular in constituencies.  However, it is a debate that needs to be had.<\/p><p>Drugs are in our society.  There is no doubt about that.  They have become part and parcel of our society.  For many people, they are part and parcel of every weekend.  I know how obvious it was to me.  Coming back to a small area, one can see people on drugs.  When out and about on weekends, some people are in and out of the pub as they would be to smoke a cigarette.  They are out taking lines or whatever.  It has become a very common occurrence.  Most of the people I have been meeting and dealing with are sensible, smart, progressive and forward-thinking.  Often we are seen in this House as being far behind the times.  Brushing something under the carpet and pretending it is not there is not the way to go.  Drugs are no longer the preserve of the <i>hoi polloi <\/i>and while the likes of celebrity overdoses - Katy French, Gerry Ryan and others - hit the headlines, often the young people who overdose, and there has been an alarming increase in that recently, do not seem to get as much attention.  I know of two deaths in Clonroche in Wexford recently.  The death of Ana Hick has been mentioned by previous speakers, and Michael Coleman, Liam Coffey and others also come to mind.  They took an alternative drug to MDMA with the same effect, which is called PMMA and is a very dangerous drug.  It is something about which people need to be educated.<\/p><p>Part of the problem is that the control and supply of drugs is now in the hands of ruthless criminal organisations which do not give a damn about what they are selling, who they are selling it to and the consequences of that.  These are my thoughts from what I see happening on the ground.  Criminalisation has failed miserably.  I agree with Senator Bacik on that.  It has not reduced the demand and therefore, in economic parlance, it has not reduced the supply.  From the IFSC to the more rural parishes, there are people taking drugs.  Anyone living in the real world can see that.  It has become tolerated and accepted in my generation and the younger generation.  In a group of friends, it is often the case that some people will smoke the odd joint, others do cocaine, others do speed, some do pills, some do all those substances and some do not do any.  Half the craic for young people when they start taking drugs is that they are illegal and there is a criminal risk attached to it.  If that were changed, it would reduce the allure for many young people and those with an inquisitive mind.  As has been said, we need investment in education programmes.  We must give people the proper information about drugs.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator James Heffernan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2362\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2362&amp;amp;pid=JamesHeffernan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to explain openly, frankly and honestly the pros and cons of different drugs and their good and bad effects.  Then we should allow people to make up their own minds, take whatever risk they want and put whatever they want to into their own bodies.  It would be far better if the control, supply and sale of these substances were in the hands of trained medical professionals acting on the State&rsquo;s behalf rather than in the hands of the 13-year-old young fellow I happened to meet outside a popular Dublin pub several weeks ago.  He was completely, totally and utterly off his face, with huge wads of cash in his possession and a real fancy top-of-the-range mobile phone.  He did not know where he was and was very frightened, looking for help.<\/p><p>The damage criminal organisations are doing to our society, as the Minister of State outlined, is very hard to qualify.  My brother worked in a disadvantaged school in Moyross, County Limerick.  In such an area, when a young fellow sees the economic benefit from the sale of drugs, that is how they get caught up in it.  My brother remarked to me that nine of his past pupils were lost to gangland violence.  That does not count the number of families affected.  I would prefer the State to control this business rather than the Dundons, the McCarthys, paramilitaries or other criminal mafia gangs that operate in this country.  The fact this now comes under the Department of Health rather than the Department of Justice and Equality is certainly a step in the right direction.<\/p><p>With regard to what Senator Byrne said about cannabis users, the problem is-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#XX00400","speaker":"1119","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":282,"content":"<p>The Senator has gone way over his time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#YY00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I promise I will finish up in one minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#YY00300","speaker":"1119"},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":284,"content":"<p>No way.

Anyone who has been unfortunate enough to spend a night in an accident and emergency department - God knows I have spent enough of them there myself with the old ticker every now and then - will have seen the unfortunates affected by drugs.  I do not believe there is a way to tackle the drugs problem other than to take it out of the hands of the warlords and drugs lords who are making massive money from it and killing one another to get control over it.  The only way I ever see us solving this problem is by tackling it - by legalising it and, in some way, controlling it from there.<\/p> <p>Over two years prior to my coming into the House, I had the privilege of visiting schools all over the country.

I always know when somebody has very little to say about a topic; they tend to focus on the Minister&rsquo;s delivery.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, it is not just outside the school gates that there tends to be some drug dealing going on but within the schools too.  We have to be mindful of the stresses and strains that teachers are constantly undergoing in this regard.  On the glamorous lifestyle that seems to be attached to the drugs trade, as I have often said, if one locks a child out of mainstream society and they do not get respect from it, they will find a parallel economy and a way of getting empowerment and prestige.  The drugs trade is glamorous, lucrative and exciting, and gets one cheap and easy money.  There is a challenge in the education system and in wider society to tackle this.<\/p><p>Senator Burke asked about the use of Suboxone to treat drug addiction.  There is not a legislative blockage as such, but we will need regulations because we are dealing with a small cohort of people for whom Suboxone is being prescribed.  Further regulations will be needed in the Bill to expand on this.<\/p><p>There has been a reduction in funding for the local drugs task forces, but nowhere near 80%.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>clarified that this was not the case.  It has been 9.8% over the past nine years.  While no one wants to defend such a reduction, it is the reality of what the entire country went through over the past several years.  In fact, every drugs task force got an extra &euro;48,000 this year.<\/p><p>I concur with Senator Bacik about putting the emphasis on harm reduction.  I welcome the fact that the justice committee is going to Portugal.  Portugal had a different approach when it came to decriminalising drugs.  When I use that term, I want to make it clear that I am not talking about legalisation.  Those are two very different things.  We have to come back to the research and wonder why 70% of those going through the courts for drugs offences were found in possession of amounts for personal use.  This seems to be a complete waste of Garda time and the time of the Courts Service.  It is primarily a health issue for those with addictions or problems, not a criminal justice issue, and that is the way in which it should be tackled.<\/p><p>The issue of class was raised.  In my experience, drugs are everywhere.  Neither is it just a Dublin issue.  It affects other urban centres and rural areas.  As I have said before, middle-class families have ways of hiding drug addiction and drug problems in a way that working-class people sometimes cannot.  Drug gangs get their funding from middle-class recreational drug takers who think there is absolutely no connection between their recreational drug use at the weekend and a dead body found in a pool of blood with a gunshot wound to the head or a heroin baby born with an addiction problem.  There is obviously a link.  When one takes recreational drugs, then one is feeding that menace.<\/p><p>I appreciate the support for the suggestion of consumption rooms.  I know people will have concerns around how they will manifest themselves and be operated.  If one examines what happens in Sydney and the 88 such centres across Europe, it is an approach to the cohort of drugs users who are so desperate that they will inject heroin in an alleyway or the stairwell of a flats complex.  Recently, I took a 45-minute walk around Dublin city centre with the Ana Liffey Drug Project, which advocates this new approach.  We did not have to walk very far to see all the paraphernalia of drug taking, syringes and so forth.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2301\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What garda&iacute;, those working with drug addicts, the addicts themselves and even the retailers working in the city centre will say is that this is not good for anybody.  It is not good for the image of the city and it certainly is not good for the individuals to have to reduce themselves to a position where they feel they have nowhere else to go for their medical need, for their addiction, than down a side alley to inject themselves.  Should we not find some new approach to that small enough cohort of people who do not fit the criteria to go into a mainstream programme for treatment and, in this way, facilitate them to do what they do in a more dignified fashion as a step toward recovery?  I think it is worthy of assessment and investigation, and it is something I am determined to do.<\/p><p>This House has a good reputation for coming together collectively and on a cross-party basis to focus on issues such as direct provision and other issues of common intent.  If this House was to come together collectively and on a cross-party basis and say this is something that should be investigated, this would stop it being a political football and we could take a practical approach to those most vulnerable of drug users who are most inclined to get involved in anti-social behaviour, burglary, muggings and all the rest of it because their need is so great.<\/p><p>We have a fantastic opportunity at this time, as a collective, due to the redrafting of the national drugs strategy.  I believe there should be a shorter timeframe for the next strategy because seven years is too long and perhaps a five-year strategy would be better the next time.  Given the Misuse of Drugs Act is currently being amended in the D&aacute;il, this means we have a number of windows of opportunity through which we can force these issues.<\/p><p>I would appreciate the opportunity to come back to this House to toss these issues around, as I have done on other issues.  I have been asked whether I am too busy.  I do not think anybody is too busy to deal with the drugs crisis and the drugs issues we have in this country.  I do not think we can say the situation is worse or better; it is just different.  The drugs issue changes drastically all the time.  The age cohorts are different; we have lost a generation to heroin and the people are now older.  The needs are different and the type of drug use is different, with polydrug use now common.  The complication with alcohol is different and the type of drinking being done is different.<\/p><p>If drugs are changing, we have to change our approach.  The \"just say no\" approach will work for some people, including children, and we can frighten some children away from drug use completely.  However, it does not work for everybody.  We have to accept that and work on issues that may actually achieve something.  The approaches in Portugal and in Sydney may be something we could look at but we have to get beyond the idea of calling people who have a medical need by a nickname,  calling them junkies and assuming they are just human litter, and that as long as we push them away and do not see them, the problem is solved.  I do not believe that.  If we believe in a Republic, and we all now believe in equality, then the person who is injecting themselves in the side alley in Dublin city centre, or in any town or part of this country, is as equal a citizen as any of the rest of us and deserves the dignity of having the State help him or her through what is obviously a medical need.  I do not believe the criminal justice system is the best way to do that.  I appreciate the comments made by Senators and I am happy to come back to the House at any time to flesh out these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#YY01000","speaker":"1018","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":292,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":293,"content":"<p>At 10.30 a.m. tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#ZZ00300","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1432647000,"counter":294,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 8.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 27 May 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
