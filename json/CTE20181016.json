I am joined by Mr. Fergal O&rsquo;Leary, member of the commission and by Mr. Se&aacute;n Murphy, director of consumer protection and chief legal adviser.<\/p> <p>  I plan to focus in particular on two areas in my opening statement - the content of the proposed directive and the designation of an enforcement authority.<\/p> <p>  The CCPC was established in 2014 to enforce competition and consumer protection legislation across the economy.  Our vision is for open markets, where consumers are protected and businesses actively compete.  Each year we help more than 40,000 consumers via our helpline and more than 1.7 million consumers via our website.  We are currently active in the following areas across the economy - motor insurance; household waste collection; mortgages; nursing homes; personal contract plan, PCP, car finance; vehicle crime; bid-rigging in the public transport sector; and ticketing, to name but a few.  I think the committee will agree that these are all areas which are of importance to consumers.  We also have ongoing work across the economy in fulfilling our mergers and product safety remit.  We do this with just under 100 staff across all of those areas.<\/p> <p>  Over the years, the CCPC and its predecessor organisations: the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency, have been active in the food sector in the enforcement of competition and consumer protection law; the publication of grocery surveys; product pricing inspections; assessing a number of mergers; and, in the fulfilment of one of our most recent areas of responsibility which is the grocery goods regulations, which I will speak about in more detail shortly.<\/p> <p>  We understand that the European Commission&rsquo;s proposed directive seeks to address imbalances of power in the food supply chain and its goal, as part of number of current initiatives, is ultimately: &ldquo;to contribute to ensuring a fair standard of living for agricultural producers&rdquo;.  This goal has relevance for all of us as consumers and as citizens.  We also note that the proposed directive is based on Article 43 of the treaty.<\/p><p>It is in the context of our work in this sector, particularly regarding the grocery goods regulations, and the experience this has afforded us to date that we wish to share our views which we hope will be of assistance to the committee in its deliberations.<br\/><br\/>As the members may be aware, while the CCPC's mandate is economy wide, we have one sector-specific remit, namely, that which relates to grocery goods.  The regulations in this regard were introduced in 2016 in order to address certain practices in the grocery goods sector with the goal of bringing transparency and certainty to trade relationships<i>.  <\/i>It is important to highlight that price or price levels are not within the scope of the current regulations.  When introducing the regulations, the Minister stated, &quot;relationships will continue to be based on commerce and prices will continue to be set by hard negotiations &ndash; this is in the interests of consumers&quot;.  The focus of the regulations is on the relationship between suppliers of food and drink and grocery businesses, both wholesalers and retailers, which have a worldwide turnover in excess of &euro;50 million.  To date, 22 grocery undertakings come within the scope of the regulations.  These 22 traders are required to have written contracts for all relevant suppliers in which the terms and conditions must be expressed in clear, understandable language.  These contracts must be signed by both parties and retained for six years.  If certain practices are to apply, they must be pre-agreed and covered in the written contract.  Through our work to date, we have found that the contracting models used by traders are different and involve varying levels of complexity.  We would be happy to discuss this aspect in more detail later, but I will not dwell on it now.<br\/><br\/>Since the introduction of the regulations, the CCPC has adopted a phased approach by promoting awareness of the new requirements under the regulations and allowing the traders involved to bring their practices into compliance where necessary.  Following an assessment of annual compliance reports received from 22 operators earlier this year, officers from our consumer protection division have been conducting on-site inspections and meeting relevant industry players.<br\/><br\/>In light of our experience to date, we see substantial differences between the existing regulations and the proposed directive.  Of particular significance is the aim of the directive to &quot;ensure a fair standard of living&quot;.  This is a significant departure from the aim of the current regulations.  Of equal relevance is the proposed scope; the Commission&rsquo;s model would apply throughout the supply chain and to buyers not currently covered by the existing regulations, including those in the food processing and food service sector.  I will return to this later.<br\/><br\/>Although the CCPC is currently the enforcement body for the existing regulations, given the aim and scope of the proposed directive we believe that a dedicated and focused sectoral regulator should be established to carry out this work.  The reasons for this are primarily concerned with our dual mandate to promote competition and to protect the interests and welfare of consumers.  In addition, our existing and future operational commitments in enforcing competition and consumer protection measures at a national and international level are significant challenges in themselves.  The CCPC would have grave concerns that our ability to fulfil our current mandate would be irrevocably diminished if we were given this task.  The proposal is extensive and will require considerable resource investment.  To give full effect to what is proposed would, in our opinion, be better secured by the creation of a sectoral regulator.<br\/><br\/>We welcome the committee's scrutiny of the proposed directive and we wish to highlight some concerns from the perspective of our statutory mandate.  The aim of the proposed directive is &quot;to address unfair trading practices in the food supply chain&quot;.  We are concerned about the impact of the current proposals on consumers and also what might be added at an EU or Irish level.  The proposed directive is a minimum harmonisation instrument, meaning that member states can go further if they believe it is necessary.  In this regard, we are aware that further additions to the proposed directive are being advocated.  These include further broadening of the scope to include more traders as well as a ban on below-cost selling.  Competition law works in the interest of consumers by requiring that businesses act independently and compete with each other when setting prices.  That is why we, and our previous organisations, have spoken strongly against the introduction of bans on below cost selling.  Any legislative requirements relating to pricing or pricing models may provide an incentive for businesses to co-ordinate prices.  Overall, we believe that consumers could end up paying more for food for two reasons, first, because some grocery markets could become less competitive and, second, that the not insignificant cost of this proposed directive will inevitably be passed onto consumers.  Effective enforcement is essential in ensuring that any regulations have the intended outcomes and that the costs incurred deliver benefits for those who are paying.<br\/><br\/>I will use the remainder of my time to discuss some of our enforcement experience, which I hope will benefit the committee.  An ongoing matter of debate and commentary in this sector is the lack of actionable complaints.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539700200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Complaints are an essential source of information and intelligence for any organisation involved in enforcement.  We know that understandably complainants live with a real fear of repercussions if they make a complaint and allowing anonymous complaints can help with this, but the ability to actually determine that the law has been broken or to take enforcement action based on an anonymous complaint is very challenging in terms of implementation, in particular when it comes to penalties or levying fines.  This is an issue that would have to be overcome for the proposals to have a real impact.<\/p><p>Another area of note of the proposed directive is the issue of fines.  Ireland is an outlier with the rest of Europe's regulatory bodies in that our Constitution raises issues around the administration of fines by bodies other than the courts.  In our current work we have found this to be a particular difficulty.  We share the view that financial sanctions are essential as a deterrent but the issue of administrative fines is one that needs to be considered and overcome.<\/p><p>I have come this far without mentioning Brexit, but I must do so before I conclude.  It is clear that uncertainty is the main issue at present for Irish food producers selling into the UK or UK retailers who operate here.  We do not know what will happen in the weeks and months ahead, but we urge the committee to ensure that the Irish food industry is not put at a disadvantage compared to their UK counterparts which most likely will not be the subject of the proposed directive.  Competitive balance could be a significant issue in the future, another area we will be happy to discuss further.<\/p><p>To sum up, what has become apparent from our work to date in the sector is that the relationships, contracts and issues experienced by those involved in the food chain are complex and are also evolving.  I hope I have usefully highlighted to the committee that the proposals presents some significant practical challenges in terms of oversight and enforceability.  We recognise the importance of a sustainable agrifood industry but it is our considered view, given the complexity, the scope and the goals of the proposals that the role of the competent authority for the proposed directive should be given to a sector specific regulator whose sole remit and focus would be overseeing this market and working with farmers, producer groups, wholesalers, retailers and other players to ensure their competing interests can be fairly balanced.

I am sure the primary producer will survive and the focus is that consumers will not be hurt by this legislation.<\/p> <p>  In the past 15 years to 20 years, I understand the percentage of the disposable income of consumers spent on food has dropped very significantly.  Has Ms Goggins the figures to support that?  We all want to protect consumers but how long can the primary producer take a smaller and smaller percentage of the sale price and continue to survive, whether in the liquid milk, beef, vegetables, pigs or whatever farm enterprise?  The percentage take the primary producer gets from the sale price has reduced very significantly.  It is said that hard negotiations will determine the price in the future.  Again that is grand but the person who is getting squeezed the whole time is the primary producer.  If there is an argument on liquid milk, the margin is squeezed and the dairy cuts the price to the milk producer.  We have seen the factories dropping the price in the past couple of weeks.  Has that resulted in lower prices for the consumer at the point of sale?  We have seen in the run up to Christmas for a number of years that very low price vegetables were used to attract the consumers into the shops, and there was significant cost cutting.  Who carried the can for that?  It was the primary producer. <\/p> <p>  In her statement Ms Goggins said the aim of the directive is to \"ensure a fair standard of living\".  However, the reality is that primary producers are getting squeezed more and more.  The major retailers are exerting a huge influence on the trade.  The members of the committee went to a presentation in one of the hotels out near the airport a couple of months ago, where many good things were proposed.<\/p><p>We are not seeing the benefit of that as regards a fairer balance in the distribution of what is being paid for food.  While I welcome the CCPC's opening statement, which is very thought-provoking, at the end of the day the primary producer is not getting protected at the moment; he is getting squeezed more and more.  That situation is not tenable into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#H00300","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539700200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Goggin for her submission here today.  I have a couple of questions.  She mentioned that the contracting models the CCPC sees used by traders are very different.  They are all over the place and there is no consistency.  Do I take it from that comment that she feels work should be done to try to get some consistency in the area and that a standard should be set up which people should try to reach?  With regard to the directive, Ms Goggin also mentioned, as did Deputy Cahill, that one of the things stated in the directive is that efforts should be made to find a fair standard of living.  That almost conflicts with the CCPC's position up to now, which has been to make sure that the consumer gets the best possible value.<\/p> <p>  From where I sit, one of the issues in this relates to organisations such as Bord Bia, which we have had in here on numerous occasions, that markets and promotes our food all over the world and spends vast amounts of taxpayers' money on trade missions in order to do so.  The benefit of that work, from the point of view of the taxpayers' money which goes into it, should be reflected in the primary producers getting a decent income for the work they put in.  I have had this out with the Minister on different occasions and he says that it is not his place to set prices yet it is the State's place to promote the product and the State uses taxpayers' money to do that.  It would be a difficult situation in which to find ourselves if taxpayers' money was being used to promote and market the product all over the world and, indeed, in Ireland, to get a good price for it, just for the benefit of one sector within the industry.  One of the difficulties that we have is the sector we see making most of the profit is the supermarkets and the processors - what we would traditionally call the middle men.  The person at the bottom is being squeezed and, in many cases, the consumer on the other end is not getting the value he or she deserves.  I would be interested in Ms Goggin's comments in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Ms Goggin also spoke about the implications of the proposed directive broadening the scope to include more traders.  There is talk of a ban on below-cost selling, which again would conflict with the work the CCPC has traditionally done.  In the interests of the consumer, this needs to be looked at on a more long-term basis.  The consumer needs a consistency of quality as well as price.  Sometimes the short-term quick turnaround, which can be seen in low prices, is not in the consumer's long-term interests because it ends up in monopolisation.  I would be interested in Ms Goggin's views in that regard.  Can we look to a more long-term means of dealing with this?<\/p> <p>  Finally, the issues around all this are basically about having a sense of fair play.  I opened the cupboard this morning to make a cup of coffee and I saw fair trade coffee in front of me.  That would traditionally have been coming from Third World countries yet we do not seem to have the same sense of ensuring that we have fair trade in respect of products coming from what we would consider to be the developed world.  We need to consider that and re-establish some sense of fair play in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#J00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1539700200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Goggin for the presentation and for coming in today to discuss this issue.  I am interested in hearing her perspective on international comparisons with other European countries.  How are they set up and how do their structures in terms of groceries regulations compare with our own?  How strong are their enforcement agencies?  I am also interested in Ms Goggin's view on the so-called supermarket ombudsman in the UK, on how it operates and how it compares to our own set-up.  Fianna F&aacute;il proposed an amendment to the current legislation in order to provide more clarity within the CCPC by allocating responsibility to a dedicated person within it who would be set up to act as a food ombudsman and to oversee the groceries regulations.<\/p><p>On how things currently stand, I am interested in Ms Goggin's perspective on the priority in terms of engaging with the 22 traders for whom the CCPC has responsibility and the identities of those traders.  Is that of benefit in light of the current proposals from the Commission, the Council of Ministers and the Parliament which would require a separate body to take over that role from the CCPC?  In that regard, I would be interested in hearing further detail on what Ms Goggin believes would be required in any such sector-specific regulator, how it could best operate and what competencies, capacity and resources it would require to implement the directive.<\/p><p> I am also interested in her perspective, given the role of the CCPC, on the objective of the directive, which is to deliver a fair income and standard of living to those two primary producers.  How can that be achieved?  Is it a realistic objective in terms of drilling down and ensuring it could happen?  Undoubtedly, as Deputies Cahill and Martin Kenny outlined, the big issue with which we must grapple and with which the current directive and proposals seek to deal is that of trying to ensure that the primary producer does not always bear the brunt of competition and hits to the market.  While others at higher levels of the food chain continue to take their margins, the primary producers always end up being squeezed, which is a real difficulty.  In terms of having a sustainable food chain, it is essential that we look at following through on the directive and trying to put systems in place to ensure that the primary producer gets a fairer deal in regard to supplying quality food to the consumer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#J00300","speaker":"1244","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539700200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Goggin and her colleagues for their attendance.  This is an important matter that has been addressed by this committee and the former Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Innovation over many years.  I am very heartened to hear Ms Goggin say that there should be a sectoral regulator because that was recommended in 2010 by the enterprise committee of which I was Chairman but that recommendation was not implemented.  The difficulties in regard to the harmonious application of regulations across the EU may have stalled such implementation.<\/p> <p>  The situation regarding primary producers has been outlined by my colleagues.  That is where we must start with this because the primary objective is to reduce the power imbalance which is so obvious in the food supply chain.  The definition of \"buyer\" in the new directive will clearly be significantly wider than that stipulated in the grocery regulations such that anyone who buys agricultural products by way of trade will be classified as a buyer.  That is why the CCPC may choose to hand this task over to another body.<\/p> <p>  There are significant issues of concern.  The CCPC has not been very effective - or has it - in ensuring transparency on issues such as hello money, the treatment of perishable products or wastage charges.  What has it done within the limited confines of the grocery regulations?  Its predecessor, the Competition Authority, was paralysed when it came to such matters, as was discovered by the committee on investigation of the matter.  Nothing could be done in regard to several issues, such as anonymous complaints or a person in the limited position of being a supplier or producer of these type of products who came forward with tangible evidence, unless the complainant brought the issue forward themselves.  Of course, the fear of victimisation meant that such people did not put their heads above the parapet.<\/p><p>We have spoken a lot about this.  It worries me that various committees have addressed the issue but nothing much seems to be done.  As Deputy Cahill has said, there is only one loser in this; the primary producer.  The retailers and the big wholesalers are almost beyond the pale in terms of trying to bring them to heel.  If this is implemented, and if a sectoral regulator is put in place, have the witnesses communicated their comments on this directive?  Have they addressed this to the relevant Minister, which is generally in the area of business or enterprise, in order to take steps? I am glad the representatives have it here but have they conveyed it to the other authorities? I am sure this committee will convey it, with the backing of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, now that we have it here in black and white.  It is something the committee had previously recommended but it was always shot down because of various issues, and perhaps one could understand that if it was just a one country situation.  England has its own groceries regulator; have the witnesses examined how that works in the UK and how it might be applied in this country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#K00200","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539700200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Before I go back to the witnesses I have a couple of brief questions.

They have been very slow about putting their hands or their heads up for the obvious reason.  Have the witnesses seen any improvement in that since the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission came into existence?

I will divide the responses up because the Deputies and Chairman covered a lot of ground there.  I will start by referring to a couple of overarching things.  Obviously, ensuring a fair standard of living for primary producers is absolutely a valid objective, and it should be looked after.  Equally, from our point of view, ensuring that consumers are fairly treated, that they do not bear the brunt of regulation and that they do not have all the costs passed on to them is also valid and that is our objective.  We do not see ourselves, as one organisation, possibly resolving all of those tensions.  If there are tensions there it is natural in a democratic society but we do not see that one could encompass the two without one's head exploding.  There would not be a degree of consistency in decision making or in the allocation of resources, which is a big issue in this regard.  We feel that they are both valid but they come from different articles of the EU treaty and they have different objectives.  We see them as being quite apart.<\/p> <p>  I will not get into the nitty gritty of the enforcement issues but I will ask Mr. Murphy to speak about that shortly.  In response to the comments by Deputy Penrose and others, our point about the effectiveness of the regulation is that currently if one wants to impose fines one has to go to court.  If a case goes to court then one needs evidence.  One cannot go to court with anecdotal evidence.  A witness is required to stand up, and this is the difficulty.  As people have pointed out they do not want to be the subject of potential retaliation and they do not even want to be identified.  With regard to enforcement, we have to square that circle somehow.  We have been told that there are difficulties in giving administrative bodies the power to impose fines themselves, which means one is then into a court scenario and the standard of evidence where the criminal burden of proof is beyond reasonable doubt.  That is also the reason given in a whole lot of areas we go across and this is why I mention it.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cahill asked about expenditure on food.  We did a lot of work on this issue last year in relation to Brexit.  I will ask my colleague Mr. O'Leary to address this and some of the other issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539700200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>We can provide detailed figures to the committee afterwards on the amount that consumers spend on food.  From the study we conducted with regard to Brexit, we found that if there is a hard Brexit or a no-deal Brexit where products could pass across relatively seamlessly, up to &euro;1,000 would be added to a family's food bill over the course of a year.<\/p><p>One of the things we saw there was that the addition of non-tariff barriers would be very significant.  That alone shows the scale of the increase and what we also found that was particularly striking was that the greatest proportional increase will be for lower-income groups.  That means that consumers who have lower incomes and who obviously have less to spend and have less disposable income are putting more of their income towards food and that generally goes to the point about how much all consumers pay for food.<\/p><p> On the comments around the proposed directive, which is the nub of the issue from our point of view, it is one of the measures which is aimed at contributing to a fair standard of living for agricultural producers.  The current grocery regulations that we are responsible for enforcing are concerned with transparency and certainty.  On the Chair's question, we believe that since their introduction, there has been an improvement over the last number of years but we must acknowledge that within the existing grocery regulations, it is about writing down what is agreed and is not about banning particular practices, which is a significant difference to what is being proposed by the EU.  That needs to be teased out in terms of the overall aim versus what we are doing at the moment.<\/p><p> I will also address the question of what a sectoral regulator could need.  We have spent the last 11 months working on a study of household waste domestic markets.  We have looked at this from the point of view of sectoral regulation in general and one of the first things any regulator would need would be the wherewithal to analyse all of the particular parts of the market and that would be a significant undertaking in this case when the sheer number of contracts that would be brought into effect by the proposed regulator are considered.  Another thing we suggest is there must be a reasonable deterrent.  That is where Ms Goggin's point on the fines comes in.  We need to make sure that whatever is proposed will have the impact it should and on that basis, it needs to have teeth.  A difficulty that many regulators currently have in Ireland is that they do not have the ability to impose fines and so there are question marks over whether that is a suitable deterrent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal O&rsquo;Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539700200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>As Mr. Murphy has been leading the inspections we have done with the grocery goods undertakings, as well as the discussions with the producers and so on, I ask him to respond to some of those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539700200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and members.  As for how we are monitoring compliance with the regulations, as our opening statement has pointed out, it was initially a case of introducing the regulations and allowing businesses to get used to them and come into compliance because the requirements within the regulations themselves require businesses to take some proactive measures in terms of identifying compliance officers, engaging with us and ensuring the contracts they have are in compliance with what is required within the ranks themselves.<\/p> <p>  I then moved, on a second phase, to our division, namely, the consumer protection division of which I am the director.  Over the past couple of months we have had director-led inspection teams, that is, I have led those teams and we have engaged with the regulated grocery goods undertakings, RGGUs.  What I can say now is their business models are different.  This might go back to the point that was asked about.  Different business models reflect the different structures they have within the country itself.  There are different distribution models, delivery and even invoice processing.  They have different ways of doing it.  They have different sized buying teams and different purchasers.  It is quite variable.  It is not a case that there is one particular model that probably would be very easy to oversee.  One must get out there and engage with each one of them, which is why we are there with the RGGUs.  I return to a point we made earlier, which is that were this to expand as envisaged, it could only be imagined what that would bring in, even in terms of an oversight, to get an understanding of the model.  Therefore, a single regulator specifically focused on that is probably the way to go.<\/p><p>In respect of the international models - I think Deputy McConalogue spoke about the relationships with others - we would be aware of what is happening in the UK.  I have a document which I can pass on to the Deputy later, if he likes, which outlines the difference between the UK grocery adjudicator and us.  The scope is significantly narrower in the UK because the thresholds are much higher, for example, there are ten large retailers there with a turnover in excess of &pound;1 billion subject to the code.  Here it applies to retailers and wholesalers with a &euro;50 million turnover.  At present 22 of these entities have identified themselves as being subject to the regulation.<\/p><p> I could list all the enforcement powers but will focus on one.  In the UK there is the power to impose a fine and penalties equivalent to 1% of the turnover.  Comparing and contrasting that with what is available to us under the regulations and the Consumer Protection Act 2007, it covers contravention notices and breaches of those notices leading possibly to a prosecution, either summary with a &euro;3,000 fine and-or six months' imprisonment on a first conviction or leading to &euro;5,000 on a second or subsequent conviction.  Depending on the scale of that, it may proceed to a prosecution on indictment.  The quantum difference between us and the UK is obvious, and that fine can be imposed by the adjudicator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539700200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Could Mr. Murphy provide us with a list of the 22 organisations he deals with?

In response to the question about drilling down, by our engagement with them, face to face with the compliance officers and head purchasers, we go through the regulations to see what was required, such as, whether there were promotional costs, wastage, shrinkage, written contracts.  We would expect that written contracts would exist but, as is emerging now, some large suppliers do not give a written contract because they are happy with their own terms and conditions.  Some small suppliers do not provide a written contract, either because they have not got around to it or because they are uncertain as to what it actually means.  We have put the regulated grocery goods undertakings, RGGUs, under pressure because they are required to have those written contracts.  They will ask us and we have made every effort to do so but we cannot get them.  We have to be sure they have made reasonable efforts.  The compliance inspections are not just an annual event.  They are rolling.  That is part of our strategic framework.<\/p> <p>  This is not the first time that we engage with traders at this level.

I contend, however, that is a false economy because none of us thinks if we managed to buy something below cost in a multiple retailer that the price is not loaded onto some other product in the store.  That is a reality in the multiple retailers.  I suggest that the consumer is ultimately paying for it on a different product.  Our concern is the main agricultural sector, beef, because prices are constantly flatlining.  That means farmers are just breaking even or the prices are below the cost of production.  Selling below cost depresses prices.  If farmers are out of pocket, which they often are and people have set out their situation and their weak position in the food supply chain here, they invariably go to Government for subsidies.  That is taxpayers' money.  It is a false economy to be allowing big multiple retailers with the power they have to sell below cost.  That is just for dairy, horticultural and other produce.<\/p><p>That is only on dairy, horticulture and other produce.  We have the same problem with alcohol in this country.  Much legislation, in particular the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, was going to target the small retailer and treat them differently from multiple retailers.  They are treated similarly for so many things yet it is a whole other animal in how it operates and the power it wields.  I cannot accept that we cannot do something.  Our problem will be that we no longer have farmers because they will be fed up with depressed prices or no income.  We had this debate in the run up to the budget.  Young people have many more options now.  We are talking about a whole system that could collapse if the primary producer in beef or dairy or whatever decides to call it a day because of all these other pressures and the lack of recognition of what they are putting into it.  Naturally we want to protect the consumer and we are looking at the farmer but it seems that we are not really taking on the multiple retailers and below-cost selling is a case in point.  <\/p><p> Another issue I wished to raise, and one which the commission would deal with, is that of cartels and concerted practices, specifically in meat factories.  Farmers regularly complain about the prices they are getting in factories, that if they present on a Monday morning at factories throughout this country, they are all getting pretty much the same price.  It is an issue I have raised before, including with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  What sort of evidence does the commission need or what investigation has it done into concerted practice or cartels in operation between meat factories throughout this country that is resulting in practically every factory, although not all - I am not saying that every one is in the same system - offering farmers the same price for their beef?  Invariably this goes against the farmer.  These corporate entities are so big they seem comfortable behind a corporate veil that we provide.  We provide them with the structures to trade with limited risks and so on and ultimately, when things go belly up they can go back to Government, whether it is to help a consumer or to enforce rights.  These are the people who will march if something is not right.  I am not only talking about dairy.  It is not just about helping the primary producer.  Some of this may be philosophically somewhat outside the commission's sphere but, specifically, what investigation has it done on meat factories?  Earlier the commission cited the lack of actionable complaints, and stated that it needs evidence.  What sort of evidence does it want people to come forward with?  What investigations has it done in its own right?  It is a big thing to ask of farmers but if it has webbed feet, waddles and quacks, it is a duck and that is what one must call it.  One must find a way of showing this up because it is another problem for farmers which I understand falls within the commission's remit.  <\/p><p> On fines, I understand what the commission is saying and the constitutional position.  However, what about the concept of penalties and the operation of a groceries regulator that would inflict penalties?  The Revenue Commissioners impose penalties and the local authorities impose penalties on people for not having paid household charges.  Is that only because it crystalises at a certain point and then one adds on the penalties and it is easier to calculate?  Is there not some way that we can try to rein in a total imbalance and an abuse of the corporate veil which goes on in so many realms?  We are only discussing multiple retailers here, and I mentioned factories, but it is always the small person who is squeezed.  Serious action must be taken or this will continue to land on our doorstep.  It is we that look at the people marching on the streets when they feel that big corporations get more consideration.  I say that acknowledging that the commission has to deal with the legal system that is there and whatever laws we pass but they are also the experts who can guide us from their practical experience.  I would like to see more accountability in this area and I look to the commission.  Does it think its powers need to be strengthened or does it need more investigative powers or more forensic expertise or whatever else to get to the bottom of this?<\/p><p>Other than that, it is like an old chestnut that keeps cropping up again and again.  We have farmers complaining all over the place.  The same story about these problems is being replicated everywhere yet we are still here discussing them and nothing has been done.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#N00600","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539700200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee this afternoon.  I will ask a number of questions about the presentation and the aim of the directive to ensure a fair standard of living.  What are the witnesses' views on how that will be achieved in terms of the current practices we have?<\/p> <p>  My other question is on the administrative fines.  Ms Goggin stated that the issues are with fines being administered other than by the courts.  I was racking my brains as to when I last paid a library fine.  There is some method.  Local authorities can levy a fine on me if I do not bring my library book back.  Is there something we are missing?  Who would fine the offenders rather than having to go through the courts?  <\/p> <p>  I want to inquire about below-cost selling, which we have all seen in the grocery sector.  It was referred to by some people earlier.  My concerns around the big multiples heavily discounting fruit and vegetables, which are the essentials for most households, is that having food so cheap devalues the production of food.  It also leads me to be concerned about food waste.  It is slightly off track perhaps but it creates the impression that food is disposable and is so cheap that it can be thrown out if it is not all used.  It does not give the producers any great comfort to see this happening.  The text of the directive was referred to where it states that buyers should not sell products below purchase price and then request the supplier to cover the difference.  Do we know that is happening already?  If it is, it is outrageous.  The primary producer is carrying the cost when the loss-leading method is used to get consumers in and then it is piled on elsewhere in terms of pricing.  <\/p> <p>  I had one other point but I cannot find it.  Perhaps the witnesses could answer those questions and it will come back to me.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#P00200","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speech","time":1539700200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.

There is quite an amount of ground being covered.  On the point about below-cost selling, the current regulations, because they require the retailer to have a contract with the producer and the terms and conditions are written down, it will be illegal for them to subsequently go back and say they are selling something below cost and want the producer to take the hit on it.  Once the thing is in the contract and it has been agreed it would not be allowed.  As to whether retailers should not be allowed to do it at all, this is where we are coming at it from different angles.  We are coming at it from the point of view of consumers.  Of course cheap fruit and vegetables are good for consumers.  How could we say otherwise?  With regard to the notion that they pay on other products, we must compare how people do their grocery shopping now compared with how they used to do it ten years ago before the crash.  There used to be a situation in which people did one big shop in one place.  They did one big weekly shop and bought a few bits like bread and milk in between.  What we see now is people spreading it around three or four different shops for the one weekly or fortnightly shop.  People go to the German discounters for certain things but they do not have all the brands so people go to another place.  People are very well able to pick up on good bargains in one shop and not buy everything there so they do not get penalised on other goods in the same shop.<\/p><p>The CCPC's big concern about a ban on below-cost selling is it means that, if the wholesaler or distributor raises the price, every retailer across the board raises the price.  Competition in the retail sector is lost and that is detrimental to consumers.  <\/p><p> Mr. Murphy will speak about the preferred enforcement model, but the CCPC has not seen evidence of retailers pushing back on suppliers where they are offering cheap products themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539700200,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I will add one point to what Ms Goggin has said.  The consumer experience is also changing.  Ten years ago, the click wrap, e-commerce transaction where groceries are purchased online and arrive to the door was not an option.  People have different experiences now.  People who are time poor are willing to pay a premium for convenience.  That is changing and evolving, particularly in terms of how that product is delivered and the accessibility of getting it from store to house.  As it evolves, regulation has to catch up.<\/p> <p>  Some committee members have mentioned penalties, and Deputy Corcoran Kennedy mentioned library fines, and there is a facility to levy those.  The CCPC has a fining power through fixed payment notices but they are for petty or regulatory breaches, so are on the lower end where something can be disposed of easily.  The sort of breaches we are looking at here require something more because of their impact.  The equivalent of a library fine, or a &euro;300 fine, will not have any effect.  It must be substantial, effective, proportionate and dissuasive.  That is the premise of larger fine regimes.  That might answer it.<\/p> <p>  There is a facility for local authorities to levy smaller fines.  The CCPC has that facility for particular breaches but, for larger breaches, another model is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539700200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I might add one comment about below-cost selling.  We are all professional regulators but, at the same time, the shorter\/longer term issue is important and relevant.  The CCPC does not believe a producer should be put out of business by a loss leader.  We do not think that is the right thing to do because the committee members are right - and Deputy Corcoran Kennedy addressed this  that what is good for today needs to be good in the medium to long term.  We believe that loss leaders and below-cost selling can be good as long as it does not devalue opportunities in the future.  It can be a way to provide good value on certain products to some consumers on the basis that it has been paid for appropriately.  That is an important issue.<\/p> <p>  I will make a couple of points about the sectoral regulator.  The CCPC has a good relationship with all of the sectoral regulators.  The commission has co-operation agreements with Central Bank, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, ComReg, and recently signed a new one with the Central Bank.  Our job is horizontal, across the economy.  In any one year, the commission looks at about 100 different markets within its mergers regime, as part of its enforcement work and studies.  The commission's remit allows it to go to the places where there is the most consumer detriment.  That focus works particularly well where there are problems in particular sectors and that is why sectoral regulators exist.<\/p> <p>  Given the range of issues that have been highlighted in this sector over the years, if there is a desire to tackle those problems, ultimately that needs to be resourced.  It needs to be resourced efficiently and given all appropriate powers.  I mentioned earlier the CCPC's recent proposal to set up a dedicated waste regulator whereby the commission can do certain things, but ultimately more would be achieved by that sector-specific focus.

Something that is a feature of every town, village and city in the country is an increasing amount of direct selling through farmers' markets and artisan markets.

We are seeing more choice being given to consumers and consumers getting more segmented in terms of what they respond to.  Some consumers solely purchase Fairtrade and organic produce but other people do not have the luxury to afford those types of products.  At the moment there is more choice available, which we support but we hope that choice is maintained in the future.  Obviously there are important questions around how the agrifood market can feed into and support that in the long term, which is the ultimate aim of the proposed directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1539700200,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their replies.

I acknowledge the initiative by Commissioner Phil Hogan in prioritising the imbalance in the food supply chain and recognising the vulnerability of producers in it.<\/p> <p>  Some members may be asking what a UTP is.  Everyday examples of UTPs are late payment for goods, cancellation at short notice of perishable food product orders, changing the terms of a contract without any notice, or a retailer charging the supplier for wastage of food products incurred on the shop floor.  The IFA has campaigned for many years, both at home with Governments and throughout Europe, for a rebalancing of power in the food supply chain to deliver a viable price for farmers and a return on their work and investment.<\/p> <p>  In November 2016, the Agricultural Markets Task Force, AMTF, made recommendations on how to improve the position of farmers in the agrifood supply chain.  It was recommended, among other things, that the European Commission would take steps to introduce a harmonised baseline of prohibited UTPs in member states and further increase market transparency of processors and retailers' prices, especially in the meat, dairy, fruit and vegetable sectors, by collecting and reporting such data in the chain.  It was also recommended that the Commission foresee effective enforcements of UTPs by an independent public body to be set up by the member states.<\/p> <p>  In Brussels, I, as chairman of the COPA 1 and COGECA 2 group on the food supply chain, have been leading the campaign on retail dominance and UTPs on behalf of European farmers.  The 2017 CAP consultation showed that 97% of EU consumers are in favour of the farmer getting a better share of the retail price.<\/p> <p>  To quantify the economic impact of UTPs in the agrifood sector, COPA and COGECA commissioned an independent study that showed that 94% of farmers and 95% of agrico-operatives had been exposed at least once to UTPs.  The most striking finding of this study, however, is that UTPs have cost farmers and agrico-operatives &euro;10.9 billion annually in the European Union.  In recent years, we have had an intensive lobby campaign to curb this activity, targeting members of the European Parliament, the College of Commissioners and a number of directorates general in Brussels, primarily those concerned with agriculture and competition.<\/p> <p>  Across member states, there is recurring evidence of large retailers dominating the market with excessive buying power and dictating price levels to farmers, often driving prices to uneconomic levels and even below the cost of production.  In Ireland, for example, the biggest three retailers &ndash; Tesco, Supervalu\/Centra, and Dunnes Stores &ndash; have almost 70% of the market share.  When Aldi and Lidl are included, this brings the figure up to 94%.  In Finland, two retailers have an 85% market share, and, in France, the top three have a 56% market share.  The message is clear: we need unequivocal and immediate action to curb UTPs at EU level.<\/p> <p>  The directive we are discussing provides for the introduction of a minimum common standard of protection across member states, which is welcome.  This is but a first step in reining in retailers and rebalancing power in the food chain.  It should form part of a wider effort in recognising powerful actors in the supply chain, which contribute to the imbalance between downstream and upstream players in the chain.  The European Parliament, under the stewardship of rapporteur, Mr. Paolo De Castro, an Italian MEP, has approved the draft legislation.  I recently chaired the COPA-COGECA food chain meeting in Brussels, where Mr. De Castro took our members through the European Parliament amendments and positions.  There has been a call for the scope to be broadened to include all actors in the food supply chain.  The EU Council has also supported the Commission's proposal, with a view to adoption in December.<\/p> <p>  Members will be aware that, in 2016, the Government introduced the grocery goods regulations, which provide for the control of certain UTPs between large supermarkets and wholesalers and their direct suppliers of food and drink products in the grocery goods sector in Ireland.  It is the remit of the CCPC to enforce these regulations.  Specifically, the Irish regulations relate to the direct business relationship between suppliers and wholesalers and retailers of food and drink operating in the country that have a worldwide turnover in excess of &euro;50 million.<\/p><p>The scope of the draft EU directive will apply to certain UTPs that occur in regard to the sales of food products by a supplier that is a small or medium-sized enterprise to a buyer that is not such an enterprise.  It will, therefore, apply to the sales of food products only by a supplier that has a turnover of less than &euro;50 million to a buyer that has a turnover of more than &euro;50 million.  This means it will apply to a farmer supplying a co-operative or meat factory, but not to the co-operative or meat factory supplying a retailer.  The IFA's position is that the EU directive should apply to the entire food supply chain.  This is also the position of COPA and COGECA.<\/p><p> The proposed directive aims to reduce the occurrence of UTPs in the chain by introducing a minimum common standard of protection across the EU that consists of a shortlist of specific prohibited UTPs and leaves member states room to keep or provide for farther-reaching measures.  It sets down provisions targeting minimum enforcement requirements applying to national competent authorities.  It sets down a co-ordination mechanism between enforcement authorities facilitated by the Commission to enable the exchange of data concerning the number and types of infringement investigations carried out and of best practices with a view to improving the effectiveness of enforcement.  It references the UK Groceries Code Adjudicator as a role model.  It is going down the subsidiarity route, to complement existing arrangements in member states, which will have to transpose the UTP rules into national law.  Twenty member states, including Ireland, have legislation in this area.<\/p><p> As the IFA understands it, the draft EU directive is not compatible with the grocery goods regulations 2016, primarily because of the scope of the proposed EU legislation.  This was acknowledged by the CCPC earlier.<\/p><p> The proposed directive sets out to prohibit the following UTPs but makes no mention of a contract; payment later than 30 days; cancelling orders of perishable food products at short notice; the buyer changing unilaterally and retroactively the terms of the supply agreement on frequency, timing, or volume; and the supplier paying for the wastage of food products incurred on the buyer's premises.  The IFA queries how, in the absence of a written supply contract, these four UTPs can be proven and outlawed.<\/p><p> The directive requires member states to ensure the following specified UTPs are prohibited, unless they are agreed in a supply contract: the buyer returning unsold food products; the buyer charging a supplier payment to secure or maintain a supply agreement; the supplier paying for the promotion of food products sold by the buyer; and the supplier paying for the marketing of food products by the buyer.<\/p><p> The grocery goods regulations provide for a greater list of UTPs.  The IFA has called on the European Parliament to strengthen the legislation by adding other UTPs in order that producers have clear written contracts and to tackle abuses by retailers, including unsustainable discounting or below-cost selling, annual tendering by retailers, and payment for retention or better positioning of shelf space.<\/p><p> The draft directive provides for the designation of \"a public authority\" for the purpose of enforcement.  The IFA's experience is that an independent retail regulator with a specific remit is required.  It would be similar to the UK Groceries Code Adjudicator, which has proved to be a game-changer.  In Ireland's case, this function is being subsumed in the CCPC, where its effectiveness is lost.  The proposed directive holds up the UK model as best practice, and this is the model that the IFA wants the Government to follow.  I imagine the meeting at the airport to which Deputy Cahill was referring was the one we organised and to which we invited the UK groceries regulator, Ms Christine Tacon.<\/p><p> The biggest issue for farmers is that they have no confidence in the CCPC to enforce the regulations.  The IFA notes that, in September, the commission announced it is about to start inspections in the grocery sector to ensure traders are complying with their obligations.  This is welcome but it should have happened much sooner.<\/p><p>The regulations were introduced in April 2016 and most farmers supplying the retailers, either directly or indirectly through a wholesaler, have no contracts.  This is a blatant breach of the regulations and the commission has been invisible in the policing and enforcing of them.  The establishment by the Government of a visible and active independent retail regulator would give confidence to suppliers that their complaints would be taken seriously and pursued.<\/p><p> Following this directive to address unfair trading practices, Commissioner Hogan is working towards bringing in an implementing Act that will address market transparency with the aim of having mandatory price reporting by member states.  The IFA has called for this at all levels in the food chain so that margins and the profitability of processors and retailers are clearly visible.  The figures do not lie.  If we look at the euro the consumer spends on the various commodities across the European Union, the retailer gets 51 cent, the processor gets 28 cent, and the farmer is left with 21 cent.<\/p><p> In conclusion, it is clear that farmers are not getting a fair share of the retail price, retailers are the modern day dictators, abusing their power to accumulate vast profits and the current situation, whereby processors and retailers always make a margin while farmers are sometimes forced to produce at or below the cost of production, is totally unacceptable.  We need the Government to transpose, without delay, the EU directive when it has been adopted in Brussels.  To be effective this will require the appointment of an independent retail regulator with a specific remit - and I note the comments made by Ms Goggin in her presentation earlier - and that the regulator&rsquo;s remit now be expanded to provide the European Commission with the mandatory price reporting required to comply with the transparency legislation that is to follow in the coming months.  I ask the committee to support our request and to ensure a rebalancing in the food supply chain so that the farmer can get a fairer share.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#U00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539700200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and his fellow members of the committee for the invitation to contribute on the unfair trading practices.  I will briefly outline the issues as the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, sees them.  In April, the European Commission and the Commissioner unveiled a draft directive which seeks to ban the most damaging unfair trading practices, namely late payments for perishable food products, last minute order cancellations, unilateral or retroactive changes to contracts, and methods which force the supplier to pay for the wasted products or waste food.<\/p> <p>  The ICMSA has always believed that a properly functioning food supply chain in the EU is central to ensuring that EU farmers and EU farm families receive a fair share of the final consumer price and an income comparable with that of other sectors.  Farmers have consistently lost out.  The figures stack up.  In 1983 there were 66,000 dairy farmers; today there are less than 18,000.  This is due to the concentration of market power and an unequal bargaining position among the various parties along the food supply chain.  With the continuing growth and concentration of firms at the farm input stage, in food processing and in food retailing, it has swung even more to the detriment of the family farm in recent times.<\/p> <p>  The relatively vulnerable position of farmers in the food chain invariably means that we bear a disproportionate share of the risks within the food chain.  The key to improving margins for farmers is to bring about a properly functioning EU food supply chain at processor and at retail level.  This would mean that farmers would receive a return that covers their cost of production and leaves a reasonable income for the farm family.<\/p> <p>  There is considerable agreement, across the political spectrum and in virtually every member state, that the EU food market is not operating efficiently or fairly and that farmers and consumers are both losing out.  The proper functioning of the food chain in the EU is central to the favourable development of the market income of EU farmers.  Addressing unfair trading practices in the food sector is not an easy task and is likely to be an ongoing concern particularly due to the likelihood of increased volatility in world agricultural markets - Brexit is coming around the corner, for example - and increased emphasis on food security.  The ICMSA particularly welcomes the acknowledgement in the draft directive that \"When occurring, UTPs can put operators' profits and margins under pressure, which can result in a misallocation of resources and even drive otherwise viable and competitive players out of business.\"<\/p><p>The ICMSA supports this logical conclusion, that EU level measures are required.  Certainly from an Irish perspective, given that 85% of our dairy produce is exported, it is very necessary that measures be enacted at the EU level.  Clearly, Ireland has a major interest in the proper and transparent functioning of EU agricultural markets as a result and the ICMSA believes this is a step forward.  Indeed, we recently submitted a submission focusing on market transparency which is a key ingredient to go with unfair trading practices.<\/p><p> The Commission&rsquo;s proposals to tackle unfair trading practices are a step in the right direction to ensure fair market prices for farmers and to address the current power imbalances.  Regulatory issues can only be effectively addressed at EU level given that many, if not most, of the major food retailing and processing companies operate in more than one member state.  No individual member state can effectively address this problem by national legislation or regulations, therefore EU regulation and enforcement is required.<\/p><p> Specifically on the directive objective for unfair trading practices, the EU Commission has stated in previous communications on tackling unfair trading practices in the business-to-business food supply chain that increased concentration and vertical integration of market participants across the EU have led to structural changes in the food supply chain.  That is very evident.  The EU Commission rightly concludes that, while differences in bargaining power are common and legitimate commercial relationships, it is the abuse of such differences that lead to unfair trading practices. The four practices as outlined should lead to more equality in the supply chain if implemented correctly.<\/p><p> An unfair trading practice that has gained much notoriety within agricultural sectors is the use of products such as milk or vegetables as loss leaders in order for retailers to gain market share.  This practice must be outlawed and legislated for as it strikes at the core of agricultural products and undermines the viability of family farms.  We believe that omitting below-cost-selling would be an error of such magnitude that it would effectively undermine the whole drive to reform and make more fair the supply chain from farmer to producer to retailer.  Unfair trading practices are a win-win for retailers.  They do not carry the loss for the below-cost food because they just drop the price back to the food producers or suppliers and, ultimately, back to the primary producer.  They win as a result of increased sales of other items arising from increased footfall.  Below-cost selling is not just an unfair trading practice, it is a sheer abuse of dominant corporate retailer power.<\/p><p> Additionally, new laws relating to unfair trading practices in the food supply chain should not add an additional bureaucratic layer upon farmers.  That is absolutely critical.  The EU and Ireland should note and consider the French legislation called the field-to-fork review which is a response to the fact that farmers bear the brunt of price wars between retailers.  Under the legislation, the French Government will be allowed to raise the threshold below which retailers cannot sell food products.  The increase in the resale below-cost threshold caters for the inclusion of additional costs such as retailer logistics and staff.  The Bill also empowers the Government to curb promotional offers.  Retailers will not be allowed to discount products by more than 34% of their value or sell more than 25% of a product&rsquo;s volume in a promotional offer.  <\/p><p> The ICMSA feels that the proposals outlined in the draft document must be implemented with a view to improving overall market information in food production.  The draft directive must broaden its remit to include more market transparency and monitoring and must ensure that these objectives are being measured and implemented.  Effective monitoring of the food sector to ensure proper functioning and competition requires detailed data and information including the direct monitoring and publication of margins of large food companies and particular production lines.<\/p><p> We also have some concerns about some specific parts of the draft directive and, in this context, we feel it is right to outline these for the committee.  The ICMSA has concerns for farmers and their product purchasers as contract law may supersede this directive and make some of the proposals null and void.<\/p><p>For example, the ICMSA has concerns regarding Article 3 and the payment within 30 days or one month.  Our members feel that they are disadvantaged under this proposal and believe that the timescale should be shortened to 20 days at a maximum, or that the product purchasers should not be allowed to increase their payment intervals to 30 days.<\/p><p> In the context of a quality pricing system in the beef industry, we believe these articles can be used to contest the use of such a scheme when there is no difference in quality.  The draft certainly needs to be scrutinised more closely in the context of returns.  The return to the producer is widespread and obvious.  There is a need to consider the position regarding processors, marketers and retailers.<\/p><p> I will leave it at that.  We have also submitted a broader statement, which has been read before now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat McCormack","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539700200,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear.  I will try to be brief and not repeat, to any great extent, the good points already made by Mr. McCormack and Mr. Healy.<br\/><br\/>The Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, very much welcomes the EU initiative to tackle UTPs in the food supply chain. Farmer-owned co-operatives play an important role in that chain.  They integrate the roles of the producer, processor, and marketer in order to add value and increase the economic weight of farmers.  ICOS supports action which will further protect farmers and their co-operatives and create a fairer and more equitable food supply chain.  We wholly support the aims of the proposed directive, which seeks to prohibit certain UTPs across the EU.  Many of these are practices to which Irish co-operatives are still continuously subject in Ireland and in EU export markets.<br\/><br\/>ICOS equally supports the proposal to establish an independent regulator in each EU member state to act upon anonymous complaints and address abuses through the use of sanctions, which is greatly necessary in our own approach.  With many Irish co-operatives exporting to other EU countries and beyond, the current landscape of varied national legislation and mechanisms to address UTPs is a cause for concern.  We have found that the <i>status quo<\/i>provides inadequate enforcement and is contributing to a fragmented Internal Market.  These features of the proposal are vital in order to ensure that the directive addresses the pitfalls of the varied and voluntary EU approach.<br\/><br\/>I wish to highlight three aspects of the draft directive about which we are particularly concerned and which we feel need to be addressed in the final agreed text of the directive in order to protect the functioning of farmer-owned co-operatives and enhance the effectiveness of the directive overall.  First, the directive must protect co-operatives and respect their functioning.  Farmer-owned co-operatives are the most effective way of increasing the bargaining power of farmers, which is the ultimate goal of this initiative.  The directive must take account of the unique relationship between a co-operative and its members, which is not simply one of buyer and supplier but, rather, one of member, owner and decision maker.  This is why we are very supportive of the proposed wording in the Council's draft directive regarding payment terms, which will protect the current structures within the dairy co-operative sector in Ireland.  It introduces wording relating to instances where a producer does not provide an invoice to his buyer, rather - as in our dairy sector - the co-operative provides an invoice to the supplier with an analysis of the delivered milk&rsquo;s contents.  The new wording would allow for the continuation of the market-oriented and democratic price-setting structures in our dairy co-operatives.  This is vital and greatly welcomed.<br\/><br\/>Second, we wish to emphasise that UTPs are unfair and damaging to all businesses, regardless of size.  If a practice is recognised within the directive as being unfair and contrary to good commercial conduct, it should be prohibited in all cases.  A total of 90% of Irish co-operatives are small to medium enterprises, SMEs.  The remaining 10%, however, represent the vast majority of the Irish dairy production pool.  In order to ensure protection for the vast majority of Irish dairy farmers, it is necessary to include non-SME suppliers within the scope of the directive.  In addition, approximately 90% of retailers in the EU are SMEs and are excluded from the current scope of the directive.  The size of businesses should not entitle buyers to use UTPs.<br\/><br\/>ICOS is also concerned about the impact of this scope on the competitiveness of SME co-ops.  There is little incentive for a buyer to choose an SME supplier over its non-SME neighbour if that buyer knows that the latter has more flexibility regarding payment terms and that it will be possible to impose additional fees in contracts with such a supplier.  In order to create a truly level playing field for farmers, co-operatives and their downstream buyers and prevent competition distortions, ICOS feels strongly that the legislation must be applicable to all businesses.<\/p><p>Lastly, but by no means least, the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS has long highlighted the unfair trading practices Irish farmers are subject to by meat processors in Ireland, and in particular the penalties imposed by the quality payment system on more than four movements between farms prior to slaughter or movement within the last 70 days before slaughter, as Mr. McCormack has already mentioned.  These issues are not addressed in the list of unfair trading practices, UTPs,  proposed by the Commission's draft directive.  We call for the list of prohibited UTPs to be extended to cover these practices that are subverting the free trade of factory-fed cattle in Ireland, stifling competition and hugely damaging the impact on prices of the entire livestock industry.  ICOS would like to see a provision that is already included in the European Parliament report within the list of prohibited UTPs that relate to the unilateral imposition of quality standards that are not based on current legislation, quality schemes, science or current practices, and which have a distorting effect on free trade.<\/p><p> I welcome any questions that committee members might have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Alison Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539700200,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Retail Ireland is the representative body for the entire retail sector in Ireland and its membership includes major supermarket groups, symbol groups and independent retailers.  Retail is Ireland's largest industry and largest employer, with a presence in every city, town and village, right across the country.  The sector employs more than 285,000 people and contributes more than &euro;7 billion, which is 23% of total tax take, each year.<\/p> <p>  Retail Ireland and its members have some concerns regarding the effect certain aspects of the current draft EU directive on UTPs may have on the grocery trade and on consumers in Ireland in the longer term.  We believe that certain aspects within the directive may have the potential for market distortion should some or all of them be introduced.  Retailers in Ireland have been working closely and effectively with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and their suppliers, to embed the grocery goods regulations introduced in 2016.  This has been a complex, administratively burdensome and costly process.  It is widely accepted, however, that this process is thus far functioning well and the commitment from all parties has been fulsome.<\/p> <p>  Given how recently this process was completed, a further layer of legislation in the form of an EU directive governing this area, at this time, is unhelpful and potentially confusing for all parties to the regulations.  We must also consider the potential for the scope of this directive to grow over time and supersede domestic regulations, which now exist in over 20 member states as Mr. McCormack has already said.  National legislation is the most appropriate place to deal with the sensitivities and intricacies of the Irish retail grocery market and it should remain the primary route for addressing any concerns around how it functions.<\/p> <p>  Retailers consider farmers as key partners in the food supply chain and support measures that can directly address the problems farmers face.  At an EU level, a critical mass of retailers are already applying principles of good practice in business to business relationships under the supply chain initiative.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of Retail Ireland I shall now turn to specific observations on the draft directive.  Prohibited practices should be clearly defined to provide legal certainty: The directive provides for strict enforcement and sanctions, and it is key that it provides legal certainty to operators so as to avoid the risk of unjustified interpretation by member states, making reputable operators potentially vulnerable to disproportionate sanctions.<\/p> <p>  The scope of the directive should not be extended beyond small farmers and processors.  The directive is based on the agricultural treaty provisions and should focus on the benefits accruing to farmers.  By extending the scope to all food products and SME processors, the Commission is already stretching its powers under Article 43 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Any attempt to extend the scope of the directive would run against the Commission's impact assessment.  Regulating trading practices between large processors, including global brands, and retailers would affect parts of the supply chain fundamentally outside the scope of Article 43.  More important, it will skew the relationship towards these large processors, with no guarantee that the benefits will accrue to farmers.<\/p> <p>  Flexibility and subsidiarity must be preserved while not undermining the Single Market.  All EU countries, including Ireland, have legislative frameworks in place and most have specific enforcement provisions.  The overwhelming majority of supply contracts are national and subject to national law.  We ask that provisions within the directive are kept to a strict minimum common denominator and allow for a degree of flexibility so as to allow schemes that have proven to work well to continue.  These have arisen out of a national context and relate to national structures.  Member states should be allowed to extend the powers of an existing authority and not have to set up a dedicated one for the purposes of the directive.<\/p> <p>  The list of prohibited and restricted practices must be kept to a minimum and focus on contractual relationships between farmers and their first buyers.  Freedom of contract and of negotiation is important in ensuring that retailers are able to deliver the best products to consumers at a reasonable price.  This freedom must be preserved, and legislation must allow trading partners to engage in agreements that deliver a benefit to both parties.  The list of prohibited practices must therefore be strictly limited to clearly defined practices, such as unilateral ex-post modifications of contracts, where the conditions were not previously agreed upon by the parties.<\/p><p>As per the remit of the directive, the focus should be on contractual relationships between small farmers and their first buyer.  Lawmakers should resist adding a series of unnecessary and intrusive provisions which will undermine usual and perfectly legitimate commercial dealings and will simply create additional costs and benefit neither farmers nor consumers.  In this regard, we are concerned at the proposed amendments emanating from the European Parliament, which include limitations on environmental or animal welfare standards and prohibitions on retail and wholesale buying groups that would have a significant impact upon thousands of independent retailers throughout the country that provide significant employment.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>On complaint mechanisms, the directive establishes a right to complain for small suppliers in respect of large buyers.  Article 48 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights requires that enforcement powers include a right of defence, including access to facts relating to a complaint, and appeal.  These need to be fully reflected in the directive; currently, they are not.  <br\/><br\/>Mediation and other alternative dispute resolution mechanisms should be promoted as an efficient means of solving disputes.  Public enforcement can be costly and adversarial, with a risk of termination of any business relationship between the parties.  Dialogue and mediation have proven to offer quick and efficient means of solving disputes in ways that allow business to continue.  Public enforcement should only be sought as a last resort in the context of limited Government resources.  Provisions on the role of mediation should be introduced.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>As most contracts are negotiated annually, we ask that the directive foresees a reasonable transposition period of two years and continues to allow for its provisions to apply to new contracts negotiated after transposition.  Retailers manage contracts with thousands of suppliers to provide consumers with a wide choice of products that meet their expectations and serve their needs.  Renegotiating contracts halfway through their execution can simply not be put in practice.<br\/><br\/>On behalf of all Retail Ireland member companies, I thank the committee for affording us this opportunity to submit our views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#Z00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thomas Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539700200,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Burke.

That was the message.  It is outside the commission's remit.  It has been working on behalf of the consumer and wants to continue doing that and it sees this directive almost in conflict with that.<\/p> <p>  I was looking at the back of Adam Smith's \"The Wealth of Nations\" in a bookshop is Sligo the other day.  It was written in 1776 and he is the hero of capitalism.  Throughout that, he talks about how the free market rules but he also, in every chapter, talks about how the firm hand of government must control it.  There was one section of it that said that never did two or more merchants come together for the simplest of conversations but the conversation turned to fixing the market.  The government has to have a hand in there to ensure fair play.  That is what this is about.  The Government has to play its role and the EU is saying that through this directive.  The Government has to come in and ensure fair play and a decent price is given to the primary producer.  That is what we need to do in all of this.<\/p> <p>  Contracts are vital, and they were mentioned from a retail perspective.  I understand retailers must have contracts, but very often the problem is there is no contract, or the contract is a very loose one that they can get out of.  That needs to be tidied up.  Standards need to be put in place so contracts cannot be wriggled out of as easily as they have been in the past and cannot be as loose as they have been.<\/p> <p>  The primary producer must get a fair price.  If that is to happen, it is about the market, but it is also about ensuring the common good of society is served.  If the common good is going to be served, the thousands of farmers in this country who produce excellent food need to be able to make a living.  That is the common good.  That is what this needs to be about.<\/p> <p>  My questions have been answered, by and large, in the witnesses' submissions.  We need to support the concept of the establishment of a directorate to pursue this solely on the basis of looking after the interests of the common good.<\/p><p>If it is going to look after the interests of the common good, the retail sector would also be well served.  There should not be resistance between the two.  There must be a sense of ensuring that we do this in a balanced way.  Balance has been mentioned several times but there is no balance at the moment.  That is why we are here.  If we are going to move forward, we must recognise that.  There must be recognition from the retail sector, particularly the large retailers, and the big processors.<\/p><p> The meat industry was mentioned.  There are rules and regulations in the beef sector in the context of U-grade meat, O-grade meat and so on.  I never know the grade of a piece of meat I buy from a shop.  People who work in the facilities state that if there is an order to be filled, it is filled regardless of what grade a farmer has received.  That is the reality.  Many of the regulations that have been put in place, particularly by the processors, are a mechanism to push down the price to the farmer.  That needs to be recognised.  That is one of the things that needs to come into play here.  Whoever takes on the role or whatever structure is set up must have sharp teeth in order to take charge of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#AA00300","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539700200,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I thank the delegations for their informative presentations.  I am grateful for the work they put into them.<\/p> <p>  I was not shocked by what the CCPC said earlier.  It is something that I knew was happening because its role is primarily to protect consumers.  It was just an add-on to the legislation to subsume the function of a sectoral regulator in a half-hearted way.  The CCPC was not given much power by the Government in its remit.  It has a different role.  I agree with Mr. Healy's presentation that the CCPC was not effective because it was never meant to be effective.  It was a cosmetic exercise.  The witnesses from the CCPC mentioned the issue of trying to secure evidence.  I understand the need for the primary evidence rule to the effect that the people, company or stakeholder affected must bring forward the case.  However, nobody scratched themselves too hard to try to assist people.<\/p> <p>  We are all aware of the power of market concentration invested in a small number of powerful wholesalers and retailers and the way they can do business and how that creates an unequal playing field and unequal bargaining power.  The current food supply chain is haphazard and not functioning; it is potluck.  It is an age-old problem which must be tackled at transnational or EU level.  It cannot be tackled independently.  In fairness to Commissioner Hogan, he was a Deputy when this all started so at least he learned in the Oireachtas that this was not going to happen on its own.  For once, he did something right.<\/p> <p>  There were problems in the vegetable market whereby consumers were getting vegetables for a couple of cents.  The industry could not survive.  That then extended to the market for milk.  I do not need to go through the detail in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I am fascinated that the French have never been subservient to EU law.  I have always admired them for that.  Our big problem has been that we have accepted everything hook, line and sinker.  We were terrified of being caught offside and brought before the European Court of Justice.  The French have never given a damn.  Mr. McCormack outlined that they took steps and grabbed the ball in order to protect their farmers.  The position is that farmers here are getting less than a third of the overall price and, if something does not happen soon, they are not going to survive in any event.<\/p> <p>  This is the last chance saloon.  I look forward to the implementation of the directive.  It should have direct effect.  There should be no pussyfooting around.  It should penetrate down to the legislative chambers here and there should be no diversion.  The only thing we should be doing is strengthen it as it comes along.<\/p><p>I understand where IBEC is coming from.  Perhaps the witnesses are coming at it from a different perspective.  We are coming at it very strongly from an agricultural perspective.  I understand the witnesses do not want another layer of bureaucracy.  The various points the witnesses set out have merit.  Is there a difference of opinion between ICOS and the two farming organisations on how far this should extend?  Do I detect that?  I noticed both the farming organisations were wondering if they should extend right through the co-operative movement and the full supply chain.  Does that include going into the co-operative movement even though the farmers are members of the co-operative movement and making a decision at that level?  Does that create a difficulty or am I misreading the situation?  Will the witnesses reply to that?  Both farming organisations made references in their presentations, some direct and others oblique.  I would like clarification on that because it might create a little difficulty in terms of the ICOS model.  It might be difficult to implement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#BB00200","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539700200,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives of all the organisations for coming in and making very coherent presentations.  Members of the farming community who are engaging in this process and asking what it will ultimately mean for them will welcome that the overall objective is to ensure a fair standard of living for agricultural producers but how that impacts in practice will be the key litmus test.  As a primarily export producing agricultural nation, it is key that the measures are being done at European level because the domestic level represents only a small part of the sector.  The key recurring issue domestically is price.  Our biggest issues are in our beef sector where farmers sell to the factories; the price farmers are getting for milk; and sheep farming in terms of the engagement between farmers and producer groups and factories.  The key question they will be asking with regard to the impact of this directive and its market transparency aspects is how will it impact on the very imbalanced relationship they have with those they sell their produce to, notably the meat factories.  In terms of how this will feed down and ensure a fair price and a fair slice of the overall cake for the primary producers domestically, do the witnesses see this making a real impact and changing that dynamic?  If not, are there additional steps that could be taken to strengthen the directive to try to ensure it resets the dynamic between farmers and the factories in particular?<\/p> <p>  Ms Graham mentioned the 70 day rule and the penalties if there are more than four movements.

The vast majority of us in the room are agreed that something has to be done and done quickly.  Do the witnesses feel the directive will go far enough to solving the problems of the primary producer?  I will address a question to Ms Alison Graham, the ICOS representative.  On the dairy side, farmers control the co-operatives.<\/p><p>There is civil war when the battle starts for market share in the liquid milk trade.  The person who supplies the milk is the only one who pays for that.  We can blame the retailer and say he or she is the big bad man or woman in the room but co-operatives, which farmers own, cut each other's throats to get market share.  I cannot see this directive solving that problem.<\/p><p> Meat factories are not farmer controlled anymore.  Farmers had a bad experience in the meat business.  The same thing happens in that industry at home or in markets in other countries.  Irish factories are competing against each other and it is all about market share.  <\/p><p> Mr. McCormack made a point about promotional gimmicks and they are a way in which retailers have, in the past, managed to get serious concessions from processors.  That needs to be controlled and outlawed, whether it is 25% free, or buy two packs and get another free.  The cost of carrying that cannot be continued.<\/p><p> I asked a question to the first group of witnesses today about the percentage the consumer is spending on food today, compared to ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  Mr. Burke made a strong point from the retailers' side of the equation.  The reality is the primary producer is getting squeezed again and again.  It is not tenable.  There are things on the producer's side that have to be got right as well and this unending competition for market share looks grand when one wins a contract, but it comes at a serious cost.  The primary producer is the one who is paying for it.<\/p><p> Are Mr. McCormack and Mr. Healy confident this directive will do what we, at this side of the table, want it to do, namely, ensure a fair price for the primary producer?

This is a special and unique relationship that has been recognised in the legislation of many nations relating to unfair trading practices in the various EU member states.  It is included in national legislation in Italy and France.  We would like to see similar recognition included within the EU directive.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned one area where the ICOS recognised a potential problem in the current draft proposed directive about the payment terms within dairy co-operatives.  This relates to the specific nature of the dairy co-operatives sector.  To put it simply and quickly, a dairy farmer receives a monthly milk cheque.  The price for that milk is decided by the elected co-operative board in the middle of the month for the preceding month's supply.  This week, for example, the dairy boards are meeting and setting the price for September's milk.  This means milk that was supplied in the first two weeks of September, under the draft EU directive the Commission is proposing, would be outside the 30-day deadline.  However, the wording that has been introduced by the Council directive makes allowance for the particular nature of the dairy sector because normally, in the course of a supply agreement in many other sectors, an invoice would be provided by the supplier at the end of a month for the produce which has been supplied.<\/p><p>This does not take place in the dairy sector because the processor must do an analysis of the milk's content.  The processor provides a receipt recording the volume, the percentage of fats and the percentage of protein, which is the basis of the milk price, as well as an overall analysis of the milk's quality.  Where no invoice is provided by the supplier to the co-operative, the co-operative provides the invoice.  In these cases the 30 day countdown begins on the date of delivery of the milk, which would put milk delivered in the first two weeks of the month outside the 30 day deadline.  We favour the wording Ireland is introducing at the Council because it makes an allowance for cases where an invoice is not provided by the supplier but by the buyer.  This allows for the 30 day timeline to begin at the end of the month long delivery period during the course of the supply agreement.<\/p><p> The 70 day rule and the four-move penalty were mentioned.  There is no good reason a restriction is placed on the number of movements, or on movement within 70 days before cattle are sent to a slaughter house.  This rule is in the scheme purely to distort trade and to stifle competition.  Meat factories do not want to be bidding against each other at a mart but would prefer cattle to be sent directly to the processors so that they can set the price rather than increasing the prices they would have to pay for cattle, which would happen if they bid against each other.<\/p><p> There was a question on the liquid milk market.  This is a highly competitive sector in Ireland and retailers can take advantage of that.  If we saw higher standards applied to all suppliers with regard to what is acceptable within contracts, and the prohibition of certain unfair trading practices for all suppliers, it would have advantages for co-operatives in terms of what they get for their contracts in the liquid milk market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#DD00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Alison Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539700200,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Mr. Burke might give the perspective of retailers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#EE00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539700200,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Deputy Penrose commented on the effectiveness or otherwise of the CCPC regulations but I would caution against an early judgment on them as the regulations have only been in place for less than two years.

A risk officer has been appointed in each of our member companies to oversee compliance and retailers have been working with the CCPC to make sure they are in compliance with the rules as they are laid out.<\/p> <p>  There are misconceptions of the margins and other things in the retail sector.  The traditional retail model operates on a margin of between 1% and 3%, which is vastly different from that of some of the very large multinationals and branded goods companies, which potentially stand to benefit from the directive as it is currently structured.  The proposal to extend the remit to all actors in the supply chain would significantly benefit those multinational companies, which operate at margins of between 30% and 40%.  The relationship is inverse in the case of those particular companies so we would caution against an extension to include them.<\/p> <p>  Some points were made about the relationship between farmers and retailers.<\/p><p>In the vast majority of instances there is an individual who is an intermediate between the two.  It is rare for there to be a relationship directly between the farmer and the retailer, with only 5% of European contracts agreed directly between retailers and farmers.  The person in the middle is usually a processor or some such person.<\/p><p> It is not in the interest of retailers that the farming sector is in any way disadvantaged or left in an unsustainable position.  We have a very good relationship with farmers and each of our individual companies has spent a lot of time, money and effort to ensure Irish produce is profiled, not only in the local market but on international stages in the UK and beyond.  As an industry we are extremely committed to this.  We want a good deal for farmers but this cannot be at the expense of retailers or consumers, who ultimately pick up the tab.  In a sector with a margin of between 1% and 3%, we are very concerned at some of the amendments which have arisen out of the parliamentary process, particularly those which seek to impose only legally binding standards.  We do not believe it is in farmers' interests to drive standards down.  This is particularly the case with respect to Irish farmers, who have among the highest standards in the world, something we should use as a marketing tool.  Anything that dumbs down standards is not in the interests of retailers or the farming community.<\/p><p> We are also very concerned about the suggestion that retail buying groups should be outlawed.  The Irish retail model is a unique one and we have been very successful in building a raft of Irish retail entrepreneurs who have operated stores all around the country, in every single town and village in the members' constituencies.  They have worked hard and the suggestion that it be unlawful for them to join symbol groups, or align with brands to form a retail buying group, is of great concern and one of the most worrying aspects to have arisen from the process thus far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#EE00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thomas Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539700200,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I will make a few specific comments first and follow them with responses to the questions that were posed.  Deputy Penrose asked about the co-operatives.  If they are in the co-operative ethos and act for the benefit of their members, they should have no fear of this regulation, which will scrutinise board members and the work they do for their electorate.  We could have a debate about whether much of the milk in this country is processed by a co-operative, a plc or a plc that is trying to be a co-operative.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue asked about the 70 day rule.  The ICMSA believes that if an animal is on a quality assured farm and moves to another quality assured farm it should still be entitled to all the quality assurance bonuses that are available, irrespective of whether the movement was in the final 70 days or not.  The four-move rule can be restrictive because people sell for various reasons.

We can take it as the first step in providing transparency and fair play in terms of the price returned to the primary producer.<\/p> <p>  I do not altogether agree with Mr. Burke about consumers picking up the tab.  The expectation of consumers is beyond belief, with the primary producer being asked to do more and more, for less and less, and at a higher standard.  That is unsustainable.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Minister and all bodies involved in the promotion of our produce, 85% or 90% of which is exported, promote the family farm structure to the exclusion of all others.  This is because it is the most sustainable from a political point of view.<\/p><p>It is the most sustainable from an environmental point of view but that family farm structure needs to be made economically sustainable.

Deputy Martin Kenny must have bought that book because he read a good bit of it.  He would never have been left standing in the shop that long.  There are good lines in it.  A line in my presentation stated that we believe the directive should apply to the full food supply chain.  This position has also been accepted by COPA-COGECA.  Ms Graham covered that earlier.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cahill asked about percentages.  If we go back to the 1960s, we can see that 30% of average household income was being spent on food.  Depending on where someone is in Europe, somewhere between 10% and 15% of the average household income is spent on food.  Apart from three tiny increases in 2011, 2012 and 2013, consumer spending on food has dropped.  We saw it in 2008, 2009 and 2010 and in the past three years.  The consumer is getting very good value.  <\/p> <p>  We need to avoid unsustainable discounting.  There is no need for it - be it with regard to milk or vegetables.  We have seen that at various times during the year, particularly at Christmas.  I do not think it happened last Christmas with vegetables but it happened the previous year.  It was said earlier that this unsustainable discounting is an insult to the producer and the food.  It adds to food waste.  While someone said earlier that cheap food was good for the consumer, it is not really good for them.  It will put farmers, businesses and retailers out of business because it is a race to the bottom.  We have spoken to retailers who have told us that there is no need for them to lower prices and that they do not wish to lower them but that they have to follow the pack.  If one or two have gone before them, they feel they must go there as well in order to maintain market share.  This race to the bottom is not good for anyone.  We talk about many strands of sustainability such as social or environmental sustainability but the sustainability of the farmer and producer of the raw material must be paramount.  <\/p> <p>  To borrow Mr. McCormack's words, we hope this is a step in the right direction.  It is a bit like the fodder crisis.  Any one solution is not going to be the answer to all ills but it is a good step in the right direction and we need to ensure we support it at all levels, be it at our level or that of the committee.  The important part is that there is a review of the directive after three years so we should watch out for what we might not have got right at the start and make sure we get it right in three years time when the review takes place.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018101600002#GG00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1539700200,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

To assist the members' consideration of the order, I have prepared a briefing note which has been circulated for their information. <\/p> <p>  Section 27(1) of the Competition Act 2002 (as amended) allows the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation to vary monetary thresholds at which undertakings, which are generally companies, must notify the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, of a proposed merger or acquisition.<\/p> <p>  The factors that have been considered in reviewing the merger and acquisition thresholds include examining comparable thresholds in other relevant countries.  The lower current threshold of &euro;3 million was found to be significantly out of sync with comparable jurisdictions. <\/p> <p>  Also of note is the general increase in property prices in recent years and the effect of the Irish economic recovery on the turnover of undertakings.  This has resulted in an increase in undertakings subject to the notifiable thresholds. <\/p> <p>  These matters all pointed to the requirement to revisit the appropriateness of the financial thresholds. <\/p> <p>  A public consultation was conducted by my Department in 2017.  The responses to the public consultation were strongly in favour of an increase to the financial thresholds for proposed merger and acquisition notifications. <\/p> <p>  I have considered the relevant economic data regarding the current thresholds and I have accepted the outcome of the public consultation which concurs with the data.  The CCPC also supports the increase to the financial thresholds for notification of potential mergers or acquisitions as set out in the order. <\/p> <p>  I signed the order on 2 October 2018 to increase the monetary thresholds which will come into effect on 1 January 2019. <\/p> <p>  The effect of the order will be that  the combined turnover of undertakings involved in a proposed merger or acquisition will increase from &euro;50 million to &euro;60 million and the turnover of two or more undertakings involved in a proposed merger or acquisition will increase from &euro;3 million to &euro;10 million. <\/p> <p>  These changes should reduce the administrative and financial burden on smaller enterprises as they will no longer be required to notify the CCPC of proposed mergers or acquisitions and pay the applicable fee of &euro;8,000 and the associated legal costs, which I understand can be of the order of &euro;15,000 upwards. <\/p> <p>  Increasing the financial thresholds will also better align the Irish regime with international norms. <\/p> <p>  I ask that the committee approves the order before it today.

CERN was established in 1954 in a Europe fragmented by the Second World War.  Its objective was &quot;science for peace&quot;, a beacon of hope and collaboration for Europe.  CERN&rsquo;s mission is to push back the frontiers of knowledge, develop new technologies, train the next generation and unite people from different cultures.  All research is open and given freely for the betterment of humankind.  Its success is manifest, allowing it become the premier scientific laboratory in the world.  Its work produced Nobel prizes in 1984, 1992 and 2013, and its benefits to humanity include positron emission tomography, PET, scanners in hospitals, hadron therapy for cancer treatment, touchscreens and the worldwide web.  Simply to be part of this European project is reason enough to join CERN but within this big picture several pragmatic and tangible benefits would accrue to Ireland.  I will list some of these and further details can be found in a booklet prepared in 2014 by the Institute of Physics in Ireland and circulated to the committee.  It is also available online.<br\/><br\/>The first benefit is education and training.  The mode age of CERN users is 27 and that simple fact tells us that the centre is a training academy for the scientists and engineers of the future.  In addition to accommodating thousands of students doing masters and PhDs, the centre has many formal training schemes, including apprenticeships; training partnerships with universities, technical training experience, a graduate engineering training scheme and internships for computer  scientists and engineers.  For undergraduates, it runs a CERN summer student programme, which by special provision has been attended by a few Irish students such as Dr. Aoibhinn N&iacute; Shuilleabh&aacute;in, science presenter on radio and television and a former Rose of Tralee, who is now a mathematics professor at UCD.  For teachers, CERN has a high school physics teacher programme and runs dedicated workshops for teachers in conjunction with departments of education in member state countries.<br\/><br\/>The second benefit is inspiration and outreach.  CERN inspires students and the public.  A survey of UK undergraduates indicates 95% had been inspired by particle physics.  In the UK, almost half the population followed the Higgs discovery on TV or radio.  In Ireland, the switching on of the Large Hadron Collider was widely covered by all news media.  During the Higgs boson announcement, I reported live on RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; directly from CERN.  I would also like to mention an inspiring story of student achievement.  On 22 July 2010, the first glimpse of the Z boson at a Large Hadron Collider experiment by Irish PhD. student James Keaveney was front-page news in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  Two different exhibitions from CERN have come to Ireland, visiting Galway in 2012 and being made possible by funding from Boston Scientific, and visiting Dublin in 2013.  Every year, we run particle physics masterclasses at Irish universities, where secondary school children are particle physicists for the day, analysing Large Hadron Collider data and discussing their results by video-conference with their school peers in other countries.<br\/><br\/>The third benefit is knowledge transfer.  Working at the frontier of what is known and is technologically possible inevitably leads to breakthroughs.  Being part of that leads to opportunities, patents and competitive advantages.  Let us consider Trinity College Dublin student, James Casey, who in 1994, courtesy of his UK passport, was a summer student at CERN working on web technology, two doors down from Tim Berners-Lee.  Today he works on cloud computing and is vice president of partner integration with Seattle-based start-up CHEF.  Another example is given by the companies that worked with CERN to make the most powerful magnets in the world for the Large Hadron Collider.  This has enabled them today to become market leaders in making magnets for magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, machines in hospitals.  A further case study is provided by vacuum engineers at CERN who spun off the technology and set up a company to make much more efficient solar panels.  The science at CERN is powering the future with ideas but such innovation does not spontaneously happen.  It is a result of knowledge gained and &quot;if you are not in, you cannot win&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The fourth benefit relates to micro-electronics and sensors.  This is an important element of our economy and one very well matched to CERN.  The Tyndall Institute in Cork makes radiation sensors that are used in the Large Hadron Collider tunnel.  SensL in Cork, now ON semiconductors, makes silicon photomultipliers and has supplied CERN.  Both producing and exploiting detectors used at the Large Hadron Collider is an opportunity for Irish industry.  Professor Val O&rsquo;Shea is an expert in that area and one of the founders of the Medipix project that uses Large Hadron Collider detectors for medical imaging.<br\/><br\/>The fifth benefit relates to medical devices and public health.  It surprises some people that Ireland has approximately 30 particle accelerators.  They are all in hospitals and are used for treating cancer or producing radioactive isotopes.  Professor Brendan McClean from St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital can explain the close links between particle physics and health.  Last year, in collaboration with the University of Kansas, we placed some of the Large Hadron Collider detectors in a medical linear accelerator beam at St.Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  There is also an important emergent technology called hadron therapy for treating cancer, which is being developed at CERN and is essentially a small version of the Large Hadron Collider.  New forms of cancer diagnosis and treatment are vital as there is a one in three chance of developing cancer at some point in our lives.  Consequently, it is a major area for policy and investment in both Ireland and Europe, including Horizon 2020 funding.<br\/><br\/>The sixth benefit relates to big data.  A report commissioned by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation in 2015 states &quot;The lack of big data skills could be the single most important  barrier preventing Ireland to achieve its goal of leadership in this market&quot;.  CERN has one of the largest data stores on the planet.  The Large Hadron Collider produces approximately 1 petabyte of data every second, a rate 1,000 times greater than global mobile phone data traffic.  Access to this data, development of machine learning and data mining tools, and the operation of what is literally a global computer is available to members of CERN experiments.  This potential has been seized by companies such as Yandex, the &quot;Russian Google&quot;, and the Yandex School of Data Analysis is a member of one of the Large Hadron Collider experiments.<br\/><br\/>The next benefit relates to contracts for Irish companies.  The total value of CERN contracts is approximately &euro;400 million per year.  CERN gives contracts preferentially to member state companies and by not being a member of CERN, companies, including multinationals, making products in Ireland are at a competitive disadvantage compared with their competitors or their own subsidiaries in other countries.  Irish companies with unique products have won CERN contracts in the past, including micro-electronic companies like SensL, Tyndall and Maxim Integrated; software companies like Microsoft, Symantec and Synopsis; and small and medium enterprises like Social Talent, Agtel and Sonru, whose founder and chief executive officer, Mr. Ed Hendrick, is present and can tell the committee about his experience of developing an innovative product and working with CERN.  It is worth pointing out that CERN contracts do not only relate to science; companies can bid for accountancy services, translation, such as provided to CERN by Nations Language Training in Cork, and even beef and dairy for the restaurants.<br\/><br\/>The next benefit relates to internationalism.  Today, both science and the economy are global.  As is becoming increasingly apparent, isolationism is regressive and has negative economic impacts.  Making connections and working together is vital for success.  Furthermore, with Brexit looming, closer ties to continental Europe are essential.  CERN stands for collaboration and is a channel to foreign markets.  A 2014 OECD study on the impact of large research infrastructure identifies several unique features of collaboration at CERN, including the &quot;richness and productivity of the network ... due to the open nature of the working environment of  CERN&quot; and socio-economic results such as &quot;the revitalisation of Central Europe following the end of the Cold War and ... the development of an advanced, extremely sophisticated form of cancer therapy&quot;.  Moreover, CERN is associated with more than &euro;350 million in Horizon 2020 funding, with a success rate of 35%, well in excess of the average of 12%.  By not being members of CERN, we make it difficult for Ireland to access this additional funding stream.<br\/><br\/>The next benefit is reputation.  Only a few sizeable European states are neither members nor associate members of CERN.  Earlier this year, Lithuania became an associate member.  The map in the submission available to the committee demonstrates relationships between CERN and European counties.  Within Europe, only Ireland, Moldova and Bosnia have no formal agreement at all.  India and Pakistan are associate members and non-European countries like Australia, China, the United States, Russia, Iran, Canada, Argentina, South Korea, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, to name but a few, all have collaboration agreements.  It is also notable that during the financial crisis, Greece remained in CERN because it saw membership as a means to recovery, citing &quot;the spillover effects of technologies&quot; and valuing &quot;the human network&quot;.  Our non-membership seems at variance to promoting a knowledge economy in Ireland and, apart from the issue of contracts, it may affect our reputation as a destination of choice for high-tech companies.<br\/><br\/>I have presented nine strands where joining CERN could lead to significant benefits for Ireland.  The bottom line, as ever, is how much this costs.  The price tag is from &euro;1.3 million per year, and this can be increased or stopped without penalty, giving great flexibility for policymakers.  This is at the lower end of a typical Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, research centre grant or, equivalently, a single cup of coffee for all higher rate taxpayers.<\/p><p>Most important though, this is not money that is given away.  Rather, it is committed to Irish nationals, Irish science and Irish companies.  Roughly speaking, one third of the money is spent on university students, teachers, scientists, engineers and computer scientists from Ireland, who receive training or placements at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, CERN; one third is spent on fellowships and staff positions for Irish nationals to work at CERN and transfer that knowledge home; and one third is spent on Irish products through contracts.  Thus in a very real sense, this money is spent on Ireland and is invested in the country and in its future. <\/p><p> The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation's Innovation 2020 strategy, published in 2015, sought to bring Ireland&rsquo;s research and development intensity to 2.5% of gross national product, GNP, by 2020, with increased investment in \"Expanding Ireland&rsquo;s participation in International Research Organisations, including CERN&rdquo;.  With gross expenditure on research and development currently running at 1.2% of gross domestic product, GDP, we have more to do to increase our impact.  Investing in science is an important part of growing the economy and of building resilience to future shocks.  Joining CERN, with its high-tech opportunities and global connectedness, is an attractive and cost-effective investment for Ireland.  The impact of CERN membership extends from the Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation to the Departments of Education and Skills, Health, Finance and Foreign Affairs and Trade.  In short, membership of CERN will benefit the entire country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018101600002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Ronan McNulty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539702000,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I thank Professor McNulty for a very comprehensive and interesting submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018101600002#F00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1539702000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation.  It is great to have them before the committee today.  I thank Professor McNulty for a very comprehensive overview of CERN and the benefits membership would bring.  I was fortunate enough to travel to CERN with Professor McNulty earlier this year.  We had a very productive two days meeting with the academics, researchers and technicians there.  I certainly learned an awful lot more about it from that occasion than I knew previously.  I also acknowledge Professor Emmanuel Tsesmelis, who came from CERN to Dublin and met with Professor McNulty and me this summer to explore the case for Irish membership.<\/p> <p>  Professor McNulty has clearly and powerfully outlined the many benefits of Irish membership.  He has covered the underlying strands and has cast quite a wide arc.  One thing I had not appreciated that struck me on-site at CERN was the breadth of activities.  We talk about particle physics and of course that is core to it, but there is also everything from big data to electronics, semiconductors, software services, hardware services, data management, pipelining and high-performance computing.  Such a range of activities take place, each of which is a spin-off field of its own and creates opportunities of its own.  Irish researchers, academics and workers could be to the fore of all of them if we joined the organisation.  That is another strong case to be made. <\/p> <p> As mentioned it in Professor McNulty's presentation, the reputational effect is also important.  Everyone on the committee should have a look at the map showing who is and is not a member of CERN.  It shocked me.  As professor McNulty has outlined, there are only three European Union states that are not CERN members; Moldova, Bosnia and ourselves.  The members include countries that are sometimes considered to be less developed than Ireland.  There are members or associate members across the world, including the developing word.  That is quite stark.  It is something that we need to address post haste.  <\/p> <p>  The case nearly makes itself.  As Professor McNulty has said, it is relevant to the knowledge economy.  I refer to the economic strategy we have pursued since the days of Thomas Kenneth Whitaker and Se&aacute;n Lemass, based on investment in education and opportunity and building a skill set to compete at that level.  We know that older industries and manufacturing have gone away.  Joining CERN ties into the knowledge economy-based intellectual capital that we have been trying to nurture for 40 years.  It is a continuation of that and makes a lot of sense given everything else we are trying to do.  <\/p> <p>  I have two questions.  It is important to get the answers on record to understand and tease these issues out.  The first question is the cost.  This came up as recently as the budget last week, during which CERN was discussed.  I made representations, as did others, and had discussions with the relevant Minister.  The cost was cited as an obstacle.  As I understand it, there are a couple of different price tags.  One can go high or low, depending on one's level of readiness.  For &euro;1.3 million we can get most of the benefits.  It is my understanding that there is no commitment or timeline.  We could join at the base level and stay there for as long as we wished, for five or ten years.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018101600002#F00300","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1539702000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>Did the Deputy say &euro;3 million?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018101600002#F00400","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1539702000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>The cost is &euro;1.3 million.  There is no commitment to increase that if we are not in a position to do so.  Could Professor McNulty confirm that?<\/p> <p>  I also wish to raise the multiplier effect.  The best comparator here is the European Space Agency, which I also visited last year with the Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan.  A sevenfold multiplier effect is sometimes cited there.

Mr. Hendrick has a similar story that I hope the committee will have time to hear about his company at CERN, and the multiplier effect there that seems to be a lot bigger than three.  There is also a survey by Bianchi-Streit that showed a factor of four on both sales and cost savings that companies had.<\/p><p> This, however, does not take account of the knowledge that one also acquires.  If one includes the knowledge that a company gains by being involved at the cutting edge, the multiplier is much greater.  Surveys of companies have been done and they have found that 40% of companies working at CERN developed new products, 40% increased their international users and 40% increased their technology learning.  A study by John Womersley for the Science and Technology Facilities Council came up with a ten-fold return on investment for the collider that preceded large Hadron Collider and included improvements to the economy and in terms of the training of physicists, or valuing the training aspects of that.<\/p><p> Depending on how one does the calculation, which is not an easy one to do, one gets a factor of between three and ten.  That does not include things like game-changing and completely disruptive technologies like the world wide web, which, as we know, came out of CERN.  If one includes how one values that, one realises that 20% of the GDP of modern economies is a result of the Internet, and that comes from a McKinsey report.<\/p><p> Quite apart from a straight multiplier of three to ten, there is the chance of something huge that changes the whole of civilisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018101600002#F01300","nonspeaker":"Professor Ronan McNulty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539702000,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I am going to allow Professor McClean in to give a synopsis of medical devices and public health in layman's terms, if possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018101600002#G00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539702000,"counter":140,"content":"<p>In Ireland this year there will be around 25,000 new cancer patients.

I have no idea why we are not a member.  It seems to me to be a no-brainer when one looks at the benefits and the fact that the money that is spent is spent on Ireland.  It is not like we giving this money to Switzerland.  It is for us and for our future.  When we had the downturn in economies, countries that had invested more in technology did better during that downturn.  We are investing in our futures.  I honestly cannot answer the Senator's first question.<\/p> <p>  On the second question, we could look at the example of Israel, if one wishes.  There are many similarities with Ireland in terms of the population size and the high-technology economy.  However, it is quite different in terms of committing funding to research.  At the moment we spend 1.2% of our GDP while Israel spends 4.2% of its GDP, which is over three times more.  It has decided that is the way to improve its economy.  One of the reasons was that it saw CERN as a way of using this money to benefit it.  When it decided to join CERN, it wanted to join as quickly as possible and took the fastest route possible to full membership which took three years.  In that period, its contract with CERN jumped from &euro;1 million to &euro;3 million in terms of the money its companies were getting.<\/p> <p>  I will give members some other interesting facts on Israel.  One of the things in which it got very involved was trade fairs.  It had a trade fair which Professor O'Shea attended in the Weizmann Institute.  In turn, Israeli companies were invited to come to CERN and a synergy or environment was created where business was talking to CERN and the scientists, and facilitating a very vibrant hotbed to spearhead different projects.<\/p> <p>  Israel had one or two teachers who used to visit CERN until it became full members.  In the year it became a full member, 40 teachers visited and they were being educated in the latest technology to enable them to go back and teach in the schools.  It had about 20 schoolchildren going to CERN each year before it joined.  Now, 200 per year are going.  In the summer for undergraduates to go to CERN.  Each year it has three to four students going around.  Some 25% of the students who go are Palestinian.  There is an example of CERN not just doing the science but also the world peace agenda.  Scientists judge one based on one's science and the common goal of understanding the universe not on one's politics.  Israel now has 30 PhD students working at CERN every year.  That is an example of how it took that decision and ramped up as rapidly as possible.<\/p> <p>  It is a policy decision and I am not sure that is the model that Ireland wants to use.  Ireland may want to go in at 10% or 20%.  One might find that we fulfil our quota of contracts, so we might want to up the amount.  That is fine and we will do so.  One might find that we do not fulfil that quota, so we might want to lower the amount.

We are a Wexford technology start-up.  We started building a product in 2007-08 and we launched in 2009 in the Irish market.  At the end of 2010, we raised some seed funding to expand into Europe.  Our first port of call was to go to the UK market.  It sounds easy to just go into that market and start winning business.  First, we presented at a trade show in Birmingham and were lucky to meet the CERN head of recruitment at that conference.  A few weeks later, CERN staff started trialling our software and became our first export customer.  We would never have looked at Switzerland in the early stages of exporting but it has become one of our strongest markets now in Europe, purely because of that first client, CERN, which we started working with in 2011.<\/p> <p>  One of the major advantages of working with CERN has been their willingness to share what they learn.  We found it a significant plus that they have been so willing to share with other companies in Switzerland and around the world their experience of using our product.  In 2011, they had been using our product for six to nine months.  They invited the recruitment team at Nestl&eacute; who are based and headquartered in Vevey to CERN and meet the recruitment team and to learn how they were using this new interview product that they had been working with six to nine months.  As a result of this Nestl&eacute; quickly became a customer.  There was a massive networking effect from working with them.<\/p> <p>  Something else that has made a great difference to us has been the willingness of CERN to speak at conferences and promote the different products they are using and to explain to peers at conferences how they are using Sonru.  This has also led to many new customers coming our way based on its recommendation.  <\/p> <p>  From a business perspective, we have experienced significant benefits from working with CERN.  Building credibility is one of the toughest things a new company has to do launching a new product into any market, let alone an export market, and to have that stamp of approval from such a wonderful organisation makes a great difference and can accelerate the process of winning business, which is what we are all about.  From our perspective it is a no-brainer as well.<\/p> <p>  One of the challenges we have had has been that Ireland not being a member of the organisation has made it more difficult to become a supplier to CERN.  Back in 2011, we had few competitors because we had a new, innovative product.  CERN did not have too many options but to work with us.  As that market has grown and matured, more competitors have come into our space and there are more options for CERN, particularly in its member states and associate member states.  This is a threat to us and it would be a huge challenge for us not to work with CERN and not to benefit from all that it brings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018101600002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Hendrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1539702000,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Hendrick believe that this association with CERN led to an increase in the number of staff his company employs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018101600002#H00600","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539702000,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Of course it has, yes.

I am a vice-chairman on the physics evaluation panel for a number of different funding instruments and I see these projects that come.  They have access to the best expertise because they know all of the people.  This is an international process.  They have expertise in putting together proposals and they achieve a hit rate of three times more.  If Ireland was a member of CERN, it would have similar access to funding.  This would increase EU funding to this country considerably.<\/p> <p>  On technology, I worked at CERN for six years and then went to Glasgow, but I was still able to access technologies through the organisation that I cannot find anywhere else in the world.  It is about networking, being able to access expertise and to use stuff that one would not be able to get even in the Tyndall National Institute, which has a high level of expertise, but it does not have it all together.  That enables me to dream up new innovations such as Medipix.  Medipix is a toy for looking at X-rays in colour.

Invest Northern Ireland brought over a delegation from CERN and a small company based in County Fermanagh, Elite Electronic Systems, received a multi-million pound contract to supply electronic devices for use in the large hadron collider, LHC.  That came about through direct contact, by bringing people around and showing them companies.  A total of 20 companies in Ireland have had contracts with CERN.  We conducted a survey of IDA Ireland backed companies that we felt were in this space.  We surveyed the managements of approximately 200 companies and asked whether they would be in favour of Ireland joining CERN.

I will make a number of points, including about education.  As we know that there is a shortage, we want to recruit more people generally into STEM subjects and particularly to address the gender balance.  CERN is an attractor for students generally into science, technology, engineering and maths, STEM, subjects.  It asks the exciting and interesting questions with which young people are taken.  They get into subjects such as physics, maths, engineering and technology in order that they can be part of it.  CERN makes a dedicated effort to provide education for associate member countries and member countries at all levels.  There is teacher training - imagine this - at primary school level and secondary school level, not just at university level.  It really supports an ecosystem for training and the advancement of technology and IT skills throughout the entire country.  This is an important message that CERN membership brings.<\/p> <p>  CERN is trying to answer these fundamental questions, but in order to do so, it must invent new technology.  The questions it asks cannot be answered or tackled with the technology we have available today.  That was also true in the past.  It invents new algorithms, computers and magnets and we can be part of that work.  The 2014 Forf&aacute;s report identified skill shortages as one of the key challenges for Ireland in the area of big data and data analytics.  I chair the scientific steering committee for advanced computing in Europe.  We see the convergence of high performance computing and big data.  We know that it will not just be for the traditional areas in physics and chemistry, but that it will spill over into the life sciences.  There will be machine learning and big data application in the life sciences and dealing with societal issues in the areas of cryptography, security and self-driving cars.  We will need to understand big data and be able to manage them.  The skills developed at CERN are the skills needed.
