It is great to be back in our natural habitat.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte ar ais roimh gach duine.<\/p>  <p>  This evening we will debate a motion of confidence in the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, over his handling of the appointment of Katherine Zappone as a special envoy, but for now I want to raise a very concerning aspect of this controversy, that is, the Minister's admission that he deleted texts between himself and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, regarding the appointment.  He deleted these texts and failed to send the communications to his Department for filing and storage.<\/p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach knows, these were no ordinary texts.  These were communications between two of his senior Cabinet Ministers in relation to Government Buildings.  They were official Government information and communications.  The Freedom of Information Act is very clear.  Communications carried out on electronic devices, such as phones, or by email relating to the official function of a Minister are subject to that legislation.<\/p>  <p>  By way of explanation, the Minister tells us he routinely deletes texts from his phone when he considers a conversation to have concluded.  It is not the prerogative of any Minister to delete official Government communications based on personal preference or judgments.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, was obliged to retain those texts under the law.  That a senior Minister was so convinced that he had the right to delete Government records is extremely troubling because it goes to the heart of transparency, public interest and accountability in government.  Freedom of information is in place to allow citizens to obtain information about decisions that affect their lives and our society.  It is fundamental to democracy, journalism and activism, and it is critical in holding power to account.  It is essential to good government.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, a Minister erasing Government records in such a fashion stinks to the high heavens.  It is an abuse of office, plain and simple.  It is corrosive to politics and insulting to people.  This behaviour was unacceptable and it has angered people, not least because it demonstrates breathtaking arrogance.  T&aacute; fearg ar dhaoine.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; seo glic agus bh&iacute; s&eacute; mealltach.  T&aacute; dam&aacute;iste d&eacute;anta don pholait&iacute;ocht ag an Aire, an Teachta Coveney, agus ag an Rialtas.  Is &aacute;bhar an-t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; seo.<\/p>  <p>  This controversy raises further questions around how pervasive this behaviour is in government.  This was not sloppy behaviour.  It was about a Minister deliberately erasing Government records.  I would like the Taoiseach to establish for us today how widespread this practice is within his Government.  Who else in the Cabinet deletes texts, documents and communications in this way?<\/p> <p>What other Ministers are doing this?  Has he spoken to each of his Ministers and has he asked them directly if they have deleted Government communications in this way?  Will the Taoiseach tell the House what action he has taken as Head of Government over the past eight weeks to stamp out this behaviour and to guarantee it will cease?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500003#A00500","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631711100,"counter":11,"content":"<p>First of all, I welcome the fact we are back in the Chamber to conduct our business as a Parliament and as D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, and I look forward to working with all parties in pursuance of the issues that challenge this country.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy that accountability and transparency is of great importance to the House and on issues of substance.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided a very full explanation to the Oireachtas committee and has gone before that committee twice in respect of this issue, which I remind people relates to the appointment of a part-time envoy, an appointment that did not go ahead subsequently.<\/p>  <p>  In my view the procedure leading to that was wrong and should not have happened. The Minister has apologised, including to the Oireachtas committee twice, and he has apologised to me as to what and how it happened.<\/p>  <p>  In the broader context, t&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil muintir na t&iacute;re buartha faoi seo ach t&aacute; siad buartha faoi an-chuid mar aon leis seo.

In other words the most important and substantive issues that people mention and are very concerned about are health services, housing, Covid-19 and many other issues.  We need a fair, balanced and proportionate response to this issue.  The tabling of the motion of confidence is not such a proportionate response from Deputy McDonald or her party, but that is their decision.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy might also look into her own cupboard in respect of the appointment of people to public positions because appointing its own to a range of public positions is the hallmark of the Sinn F&eacute;in approach when in government.  The party has made the city of Derry its fiefdom in terms of patronage.  This party is not on steady ground when it is attacking others in respect of appointing people to positions.  The position in question was a part-time one while Sinn F&eacute;in has appointed its own to very senior positions as a member of Government.<\/p>  <p>  On the deletion of texts, any texts relating to public or Government business should not be deleted.  I have made that clear to all of my Government colleagues.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, was not acting in bad faith here and he has explained to the committee the circumstances and context in which he took that action.  At all times I genuinely believe he has been acting in good faith.  I know that when Deputy McDonald has been dealing with Deputy Coveney in respect of Northern Ireland or foreign affairs issues, there is nobody in the House who would argue that he has not acted in good faith and with sincerity and honesty.  He can be faulted in certain respects - no doubt about it - in terms of this appointment; he himself acknowledges that himself.  As I have said, however, any records pertaining to Government business should not be deleted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500004#B00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1631711100,"counter":12,"content":"<p>This is a substantive and serious issue.

There is a sense of some normality as we finally come back into this Chamber.  That is what I want to ask the Taoiseach about.  I have a direct question: What has changed since we left this Chamber last year?  What has changed for the Taoiseach and his Government in how they will deal with things?  We in the Labour Party believe that everything has changed in that year - how we think about things and, collectively, our political ideologies and philosophies.  Everything has changed because Covid, quite simply, has been the biggest disruptor in 100 years - in our thought and in every other way.  I therefore want to know what lessons the Taoiseach has learnt.  I am not asking about the Zappone affair; I am asking him about what lessons he has learnt from Covid and how, collectively, the Government will ensure we change things for the better.  I believe the public want to know this.  Why?  Because their priorities have changed in the past year.  I refer to how they look after their families and their communities and what they expect from the State, particularly when it comes to public services.  The need for investment in healthcare, education, housing - everything has changed.  It has changed for me in respect of my time management, my work-life balance and my need to spend more time with my elderly parents, my wife and my children.  I believe it is the same for many people.  I 100% get the sense that the public's tolerance for short-termism and for a lack of consistency in political thought and action is absolutely exhausted.  They do not have a tolerance for our not seeing through major reforms; they do not have a tolerance any more for a two-tier health system; they do not have a tolerance for an education system whereby students today cannot get accommodation to go to college; they will not have a tolerance any more for a hugely expensive private childcare system; and they will not have a tolerance for people no longer being able to get houses where they are from.<\/p>  <p>  I therefore ask the Taoiseach genuinely what has changed for him and his Government since we left this Chamber a year ago.  We know that the great white hope of Sl&aacute;intecare is now at a standstill.  The Government has launched Housing for All and I genuinely wish it the best in delivering that.  However, what I am asking the Taoiseach, as we step back in here, is what has changed for him and his Government in how we can deliver for the people.  Everything has changed, in our opinion.  If the Government works towards the issues I have just spoken about, the Labour Party, for one, will meet it halfway on ending the short-termism and delivering for the Irish people.<\/p> <p>How is the Government going to deliver for the people in what has changed in the past year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500005#C01200","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631712000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>First, I agree with the Deputy and take the question in the very good faith in which it was articulated.  The world has changed.  It has changed most fundamentally and the long-term impact of Covid, in terms of how we live, work, recreate and experience and organise life, will be profound.  That relates to all those areas.  In respect of the lessons we have learned from Covid, the whole-of-government approach to dealing with Covid, with all hands on deck, is a lesson we need to apply to other key crises in our society.  The national vaccination programme, for which we pulled together a national task force, has achieved phenomenal results.  That is the biggest change in the past 12 months.  Ninety per cent of our people over the age of 18 are fully vaccinated, as are more than 89% of those aged over 16.  That now enables us to begin the journey of what some might call a new normal or a new or different way of living in regard to how the workplace develops.<\/p><p>As for the housing crisis, a key issue for many people, that whole-of-government model has to be applied to dealing with housing, and not just at national level between all the Departments.  A Secretary General of my Department now chairs a group of other Secretaries General to ensure there is a cross-cutting approach to dealing with the housing issue.  There are lessons to be learned from Covid because we did cut through on Covid in respect of a number of issues, which we had to do.  Time was not an option.  We have to try to inject the same approach into housing.<\/p><p>The same is true of climate change, which is quite profound.  I recently read a global survey that showed the degree of anxiety among our younger generation about what climate change means for them and their lives into the future.  The levels of anxiety among young people all over the world are very high - worryingly high, from our perspective - in terms of their health, mental health and well-being.  Everybody in this House has to play their part in tackling that issue, and again it has to be cross-departmental and across society.<\/p><p>In respect of our health services, Sl&aacute;intecare has not stood still.  In fact, at last year's budget, about &euro;1.235 billion was allocated purely for Sl&aacute;intecare initiatives.  The comments of the then director, Ms Laura Magahy, to the Oireachtas committee regarding the budget were very clear.  She stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAll the elements such as beds, community staffing, diagnostic care, social care expansion, etc., that were outlined in the budget, which we went through with the committee at our last meeting, have been funded.

We need to deliver on Sl&aacute;intecare over the next four to five years.  Within five years, I want to see a national childcare service and change in respect of balanced and regional development.  Project Ireland 2040, for me, is out the window.  Within two to three years, I want to see a living wage; the leaving certificate completely transformed and education made free at the point of entry and at third level; Housing for All, perhaps 2.0, delivered; and a situation whereby we are bulletproof in regard to climate change targets.<\/p>  <p>  When I say the short-termism has to end, how is the Taoiseach going to ensure in all those areas he will change tack and deliver?

Throughout my political life I have always thought to do that which benefits the medium and longer term.  That is why I initiated the first ever major public investment in research back in 1999, when I was Minister for Education and Science, with the programme for research in third level institutions, which in itself was transformative for the research environment.  That is why I insisted that in the programme for Government we would establish a new Government Department: the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  That is the kind of long-term thinking I engage in.  I think that it is better for the public over the long term.  I agree with the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  In health, we need a universal, accessible health care system.  I subscribe to that and I will work with the Deputy.  Sometimes, when the Government opts for the longer term, it will continually be hit on the Opposition side by short-term political imperatives which can undermine the more medium- to longer-term thinking and strategies.  I do not think we can shy away from the work of the Commission on Pensions, for example.  We will bring that to the Government shortly and we will publish it.  It will need a debate across the House, as does the Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  The State is going to get bigger.

One of those issues will be highlighted at 5.30 p.m. this evening by the National Homeless and Housing Coalition.  They will gather in a demonstration to appeal to this Government to break from the failed policies it has applied; to address the housing crisis; and to actually deliver the public and affordable housing, the affordable rents and the answers to the homelessness crisis that people are demanding.  At that protest, there will be many groups who are affected by the ten years of failure by both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in government to address the housing crisis; those affected by the mica issue; renters who are paying extortionate rents; working people who have no chance of getting on the housing ladder because of unaffordable prices; those waiting a decade and sometimes two decades on housing lists; people who are actually homeless; and many others.<\/p>  <p>   One group I particularly want to highlight in these few weeks is those affected by the student accommodation crisis.  It is absolutely dire.  We are facing an unprecedented crisis of availability of affordable student accommodation.  The student unions in Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Sligo and many other places are now overwhelmed with thousands of students who cannot find affordable accommodation.  The disease of unaffordable rents that has contributed so much to the housing crisis in wider society is now infecting our student population and, indeed, our on-campus accommodation.  It is completely pricing students out of the market of affordable student accommodation.  The consequences are record levels of homelessness among students who are sleeping on couches or in friends&rsquo; homes and so on; being forced into hotels where they have to pay up to &euro;400 per week for accommodation; or simply, being unable to find accommodation and having to commute two, three and sometimes four hours back and forward a day because they cannot get accommodation near their college.  <\/p>  <p>  Why is this happening?  I put it to the Taoiseach that it is because of the failures of Government policy that now replicate themselves in the student accommodation issue.  In UCD, which is a publicly funded college, they have increased student accommodation costs by 20% to 30%.  In the newly constructed student accommodation, they are charging up to &euro;15,000 per year for accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500007#E00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1631712300,"counter":33,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500007#E00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1631712300,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Similarly, around this city, we have private investor-built student accommodation where they are charging &euro;1,000 per month and more for student accommodation.

The Government's Housing for All strategy has fundamentally changed the State's approach to housing.  Some &euro;4 billion per annum will now be allocated to increasing housing supply - social housing, affordable housing, cost rental and private sector housing.  We need housing supply to increase under all headings.  A wide range of measures will be introduced.  The legislative underpinning for those measures has been already passed through the Oireachtas in the majority of cases.  Part of the Housing for All strategy is the total elimination of homelessness over the next decade.  We have committed and signed up to that.  Progress has been made in the past year.  Fianna F&aacute;il, by the way, has been in government for only the past 14 or 15 months and has not been in government for ten years, as the Deputy glibly throws out all the time.  We need to increase investment in housing to get supply.  Supply is the big issue for us.<\/p>  <p>  The number of people in emergency accommodation has fallen by 7% in the past year.  The current number of homeless individuals is 8,132, which represents a reduction of 23% from the 10,500 people recorded in October 2019 which was the highest number recorded to date.  The current level of family homelessness is 48% below the peak figure recorded in July 2018.<\/p>  <p>  For us, the housing first strategy is the key instrument in dealing with homelessness.  We are working with the non-governmental organisations and the approved housing bodies in the homeless area to significantly increase supply.  We are providing them with the resources particularly through the housing first approach, which I think most people accept is the preferable way to deal with homelessness in this country.  We are very committed to that and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is certainly committed to dealing with it.  <\/p>  <p>  Regarding student accommodation, the Minister introduced legislation, the Residential Tenancies Act, to protect tenants, including students.  We are also giving the capacity to the institutes of technology to borrow in order to provide additional student accommodation supply for students attending the technological universities and the institutes.  For many years they did not have that capacity, which the universities had.  We will be keeping a close eye to ensure the third level colleges do not charge exorbitant rates to students.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, the broader housing issue impacts on this because the more housing we develop, the greater capacity we develop in the market for students to be able to access accommodation at an affordable rate.  At the moment we do not have the supply we need.  We need to be building far more units across the board than we are currently building.  Housing for All sets out a programme to do just that with very significant resources allocated.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500008#F00100","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1631712600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>We will debate the detail of Housing for All another day.

Does the Taoiseach know how many additional hotel rooms will be built, which are in the planning system, over the next while?  It is 18,000 new hotel rooms.  In this city between now and 2023, some 24 new hotels will be built - we have already had many new hotels built - with another 4,500 rooms.  All that building capacity is going into building stuff for profit, but not going into building the affordable student accommodation we actually need.

We have a once in a generation opportunity, as we work our way out of this pandemic, to restructure our economy.  The Deputies in the Regional Group are firmly of the view that this budget cannot just be about closing the gaps that have emerged during the pandemic; it must also implement the strategy and support structures that will ensure that every person in Ireland can grow and be supported in our recovery.  First and foremost, we must ensure that we have a tax and welfare system where work always pays.  Returning to work must be the most financially beneficial option for individuals and families.  This is the most effective way to break the cycle of poverty in families.  Every child should have a healthy environment, a home and an education.<\/p>  <p>  While there are many ways to measure poverty, for me, the most basic measure is hunger.  No child should go to bed hungry.  A child will never reach his or her full potential if that child sits at a school desk hungry.  According to the study by the State agency, Safefood, one in ten of our population lives in food poverty.  The best way to boost incomes of poor families is by removing cliff-edge barriers to work embedded in our tax and welfare codes, for example, by removing the anomaly where workers who earn in excess of &euro;352 a week face a high marginal PRSI rate of 23.6% on additional income up to &euro;424 or by introducing a sliding scale of welfare payments so that people do not find themselves better off out of work than in work.<\/p>  <p>  We have all been contacted by employers who are finding it difficult to fill positions or where employees are refusing overtime or will only work three days a week.  The fact is that both individuals and families are deterred from returning to work or accepting additional hours for fear that they will be penalised by the welfare system and related supports.  For example, the income limits for social housing have not increased in a decade, while property prices have doubled over the same period, forcing people to turn down work or face the prospect of homelessness.  This has to be turned on its head and our tax and welfare system must actively support people to return to the workforce in any capacity.  Work must always be a better option than welfare and the first place that we should start is with a radical overhaul of the working family payment, both with regard to the exclusions and the rates of support, to always make it financially better for families to access employment regardless of their make-up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500009#G00600","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1631712900,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  I accept that work is always the best option and there is an onus to facilitate and incentivise opportunities for work in the economy.  The successful reopening of the economy and sectors of society over the past six months is having a significant impact on the numbers of people at work.  For example, the number of people in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment is down to 114,000 this week.<\/p> <p>That is down from a peak of 602,000 last year, which is very good progress.  Employment opportunities have been created.  We need to do more.  I take the Deputy's point in respect of the cliff-edge nature of payments; he referenced the PRSI rate for those earning between &euro;18,000 and &euro;22,000 per annum.  Those measures were originally introduced to avoid an even sharper cliff edge that was present prior to their introduction.  We established the Commission on Taxation and Welfare to deal with the broader tax and welfare systems and the interplay between them.  Issues such as that will fall under the remit of the commission.  It has been asked to review how best the taxation and welfare systems can support economic activity and income redistribution while promoting employment and prosperity.  The commission is where many of these issues will, hopefully, be dealt with, and recommendations will come from it.  In the interim, in the context of the budget, the Ministers for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Social Protection will periodically review the existing measures and will look at anomalies or traps that could perhaps discourage or act as a disincentive for people to take up employment or move to full-time employment, for example.<\/p> <p> I take the Deputy's point in respect of the income limits for social housing.  Those thresholds are low.  I have asked the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to look at them.  They are under review.  We have large numbers on the social housing list but the idea that people are not able to progress in work or get an increase in salary because that would marginally rule them out of eligibility for a social house needs to be relaxed.  We need to take a more holistic approach to that issue.  That is my view.  There are complications around the implementation of it.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and his Department are looking at the issue that is there.  <\/p> <p> The Deputy raised the issue of liability around social insurance contributions.  He knows why that was brought in in 2016.  As I said, both Ministers will keep those thresholds under review in the context of the forthcoming budget.  This year's budget for the Department of Social Protection is &euro;25 billion.

We must make sure that a work always pays strategy is not focused on encouraging people into low-paid employment but about giving them the skills for today's economy so they have the ability to earn more and progress in their careers.<\/p>  <p>  The welfare website must also provide a user-friendly interface that outlines the supports and options for education and retraining.

The apprenticeship programmes, including, for example, the national action plan on apprenticeships, is yielding results.  There are incentives in that for employers.  We want to get to 10,000 new apprenticeship registrations per year by 2025.  We are on target to achieve that.

I urge the Taoiseach to take responsibility for its implementation.<\/p>  <p>  My question is more specific.  One reason, although far from the only reason, for hospital waiting lists in the mid west in particular is the use of theatres at University Hospital Limerick, UHL.  The rate at which the theatre was used was far below the target rate, which is approximately 85% internationally.  It was at approximately 75% at the time of the most recent election.  That obviously worsened because of Covid, which is not the fault of anybody.  What is the rate of use now?  Unless we can get theatre usage up to the optimal levels, waiting lists will not be addressed.  That is true for UHL but there is also the issue of theatre usage in Ennis and Nenagh hospitals.  I do not expect the Taoiseach to have those figures off the top of his head.

When we talk about just transition, there is confusion over what it means.  It is quite a technical term.  What do we mean?  Just transition means those people, workers and communities who may face significant changes to their lives as a result of the need to move to a zero-carbon society are supported in making those changes.  It means a fair deal for workers, farmers and communities, and it means protecting their rights.  We really cannot have a successful transition without buy-in from workers, farmers and urban and rural communities.  They must feel secure and supported as things around us change.<\/p><p>We all know we have significant changes to make.  We all know we have major targets to meet.  There is general acceptance that we will strive to do our best to meet those targets.  However, the question of how we meet them is fundamental.  We must meet them in a fair and just manner.  This must be driven by the Government.<\/p> <p>My Bill today seeks to ensure that happens.  It puts in place a just transition commission, similar to the Workplace Relations Commission, to bring together workers, communities, employers and the Government into a social dialogue that will drive climate action plans, mitigation plans, adaptation plans, and policies and investments that are needed for a quick, fair and just transition to a zero-carbon economy.<\/p> <p> Crucially, this Bill also amends the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 to include for the first time in Irish legislation a definition of just transition and its principles.  Unfortunately, this was left out of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 earlier this year.  It is a fundamental piece of the information that people need and it needs to be a fundamental piece of the legislation we put in place to ensure a just transition.<\/p> <p> The Government has so far failed to put in place just transition mechanisms to protect our most vulnerable workers.  The remit of the current just transition commissioner is limited to one geographical area only and one sector and he does not have statutory powers to carry out his work.  That is despite the promises made in the programme for Government to place a just transition commission on a statutory footing.  While the Government talks about just transition and often uses it as a buzzword and as a type of branding, its actions, unfortunately, are not seeing that through.<\/p> <p> There is no reason the Government should oppose the progression of this Bill.  It will be familiar to some members of the Government because the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in his previous role as Deputy introduced this legislation in 2018.  He sought progress on this to Committee Stage before the D&aacute;il fell.  In his own D&aacute;il contribution on the Bill he said he hoped there would be \"a recognition from Government that this Bill is a piece of the architecture that fits in critically within the all-of-Government climate action plan\".  I agree with him that this is a critical piece of the architecture.  That all-of-government climate action plan is coming and I hear it will be with us in a few weeks.  Not only is this crucial piece of architecture essential for workers' rights, but the success of climate change action depends on the success of a just transition and the incorporation of this into that work.  Embedding this structure into our response is a priority.  If the Green Party members were serious about this in 2018, they should be as serious if not more so about supporting this legislation now.  <\/p> <p> We often talk about the climate challenge.  It will be a challenge to meet our targets and to make the changes that we need to make in our lives, but we need to start refocusing because there could potentially be a huge climate opportunity.  The climate challenge will give us the time and the space to rebalance our lives and our society, to start focusing on what is important to us and to start living more sustainably.  This opportunity will only be met if we do it in a just and fair way, and this just transition Bill is a key element of doing that.

north inner city.  This report has been further supplemented by the publishing of the north-east inner city strategic plan 2020-22.  Both documents are available on the north-east inner city website, <i>www.neic.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>In June 2017, an independent chairperson was appointed by the Government to the north-east inner city programme implementation board.  Members of the board include representatives from relevant Government Departments and agencies, businesses and the local community.  The board is assisted in its work by six subgroups, which focus on enhancing policing; maximising educational, training and employment opportunities; family well-being; enhancing community well-being and the physical landscape; substance use, misuse and inclusion health; and alignment of services.  The board and its subgroups continue to meet monthly to oversee and progress the implementation of the Mulvey report and the north-east inner city strategic plan 2020-22.  Officials from my Department work closely with the board, the subgroups and the dedicated programme office based in Se&aacute;n MacDermott Street.<\/p><p>The chair of the board reports to an oversight group of senior officials chaired by the Secretary General of my Department.  The membership of the oversight group is comprised of the chair of the north-east inner city programme implementation board and senior officials across Government Departments and agencies who are actively engaged with the work of the north-east inner city initiative, namely the Department of the Taoiseach; the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth; the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform; the Department of Rural and Community Development; the Department of Social Protection; the Department of Education; the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and a whole range of other Departments including the Department of Transport; the Department of Health; the Department of Justice; the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage; the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media; Dublin City Council; the Office of Public Works; and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This group, which has met 13 times to date and met most recently via video conference on 3 June 2021, supports and oversees the work of the north-east inner city programme implementation board and ensures strong and active participation by all relevant Government Departments and agencies in the north-east inner city initiative and deals with any barriers or issues highlighted by the chair of the programme implementation board.<\/p><p>The Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality provides political oversight of the north-east inner city initiative.  The Government is committed to supporting and investing in the north-east inner city community and ensuring the board has the necessary resources to achieve its targets and fulfil its ambition.

He might recall that when we discussed the north-east inner city initiative on previous occasions, I asked and I suggest again that there be a review of progress made and achievements in this part of our capital city.  That is essential for the success of this initiative.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work that has been done but I also flag to the Taoiseach that the social and economic problems within the area remain extremely deep.  In my own view in many respects we are only skating on the surface of what actually needs to be done.  I therefore recommend to the Taoiseach the need for a review to be done not least because we are now in the autumn of 2021 and 2022 will soon be upon us.<\/p>  <p>  Before we broke for the summer recess the Taoiseach may recall that I raised with him the looming closure of a number of community early learning providers in the north inner city.  This is as a direct consequence of the restructuring of the national childcare scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Since then, a coalition of providers in Dublin 8 have raised the same concerns as I raised with him.  My colleague, Deputy Funchion, is engaging with a number of providers in disadvantaged areas across the State who face similar funding challenges.  The truth is that kids from the poorest households are going to lose their after-school or childcare places.  Some providers tell me that they will lose up to 70% of their income because the new scheme penalises the children of parents who are not at work and are not studying and as a consequence will disadvantage children who are living in circumstances of profound disadvantage.  I have corresponded with the Taoiseach on these matters.<\/p> <p>He has made reference in that correspondence to the sustainability fund.  In practice, that is not a fund.  In fact, it is described to me by those seeking access to it as an adversarial compliance, governance and financial audit.  The statement from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth that children with particular needs, as it calls them, might qualify for the full 45 hours if sponsored by Tusla simply does not recognise the very real fear that families not already engaged with these agencies have of inviting Tusla into their and their children's lives.<\/p> <p> In my correspondence with the Taoiseach and with the Minister over recent months, and I have been raising this for months, I reminded them of the urgent need for a DEIS model for early learning settings in areas of disadvantage, as supported by the current Government and the previous Administration.  This problem is not going away.  I ask the Taoiseach to liaise with the Minister to agree a revised strategy to ensure these children retain the existing childcare and early education entitlements they so desperately need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500018#Q02400","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631718300,"counter":191,"content":"<p>As we are tasked today with coming in here and talking about the review of the inner city initiative, it would be remiss of me not to mention that tomorrow, once again, several hundred people from the north inner city will descend on the D&aacute;il in protest.  That protest will be in recognition of the 16th anniversary of the death of Terence Wheelock.  I cannot separate the inner city initiative from the legacy of poor relationships between the community of the north inner city, which has for decades been disadvantaged by structural inequality and structural violence.  The initiative had absolutely no targets or benchmarks.  It involved lots of good work because of the nature of the good people involved, but it will not address the legacy of a community which has a mistrustful relationship with the State and its infrastructures because of deeds the community believes were inflicted on it.  To my mind, there is no greater example of that than the north inner city community's continued 16-year quest for answers to what it believes to be the outstanding questions surrounding the death of Terence Wheelock.  Until that is addressed, every year, like tomorrow, that community will continue to march on the D&aacute;il and on Store Street Garda station and will continue to have a mistrustful relationship with the State, and all these nice initiatives will fall on deaf ears.<\/p>  <p>  Once again, therefore, in advance of Terence's anniversary tomorrow, I ask for an independent review into the circumstances that led to his death in order that his family can stop having to show up at Store Street Garda station and at the D&aacute;il demanding what they believe is justice for their son and their brother.  Please, Taoiseach, I know there was a GSOC review.  That was ten years ago and questions still remain.  Let us simply address this issue now and bring some finality to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500019#R00200","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1631718300,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising these issues.  To respond to Deputy McDonald's basic point about a review of probity, yes, we should do that.  I will talk to my Secretary General about that and about the broader interest in terms of just reviewing the progress that has been made, the remaining issues and perhaps lessons learnt from the model.  As I said earlier, maybe during Leaders' Questions, I am anxious we would broaden out and learn from previous experience of models that were developed before in certain communities in terms of multidisciplinary, multi-agency-based responses to disadvantage.  I think we can now learn lessons from this initiative, which has been up and running since 2017.  I am anxious to do that and I do not doubt what the Deputy says about the social and economic problems remaining.  Deputy Gannon has referred to those also.  That is something we can do.<\/p>  <p>  As for the childcare issue Deputy McDonald raised, I did write to her about that and, again, I am anxious to resolve it.  No provider should lose 70% in any new scheme.  I do not think anyone intends that to happen, nor should it happen.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has aimed to ensure alignment of existing initiatives as well as the development of other responses which add value to the actions to achieve maximum impact in respect of integrated service delivery relating to children, young people and their families.  As for the issues Deputy McDonald has raised, my understanding is officials from the Department have met with a small number of providers operating in the north-east inner city several times regarding the national childcare scheme.  I am just saying this is what I have been informed, so the Deputy may take it as she wishes, but we could follow up on it.  It became apparent through this engagement that some issues arising were due to a lack of familiarity with the scheme, with some parents registering for the wrong subsidy.<\/p>  <p>  On that basis the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has provided and will continue to provide additional training and support to providers through the Dublin city childcare committee in order that it can in turn advise and direct parents to better understand the operations of the scheme and the subsidies available through it.  A letter issued to the committee providers on 23 July restating the offer of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth of case management support and the potential for financial supports where assessment criteria are met.  A highly skilled and experienced early years specialist team from the Better Start quality development services is to work directly in a mentoring capacity with services in the north-east inner city to support quality improvement.  The Dublin city childcare committee is a key resource that is supporting services in the area on matters relating to the structure of their service delivery, governance and management and optimal use of the current subsidy schemes.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and the Department are actively monitoring this issue and are committed to ensuring this scheme functions in the best interests of families and children, that the Department supports services in adjusting to this new or more progressive approach to early learning and childcare, and that State investment in the sector delivers affordable, accessible, sustainable and high-quality service provision.  The Department has engaged an external consultant to review the first year of the scheme.  This will include looking at its use by socioeconomically disadvantaged families and by providers serving socioeconomically disadvantaged communities.  Work is also progressing on a new funding model for the early learning and childcare centre, which is being led by an expert group.<\/p>  <p>  To cut to the chase, we need to engage with the providers Deputy McDonald has identified, see how this scheme is performing in meeting their requirements and see what we can do to make up the balance.  It is not our objective that any child from a disadvantaged situation should lose out on childcare.  I know Deputy McDonald has raised this a good few times.  We need to get people around the table and just ask what are the issues here and can we get them sorted.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Gannon has been consistent in raising the issue of the very sad death of Terence Wheelock.  Again, I extend my deepest sympathies to the Wheelock family for their terrible loss and the pain his tragic death still causes them.  The challenges are, as the Deputy knows, that the case was subject to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and that the report of that inquiry was published by GSOC in March 2010.  I also note that legal proceedings arising from these matters were settled in 2014.  Both GSOC and the courts are fully independent in the exercise of their functions.  It is not open to the Minister for Justice or to me to intervene or to comment on an inquiry that has been carried out by GSOC or on the outcomes of any court proceedings.  The case was fully considered by GSOC.  I believe the death has been the subject of legal proceedings.<\/p>  <p>  I have a general view that, more generally across our system, our independent agencies should be the mechanisms by which these issues are resolved.  There are no easy answers, but I am not clear as to what new mechanisms can be devised that would supersede ones we have put a lot of investment and resources into to do just that, to carry out independent investigations into the actions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for example, in given situations.  I empathise with what Deputy Gannon says but I think we need as a political system as well to have greater faith in the organisations we set up.  Otherwise, we will have different types of inquiries under different Acts on an ongoing basis, and that is not-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500019#R00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1631718300,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I understand how delicate this issue is and I do not want to put undue pressure on the Taoiseach when I am asking a question that I have not given him advance notice of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500019#R00400","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1631718300,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I understand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500019#R00500","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1631718300,"counter":195,"content":"<p>-----but GSOC was in its infancy when this case emerged, and maybe it requires a new look with fresh eyes.

I thank him for that.<\/p>  <p>  Second, I reiterate Deputy Gannon's call for a fresh investigation in respect of the Terence Wheelock case.  It is true to say there were previous processes and procedures, but it is also true to say big questions remain, not just for the family but for the wider community.<\/p> <p>It would be helpful if we could have political agreement that, whatever the specific mechanism, there would be at a minimum some form of review of this case.  Any death in custody is extremely serious.  As the Taoiseach knows, in the early 2000s there were profound concerns about places of detention, including Garda stations, and previous governments had to deal with that reality.  We need to progress this issue.  There will be the gathering for Terence's anniversary.  This issue does not go away; it festers in the soul of a community, as we have seen in other parts of Ireland.

I will make the general point that, ultimately, we have to get to a position where our existing mechanisms are ones in which we trust and whereby we say it is their duty to investigate.  We can see with commissions of investigation how, even after three or four years of investigations, people are not necessarily satisfied with their outcomes, and that creates all sorts of challenges for our entire system of inquiry and investigation in regard to GSOC, commissions of investigation, tribunals of inquiry and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  We are now setting up a new mechanism regarding impropriety on the part of finance officials.  When we create these institutions that are at arm's length and independent, we have to allow them to do their work.  That is the point I am making.

I know, from speaking to many survivors of mother and baby homes, that the actions of the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, around the time of the report's publication were deeply hurtful.  Many of those people are elderly and some are, obviously, very vulnerable at the moment.  I spoke to people, for example, who had attended the Zoom meeting with the Taoiseach, and it sounded very inappropriate too.  Their microphones were switched off and they did not have an opportunity to ask questions.  Questions had to be submitted in advance and were presumably vetted by the Department.  At the time, the Taoiseach gave credibility to the details that had been leaked by giving comment on them to a journalist, who wrote the story, and that caused great hurt as well.  Will the Taoiseach apologise for doing that?  When will he publish the findings of the Government's investigation into that leak?  It has been nine months since the investigation was first heralded.  If we are pointing the finger at all these other investigative vehicles in this country and yet Departments are taking nine months to carry out an investigation as simple as this, that leaves serious questions.<\/p>  <p>  The wider issue of leaks is also really important.  There is the idea the Zappone affair was predicated on a leak from the Taoiseach's Cabinet, a leak that, by law, is a criminal offence to undertake.  There have been reports in the newspapers that a Minister of State set a trap for a senior Minister, that that information on the senior Minister was given to the T&aacute;naiste and that the T&aacute;naiste was carrying out an investigation into this.  Where lies that investigation?  Has it evaporated too, like the rain of the summer?  Are we ever going to find out whether these people will be held to account?  If there are no consequences for any of these leaks, there will never be any change or accountability.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach detail exactly where stands the investigation into the leak of the commission's report?  When will it be finished?  When will survivors of mother and baby homes know exactly the truth of that leak?  When will the answers be published?  Will the Taoiseach shed some light on the incredible Machiavellian situation of, seemingly, one Fine Gael Minister leaking against another and a Minister of State setting a trap for him or her as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500020#S00700","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1631718900,"counter":204,"content":"<p>As the Taoiseach said, the examination is into this particular leaking of details of the mother and baby home commission's report but, more generally, around what is called unauthorised dissemination of documentation and other information relating to the work of the Cabinet.  My God, the Taoiseach has his hands full because I do not know whether a previous administration has been so leaky.  The Government is formidable in its capacity to leak, if nothing else.  It is quite astonishing and it is, as my colleague said, a very serious matter.  In this case, the leaking of this report caused incredible heartache and anger among a group of people whom the State had failed comprehensively, people who had suffered comprehensively.  We know it is not an isolated incident, however, and we will talk about the Zappone debacle later.  All of it stacks up to the most incredibly cavalier attitude in the Taoiseach's Government, and particularly among his Fine Gael colleagues, in respect of Cabinet confidentiality and the guarding and storage of Government communications and information.<\/p>  <p>  There are two further issues of concern to survivors of these institutions and their families, the first of which relates to the burials legislation.  The Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth submitted its pre-legislative scrutiny report on the Bill to the Minister before the recess.  The legislation had been unduly delayed by the Department in the first instance.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that the Minister responds swiftly to the committee's report and that the Government Bill is introduced as soon as possible?<\/p>  <p>  The other issue of concern is that there seems to be no urgency from the Government in progressing the survivors' redress scheme.  The consultative strand of the process was completed months ago, yet we still have no indication from the Minister as to when the interdepartmental group will conclude its work and report to him.  Has the Taoiseach sought an update from the Minister on when he will bring his recommendations for the redress scheme to the Government for a decision?<\/p>  <p>  I appeal to the Taoiseach to follow up on these issues in respect of survivors, but alongside those issues is the deep grievance in respect of the leaking of this report.  It is utterly outrageous, as is the other, associated behaviour.  It is happening on the Taoiseach's watch and he needs to take a hold of this.  It needs to be knocked on the head.  We need answers and there have to be sanctions.  Whoever leaked from the Cabinet should be named and shamed and sanctioned for it if the Taoiseach's Government, or any administration, is to have any credibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500020#S00800","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1631718900,"counter":205,"content":"<p>The general point the Deputies have made is valid, in regard to the protection of documentation and information.  The storage and dissemination of such information has to be protected.  I have asked for new mechanisms to be brought into play to ensure the protection of material that comes before the Government.<\/p>  <p>  The entire response of the Government to the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes is to deal, once and for all and comprehensively, with the issues that have been raised.  I am not pre-empting the outcome of the ongoing investigation but it will deal with the overall arrangements for the management of documents for Government meetings and their confidentiality.<\/p> <p>There will be an action plan on all of the recommendations that were contained in the mother and baby homes report, which will be published shortly, in terms of the survivor-centred approach, access to personal information, education and research, archiving and databases, memorialisation, restorative recognition, which I will come back to in a moment, and dignified burial.  <br\/><br\/>The key issue for many has been the information on tracing.  We have published that legislation.  It is with the committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.  It is radical.  It is in line with what most Members of the House and, in particular, the survivors&rsquo; groups wanted.  The scheme was published on the 11 May.  This is the most effective way we can meet the needs of all those who were in mother and baby homes.  It has been forwarded to the Oireachtas committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.  It gives access to birth and early life information for people who were adopted or, indeed, who otherwise have questions on their origins.  <br\/><br\/>I would like to work with Members.  I would like to see this progressed prior to the end of the legislative term.  There is a danger that it may not make it to the end of term.  In other words, it could go over.  I know that the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is watching what is happening with the pre-legislative scrutiny at the committee to try to anticipate some recommendations and changes.  That legislation covers not just all those who were adopted, but everybody who needs access to information on their origins.  It would support access to early life care, medical information and so on.  It will also provide for a comprehensive tracing service for people who want to make contact, share their information, request information from a birth relative, and make or establish a contact preference register to allow people to be able to record their preference in relation to having contact with birth relatives.  <br\/><br\/>The Minister has done detailed work on the legislation on burials.  He visited the Tuam site recently.  He met with all of the interested parties there.  That legislation is to support the excavation, exhumation and, where possible, the identification of remains and their dignified reburial.  The legislation will support intervention at the Tuam site and any other site where intervention is reasonably required by virtue of the manifestly inappropriate nature of burials that may have taken place.  Separately, the Minister and the team will engage with former residents and their advocacy groups on the question of appropriate dignified local memorialisation of a known or agreed burial site, where this is not already the case.  That legislation will be brought forward shortly.  The Minister updated Cabinet this morning on that. <br\/><br\/>With regard to compensation payments for the victims, a fundamental element of the Government action plan is to establish an <i>ex gratia <\/i>payment scheme.  This scheme will include a financial payment and a form of enhanced medical card.  An interdepartmental group was set up to develop detailed proposals for the scheme, taking account of the recommendations of the commission.  However, it is not limited to those recommendations; it can go beyond them.  The Minister has been overseeing this.  The group's work is guided by a human rights focus, and informed by consultation with survivors, which took place during March and April.  I am glad that consultation received a strong response.  The work of the group is being finalised.  The Minister looks forward to getting the group's final report and bringing the proposals to Government for approval early in this D&aacute;il term.  I hope that we have that before the House in a short while.  The Government will then establish the scheme and make it available for application as soon as possible, beginning I would say at this stage, in early 2022.  <br\/><br\/>That covers the range of issues that the Deputies have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500020#S00900","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631719500,"counter":207,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach gave no answer on the updates into the investigation into the leaking.

This wide-ranging discussion between our two governments covered the ongoing co-operation between North and South in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, including the roll-out of vaccines and the gradual reopening of society, developments in the delivery the New Decade, New Approach commitments, the development of the PEACE PLUS programme, corporate governance matters, and board appointments.  Following the meeting, the T&aacute;naiste and I participated in a joint conference with the First Minister and deputy First Minister.  <\/p>  <p>  I hosted a meeting with Sir Jeffrey Donaldson in Government Buildings on 27 August.  We had a good discussion on likely developments over the months ahead.  I emphasised to him the importance of the stability and proper functioning of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  On the Northern Ireland protocol, he outlined the serious difficulties and concerns that the unionist community have with the protocol.  I stressed that this Government was focused on supporting practical solutions and on reducing friction where possible and that we have been active in engaging with our EU partners on issues relating to the protocol.  I also outlined our ongoing outreach with stakeholders in Northern Ireland, and that we are listening carefully to the concerns of the unionist community.

Denise Mullen is an Aont&uacute; councillor in Mid Ulster.  Forty-six years ago, the Glenanne gang murdered her father in her family home.  Denise was just four when she came upon her father's lifeless body in that home.  She had to stay with her father for two hours before the medical professionals could get into the house because they were fearful the house was booby-trapped.  The Glenanne gang murdered 120 people in the Tyrone and Armagh area.  They did so in cahoots with the RUC and the British Army.  They also planted bombs in the South, killing 34 people in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in 1974.<\/p>  <p>  Just last year, Councillor Denise Mullen received a death threat from Garfield Beattie, the man who murdered her father.  These issues are ongoing in people's lives right now.  It is absolutely wrong that the British could consider giving an amnesty to people who were involved in these heinous crimes.  I have asked three taoisigh - Enda Kenny, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, and the current Taoiseach - to meet the survivors of the Glenanne gang.  The first two refused to do so and ignored those requests.  In fairness, the Taoiseach said he would, which I appreciate it.  I know the Covid pandemic has got in the way of that.  I ask him to try to find time in his schedule to finally meet those people, especially at this critical time when the British are seeking to do what they want to do.<\/p>  <p>  I also attended the 50th anniversary of the Ballymurphy massacre in Belfast.

What there is no room for is any misunderstanding on the protocol itself - the need for it and the fact it will endure.

I thank Deputies T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and McDonald for their questions.  Deputy Haughey asked about my meeting with the new DUP leader and the issue of the Executive in the North.  The DUP leader took the opportunity to highlight his concerns.  He left me in no doubt that there is unionist concern over the protocol.  Whether you agree or disagree, that was his main purpose in the meeting.  Our point back was that Europe was in solution mode and wants to create a flexible response to any issues that might arise with the operation of the protocol in respect of people living in Northern Ireland and the routine trade that goes on between the UK and Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  They are not against the shared island issue, but official unionism has had challenges in openly embracing North-South initiatives of this kind.  It is very helpful that about 1,000 people have now participated in the dialogue on the shared island.  They come from all communities and traditions in Northern Ireland and include many young people and more women.  Two new groups have been formed within that dialogue.  An all-island women's forum has been established arising out of the dialogues to give a stronger voice to women in respect of the future of the island and in terms of human rights and other aspects, which is good.<\/p>  <p>  The DUP leader was unequivocally against any amnesty.  He does not want anyone who is guilty of murdering or killing anybody to be freed from justice.  He was very clear about that at the meeting.  I took the opportunity to speak about the shared island initiative.  He wished us well and understood our bona fides.  We pointed out how we felt it was important not just to build bridges physically, as in the Narrow Water Bridge, but also to do it between people and to get practical things sorted on energy, climate change and all of that.<\/p>  <p>  On the British-Irish Association and Deputy Richmond's point, there is now a window of opportunity to see if we can get this issue resolved between the European Union, the United Kingdom and the parties in Northern Ireland with the Government in the Republic playing a facilitative role.  We have sensitised the EU system to the issues.  Commissioner &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d and I had a long meeting over dinner the day before he went to Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>It is clear to me from that meeting, as Deputy McDonald and others have said, that the EU is in solution mode.  I have conveyed that to unionist leaders and to all parties.  It is clear to us that the EU wants to be helpful.  It has invested a lot in the peace process in Ireland.  It sees it as one of the success stories of European conflicts.  Most conflicts are frozen and have not been resolved.  This one was resolved.  The PEACE fund goes up to approximately &euro;1 billion.  That was because the European Union initially put in &euro;120 million, then there were <i>pro rata<\/i>responses from the British and Irish Governments and the Executive, so &euro;1 billion will be available over and above the shared island fund for a range of range of cross-Border reconciliation projects and initiatives in the North.  Europe is invested in this.  It wants to be genuinely engaged and to try to get a resolution to this.  I agree with what Deputies Haughey and Richmond said.  It is not good enough to say that we will end all North-South co-operation unless this is resolved.  The main point made by anyone I meet is that the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement need to be retained and kept operating for the benefit of the people, so that health, housing and all the various issues relating to Covid are dealt with by the Northern Ireland Executive.<br\/><br\/>In response to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, the amnesty applies to the Glenanne gang too.  I will meet with the relatives.  I do not know if they have contacted my office.  Things have been fairly hectic and we have UN business next week.  I have met some victims in the past in a different context.  They were families of victims of the Glenanne gang.  It would be unthinkable for them to be given an amnesty.  It is unthinkable that the perpetrators of the Kingsmill massacre, Claudy bombing or Ballymurphy massacre would be given an amnesty.  I took the opportunity in my speech to the British-Irish Association to say that unilateralism has no place in the relationships between the British and Irish Governments and the parties in Northern Ireland.  The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference is looking at the question of how we deal with Brexit.  We said to the British Government that there cannot be a unilateral response to this.  I made that clear in the opening address to the conference.  I met with Ministers over that weekend.  The Chatham House rule applies to British-Irish Association meetings, which allows us to speak frankly.  There is a window of opportunity over the next month or so to try to get this resolved.  The UK Government says that it does not want to escalate tensions in the North.  I take it at its word but we need to get a solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500022#U00500","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021: Second Stage","time":1631720700,"counter":221,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500023#V00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1631720700,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>  If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will indulge me for 20 seconds, I have been made aware of comments made during today's Order of Business, and I would like to clarify that the remarks I made about the first home shared equity scheme relate to an aspect of the scheme that was informed by engagement with the Central Bank of Ireland.  The scheme is being designed as an equity product rather than being a debt on the purchaser, which is important.  I have consistently made that point in response to Opposition claims that the shared equity scheme is debt-based; it is not.  It is an equity scheme.  Through parliamentary questions and speeches on the affordable housing scheme, as recently as June, I have repeatedly stated that the operational details of the first home shared equity scheme are currently being finalised.  I stated, \"Work on the detailed design of the proposed scheme is ongoing and at an advanced stage\", as recently as June in a response to a parliamentary question.  I wanted to clarify that and thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for her indulgence.<\/p>  <p>  Today I present the Maritime Area Planning Bill to D&aacute;il, which was initiated in August of this year.  The Bill is the most significant legislative reform of maritime governance since the foundation of the State.  It seeks to establish a coherent and comprehensive marine planning system to manage development and other activities in Ireland's seas, which are one of the largest maritime areas in the EU and seven times larger than our land mass.  It covers an area of almost 500,000 sq. km.<\/p>  <p>  This is once-in-a-generation legislation.  It is a cross-government initiative, led by my Department, and is another key commitment in our programme for Government.  In preparing this ambitious Bill, we have listened to all stakeholders and balanced their needs in a fair and equitable manner that has the citizen at the heart of the process.  It has been said that we have not inherited the Earth from our parents but rather we have borrowed it from our children and, as such, the Bill is the key legal enabler for long-term protection and sustainable development of the maritime area for the next generation, including the envisaged expansion of the offshore renewable energy sector, which is required to meet Ireland's 2030 climate goals in an integrated and sustainable manner.<\/p>  <p>   The original Foreshore Act was designed to manage a gentle pace and intensity of marine use.  It will be replaced by a marine planning system for the 21st century, designed to work for all types of development from the smallest boathouse to the largest offshore renewable energy project in a way that protects our oceans through rigorous environmental assessment.<\/p>  <p>  The new system is based around four key pillars.  One is inclusive forward planning through the National Marine Planning Framework, NMPF, with comprehensive sub-national planning.  Another is the establishment of a game-changing new entity, the maritime area regulatory authority, which will be known as MARA.  It will be based in Wexford.  Another pillar is development management through a structured sequential consenting system.  The final pillar is robust provisions for investigation, enforcement action and penalties.<\/p> <p>The Bill provides the necessary legislative toolset for participatory forward planning, well-regulated development, streamlined consenting and comprehensive environmental assessment of proposals.<br\/><br\/>The Bill is part of a wider package of ongoing marine reform including: the State's first marine spatial plan, the national marine planning framework, NMPF, which I established in June of this year and is the existing plan in our plan-led approach; the Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2021 that confirms the extent of our maritime area; and separate legislation for marine protected areas for which public consultation on the first stage of this work has just concluded.<br\/><br\/>On forward planning, Parts I and 2 of the Bill restate and augment the marine forward planning provisions of thePlanning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018.  A high-level marine planning policy statement will guide all marine policies.  Designated maritime area plans will provide for comprehensive sub-national planning.  Prepared by a designated competent authority, underpinned by a mandatory publicparticipation statement and subject to my oversight and Oireachtas approval, specific designated maritime area plans may include allowed or restricted usages, spatial designations, if any, and mitigating or beneficial measures.<br\/><br\/>Part 3 of the Bill establishes a new agency called the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority.  MARA will administer and enforce marine property consent and licences and ensure compliance with offshore development consents.  The establishment of MARA is the physical embodiment of this Government's maritime ambitions and will be transformational in Ireland's marine governance, creating a centre of excellence, independent decision-making and proactive enforcement.  MARA will be one of the fulcrums of inter-agency collaboration needed to properly harness and protect our ocean wealth.<br\/><br\/>A new property consenting regime is established by Part 4 of this Bill.  Maritime area consent, MAC, in essence considers the person applying and financial terms of occupation.  Granted maritime area consents will govern the relationship between the State and the holder, place necessary obligations on the holder and ensure appropriate returns to the State.Maritime area consent holders will have no right to occupy or develop until the public have had their say and the project detail is fully assessed and planning permission granted.<br\/><br\/>The consenting for development and other activities in the maritime area is dealt with in two ways.  First, the terrestrial planning permission regime, augmented by marine-specific considerations, will be extended to the whole maritime area.  This is done in Part 8 of the Bill.  An Bord Plean&aring;la and local authorities will carry out the required planning and environmental assessments of projects in a manner familiar to the public, with all of the associated opportunities for submissions and observations and with the national marine planning framework at the top of the decision-making hierarchy.  The granting of a MAC is conditional on receiving planning permission.  In short, no one can occupy the maritime space until the project has been fully assessed and the public have had their say, both at plan making and project stages.<br\/><br\/>Part 5 introduces a new centralised licensing regime, operated by MARA.  This regime will ensure proportional, time-bound and joined-up consideration of activities ranging from the harvesting of seaweed to pre-development survey works without clogging up the already pressurised planning permission system.<br\/><br\/>On enforcement, the seas are a precious resource and we will ensure they are adequately protected from those who would do them harm.  Part 6 of this Bill provides MARA with strong powers of investigation, enforcement, prosecution and collaboration with other State bodies that manage our seas and will be a real force for the State into the future.<br\/><br\/>This Bill ensures that the MARA and local authorities have teeth when it comes to enforcement in the maritime area.  The enforcement provisions set out in this Bill are our first line of defence in that regard.  There is a lot to this legislation.  Much of it is new and we have not shied away from developing fresh concepts as well as including ways of doing things that have worked well on land.  We have informed ourselves of things that work successfully in other jurisdictions and we have been guided by input from across Government.  On that note, I particularly want to thank the joint Oireachtas committee, chaired by Deputy Steven Matthews, and all its members, for the pre-legislative scrutiny report it produced.  I am pleased to report that the majority of the recommendations put forward by the committee have been reflected in this text.  <br\/><br\/>I thank in particular our officials who have worked extremely hard and diligently, not just over the past 12 months but for a number of years, on this very important legislation.  The Government and I are determined that we strike the right balance between the three, sometimes competing, pillars of sustainable development: protecting the health of our ocean, which is crucially important; enhancing our social engagement with the sea; and developing a thriving maritime economy.  I believe these pillars can coexist through proper, conscientious long-term planning working in tandem with robust, fair and transparent consenting regimes.  That belief is reflected in this legislation. <br\/><br\/>In conclusion, I look forward to our debate on the Bill's provisions.  I will seek to respond to any specific questions and will engage further on Committee Stage.  I commend this Bill to the House. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500023#V00300","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631721300,"counter":224,"content":"<p>On a point of order, when a Bill is introduced the Minister would normally take us through the relevant sections.

That is all I am asking for.  On 24 June last year, the Minister said that the \"shared equity scheme is focused on those who need it most.  It will work.  It has been passed by the Central Bank, has received approval...\".  That was what the Minister told the House last June.  We knew that was not the case because we wrote to the Central Bank, which stated it was not.  He said the same thing again on \"Prime Time\" last week.  I presume the Minister is trying to say he misspoke rather than misled both the D&aacute;il and the good viewers of RT&Eacute;.  I accept his clarification.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to the Bill, this is incredibly important legislation.  It is also, as Deputy Boyd Barrett pointed out, incredibly complex.  It runs to 245 pages and has 181 sections.  Significantly, there are 22 pages of detailed amendments to the planning and development Acts, which Deputies who have been in the House longer than I have already know is very complex, unwieldy and at times contradictory legislation.  I say all that because while the officials have done an incredible piece of work in bringing the legislation to this stage, this House now has the onerous task of ensuring we give this legislation due and detailed consideration.  The Minister is right.  This is once-in-a-generation legislation.  It will define all planning applications for an area seven times the size of the State's landmass for 30, 40 or 50 years and, therefore, if we get it right we will have what everybody in this House wants - a marine planning regime fit for purpose to suit the varied interests of people using it.<\/p>  <p>  If, as has too often been the case in the past, we do not get it right, we will come back again and again, either through legislation, the courts or the European courts, to correct things that elected Members have a duty to get right at this stage.  It is, therefore, very important that the Government and the Oireachtas housing committee give sufficient time to this.  I cannot see that being a problem.<\/p> <p>I would also ask the Minister to make his officials available for any level of technical briefings that the committee or individual members of it may want in advance of Committee Stage to ensure we fully understand this complex legislation.<\/p> <p> The Minister said the majority of the 29 very detailed recommendations made by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage in its prelegislative scrutiny report are reflected in the Bill.  I submitted a parliamentary question today requesting the Minister to set out in table form exactly where in the Bill they are dealt with and to what extent.  That would be really helpful.  That has been asked as a genuine question.  I would be grateful if the Minister would respond to it.<\/p> <p> I have a concern, based on my first and second reading of the Bill, that some key aspects of what we asked for are not fully reflected.  I will tease through some of them more as questions than as comments because they are important.  One of the biggest areas of concern at the prelegislative scrutiny stage was the lag between the planning regime, which is in front of us, and the marine protected areas legislation, which we have been told will be brought forward later in the year.  I find it hard to imagine we will get that, get through it and have it enacted by the end of the year, although we would be facilitative of it if that could be the case.  Even if it is passed early next year, it might be up to two or three years before the designation of marine protected areas takes place after that.   That is a very long and slow process.  That then creates obvious problems with the immediate applications, whether it be for marine area consent or subsequent planning applications and the transitional projects that will follow the passing of this Bill.  I am still of the view, as the committee was, that these two measures should have been done in parallel but, given that they are not, I do not see in this Bill what interim protections will be put in place for areas that are likely to be designated as marine protected areas.  What additional protections can be put in place to address all of that?  Also, what additional level of public participation, particularly for experts and environmental NGOs which have much expertise in this area, will be given?  Notwithstanding the long timelag between the passing of the planning regime and the planning applications that will follow, and the designation of the marine protected areas, what can be done to ensure they are, notwithstanding the lack of former protection, protected nonetheless?<\/p> <p> Section 6 deals with the marine planning policy statement about which I have a significant concern.  It seems this will be developed without any public participation from sectoral organisations, academic experts or the wider public.  If my reading of that section is the case, that is very considerable flaw.  It may well be in conflict with the Article 15.2 of the Constitution and with our international obligations under the Aarhus Convention.  I would have thought a policy statement of that nature would be developed not only by the Minister and the Department but in partnership with all those other agencies, namely, the public, academic and specialised environmental NGOs, which would bring their expertise to bear.  Perhaps I am missing something in that section but that is how it reads to me.<\/p> <p> Are the ministerial guidelines in section 7, which sets out the procedure for issuing ministerial planning guidelines, mandatory?  Do they have the same force, for example, as the highly controversial mandatory ministerial guidelines that apply to building heights and design standards in terrestrial planning?  If they are mandatory, why bother calling them guidelines?  What not just say exactly what they are, namely, directives?  That would make it much easier for everybody to live with.  Again, there seems to be virtually no public or, importantly, Oireachtas participation or consultation in the issuing of those.  That gives me some cause for concern.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's views on that.<\/p> <p> The marine planning framework review will take place after six years, as I understand from section 17, but best practice internationally would provide for an interim review after a year.  That is an insertion the Minister should make on Committee or Report Stage.  Certainly, it is an amendment I intend to introduce.  Given the controversial way the marine planning framework was introduced without a vote of the Oireachtas or having been properly scrutinised by the D&aacute;il, I would have thought an interim review would provide an opportunity to tease out some of those matters and for the Opposition and the Government to reach a level of agreement on them, which we did not have when the marine planning framework was originally approved.<\/p> <p> With respect to the designated maritime area plans which come under section 20, I am unclear as to who can become a competent authority, designated by a capital \"D\" and against what criteria that competent authority would be determined.  It would be helpful to have some clarity on that.<\/p> <p> Protected sites are referred to in section 21(2)(c).  These are the already designated sites.  That is only a tiny fraction of what we should have reached by 2020, let alone what we have to reach by 2030.  Could proposed protected areas also be included in this section?  That goes back to the an earlier point I made.  Could some form of interim protections be included in advance of any designation for a maritime area plan for example?  My big worry is that if we do not do that, we could unintentionally see significant further deterioration of our biodiversity or, even if there is not further deterioration of it, we could not necessarily see a restoration of the biodiversity loss we have experienced to date.<\/p> <p> The marine area regulatory authority has been very nicely given the acronym, MARA, and whoever thought that up should get a badge or star.  Part 3 deals with the establishment of the new agency.  If that is done right it will be a major addition to the regulatory infrastructure, not only of the marine but of the State.  However, that means it needs to be fully independent and it needs to have the appropriate level of staff and board expertise, skills and experience.  I am not saying there is anything in the Bill that suggests it would not have that, but that is something about which I would keen to hear more from the officials in a briefing and more from the Minister in his reply to this debate or on Committee Stage.  This Part is very detailed.  I have many questions on it but I do not have time to go through them now.  I would be pleased if we could deal with them at future engagements. <\/p> <p> Part 4 deals with maritime area consent.  Deputy Boyd Barrett will note I am trying to do my best to talk him through as many of the sections as possible.  The Part deals with the granting of the marine area consents as well as changes to consents, interim consents and surrender of consents.  It is important people understand all of those provisions that are included.  This Part also deals with the rehabilitation of security requirements.  This is really important particularly in the context of the ongoing disaster that is Derrybrien, which is costing not only the people of that part of Ireland enormous stress and strain but the State very considerable sums of taxpayers&rsquo; money on a daily basis.  The big omission in it is the absence of any public participation.  Again, if I am wrong, I ask the Minister to correct me and detail that in his reply to the debate.  Why have prescribed bodies not being included in this process?  It would have seemed to me, even if there is not a wider public participation process, that including prescribed bodies that would ordinarily be included and their expert opinion sought in the terrestrial planning process would be very good here.  It would strengthen the decision-making process and if it were to do that, it would strengthen the quality of the decision at the end, which would have a knock-on positive effect for the overall planning grant.  That is something we all want to see.  I have some concerns about whether this particular gap is in line with our requirements under the Aarhus Convention.  I am particularly concerned with how it will deal with the transitionary projects - the key first round of applications for those projects that are already in the pipeline and will be key for us to meet our renewable energy targets for 2030.<\/p> <p> The last area I want to mention is the sections that deal with judicial review.  I have a very strong view that the courts are the last place to be making complex planning decisions on land or in the maritime, but restricting people&rsquo;s access to justice is not the right way to deal with that.  It is not the best way to reduce the volume of planning-related judicial reviews in our courts.  There is a narrative that is growing ever louder, namely, that somehow a portion, if not a large volume, of the judicial reviews working their way through our courts are vexatious.  Some 68% of applications for judicial review are rejected.  The suggestion that any of those that are not rejected and get leave to be heard are somehow vexatious seems not only to cast aspersions on our Judiciary but to challenge the independence of the Judiciary to make those kinds of decisions.  There is a very significant bar that justices have to adhere to.  If restricting access to justice is not the right approach, what is the right approach to reduce the level of judicial reviews, a matter on which we are agreed?  In my view it is the best possible transposition of EU environmental directives, full compliance with the Aarhus Convention and involving the greatest possible participation of the public and sectoral interests at the earliest moment in the planning process so that people feel they have adequate buy-in.<\/p> <p>It also involves ensuring that, when planning decisions are made, particularly in respect of large offshore wind projects, they are made in a way that protects our marine biodiversity as well as the economic and social well-being of our coastal communities and inshore fishermen and fisherwomen.<\/p> <p> I therefore have concerns, especially regarding sections 103 and 104, which deal with judicial reviews and maritime area consents.  I believe these provisions seek to restrict access to justice, particularly for environmental non-governmental organisations.  If that is the case, that is a mistake.  I am also convinced these sections are not compliant with the Aarhus Convention.  Likewise, section 128(1) appears to be an attempt to restrict access to justice.  This could also be in strong conflict with section 50B(1) of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  I am on the same page as the Government in wanting to get stuff out of the courts but I have a very different set of propositions as to how to do that.  I would like the Minister to consider that matter.<\/p> <p> Before I hand over to my colleague, I will make some general concluding remarks.  My strong view and that of our party is we need to ensure the competing demands regarding the use of the maritime area are addressed in a way that preserves and protects marine biodiversity, respects the interests of coastal communities and inshore fishermen and fisherwomen and provides the greatest possible level of public participation in all aspects of marine planning.  If we strike the right balance, the desire we all have to see significant progress in the development of large-scale offshore renewable wind energy projects can be achieved.  We are all on the same page with regard to that objective.  However, if we do not strike that balance correctly, and there are areas of this Bill where that may be the case, not only will there be further losses in environment and biodiversity, but there will also be a real risk of additional legal challenges.  We do not want additional legal challenges resulting in much-needed renewable wind energy projects being held up in either the Irish or European courts.<\/p> <p> I made exactly the same point back when Deputy Coveney was introducing the strategic housing development legislation.  Many of us on the Opposition benches, including the Minister's colleague, Deputy Cowen, who was on the committee at the time, warned that, if we were to go down the strategic housing development route, planning would not be sped up and, in fact, many projects would end up in judicial review.  That has proven correct.  The Minister is now doing the right thing and ending that process.  We are engaging with him on the legislation.  I am urging us not to make the same mistake in this legislation if we are at all able.  If the Minister takes that approach and works with those of us in the Opposition to improve aspects of the Bill that could be improved, we will be able to pass this Bill.  It will involve much work over the coming period but will result in the greatest degree of unanimity possible.  It is possible to do this.  It is being done in the Netherlands, in Denmark and in Scotland.  I know the Minister's officials have paid very close attention to these models of good practice.<\/p> <p> Again, I am coming to this not in any sort of adversarial spirit.  I wish to work collaboratively to understand this very complex legislation.  I appeal to the Minister and his officials to work with Members on the Opposition benches, or indeed on the Minister's own backbenches, who raise any legitimate concerns so that this does not end up the same way as the marine planning framework, which got bogged down in a battle which was never political but which was based on the genuine concerns from the Opposition, and so that we get the best possible marine planning regime, one which is in the interests of all sections of our community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500024#W01500","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631722500,"counter":240,"content":"<p>My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, has substantively responded to the Bill on behalf of our party.  My responsibility, as our fisheries spokesperson, is to speak for the fishermen I am engaging with up and down the coast.  The Minister will know from the protest held outside the convention centre in recent times that there is real anger across our coastal communities that they have not historically received their fair share of the fish in our waters.  Of course, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement made that situation worse with another 15% of our quota lost, resulting in tens of millions lost every year.  To put that into context, we have at least 12% of the entirety of the waters within the European Union but get 4% of the fish.  What does that mean?  It means we lose thousands and thousands of jobs in coastal communities every year and hundreds of millions of euros.  That is the context in which the Minister is presenting this proposition to fishermen.  There is a distrust of those in positions of political leadership because of historical failures.<\/p>  <p>  I have spoken to fishermen up and down the coast about this issue.  Of course, they are not opposed to offshore energy generation.  They are intelligent people.  They understand we need to meet the State's responsibilities.  They merely ask to be genuinely consulted and that their traditional fishing grounds be respected.  I understand the industry states this is also its desire.  The task facing the Minister in this legislation is to ensure there are robust measures in place regarding consultation, especially with coastal and fishing communities, so that they will genuinely be partners in this process.  They are not there to prevent the establishment of offshore energy projects in this State.  They just want to make sure they can fish.<\/p>  <p>  A comment has struck me again and again.  I put to some fishermen the idea of increased financial supports when they are tied up.  They are increasingly forced to fish for lobster and crab.  Access to mackerel, herring and other fish such as spurdog has been denied to them, so they are squeezed more and more.  I talked about financial supports and subsidies and it struck me that people on a number of piers said they just want to fish like those who came before them.  Of course, they want to do so sustainably.  They asked for officials of the Marine Institute to go out with them and officials of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority to come out to the pier to examine what they are landing.  They said they just want to fish sustainably.  That is all our coastal communities want to do.  I believe we can do both.  These ideas are not in conflict with one another.<\/p>  <p>  The marine resource is immense.  The protection of marine biodiversity is the responsibility of all.  I appeal to the Minister, as did my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, to get this legislation right.  There have obviously been substantive submissions from inshore fishermen's organisations and others into this process.  I ask that, at the various stages, these groups are heard and engaged with.  If we do this right, we might get legislation which strikes the right balance and does justice to all stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500026#Y00200","speaker":"1463"},{"type":"speech","time":1631722500,"counter":241,"content":"<p>So interested is the Labour Party in this legislation that we are providing three speakers this afternoon.

I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  As we know, it provides a legislative framework for a new streamlined development consent process for activities in the maritime area, including offshore renewable projects.  As has been said many times in this debate, our sea area is seven times the size of our land mass.  As an island nation with one of the largest seabed territories in Europe, this Bill will be essential in shaping the future of marine areas and developing a spatial strategy for that entire area.  If done correctly, it will help scale up our renewable energy capacity and protect our coastal communities and marine habitats while also providing a foundation for what need to be sustainable fishing and tourism sectors.<\/p>  <p>  As have others, I note that environmental NGOs such as An Taisce, the Irish Wildlife Trust and the Sustainable Water Network, in addition to some in our inshore fishing community, have voiced their dissatisfaction with the prior consultation process.  As far as they are concerned, this has not adequately considered many of the issues they have raised in the required depth.  However, we are well aware, particularly in the context of the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, that we cannot delay any longer with regard to the development of renewable energy, such as offshore wind.  That sector will be enabled by this unprecedented legislation.  That being said, good consultation is always key, as I hope the Minister would accept, as is parliamentary scrutiny.  I know the Minister will understand and appreciate that and will engage with the committee on amendments and so on.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party supports the thrust of this Bill, especially with regard to the need to address the current lack of cohesion around Ireland's marine planning consent regimes and the confusion and duplication this causes.  Anybody who represents a coastal community or constituency will understand the concerns people have and the problems that have arisen in respect of the range of different agencies and organisations involved, the planning consents and so on and how these affect economic and environmental development in our coastal areas.<\/p> <p>We are also conscious that the passing of this Bill with appropriate amendments will be essential in helping Ireland to reach its climate action and renewable energy targets, particularly in enabling the scaling-up of offshore renewable energy.<\/p> <p> To achieve our climate action goals, we will have to lean heavily on renewable energy and offshore wind energy will play an enormous part in that.  Ireland needs to harness its potential to be a world leader in wind energy as part of a broader new industrial strategy, aside from meeting our climate action targets.  The case of Denmark, a similar-sized country, is illustrative.  Since the oil crisis in the 1970s, the Danes have invested heavily to become world leaders in wind energy and turbine production, having the world's largest wind turbine industry with 90% of its output exported.  Consequently, the country has the highest proportion of wind power in the world, accounting for a little under half of its total electricity consumption.  This has drastically cut its carbon emissions and decreased citizens' energy bills and the country's dependence on imported fossil fuels, which are subject to geopolitical and price instability.<\/p> <p> We need to take this example as a model of best practice and apply it here.  If we are ambitious enough, Ireland can become the next superpower in renewable energy and produce up to 5,000 MW of offshore wind energy by 2030.  Wind power has the potential to transform our country in a similar way to how oil transformed the economies of the Gulf states.  Respected economists have written and commented about this.  We have the potential to achieve energy independence and become an exporter of clean power to the EU grid.  If we are to achieve this, we must have a national strategy that does not allow us to fall prey to the so-called resource paradox we have seen in other resource-rich countries, wherein strategic assets are sold off and privatised without any public gain.<\/p> <p> A significant part of the emergence of the Danish wind success story was the birth of local community wind co-operatives.  For instance, Denmark requires 20% of all renewable energy projects to be offered to local communities with 67% of onshore wind energy coming from citizen-owned parks in 2016.  Such wind farm developments, whether onshore or offshore, work best when there is active stakeholder consultation and participation and community involvement from beginning to end and where local communities benefit directly and indirectly from the sites.<\/p> <p> I urge the Minister and Government to examine the Danish experience in the context of this Bill and of broader Government policy to strengthen community involvement, co-ownership and acceptance of offshore wind projects.  While the need for offshore renewable energy and energy security is clear, we also have to strive to protect the delicate ecology of our seas.  Our climate and biodiversity crises are inextricably linked.  As a recent joint report from the UN's leading climate change and biodiversity bodies stated, we can either solve both crises or solve neither.<\/p> <p> The Labour Party has been at the forefront of biodiversity protection along with climate action.  In our latest manifesto we made a clear promise to set up maritime conservation zones to allow Irish fish stocks to recover.  Such marine protected areas are necessary and are obligatory under the EU's maritime spatial planning directive, which states that countries must have an ecosystems-based, sustainable approach in respect of marine planning frameworks.  The process of scaling up designation of MPAs in Ireland to 30% of maritime area over the next decade is welcome.  As it stands, however, as was referenced earlier, there is minimal participation of Ireland seas, covering just over 10,000 sq. km.  At just 2% of Ireland's total maritime area of nearly 500,000 sq. km, this is among the lowest in the world.  We are falling short of our international and commitments in this regard.  Significant concerns have been expressed by environmental experts on this issue, particularly about the incredibly slow progress by Government until now in the context of marine protected areas.  Professor Crowe of the UCD Earth Institute stated: \"Current Irish legislation does not define MPAs and is limited in its ability to enable the conservation of many of Ireland&rsquo;s threatened or important species, habitats and other marine features of biological or cultural significance.\"  His report concludes, and this view is shared by other experts and environmental groups, that Ireland's network of protected areas \"cannot be considered coherent, representative, connected or resilient or to be meeting Ireland&rsquo;s international commitments and legal obligations.\"<\/p> <p>  We know from the experience of other EU countries that such legislation may take two to three years to pass, be enacted and come into effect.  I urge Government to strengthen and implement any interim measures it can to protect areas of the marine environment in the meantime.  I extend my party's support to this Bill.  We look forward to proposing more detailed amendments on the issues I raised and those that others may raise in this debate at later stages of the legislative process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500026#Y00900","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631723100,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I thank our spokesperson for affording me five minutes to contribute to a Bill that runs to 245 pages.  As one not known for short speeches, I will do my best to touch on one or two aspects of this.  The Long Title begins, \"An Act to regulate the marine area\".  That is a mouthful and that is an ambition.  It is to regulate an area that is seven times the size of our land mass.  We are doing it for the first time.  For too long, this island nation ignored or at least downplayed the importance of the marine environment and the seas that surround us.  We have traditionally been fixated by the land.  The emotional and visceral attachment of the people to the land is evident in our history and our literature.  We are finally looking to the sea, not only as a means of transport for our goods and, as in the past, of escaping poverty, or for our fisheries, important as they are, but also to address our protection of marine diversity and as a means of addressing the critical and urgent goal of decarbonising our economy.<\/p>  <p>  As my colleague, Deputy Nash, said and others alluded to, wind potential is enormous around our island nation.  It is the future in terms of decarbonising our economy and we need to progress quickly to harness the technologies available to do that.  That will initially mean harvesting off our eastern and southern coasts.  Then, when technologies develop, which will not be in the very distant future, it will be in the area the Leas-Cheann Comhairle represents.  There is the greatest potential for floating wind turbines off our west coast.  We need to do that in a regulated way to make space for all marine utilities, and in a sustainable and planned way, in co-operation with all sea users.  That is why a regulatory framework of this kind is essential.<\/p>  <p>  I will make a brief point on that and we will come back to it.  We need to move quickly on who will service those offshore wind facilities.  We need a designated port.  I have had discussions with a number of Departments and Ministers and there is no urgency about ensuring we have a designated port to service offshore wind.  The bids and the investment are coming in from Pembroke in Wales, Liverpool in England and other ports.  If we do not get our act together, we will lose the capacity to service our offshore wind facilities from our own port.  I will come back to that point.<\/p>  <p>  In the couple of minutes I have left, I will address one important aspect of the Bill.  That is the exciting establishment of a new marine area regulatory authority with, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, a wonderful acronym, MARA.  This maritime regulator can ensure the optimum and orderly development of our coastal potential.  I am delighted this new agency is to be sited in Wexford.<\/p> <p>That was a prescient, wise and intelligent move by the Government.  The body will become an important component of a new maritime area in Wexford town.  It will be sited ultimately in a development now under way, namely, Trinity Wharf.  I express my appreciation to the Government and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, for the decision to site it there.  It will have synergies with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which is already sited there.  It is a good and wise decision.  The maritime tradition of Wexford is second to none.  Many streets in the town are called after vessels that sailed from the harbour, of which there were hundreds over centuries.  It is appropriate, therefore, that down the quay front from the statue that commemorates the founder of the United States navy, Commodore John Barry, a new agency will regulate the next and most exciting chapter of Ireland's sea tradition.<br\/><br\/>I want to make a few remarks on the board of the proposed maritime area regulatory authority.  Section 43 of the Bill, a critical part of the legislation dealing with the establishment of the board, provides that it will have a chair and ordinary members.  Those ordinary members will comprise five civil servants, a representative of the County and City Management Association, CCMA, and four others.  We need to revisit that.  This independent agency will be as important as An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Five representatives of five Departments and the representative of the CCMA making up a majority is not exactly the ideal independent board I would want to see.  I make that point openly.  Section 46 excludes Deputies, MEPs and Senators from serving on the board.  That is fine and I do not quibble with it.  I do quibble, however, with the additional exclusion under that section of elected members of local authorities.  It says something about the attitude of Government that the county managers are included <i>ex officio<\/i>but elected council members are specifically excluded.  Those members would have something to add and at least one should be included.<br\/><br\/>My time is almost up.  I will have an opportunity in committee to deal with other issues.  I will look carefully at the judicial review procedure and I was interested to hear Deputy &Oacute; Broin's view on it.  The threshold for getting a judicial review is very low, although the Deputy rightly says that 68% of applications do not even meet that low threshold.  A large number, however, do meet it.  I agree with him that the courts are not the place to ventilate complicated planning matters and we should try to avoid that.  I expect there will be people who simply want to delay process.  If there is another avenue to go and a statable case, no matter how hopeless the argument, they can get a judicial review.  That is something we can look at again.  This is important legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500027#Z00200","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631723700,"counter":251,"content":"<p>While I have the floor, I beg the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's indulgence on a small matter of etiquette and good manners.

We know we will need 27 GW of offshore wind to meet our zero-carbon targets by 2050.  Putting that into perspective, Moneypoint power station generates approximately 850 MW.  The opportunity is there in terms of offshore generation.  There are questions inherent in this legislation that have yet to be answered in regard to the offshore opportunity.  We know that wind will provide a source for decarbonisation.  We know it must come from floating offshore wind on the south and west coasts because traditional fixed-bottom offshore technology is only for shallow waters such as those of the Irish Sea, which gives limited space and capacity for the development at scale that is needed.  We must start now by ensuring that floating wind projects contribute to the target of 5 GW of offshore wind by 2030.  Starting now means we can begin to develop the supply chain, including at ports such as Cork, in order that floating wind platforms can be deployed from Irish ports up to and beyond the 2030s.<\/p>  <p>  A major constraint on starting now and securing the benefits of floating wind for Ireland stems from the uncertainty from Government on how the sector will be progressed in the short, medium and long term.  The forthcoming climate action plan should have a target for floating wind.  Will the Minister tell us whether this has been addressed?  How will he ensure the legislation caters for floating wind development?  In order for floating wind projects to contribute to our 2030 target, developers need to be surveying at sea next spring or summer.  If developers have to wait for the new regulatory authority to be set up, which could take up to 18 months from the passing of the Bill, they could miss the boat.  How will the Minister ensure floating wind developers can achieve permission to survey outside of the 12 nautical miles zone in 2022?  The maritime area planning legislation is a major reform, as we know, but Ireland has been sea-blind for too many decades at this stage.  That is evident to everyone here.  We want to ensure the industry can scale up and scale out.  Those permissions for surveying need to be given as soon as possible and that should be addressed within this legislation.  We are calling on the Minister to provide those consents in advance of the regulatory authority being set up in Wexford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500028#AA00600","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1631723700,"counter":256,"content":"<p>Is &uacute;dar d&iacute;oma dom nach bhfuil agam ach seacht n&oacute;im&eacute;ad.

It probably has not received much attention outside the specific sectors that are considering it but it potentially has significant ramifications for large parts of the country.  The Bill consists of 245 pages setting out a planning regime for a maritime area that is seven times the footprint of the land mass of the State.  It is enormous.  This is once-in-a-generation legislation, so it is crucial that we get it right.<\/p>  <p>  There are enormous opportunities in this area.  I think of my own locality in terms of Cork Harbour and the potential that exists there for offshore wind energy.  This is vitally important.  It is difficult not to think of some of the failures in connection with wind turbines on land, which is very important and valuable technology.  However, too often, the planning process that surrounded such wind turbines led to conflict with local communities and misunderstandings.  A lot of that arose from inadequate consultation.  I am hoping that through this legislation we will ensure those mistakes are not repeated and that the consultation is very intensive and gives adequate opportunities for communities to have their say.  In so doing, it is likely that the danger of legal challenges and conflicts with heritage legislation, conservation areas and designations of that kind will be minimised.  We need to ensure the communities in question buy into that.<\/p>  <p>  That brings me on to the second point on which I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  The first point on which I agree with him relates to the title of the organisation, which should be in Irish, in keeping with the Official Languages (Amendment) Bill that is currently going through these Houses.  As well as being crucial in terms of energy and climate change and the benefits that can bring, there is also the potential for significant generation of wealth.  I would much prefer, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v pointed out, that it would be either the State or local communities that would benefit from that wealth and that, as much as possible, the State or community energy trusts should be directly involved.  That would also be a subtle way to ensure there is community buy-in for this.  Local communities, particularly those that could be affected by the generation of wind energy, need to benefit from the wealth it may create.<\/p>  <p>  A maritime issue that could be affected by the Bill is that of draft net fishermen.  It is a very specific issue but I wish to flag it because I have raised it in the past .  There are not many draft net fishermen left.  They are in a very small number of locations.  Their experience is that since the regulations were changed and they came under Inland Fisheries Ireland some years ago, their voice has not been adequately heard.  It is a long tradition but there are very few people still at it.  We need to look at the structures in order to ensure the voice of the draft net fishermen and fisherwomen is heard and that they are adequately represented.

I welcome this focus on the sea and how we can better manage this incredible resource in a sustainable way for the benefit of coastal and island communities.<\/p> <p>Clearer structures and more cohesive governance are to be welcomed, but I want to emphasise the need for stronger assurances around public involvement, justice, and sustainability. <\/p> <p> The Maritime Area Planning Bill will bring in an entirely new legislative framework for development consent and management of Ireland's offshore marine area.  It will have considerable impact on how offshore developments are planned into the future.  The significance of the legislation for all stakeholders cannot be underestimated.  We have very limited opportunities for public involvement in our decision-making.  While the Bill has sections on public participation, it is only in very specific and limited ways.  Public involvement should be something the State fosters and encourages as part of a functioning republic.  The Aarhus Convention formally outlines everyone's rights to participate in environmental decision-making, and these rights are further articulated in the European Parliament and Council directives.<\/p> <p> Unfortunately, where marine issues are concerned, the Government's record on public engagement falls well short.  Back in April, I and other Opposition Deputies objected to the pushing through of the national marine planning framework without proper scrutiny by fishing communities, other maritime sectors and coastal and island communities.  This situation was exemplified by the mess-up in the 2019 fishing directive, which excluded trawling by vessels over 18 m in waters inside the six-nautical mile zone.  Last year the High Court overturned the ban due to problems with the consultation process.  The law banning trawling by large boats in coastal waters was designed to ensure sustainable fishing practices and to protect the livelihoods of small-scale and island fishing communities who rely on inshore fishing.  Although the Minister has appealed the decision, and that is welcome, it is taking time and there is still considerable confusion and fear it will be overturned again.  While this example concerns inshore issues, it demonstrates the very obvious problems with our public consultation process.<\/p> <p> Too often, an online submission and a public meeting is considered sufficient by Departments, which can too easily override the views and experiences of locals.  The Bill makes extensive reference to public participation, but this comes with caveats and a poor track record.  This principle will need to be strengthened in the Bill to ensure coastal and island communities have a strong voice in determining what happens to them.<\/p> <p> Second, the Bill must include explicit references to balanced approaches based on natural justice in the running of the new agency, the maritime area regulatory authority.  Maritime area planning facilitates the type of sustainable investment we need in infrastructure such as offshore renewable energy production.  However, this cannot be done at the cost of local communities.  Fishers, marine tourism and other stakeholders can all be negatively impacted by the developments this Bill will enable.  For example, inshore fishers on the east coast are already experiencing disruption caused by surveys for potential offshore wind farms.  Even at the survey and site investigation stage, they are being limited in the areas they can fish, without sufficient compensation - it does not even come close - and engagement.  That is just at the site investigation stage.  Imagine what the impact will be when we get to the construction stage.<\/p> <p> The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is working on a liaison process, but this belated initiative should have been in place before.  Fishers are eager to engage and seek solutions but are rightly sceptical of new systems that only seem to have their interests as an afterthought.  There is significant detail in the Bill on the board of the maritime area regulatory authority.  While this is only correct, it is showing that the same level of attention has not been included to protect the interests of coastal and island communities.  I urge the Minister to add new sections enshrining processes based on natural justice and valuing existing marine sectors.<\/p> <p> Third, the Bill makes reference to sustainable maritime usages and sustainable development.  However, at the same time we know that the national marine planning framework allows for exploration and production of petroleum.  In a climate crisis, when we need to be keeping fossil fuels in the ground, the Government's policy is planning for oil drilling.  We have little opportunity to change the national marine planning framework, which was rushed through a few months ago, but the Minister has an opportunity to ban this type of activity through the Bill.  It is essential the maritime area regulatory authority's commitment to sustainability is real and impactful rather than being in name only.  The Bill has to reflect our climate obligations and the immediacy of climate action.  Any energy projects need to be entirely renewable and should be State-led rather than permitting corporations to make massive profits in exchange for a handful of local jobs.  The Government should be spearheading public bodies to develop renewable energy projects that will guarantee our energy sovereignty and provide decent jobs for coastal communities.<\/p> <p> This Bill forms part of major changes concerning maritime governance and planning.  It is interconnected with the national marine planning framework, which outlines the Government&rsquo;s objectives and marine planning policies, the Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2021, which establishes boundaries and zones in the territorial sea, and the policy statement on the framework for Ireland's offshore electricity transmission system.  The Minister needs to work with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to develop a broad public information campaign to show how this patchwork of laws and regulations will work and how communities will be affected and can take action, if required.<\/p> <p> As a Deputy representing a coastal constituency, I always welcome a focus on the sea and its considerable potential.  However, this needs to be done in a fair, transparent and sustainable way for the benefit of coastal and island communities.  This Bill has a way to go to achieve this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500029#BB00700","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631724900,"counter":265,"content":"<p>This Bill, in principle, is welcome as an important step to provide a legislative basis for marine-based activities and development.  However, it needs to be done sustainably in tandem with our international climate action and biodiversity obligations.<\/p>  <p>  Looking out over the sea from my constituency in County Wicklow, you can see the changes on the horizon.  From small developments to large-scale offshore renewable energy proposals, our relationship with the sea is changing, and rapidly, as we enter a more intense phase of combating climate change.  Managing this development requires a generational shift from our historic approach to planning and development.  I listened earlier on as some of our colleagues talked about how, to date, we in Ireland have been what is called sea blind and we have not focused our attention enough as our attention and focus tends to be on the land.  I must respectfully disagree.  I too am from very close to Trinity Wharf.  I grew up a minute's walk away from it.  My family, including my brother, dad and grandad, and I worked on the boats.  I know I can speak for every person who lives in a coastal community or works in a fishing community when I say that the sea and fishing is intrinsic to who we are.  Culturally, we are very connected with our sea and maritime areas.  That goes for every community, whether it is Wexford town, Arklow, Wicklow or the west coast.  What we have not done to date is protect it properly.  That is where our focus has not been.  We have not focused on ensuring that we manage it sustainably and look after it for future generations.  That is where this Bill should be coming in.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has the largest maritime area in the whole of the EU.  That is of huge benefit to us, but it is also a huge responsibility.  How we manage our marine areas will be key to the success of our response to climate change and the biodiversity crisis.  It will also be the key to the success of development.  We know we have to meet our climate obligations.  A large part of that will be wind farms and offshore developments, but we do need to get the balance right.  In my speech today, I will talk primarily about biodiversity and the environment, because that is where the focus should have been when we were developing this Bill.  It should have been the priority and the development should happen afterwards.<\/p>  <p>  Under the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, member states should collectively legally protect at least 30% of EU land and marine areas, with at least 10% of such land and marine areas being subject to particularly strict protection.  Yet, at present only 2.4% of Irish waters are designated as such.  It is the second lowest in the EU, despite Ireland agreeing to designate 10% by 2020 and 30% by 2030 under the EU biodiversity strategy.  The Minister will know that I have repeatedly called this out because it is something that I am particularly interested in.<\/p>  <p>  We talk about the size of our maritime area and how 90% of Ireland is under water.  I think probably all of the speeches today have referenced that.  I know that because I spent weeks and months surveying those sites, whether on the Marine Institute survey boats or on fishing boats.  I have been out and I know how vast and fantastic it is and what an amazing resource it is.  I also understand why we need to protect it.<\/p>  <p>  To address the gap in protecting our biodiversity, since becoming a legislator, I have sought to protect our basking shark populations through a Private Member's Bill.  I am thankful I received good support from the Minister on that.  While it is an important step, it is only a small step.  That is the reality.  It would be fantastic to protect the species but there are many species out there that need that level of protection.  That includes our shark species.  What we need to be doing, in conjunction with protecting particular species, is protecting the areas where they are.  We are looking at areas and nursery spots like Tralee Bay and Dingle Bay with a view to ensuring those areas are protected and those vulnerable species are safe there.<\/p> <p>That really needs to be where we are going.  When talking about marine protected areas, MPAs, it is key that they be ecologically coherent.  There is no point in just selecting a spot offshore and saying it is now protected; it needs to be ecologically important.<\/p> <p> Owing to the urgency of addressing our biodiversity crisis and the warming of our seas, establishing the MPAs must be, and should have been, the first port of call.  The timing of this Bill seems off.  The introduction of this Bill to the D&aacute;il does not resolve the current disparity between the designation of MPAs and the licensing of offshore renewables.  It is really cart-before-the-horse territory.<\/p> <p> The Government has prioritised the advancement of development- and consent-focused legislation.  Meanwhile, it has left legislation on MPAs paddy-last.  They are to be dealt with in another Bill, the heads of which have not been drafted.  Pre-legislative scrutiny has not been scheduled, and we have no timeframe for the publication, passage and enactment of the legislation.  These must all occur before we can put into place the designation process for MPAs.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, supported by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, has determined that all the essential protections will follow after the decisions and the consents granted in the marine environment context.  This clear hierarchy of priorities of Departments and business interests really does not bode well for our marine biodiversity.<\/p> <p> It is important that the Government ensures adequate time is afforded to the Oireachtas so it can really get to grips with this complex and lengthy legislation, which amounts to more than 200 pages.  It is a very complex piece of work.  The effects need to be considered very carefully, along with whether the changes to the planning Act, together with the relevant provisions in this Bill, ensure that the additional requirements under the EU's marine legislation have been sufficiently addressed.  This is particularly important given the legacy of issues concerning the process associated with the starting blocks and outputs and outcomes of this legislation.  I hope to work with the Minister to close any gaps in this regard.<\/p> <p> I have further concerns in respect of gaps in provision for public participation in respect of the key elements of this Bill.  For example, on the fundamental marine policy statement, there is no provision for public participation.  Extraordinary discretion is given to the Minister to develop on his own without any stakeholder input.  The approach proposed regarding public participation statements, as in sections 18 and 22, could be clarified and made more accessible.  We need to ensure the standard of access to information for consultations befits the technological age in which we live.  In this regard, I refer also to the issues experienced by some in accessing technology.  The burden needs to be fairly balanced between authorities and the public in the processes in question.<\/p> <p> The failure to provide for public consultation regarding maritime area consents, the granting of consents, changes to consents, and interim maritime area consents, particularly regarding rehabilitation and security requirements, is a serious concern given the significance of a maritime area consent and the benefits derived from the input of prescribed bodies and the public and their scrutiny of this process.  There are limitations in the specification of prescribed bodies for applications to the development consent board.<\/p> <p> Earlier, the Minister for Housing, Heritage and Local Government stated this Bill reflected the majority of the recommendations made on foot of pre-legislative scrutiny by the committee.  Unfortunately, some gaps have been raised.  One recommendation that has not been reflected in the Bill is, \"The completion of designation, and specification of regulation and management of Marine Protected Areas based on ecosystem requirements, required under Article 13(4) of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive as the basis for any spatial plan and consents, be provided for in the proposed bill as a precondition to the making of any plan or the granting of any consent under the legislation\".  Alternatively, it was suggested that \"the Department prioritise the introduction of separate and complementary legislation to complete the designation, regulation and management of Marine Protected Areas and subsequently that Marine Protected Areas are included in the National Marine Planning Framework and Marine Spatial Plan.\"  It is clear the environmental NGOs and people raising concerns about the MPAs understand the necessity of wind farms and meeting our climate targets.  What they wanted was to get the balance right.  That has not happened.<\/p> <p> The Government has confirmed that we will have to wait for yet another while after the recent public consultation on the MPAs as the legislation on the identification, designation and management of MPAs is expected to be developed later in 2021 and into 2022.  One can see the speed of the work on this Bill by comparison with the speed of the MPA work and that there is a risk that sites of ecological importance will not be protected.<\/p> <p> What the Government could commit to in the meantime, until all the legislation is lined up and enforceable, is the implementation of interim measures to protect areas of the marine environment given the disparity between the introduction of the proposed legislation and the absence of legislation regulating MPAs.  I have spoken to the Minister about this already.  The scientific evidence exists.  Incredible work has been done over the years by universities, the Marine Institute and many environmental NGOs.  People know where the important sites and species are to a great degree.  The protections could be put in place using their data, information and expertise.  It is important that this happen.<\/p> <p> Delays by current and past Governments in legislating effectively for marine health and our urgent need to develop clean energy have resulted in a legislative quagmire.  Who is going to come first?  Will it be marine habitats or wind farm developers?  We are now in a position in which we must do our best to align both MPA targets and the renewable energy target of 70% by 2030 and have them work in tandem.  Taking into consideration the recommendation that marine habitat concerns be considered in applications for maritime area consents and licensing, we can make this legislation work both for the environment and for the economy.  In doing so, we can facilitate the sustainable development of offshore wind energy to meet our renewables goals.<\/p> <p> It is clear, however, that there is a need for certainty in the sector, including the developers and those building the wind farms.  We expect significant investments to be made.  The lack of certainty for the investors is also an impediment.  It is important that we ensure that any bodies established be resourced fully and properly and that they can actually perform their functions, and do so quickly.  At each stage of the planning process, there should be officials with the relevant expertise in marine science, ecology and marine planning so that the needs of marine habitats will be represented during the process.  The public and civil society will need to know the point at which they can participate.  There were concerns over the participatory aspect.  At what stage, and to what extent, can communities have a say during the planning process?<\/p> <p> It is important that there be clarity in the Bill regarding how prioritisation for phase-1 projects will be given effect so they can progress with some certainty.  Interim measures have been proposed in that regard but they need to work with the interim measures proposed in respect of the biodiversity aspects.<\/p> <p> In summary, the Bill does little to help to advance the protection of the marine environment.  This is a missed opportunity.  The explanatory memorandum states a \"Designated Maritime Area Plan or DMAP will be a management plan for a specific area and can be used to develop multi-activity area plans; to promote use of specific activities; and\/or for the purposes of the sustainable use and protection of particular marine environments.\"  The question, however, is whether it will be too late for protection if there is no mechanism in place to design and designate MPAs or provide the interim protections that are required before permission is granted for the developments in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500030#CC00200","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1631725500,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Confidence in Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence: Motion","time":1631726100,"counter":268,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500032#EE00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1631726100,"counter":269,"content":"<p>The next item is a motion regarding confidence in the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence.

Since the foundation of the State, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has held that these motions are the most serious that can be tabled.  They are supposed to mark an important statement on fundamental policy failures or a serious legal issue.  The sad reality is that the issue of confidence in the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence before the House this evening has nothing to do with any of this.  It has nothing to do with seeking to protect the State or assert the rule of law.  It most certainly has nothing to do with the refusal to be accountable to the Oireachtas and the Irish people.  No questions have been ignored.  It has nothing to do with asserting a sincerely held point of principle about misconduct or the abuse of office.  Let us be clear that we are debating this motion because one party decided that it was a handy way to get publicity and deliver populist, partisan attacks.<\/p><p>There is no question or doubt about the substantive issues in this controversy; they are uncontested.  The position involved was intended to be part time and awarded no permanent benefits to anyone.  There is no allegation of a benefit being sought for or conferred on any officeholder.  Ultimately, as we know, no one was appointed to the role.<\/p><p>However, as I stressed from the beginning, there is an important matter and it is a perfectly legitimate issue of public concern.  The creation of this role and the attempt to appoint an individual to it was handled carelessly and badly.  As the House will be aware, the Minister has apologised to me, his ministerial colleagues, the Oireachtas and the public on a number of occasions for his handling of the matter.  He has accepted that I should have been informed of the proposal in good time and that the procedures followed were unacceptable.  Procedures that were not properly followed were strengthened and where they were missing have been introduced.  The Minister and the T&aacute;naiste have published extensive material, including text messages and departmental emails, about all matters relating to the appointment.  The Minister has also twice appeared without delay before an Oireachtas committee and answered lengthy and detailed questions.  His handling of this appointment was wrong but by any fair measure it would be completely out of proportion to remove a Minister on the basis of what is involved in this matter.  As I have said, I have received private and public apologies for the failure to provide appropriate notice of this proposal.  More important, procedures have been put in place to ensure this never happens again.<\/p><p>This is a coalition Government of three distinct parties, which are seeking to work together on behalf of the Irish people.  One of the most important roles for the Taoiseach in a Government such as this is to seek to sort out problems rather than to exploit them for some short-term gain.  In this case, the problem has been addressed.  There has been no reluctance to accept accountability and action has been taken to prevent any recurrence.  My primary focus is, and has been, to lead a Government that is delivering change at a radical pace even while handling once-in-a-century public health crisis.  <\/p><p>In demanding the removal of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence, Sinn F&eacute;in has made a long series of statements about what standards it believes should be implemented.  It is important to address this issue of standards that Sinn F&eacute;in says should be basic in any government.  Sinn F&eacute;in has at no point raised any concern with how the Minister has been fulfilling his duties.  There is no allegation before the House that he has neglected or mishandled any of the major issues under his supervision, some of which have seen him work directly with Sinn F&eacute;in.  The motion is before us because we are being asked to accept that the non-appointment of Katherine Zappone to a temporary and part-time envoy position was a gross abuse of office.  This is manifestly not the case and Sinn F&eacute;in is seeking to demand a standard of accountability that goes well beyond anything that party has ever been willing to practice in its 50-year history up to and including its current officeholders.<\/p><p>Some of the statements that Deputy McDonald has made in the past few days are genuinely breathtaking in their cynicism and the double standards involved.  She even went as far as to say yesterday that her party had been forced into tabling the motion because it was not &quot;prepared to look the other way&quot;.  Is Sinn F&eacute;in not prepared to look the other way?  This debate is simply not long enough for us to go through the list of dramatically worse and often sinister events where looking the other way has been the defining essence of the Sinn F&eacute;in response.  <\/p><p>It is important, however, to address the specific issue of appointments.  There is only one party in this House, which refused to act on a fair employment tribunal judgement that one of their Ministers appointed someone to the chair of an important public body because &quot;he was not from a Protestant background and because he was known to the minister and his ministerial colleagues&quot;.  The Minister involved faced no sanction from his party leader and he remains at the very top of the Sinn F&eacute;in organisation.<\/p><p>Anyone who pays any attention to appointments which are at the discretion of Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers has known that for a long time that such appointments very rarely go anywhere other than to current or former public representatives, advisers and supporters.  In the case of North-South bodies, Sinn F&eacute;in only ever nominates its own people.  This goes far beyond North-South bodies.  For example, when the acting Sinn F&eacute;in Minister for Communities was looking for someone to appoint to the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, where did she go?  She went to the party and appointed her former ministerial colleague, M&aacute;irt&iacute;n &Oacute; Muilleoir.  There are many more examples of this, every one of which is less transparent and more consequential than the part-time envoy non-appointment the party is attacking.  <\/p><p>In this, as in every other area of public life in this country, it seems that as far as Sinn F&eacute;in is concerned accountability is for other people.  Its partitionist approach of having radically different core principles on either side of the Border will some day catch up with it.  There will come a point where more broadcasters decides to stop allowing the hypocrisy to go unchallenged.  It is simply remarkable, for instance, that genuine scandals reported by programmes such as BBC Northern Ireland&rsquo;s &quot;Spotlight&quot; have been ignored in coverage in the Republic.  In various interviews in recent days, Deputy McDonald has attacked me and Fianna F&aacute;il, always casually ignoring much more serious issues, which she will not even acknowledge.  There is something genuinely unique about the ability to say on the national airwaves, &quot;I certainly don't know many millionaires&quot;, when she leads what has been for many years Ireland&rsquo;s wealthiest party, which organises fundraising among the very wealthy in New York every year, and is accepting more than &euro;3 million in a single bequest.  What would happen to any of the Government parties or indeed any other party or independent individual here if they had moved a multi-million euro bequest out of the country, from a man of no-fixed-abode who lived in a caravan, in order to accept it and to avoid any tax on it.  Can one imagine this?  <\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in did not propose to remove the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence because of any standards it advocates or implements.  It saw a political opportunity and was confident that its own behaviour would not be questioned.  <\/p><p>There is important work to do in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the errors that were made have been addressed.<\/p> <p>There has been full transparency, and every reasonable question has been responded to.  Procedures have been tightened to ensure that this will not happen again.  The Minister has apologised and I have accepted his apology.<\/p> <p> Our country is emerging from a once-in-a-century pandemic.  Our society and our economy are reopening and have to be renewed.  I am proud of the work Fianna F&aacute;il and the other Government parties are doing in this regard.  With the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, we have fundamentally transformed the State's approach to homebuilding in response to a housing crisis.  With the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, we have begun a process of profound reform of our health services.  The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, is concluding a comprehensive review of the country's national development plan, investing in services and projects for the long term, and we are preparing for a budget that will drive forward our recovery from the pandemic.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, has ensured that our children are safely back at school, with significant funding to mitigate the damage Covid has done to the learning environment and to their education.  Our young people are back enjoying third level education on campus.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, is ensuring that our farmers, agrifood producers, rural communities and fishing communities are protected for the future, particularly by the environmental schemes, which have been oversubscribed.  As a Government, we are transforming the apprenticeship sector, introducing real insurance reform, improving mental health services and radically changing services for older people and citizens with disabilities for the better.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in will play its games.  My party, Fianna F&aacute;il, and the three-party coalition Government will do what we were elected to do: we will work every month we have to improve the quality of people's lives and to build up our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500032#EE00300","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631726700,"counter":272,"content":"<p>The Green Party will vote confidence in the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Government this evening.

He was tough and gruelling but he is fair, knowledgeable, committed and sincere in all the dealings I have had with him.<\/p>  <p>  I have seen the Minister's work on Brexit.  Anyone here involved in anything to do with Brexit will have seen the very open way in which the Minister involved other parties and every section of our society in our approach to Brexit.  That shows what a capable Minister for Foreign Affairs he has been and is at present.  I am working with Deputy Coveney on the likes of the UN Security Council at the moment, at a critical time in this country's history, when we can address key issues like climate change, as the Minister is doing in the UN Security Council and elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  We need Ministers who can take initiative and who are willing sometimes to push the boundaries of what can be done.  That was typical in terms of approaching the former Minister, Katherine Zappone, to take on this critical role involving freedom of expression and LGBTQ rights.  That was not an unimportant job we were looking to get someone for, and I can see absolutely why a Minister might say to himself or herself, when considering that role, \"Katherine Zappone would be a good person for that job.\"<\/p>  <p>  I also want to speak-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500033#FF00200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1631726700,"counter":273,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1631726700,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500033#FF00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1631726700,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I want to speak, if I may, about her good name and her good reputation.  I recall sitting in one of those seats at the back of the House when she decided to go into government.  That same willingness for public service was, I believe, behind her desire to take on this role, one for which she was eminently qualified.  I remember her, in those days before she was well known or in the D&aacute;il or the Seanad, taking a lonely path with her partner into the courts to stand up for equal rights and marriage equality when no one else was willing to do so in a public way.  That makes her a very good person and well qualified, to my mind, to be a special envoy on freedom of expression and LGBTQ rights.<\/p>  <p>  There were problems with this process, as the Taoiseach has said and as the T&aacute;naiste acknowledged immediately to us.  Yes, we have to call that out, and we did.  However, I will make a couple of points.  First, as I said, you need Ministers with initiative but you also need a check, and the check is often in the Department.  The public service job is to pull up Ministers and say, \"Hold on a second here.  We have to follow right and due process.\"  As I can see, however, from listening to the Oireachtas committee hearings and elsewhere, the Departments had a similar view to the Minister's in this case; that is, that Ms Zappone would be a good person for this role.  It was not the case that the Departments were trying to hold back the Minister; they were working with the Minister to deliver.  That is very significant, to my mind, in the context of what took place.<\/p>  <p>  We were surprised, as the Taoiseach said at the time.  We do not discuss what goes on in Cabinet, but he was the first to say in Cabinet, as was I - his experience of this and mine are absolutely mirrored - that the process was not correct.  We are right to draw attention to that and to investigate it, as the Oireachtas committee has done.  However, I will vote confidence not only in the Minister as a person but also in the Government.  This is a functioning Government.  As the T&aacute;naiste said, where surprises exist you pull the other parties up and say, \"Hold on a second here.  What is happening?\".  You also have to have good faith, which does exist.  This is a functioning Government which in its first year has put through 62 pieces of legislation.  Compare that with any other jurisdiction or any other parliament.  Deputy McDonald will understand how dysfunctional government can be.  How many pieces of legislation have been put through Stormont in the past year?  We have important work to do, including in delivering the housing we are committed to delivering and in delivering fundamental change in our climate action plan and a new national development plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500033#FF00500","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1631726700,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Thank you, Minister.

We are here because the Taoiseach refuses to do his job.  He refuses to hold the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to account.  The Minister sought to make up a job for a friend and former colleague and, when caught red-handed, he went about covering his tracks.  He destroyed records he was obliged to keep under law and twice fed a cock-and-bull story to a committee of the Oireachtas.  This is by any standard an abuse of office.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in was left with no option but to move a no-confidence motion.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il go to great lengths, as does the Green Party, it seems, to cast this fiasco as a non-issue.  They want people to tune out and to sweep all this under the carpet.  The deluded response from the Taoiseach as Leader of the Government this evening is proof positive that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have held power for far too long.  The cronyism they now so loudly defend is precisely the brand of culture that has squandered the hopes of generations.  It is why governments have come and gone but nothing has really changed.  It is why the basics are denied still to so many: an affordable home, access to healthcare, a decent living.  These failures persist not by accident but because the Government parties govern for vested interests and those at the top.  Let us face it: they clubbed together to form this shambolic, out-of-touch Government because they could not countenance the idea that a new generation might get what they denied to that generation's parents and grandparents before them, that is, political change and a government that acts in the interests of citizens.  They simply could not stomach that because they believe that government belongs to them and their circle.  They believe that power is their right.  They believe that they and only they are entitled to govern and, for them, ordinary people are to be kept outside, far away from power.  This is all about power: who has it, who wields it and who has access to it.  This fiasco demonstrates again that the well-connected can literally have access to the highest level of government at the touch of a button.  However, those denied their rights and those campaigning for services are locked out and ignored.  I refer to those who regularly stand outside the D&aacute;il protesting just to get the ear of the Government.  I mean citizens with disabilities, carers, children waiting for surgery, families in Donegal and beyond whose houses are literally crumbling around them - the list is endless.  These, in my view, are the voices deserving of being heard by the Government, but the truth is that they are drowned out by the politics of cronyism.<\/p> <p>T&aacute; s&eacute; thar am d'athr&uacute;.

Tonight is about the Minister, Deputy Coveney, but it is also about their toxic culture, that culture they fester in government.  It is about their rotten way of doing business that has robbed so many of a decent life, and it goes to the heart of how politics has been conducted in this State for decades.  That must end here tonight because this generation wants and deserves far better.  We will have an Ireland that matches the ambition of our people, an Ireland driven by equality and equality only, an Ireland where the right to a home, to healthcare and to a fair economy is the bedrock of our decent society and our brighter future.<\/p> <p> I say to all Deputies who will line up this evening in defence of cronyism that they might delay change but they will not stop it.  The days of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael cosy club are numbered.  They can have the past; that belongs to them.  But the future belongs to the ordinary people of this country.

His narrative, essentially, is that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, contacted him to tell him that Katherine Zappone was looking for a UN gig and he then made contact with her.  He says she did not lobby him or ask him for a job.  Almost immediately afterwards, however, he had a conversation with his Secretary General in which he outlined his great new idea about a new UN envoy for something or other.  The Minister then contacted Katherine Zappone and told her about his great new idea.  He says he absolutely did not offer her the job he had just made up.  Nevertheless, after not being offered that job, Ms Zappone texted him to thank him for the incredible opportunity.  By the Minister's account, either he is a very bad communicator or Katherine Zappone is a dope.  Not only did she misunderstand him regarding the job offer, she even thought she had a start date.  When the Minister was not replying to her, she went as far as to contact everybody she could get a hold of to put the skids on it, including the Irish ambassador to the UN and even the T&aacute;naiste.<\/p>  <p>  What did the Minister do about this person who could not understand a simple conversation and who repeatedly went over his head to pressure him?  He offered her that job he says he had not offered her previously.  Anyone who expects the people to swallow that story is either a dope or thinks the rest of us are, because the truth is much more obvious.  A former Minister wanted a job that would get her access within the UN and her Fine Gael friends bent over backwards to make it happen.  The Minister made up a job that was not necessary and he expected Irish taxpayers to pay for it.  He allowed Katherine Zappone to draft her own job description, deleted information he was legally obliged to protect and wasted his Department's resources and staff time to justify all those actions retrospectively.  He brought the appointment to Cabinet without first informing his coalition partners, but they signed off, probably in the knowledge that at some point in the future they would want to do a favour for one of their friends because that is how Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il do business.  In fact, for hours, days and even weeks in some cases, out-of-touch Ministers could not understand what all the fuss was about, and it appears some Ministers still have that affliction.  The Taoiseach will recall that on day one, he told us to move on.  The Minister himself went on radio and arrogantly told the media not to create new stories.  Rather than deal with the debacle, Fine Gael ran a sting operation to expose that the Minister, Deputy Harris, had leaked the appointment from the Cabinet meeting because that is how business is done.<\/p>  <p>  Appointments to public bodies, right up to the Supreme Court, are decided not by what you know but who you know.  Public finances are spent and policy decisions are made on the basis not of what is in the best interests of workers and families but of who has access and who is on the inside track.  That is why we have a housing crisis.  It is why Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael always deliver for developers, speculators and vulture funds rather than those who need homes.  It is why we continue to have a two-tier health service where personal wealth rather than healthcare needs can determine whether a person has access to the treatment he or she requires.  It is why Irish families and workers are fleeced with the highest mortgage rates in the eurozone and among the highest rents, insurance, childcare and utility costs in the world.  It is why we need change.  It is why we need to bring an end to cronyism, back room deals and insider politics.  It is why this House should vote no confidence in the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  It should also vote no confidence in the Government and in the old-style, failed, corrupt politics that have been the hallmark of this State for too long.  The people deserve better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500034#GG00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1631727300,"counter":281,"content":"<p>In a parliamentary democracy, the tabling of a motion of no confidence in a member of Government is a most serious matter, one that goes to the heart of our responsibilities as a House under the Constitution to hold the Government to account.  Such a motion has been tabled, and I will set out the Labour Party's position on this unfortunate affair.  The facts of the issues at hand are clear from the documents published by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Those facts are that the former Minister, Katherine Zappone, actively sought a role after leaving office, initially with USAID by seeking an introduction to Samantha Power, and contacted her former Government colleagues to that end.  Subsequently, she sought a role with the United Nations as an Irish special envoy.  The text messages of 26 February from Ms Zappone to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, in response to his phone call to her was a checklist of her qualifications for the job.  Her text message of 4 March was a clear appreciation of being offered the role and sought the specifics of her appointment duration.  There is simply no other way of reading those text messages.  The Minister denies he made the job offer in late February and does not see Ms Zappone's communications as lobbying, and therein lies the difficulty.  He cannot accept that in response to a request from a former ministerial colleague, he created a new position without reference to his partners in government and offered it to her.<\/p>  <p>  I happen to believe that a special envoy on freedom of opinion and expression is a very good idea in the current world, an idea that should usefully be debated in this House and that would attract many excellent candidates, no doubt Ms Zappone among them, but that is not how this matter was handled.  Many Members, and indeed commentators, have rightly said in recent weeks that there are more important and pressing issues to discuss, such as the future of Sl&aacute;intecare, the climate crisis or the new housing plan for Ireland, but underpinning all major policy initiatives is the requirement to maintain public confidence in the way politicians do the people's business.  In government, the Labour Party introduced the reformed Freedom of Information Act, the Regulation of Lobbying Act and legislation protecting whistleblowers, all designed to ensure transparency in public administration, but cultural and behavioural change is difficult to legislate for.<\/p>  <p>  These are not small or irrelevant matters.  Trump won by eroding confidence in government.  His calls to \"drain the swamp\" struck a chord with people who had lost their trust in politicians.<\/p> <p>We see evidence of that happening in Europe, too.  Ironically, nobody is more attuned to and aware of that than the Minister for Foreign Affairs.<\/p> <p> Ministers, no more than anyone else, make mistakes and make misjudgments.  What is required when that happens is a full ventilation of the truth.  Had that happened from the outset, I do not believe we would be having this debate tonight.  However, that is not what happened.  That is plain for all to see.  No more than Donald Trump, the Government and the Minister are not entitled to their alternative facts.  Public confidence in politics itself is under attack across the world, and this sorry affair damages all of us.<\/p> <p> The Labour Party, from the outset of this Government, expressed no confidence in this Administration.  We will do so again this evening.  However, I hope, in the expectation the Government will win the vote tonight, that it will not be taken by the Government as somehow an expression that what happened is acceptable in any way.  I would hope the true spirit of the legislation on freedom of information, the regulation of lobbying and the protection of whistleblowers is put into effect and those assurances are given to this House tonight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500034#GG00300","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631727900,"counter":283,"content":"<p>The next contributor is the T&aacute;naiste, who is sharing time with the Minister for Justice, Deputy Humphreys.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500035#HH00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1631727900,"counter":284,"content":"<p>It is an honour for me this evening to express my full confidence in my friend and colleague, Deputy Simon Coveney.<\/p>  <p>  I first met Simon 23 years ago, when I was canvassing for him in the Cork South-Central by-election, following the tragic death of his father, Hugh.  I know nobody more committed to public service than him.  Since then, he has served with distinction as a Member of this House, as a Minister, and as a Member of the European Parliament.  We were both appointed to the Cabinet in 2011 and Simon subsequently served as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Minister for Defence, Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and now as Minister for Foreign Affairs and for Defence.  He has always put the long-term interests of the Irish people ahead of any short-term political considerations.  He is a reservoir of patience and kindness and he always has his eye on the big objective, whether it is the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, negotiations and defending the rights and needs of farmers, the programme for Government negotiations - the Government with Fine Gael independence would never have happened were it not for him - negotiations with parties in Northern Ireland, or ongoing negotiations in relation to Brexit.  He is diligent, knowledgeable, sincere, supportive and loyal.  On the toughest days and at the toughest times, I have been fortunate to have him as a Government colleague and Deputy.

Often, that meant leaving his young family at three or four o'clock in the morning to travel across Europe, fostering relations with our EU neighbours and ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s interests were protected in the Brexit negotiations.

The roll of shame that has preceded this scandal is too long to recite.  I could go back for many decades.  The history of this State is steeped in scandal surrounding both Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, the latest scandal being that surrounding Katherine Zappone this summer and the reverse-engineering of a job for her.  <\/p>  <p>  Since then we have witnessed a deliberate attempt to cover up the affair by the guilty parties once discovered.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, deliberately misled an Oireachtas committee.  He has given contradictory and misleading accounts of his actions and role in the events surrounding this affair.  He breached the law by deleting communications critical to our understanding of events and to allow for any transparency in the attempts to decipher his actions.<\/p>  <p>  He has used his position as a senior Minister, alongside his party colleagues, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, to make up and offer a job to a former colleague on the mooch for a cushy number that would provide access to the corridors of power within the UN.  The Taoiseach, the individual with the ultimate responsibility for the conduct of all his Cabinet not just the Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers, has failed in his duty to the people.  He has failed to stamp out the toxic culture at the heart of the Government, a culture that has unfortunately existed in both main Government parties since the foundation of the State.  <\/p>  <p>  We are witnessing an attempt by the Fianna F&aacute;il leader to deflect attention, telling us, \"Move on; there is nothing whatsoever to see here\".  He will do anything to avoid scrutiny of the facts or his having to hold anybody to account.  There is also a collective failure of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and the Green Party in this.  There must be consistent exposure of wrongdoing and it must be done in a manner that cannot be ignored.<\/p>  <p>  It is critical that the truth must come out.  The jury, who are the public, have given their verdict and they know damn well what is the truth.  They know what is happening here because they have seen it time and time again.  They know the Taoiseach is guilty of presiding over a culture of cronyism and rotten politics at the heart of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  He is clearly unable to see the rot at the centre of his Government and the type of politics he represents which makes it evident how out of touch he is and how out of touch is the Government.  That is because both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have been in power for too long.<\/p>  <p>  I do not have any confidence in the Minister.  I have no confidence in the Government whatsoever.  It is time for new politics.  It is time for a change from this rotten type of politics.  We need politics that puts ordinary citizens at its core, not cronies, insiders or the well connected.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500036#JJ00600","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1631728500,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Tonight, the Social Democrats will vote no confidence in the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  At the outset, I would like to depersonalise the debate as much as possible.  As we vote this evening, I would like our vote to be a rejection of the culture that enabled this controversy.  It is culture of arrogance at the highest levels of our State, one that facilitates those who have governed for too long to believe that both they and the decisions they take on our behalf are above scrutiny and, where necessary, consequence.<\/p>  <p>  We reject the existing culture of cronyism where a Minister can believe that only the person they favour and whose credentials and experience they place value on can be appointed as a UN envoy.  Beyond that, we reject the outcome that because the public outcry was so vehemently against the appointment of a Fine Gael insider to such an important role without process, Ireland is now without an envoy to the UN to advance LGBTQI+ rights despite this being so clearly a valuable position and one on which I believe the Irish public would like us to demonstrate leadership.  <\/p>  <p>  We reject the passing of blame, telling a reporter on our national airwaves what they can or cannot make a story of, a culture of deleting records and telling the Irish people that lessons have been learned as a means of avoiding the responsibility for the actions that were taken.<\/p>  <p>  Tonight, what exactly is the Government asking us to vote confidence in?  I have listened to some of the most senior Ministers in the State speak and not one of them has attempted to debunk the fact that a political stroke was attempted.  If so, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has had multiple occasions on which to set the record straight on the botched appointment of Katherine Zappone.  Each time his explanation has stretched the truth to the point of annihilating it.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has asked us to believe that not only did Dr. Zappone misapprehend the job offer that had been made on 4 March, but she also misconstrued a start date.  Dr. Zappone's text message to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is clear: \"You had mentioned June as a start date.\"  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has told us that this explicit statement from Dr. Zappone is a misunderstanding and her earlier exuberance about the \"incredible opportunity\" she had been offered was pre-emptive.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that Katherine Zappone has done some service to the State.  I have visited An Cos&aacute;n on numerous occasions.  However, I believe Fine Gael is attempting to throw her under a bus here and to make us believe that not only did she invent a job offer, but that she invented a start date for this non-existent job.  The Minister has asked us to come to this conclusion despite professing himself to be so impressed with her professional ability that he felt she was the only candidate who should be in the running for the role of UN special envoy.<\/p>  <p>  More important to me than seeing a former Minister and friend of Fine Gael whom it is willing to sacrifice for the purpose of its own survival is the concept of what constitutes political lobbying and political patronage in this country.  Every person involved in this saga understands that power and access to it are their own form of currency.  Tonight, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green Party Members want us to believe that a highly connected person who was found to be contacting and influencing senior Ministers and diplomatic staff in the awarding of a prestigious job does not amount to lobbying.  Beyond that, the T&aacute;naiste tried to diminish the story in early August by saying that a salary of &euro;15,000 was not significant.  Tonight, the Taoiseach described the role as being part time.  <\/p>  <p>  There was, I believe, a time for contrition in this sorry saga when hands could have been raised with people saying, \"We got it wrong and we'll go back to basics.\"  That was a long time ago and in the intervening period, all we have had is waffle and obfuscation.  Tonight, we in the Social Democrats will vote against this version of an Ireland Fine Gael wishes to maintain.  Tonight, we will vote no confidence in the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  I hope it is clear that our absence of confidence extends to every facet of the Fine Gael brand and all that it represents for our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500036#JJ00700","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1631728500,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Richmond, who is sharing time with Deputy Bruton and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500036#JJ00800","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1631728500,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I support the motion of absolute and full confidence in the Minister, Deputy Coveney, continuing as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Defence at this crucial time for our State and the European Union.

Throughout that period, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, stood up, stood particularly tall and defended the interests of Ireland and its people North and South.<\/p> <p>That is not just my opinion as an observer or someone who is in the room but the opinion that has been stressed countless times by the same people who read absolute nonsense from prepared scripts tonight.  They are the same people who thanked Simon Coveney for standing by the tenets of the Good Friday Agreement and thanked him for protecting the rights of Irish citizens in the North.  They are the people who thanked Simon Coveney for his patience in the face of absolute adversity from politicians in the North of this country and across the water.  They thanked him and lauded him in this Chamber, the Seanad, committee rooms and closed conversations across the island and Continent.  They now stand up, as political opportunists, to take a swipe and bring a good man down.  Deputy Gary Gannon admirably tried to depersonalise the argument but a motion of confidence in an individual Minister is personal.  Now we face those challenges again with politics in Northern Ireland in flux and the British Government reneging on commitments in the protocol.  Today, the British Government has appointed its fourth Foreign Secretary in the time that Simon Coveney has been Minister for Foreign Affairs.  This is the time that this Government and country need Simon Coveney.  This is not the time for the duplicity, contradictions and sneering from those opposite.

Katherine Zappone is not a crony when it comes to defending LGBT rights and history will show that.  These facts are not lost on Sinn F&eacute;in.  That is why it has shifted its attack tonight.  It seeks to destroy Simon Coveney's career to create a political platform to attack every party that is part of this Government.  That is using the solemn process of removing someone from office in a way that undermines the value of a process that should be about proportionate accountability.  Those of us who believe in proportionate accountability see it is being destroyed and hurt by this approach that Sinn F&eacute;in is taking.  We are devaluing something that is core to a process.  It is part of Sinn F&eacute;in's binary politics.  It may be successful to make it black and white and say that people are either on their side or against them.  It is no accident that Sinn F&eacute;in is using this against a politician who is tireless in his attempts to find common ground and understanding with others with whom he has differences.  That has been discarded by Sinn F&eacute;in.  Their politics is about building a wall and taking back control.  They seek to present a simplistic caricature of Simon Coveney and others in government.  It is not worthy of a party like Sinn F&eacute;in to adopt but that seems to be its way.<\/p>  <p>  I believe it will galvanise this Government because we know that we need politics that examines evidence and develops solutions that are sustainable for the public.  That is what Simon Coveney has done throughout his career, whether in the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or Foreign Affairs or dealing with the issues of Northern Ireland and Brexit.  He has demonstrated his ability to stay the course and to find ways that we could bring people together to resolve differences that hold us apart.  That is the sort of approach we need if we want to create a shared Ireland, not the divisive, binary politics that we see all too often from Sinn F&eacute;in.  I vote full confidence in Simon Coveney.  He is part of the answer to this country's problems and his record of service shows that is the case.

I think that is because to simply lay out fact after supposed fact would reveal how ridiculous this is.  I will go through a few issues with what the Minister claims.  He claims there was no lobbying for this position.  He slightly revised his position at the second committee meeting, when he said that there was no formal lobbying for this position.  Obviously for anyone who can read and can see Katherine Zappone's messages, there is no question that that was lobbying.  Second, he claimed that no job was offered until July, despite a text message from Katherine Zappone stating, \"Thank you so, so much for offering me this incredible opportunity.\"  That was before the job specification was even written and she obviously had a hand in writing that later.  The Minister then claimed that he deleted the message about this because his phone was running out of space.  I think the Minister has an iPhone, if not a high-end Android.  They can contain approximately 350 million messages.  I am sure he is a popular man and receives many text messages but that was incredible.<\/p>  <p>  That story was changed in 12 hours.  The story was then that the Minister deleted the messages because his phone was subject to a security breach, hacking, etc.  The only problem with that, which came up at the second committee appearance, is that to square the circle of not breaching the Freedom of Information Act with the Minister simultaneously saying that he deletes text messages because of his phone being hacked, he said that he does not breach the Freedom of Information Act, that he does not delete any message to do with Government business, and he deletes the other messages.  He is telling us that he deletes the unimportant messages, not the ones related to Government business, and leaves the messages about Government business on the phone for Government hackers to be able to access.  It is nonsense.  Every aspect of the story is complete nonsense.  It is clearly in contrast to what the Taoiseach said earlier.<\/p>  <p>  It is clearly a breach of the Freedom of Information Act to delete text messages between a Minister and the T&aacute;naiste relating to the appointment of someone to a Government position.

It was the Minister who wrote the legislation in conjunction with, and at the behest of, the developers of strategic housing developments, with disasters across the city and country as a consequence.  It was the Minister who said that by July 2017 we would see an end to homeless people in hotels and emergency accommodation.  That situation still exists today.  These are the consequences of the policies of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  They have a wafer-thin majority now.

Since this Government began its life, we have seen the complete erosion of public confidence in political life.  It is undeniable at this point that we have a crisis in how this Government does business.  Public standards and ethics are on the floor.  We previously had a clear attempt to breach the lobbying Act, which tries to close the revolving door between government and vested interests.  The events of today have been dictated by Zapponegate, another occasion when public standards and ethics were thrown into the bin.  We then had the Minister, Deputy Coveney, appear before a committee where he provided an account that contained serious inconsistencies and excuses designed to try to explain away the problem.  We also heard the Minister stating, by his own admission, that he had deleted official correspondence related to this matter.<\/p>  <p>  I am no legal expert, but section 52 of the Freedom of Information Act is written with the kind of admirable clarity that does not require a legal background to understand.  It states that \"a person ... without lawful excuse and with intention to deceive destroys or materially alters a record shall be guilty of an offence and be liable on summary conviction to a class B fine\".  I guess we will just have to let the public decide for themselves because the Government's vote of confidence would seem to suggest it does not believe there is any issue.<\/p>  <p>  We then heard that this Government does not even seem to believe that Katherine Zappone's actions constitute lobbying at all.  To hear Ministers say they are not being lobbied when they receive numerous texts and communications from a former Cabinet colleague about a role that was created for her, the mind absolutely boggles.  It would appear that some Ministers simply believe they are doubling as HR specialists in their spare time.  I heard one Fine Gael Minister play the definitional game by trying to define the problem away, and that is the height of cynicism.  Yes, we could restrict the definition of lobbying to someone who conducts their canvassing activities in a hotel lobby, but where would that get us?  Call me old-fashioned, but I have always subscribed to the belief that if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it is a duck.  The same goes for lobbying.<\/p>  <p>  I have heard some people tonight say that members of the Opposition are just standing on the sidelines, but we are being extremely constructive and the lobbying Act clearly needs to be strengthened.  I have a Bill to do that and what did members of the Government do?  They kicked the can down the road.

Let us look at the track record of this Government and what it has achieved across recent months, while always acknowledging how much more we need to do.  Some 7 million vaccinations have been administered, 500,000 people have come off the pandemic unemployment payment and the building of 3,300 homes was commenced throughout July.  There is much more to do.  There are also tests in politics and tests in the progress the Irish people want us to meet.  These are the tests this Government is striving to meet, a contributor to which is the Minister, Deputy Coveney, in his work.<\/p>  <p>  I have heard the allegations of cronyism and of some alleged elite.  There are 145 reasons that charge does not stand up tonight, which are the 145 appointments made by the Government with the assistance of the semi-State body, the Public Appointments Service, that advises the Government on appointments that are made to leading positions in semi-State bodies.  It is the kind of organisation that was put in place to respond to the concerns that Deputy Howlin has and is implemented and overseen by this Government.  That is proper government.  It is the way that the Government has made those decisions.<\/p>  <p>  That leads on to the next point on the charges made against the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  We have acknowledged what went wrong in that process, as he has.  As other Deputies have said, when the long hours needed to be put in to defend our country on Brexit and to put together the proposition that led to the backstop, when a political crisis - how we could respond to Brexit - emerged, nobody did more and nobody worked harder with more integrity, patriotism and competence than Simon Coveney.  If you are going to make the charge about a single point, and I hope all who are making this charge have records of perfection, unblemished records they can stand over, let us look at the man, his track record and his character.  That is why we on the Government benches make the case on his behalf and on behalf of our efforts.<\/p>  <p>  We do so in the face of a party whose members say they want better local services but they want to abolish the local property tax.

What has made the whole business such a sorry tale is that there was absolutely no public appetite, no demand, for any such envoy to be appointed.  It was easy then for the public to conclude or to perceive that this was a set of insiders looking after one of their own. <\/p>  <p>  I told the Taoiseach directly at our party meeting recently that, notwithstanding his present authority, it would be presumptuous for anyone to believe or presume they have majority support.  The same should be said for the entire coalition.  The people expect, wish and deserve to see good governance, not sideshows or ineptitude.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has apologised and so too has the T&aacute;naiste.  Let us be fair, there is not unanimous absolute or wholesome confidence in the Minister, especially, unfortunately, in the way he handled this issue within Fianna F&aacute;il, but I expect that the whole sorry episode may well represent the last chance moment for all concerned.  <\/p>  <p>  The parliamentary democratic system provides potential for Government stability up to five years.  It affords time, space and opportunity to implement its programme for Government.  I represented Fianna F&aacute;il, among others, in negotiating, agreeing and selling that programme.

Not to vote with the Government today would seriously curtail our ability to best serve our constituents.  <\/p>  <p>  My membership of the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party and my commitment to modernise its aims and goals from within are an example that will not be compromised or undermined by the obvious yet understandable political gamesmanship we see here this evening from Sinn F&eacute;in.

We heard some of that tune played just a moment ago.  Let me remind Members that the last time there was a similar controversy surrounding a Fine Gael Minister of using his influence to do favours for his friend, it was the T&aacute;naiste.  When he leaked a confidential document to a friend, we were told to move on, there is nothing to see here, this is gameplaying, political stunts and so on.  it is now nine months later and his actions are still under criminal investigation by the Garda.  I would ask Members to forgive Sinn F&eacute;in and many others in the Opposition if we are sceptical of the same excuses being peddled by the Government parties today.<\/p>  <p>  Let us call a spade a spade.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has been caught red-handed offering a salaried job, paid by the taxpayer, to a friend.  He has been caught using the time and resources of his Department to reverse-engineer that role.  He has been caught covering his tracks and destroying records and communications pertaining to official Government business, thereby making a mockery out of the freedom of information legislation.  He has been caught misleading the committee to which he is answerable and then concocting a story that stretched all credulity, expecting the committee and the public to swallow it.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach believes we should turn a blind eye.  He tells us that this behaviour is not worthy of sanction or of censure - that, in effect, it is an example to all members of the Government to follow, that there will be no repercussions, and that while there may be three parties there should only be one Taoiseach who should take action, but he has failed to do so.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in has moved this motion today.  We have a very different view, namely, that a Government Minister using his influence, office and power to create a paid job at the UN for a friend is not acceptable, that a Government Minister misleading a committee of the Oireachtas is not acceptable, that a Government Minister destroying records of Government communications is not acceptable, and that creating backchannels to communicate favours for friends is not acceptable.  This Government needs to understand that.  This cuts to the core of how the Government works and who it works for.<\/p>  <p>  The culture of the insider has become the hallmark of Fine Gael in government for far too long and it is a corrosive force, but it comes at a cost to the outsiders - those who, unlike the developers, the bankers or former Government Ministers, do not have members of this Government on speed dial.  That culture needs to be stamped out.  While Fine Gael remains in power, that is unlikely to happen.  It is even more unlikely when a Taoiseach allows the culture to fester without any action or sanction.  That is crazy stuff.  Without sanction, what is the message that is being sent out?  It is that this is how Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party are permitted to do their business.  That is something Sinn F&eacute;in does not accept.  It is something this D&aacute;il should not accept.  That is why this D&aacute;il should stand up and set out a clear message tonight that the culture of cronyism and the culture of doing favours for those on the inside is not acceptable and will not be tolerated.  That is why Members of this House should vote no confidence in Simon Coveney tonight.  What he has done was pure cronyism.  He has been caught out.  He has only ever apologised for not telling the Taoiseach in advance, and not for the creation of a job for his friend that was paid by the public purse, for the fact that he destroyed the records, or for the fact that he reverse-engineered the job.  None of that he has apologised for yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500039#MM01800","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1631730300,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I will move on to the Regional Group.

I very much look forward to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, still being in office so that I can hold him personally to account in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The people I represent do not want a new defence Minister who would come in here with brand new bright ideas and kick the can down the road for another four or five years.  They need action and they need it now because our armed forces are in crisis.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has proven he can act decisively when required.  He deployed Irish troops to Afghanistan only a few weeks ago to save dozens of Irish lives in a meticulously planned and superbly executed operation, despite the resource constraints which everyone knows everything about.  That is precisely the mettle and resolve we need to see from the Minister or from any Minister when tackling the structural issues in our military from December and beyond.<\/p>  <p>  I empathise with the Minister that he is holding down two ministerial portfolios, which were held by two separate individuals up to a few years ago.

His troops do not need to see him in New York.  They need to see him in Newbridge, tackling the daily difficulties in our armed forces as soon as possible.  I would be grateful if the Minister could take those constructive points on board.<\/p> <p> In summary, the Minister has my absolute confidence but we need to improve expectations from a defence perspective.

What message is that for our young people and people who might consider going into public office?<\/p>  <p>  Meanwhile, back on the crowded Sinn F&eacute;in high moral mountain, in the words of Deputy Carthy, the Sinn F&eacute;in Party has made political appointments to boards, including Foras na Gaeilge, based on &ldquo;a process and on a set of defined considerations&rdquo; and furthermore that \"Any person that we have nominated to any board at all, has always been on the basis of them being, in our view, the most suitably qualified candidate.&rdquo;  The result of this defined process has led to the following.  Out of 16 board members of Foras na Gaeilge - eight from the South, nominated by the Irish Government, and eight from the North, nominated by the Northern Ireland Executive - at least six have links with Sinn F&eacute;in.  One such member is Liadh N&iacute; Riada, a former presidential candidate for Sinn F&eacute;in.  Did Deputy McDonald propose Liadh N&iacute; Riada for this position?  Sinn F&eacute;in councillor, Conor McGuinness, who is the leas-chathaoirleach of the board of Foras na Gaeilge, is from Waterford and works closely with Deputy Cullinane.  What was Deputy Cullinane's role, if any, in this appointment?  We also have Kevin &Oacute; hEadhra, a Sinn F&eacute;in activist and candidate who stood in the 2019 local elections in Connemara, and Niall &Oacute; Gallochobhair from Lifford.  I know Mr. &Oacute; Gallochobhair well and he is a good guy.  He is a political adviser and constituency manager with Deputy Doherty.  Did Deputy Doherty have a role in this appointment?  Other board members include Maighr&eacute;ad N&iacute; Chonghaile from Belfast, who is principal of a Gaelscoil and a member of Sinn F&eacute;in, and Caoimh&iacute;n Mac Giolla Mh&iacute;n, who is from Belfast and who was a Sinn F&eacute;in councillor for six years.  T&aacute; blas na fim&iacute;neachta i gceist.  This is hypocrisy at its best.  <\/p>  <p>  This was not Simon's finest hour and nobody knows that better than Simon himself.  However, there are wider issues as we hold this so-called debate tonight.  This is the level of political discourse, to which Deputy Richmond alluded, despite all the relevant and critical issues facing us which must be dealt with, including all of the issues that emerged during August when this charade was ongoing.  Covid is still an issue.  Our young people in primary and secondary school are still facing disruption.  They are still having their education in schools disrupted because of Covid.  We also have issues across six or seven counties where people are living with the nightmare of their houses falling down due to mica and pyrite.  We face many critical issues of importance.  Yes, Ministers need to be held to account but is this really where we are at?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500040#NN00500","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1631730900,"counter":363,"content":"<p>Last month the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change launched its landmark report setting out in clear terms the urgent need for radical climate action.  It did so against the backdrop of the consequences of a climate-altered world being played out in real time, with heat records shattered in Italy, Canada and Northern Ireland, with Hurricane Ida crashing into the Louisiana coast and subsequently flooding the New York subway system, with devastating floods sweeping through northern Europe and with wildfires raging from California to Greece to Siberia.  That report is not equivocal in its findings.<\/p> <p>The window for action on climate change is closing and the consequences of inaction are catastrophic.  In the words of the UN Secretary General, the report is a code red for humanity.  If this seems tangential to tonight's debate, it is not.  The Government has significant work to get done, not least of which is action on climate change but also in the areas of health, housing and myriad other challenges posed by the social and economic fallout from the pandemic.  We have a programme for Government, which is the most ambitious in the history of the State.  We have followed through with important legislative work, from the LDA Act to the climate Act.  Now we must concentrate on delivery and on translating legislation into action.  This is all being done in the context of doing our utmost to protect lives and livelihoods as we steer our course through a global pandemic.  This is the work we have in front of us as a Government.  I believe this work is important and for that reason I will vote confidence in this Government.<\/p> <p> The issues surrounding the proposed appointment of Ms Zappone have been well ventilated at this point.  The process leading to the appointment was unsatisfactory and should have been handled in a more transparent manner.  The Minister has acknowledged he made a number of mistakes, has apologised and has twice appeared before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.  All this is well known.  However, it is my opinion that a vote of no confidence would be in no way proportionate.<\/p> <p> With respect to the Minister's brief, this vote comes at a critical juncture.  From the ongoing effect of Brexit to our seat on the UN Security Council to the unfolding situation in Afghanistan, he has demonstrated his experience and expertise on all these issues.  I have full confidence in his ability to continue in these ministerial duties.  We have been promised change and a new politics from the Opposition benches.  In tonight's debate, I only see populist Punch and Judy politics, aimed at sowing discord among coalition partners.  The issues facing us as a Government and a country are too serious and urgent.

I have no confidence in the Government's delivery of health services.  There is an ongoing crisis in health provision, with 1 million people out of a population of 5 million on waiting lists, many of them for more than 18 months.  I have no confidence whatsoever in the Government's credibility in delivering Sl&aacute;intecare and I have serious concerns about what is happening in that regard.<\/p> <p> Having said that, there are questions to be answered by the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance in this debate.  They relate to the deletion of texts from mobile telephones and the response to freedom of information requests to the T&aacute;naiste's office.  Both Ministers, Deputies Coveney and Donohoe, have stated that they regularly delete text messages from their telephones in order, as they claim, to free up space.  We know that one of the messages deleted by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, was a message from Katherine Zappone inviting him to her party at the Merrion Hotel.  This message was deleted as the controversy about the party blew up.  In the case of the T&aacute;naiste, we know that the response to an FOI request to his Department was that no messages relating to Dr. Zappone or the Merrion Hotel affair could be found.  Twelve days later, however, such material was available.<\/p> <p> Any logical interpretation of these facts would pose the question as to whether there was an attempt, probably a co-ordinated attempt, by the individuals involved with Katherine Zappone's appointment to hide the truth of their involvement in this shabby affair.

It is a reflection of the culture of Irish politics and the way members of the Government parties have always done business over decades.

I stand by those words.  Nonetheless, tonight is a different context.  Many mistakes were made and they all arose from the premise that a former Minister could lobby the two most senior Fine Gael Ministers, the T&aacute;naiste and an ambassador for a job that at that point in time did not formally exist.  This, it seems, is how business was conducted in the allocation of similar, existing posts up to that point.  It was not transparent or accountable.

This motion is an attempt to damage him, not because of the error he made, which should not have happened and for which he repeatedly apologised, but to sow division among the Government parties.  Our citizens demand and deserve that their parliamentarians work on issues that matter to them.  This motion is a distraction from that important work.  It is very clear that in our first week back here in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, Sinn F&eacute;in is prioritising making personal attacks rather than focusing on the important issues that matter to people.<\/p>  <p>  As colleagues have stated here this evening, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is a politician of vast experience, ability and integrity.  He has been deservedly praised for his careful handling of Brexit and his relationships with the EU and its institutions.  He has helped to ensure that Ireland's interests and the protection of the Good Friday Agreement were at the heart of the Brexit negotiations.  His tireless work in Northern Ireland in restoring the institutions there have been also widely praised.  If Sinn F&eacute;in Members were honest, they would admit that he acted at all times with integrity and honesty.<\/p>  <p>  I have seen at first hand his dedication to public service.  In late December last year, including on Christmas Eve, instead of spending time with his family, he worked with me and colleagues across Government to ensure Irish citizens were not stranded abroad at Christmas due to the necessary restrictions that were brought in as a result of Covid-19.  At all time, the interests of the Irish people were at the forefront of his response.  However, Sinn F&eacute;in's view is that the Minister made a mistake and should be punished by hounding him out of office.  It is such hypocrisy.  Some Sinn F&eacute;in Members of this House have made very public mistakes, by making offensive and divisive statements in public and on social media, but, after apologising, they remained in their positions.  Is it Sinn F&eacute;in's contention that only its Members can apologise and move on but Members of other parties must be pilloried before this House?  There has been much written about Sinn F&eacute;in appointing its own members to various boards.  Is that not cronyism?<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in Members know that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, should not resign.  They do not want him to do so.  That is because they know there is no one within their own ranks who has the ability to deliver for Ireland on the world stage.  What they want is to cause friction within Government and within the coalition parties.  There is no greater good being served by this motion, which is a classic example of \"Do what I say but not what I do\".  This underlines the cynicism at the heart of today's motion.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, entered politics to make a positive difference in people's lives.  He still has that focus.  Politics should be about implementing policies that make the lives of citizens better, not about personality.  It should be about the good we can do, not the damage we can inflict when the occasion arises.

Their support is much appreciated.  Quite honestly, I never thought I would find myself in the middle of a debate like this one.  Given the magnitude of the issues this House needs to deal with, including the removal of Covid restrictions, the pressures on healthcare delivery across the country, the launching of the most ambitious new housing plan in history, Ireland's chairing of the UN Security Council at a crucial time, and the ongoing pressures in Northern Ireland relating to the Brexit protocol, the legacy of the past, the threat to the very existence of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and the possible early collapse of the Executive and the assembly, it seems scarcely credible that a short-lived Government appointment of a part-time special envoy should be dominating our focus on the first day back after the summer break, but here we are.<\/p>  <p>  I take my share of blame for this debate.  For six weeks now, the appointment of Katherine Zappone and the issues related to it have been the focus of media and political commentary.  In truth, I should have and could have dealt with this issue much more comprehensively in early August, after it became controversial following a Government decision.<\/p> <p>I did not take the issue seriously enough then.  I was too defensive in interviews.  I allowed speculation to drift into a political narrative that does not reflect the truth of what actually happened.  By the time a comprehensive release of more than 100 documents under freedom of information by my Department allowed me to detail before committee the chronology of events - the communications, the consultations, the recommendations and the decisions - most people had already made up their minds on what had happened.<\/p> <p> I want to say to every one of my colleagues in this House but, in particular, to my partners in government, that I regret that this issue has distracted from the important work we have been trying to do and I regret the mistakes made by me in advance of the Cabinet decision and subsequently in terms of not clearing these issues up earlier.  I have apologised to the Taoiseach and to my colleagues, and I do so again this evening to everybody in this House.  Government is busy and difficult enough without a preventable controversy like this one rumbling on as long as it has.<\/p> <p> I have no intention of repeating my evidence to the committee again this evening, but I will say this: my decision to appoint a special envoy was based on a role that was conceived, designed and recommended to me following consultation with my Department.  My decision - and it was my decision - to ask Katherine Zappone if she would be interested in such a role, and ultimately to appoint her months later following an extensive process, was in no way corrupt or dishonest.  Although I know many on the other side of the House will not accept this, it was a genuine effort to add to the credibility and effectiveness of Ireland in an area of promoting human rights and freedom of expression.  This is one of many special envoy roles that Ireland has appointed, Government after Government, and was absolutely consistent with what many like-minded countries are currently doing, including our closest neighbour, the US, Canada and many EU states.  For the future, clearly there is a need to restore confidence in the role of special envoys and, certainly, the process by which they are appointed.  My Department is undertaking a full review in that regard and I agree with the Taoiseach that from now on, should a special envoy be recommended, we should ensure there is an open competitive process to fill any such position.<\/p> <p> I have been in politics for 23 years and in government for more than a decade and every day has been a privilege.  I have made mistakes on that journey but I have never had my integrity questioned in the way it has been in the past month, leading to this debate.  Ironically, in recent years I have worked closely with many of those who have now chosen to table a motion of no confidence in me.  I have worked with them on Brexit and the Northern Ireland protocol, preventing Border infrastructure re-emerging on this island, restoring the devolved institutions in the North, reconciliation and trying to find a way to deal with the legacy of the past in Northern Ireland and maintaining North-South co-operation through it all.  All of those difficult achievements required trust.  They required respect and an absence of cynical party politics to get important things done.  The conversations I have had in private in many cases do not reflect much of the public commentary that I hear from the same people.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in is not attempting to hold the Government or me to account tonight, or even to establish truth.  Deputy McDonald is not trying to get answers in this debate or achieve anything positive as regards what really happened here and how we can improve things for the future.  This is a political tactic to try to extend a political controversy and to reinforce a false narrative of cronyism to damage relations in this Government.  Sinn F&eacute;in is doing what it does so often, North and South - stoking tension with an exaggerated narrative in an effort to create anger, resentment and division, not just in this House or in the Government, but across society more generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500042#PP00600","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631732700,"counter":384,"content":"<p>The Minister has learned nothing, absolutely nothing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500043#QQ00200","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1631732700,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I want to sincerely thank colleagues who will vote in support of me this evening despite the fact that many of them have been less than impressed - I know that - with my handling of this controversy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500043#QQ00300","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1631732700,"counter":386,"content":"<p>It is not the handling; it is what the Minister did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500043#QQ00400","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1631732700,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I thank them for their trust, their sense of perspective, which is often lost in the heat of political debate, and their decency.

The debate we had earlier is a perfect example as to why we need to enhance our freedom of information, FOI, regime.  The reality is that in this State for most of its history there have been very significant concerns as to transparency and access to records and data.  Some would tell us this was all in the past and ancient history, so to speak.<\/p><p>Let me remind those people that this time last year the Government was attempting to lock away for 30 years records involved in the mother and baby homes scandal.  It seems ancient history continues to manifest itself in contemporary policy, and that is precisely why the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act in 1997 was such an important moment and was, indeed, a watershed one.  It was one of the first big steps in transparency to give our citizens three new legal rights.  These were, first, the right to consult official records, excluding those relating to internal security and foreign relations; second, the right to update and correct personal information that was inaccurate; and third, the right to be given reasons public decisions are made when they affect the person in question.<\/p><p>Freedom of information has been essential for journalists, political researchers, concerned citizens, NGOs, historians and victims of State abuse.  It has been a means to get access to information on politicians&rsquo; expenses and to gain access to reports on scandals in our nursing homes, hospitals and industrial schools.  It has played very significant roles in sagas that have been detrimental to this State.<\/p><p>Many transparency campaigners and journalists have been saying for a very long time that they have very significant concerns as to the ability of the FOI Act at this time.  John Devitt from Transparency Ireland said it played an essential role in underpinning our faith in public affairs but that it has been deliberately diluted in recent years.  That is its importance here in that it has an essential role in underpinning our faith in public affairs.<\/p><p>This time last year I began researching the problems that currently exist in our FOI regime because not only were we hearing it from the transparency campaigners and journalists but so many other people were coming to me on this issue.  It was because of those concerns that I conducted a survey with those who often and regularly use the freedom of information mechanism.  The results were absolutely damning.  Any of us who has tried to use the freedom of information regime can very much relate to what these results say.<\/p> <p>What we saw was that almost 80% felt that the regime was performing poorly or very poorly and 86% said it had seriously declined in recent years.  I raised this with the Minister repeatedly but his response in June was that the regime was \"robust and functioning well\" - famous last words because the events of Zapponegate, or whatever you want to call it, soon overtook matters and have raised serious concerns about adherence to FOI and the importance attached to the FOI regime within the Government.<\/p> <p> Those events really show the attitude towards the FOI regime and the fact that it needs to be strengthened.  We know that deleting official correspondence is a clear offence under the Act, but this seems to be disregarded again.  Public bodies were claiming that correspondence did not exist only to show later that it did.  This is nothing new, however.  Anyone who has been using FOI can tell you that this happens regularly.  We know from Right to Know that Ken Foxe has said we have public bodies failing to meet their obligations time and time again, and it is the same organisations year after year.  They seek time extensions for routine requests, do not bother answering requests, refuse access to everything and fail to find records that are later shown to have existed.  Some of this may be cultural or educational, and some are resource-based and cannot be tackled through legislation, but many of the current weaknesses of our FOI regime can be tackled through legislation: the lack of accountability for those who fail to fulfil their obligations under the Act; the failure to bring new public bodies immediately within the scope of the Act; the failure to extend the remit of the Act more fully to certain public bodies that are only partially covered; and the refusal to grant information on the pensions of retired Taoisigh, T&aacute;naist&iacute; agus Air&iacute;, which once was available.<\/p> <p> The Act has, in addition, a lot of shortcomings.  For this reason my colleague, Deputy Clarke, and I felt that urgent action was needed.  That is why we drafted our forthcoming FOI (amendment) Bill, much of which is included in tonight's motion.  To be clear, this is not something we have conjured up in the past few days; it is something we have been working on consistently over the past year.  We need urgent action.  I have seen the amendment the Government has proposed.  We do not need more reviews and delays.  What we need is action.  I hope this second legislative attempt by me to increase transparency and accountability will not be pushed down the road like the Regulation of Lobbying Act, which we also need to see implemented.  We were told the Government would create its own Bill in the intervening period but, thankfully, now we can deal with this Bill and it can move to Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> I often hear and heard again tonight - and it does my head in, for want of a better term - Government party spokespeople say the Opposition should offer solutions.  Well, here I am.  Here we are.  We are offering solutions and I have been here before offering solutions.  We are seeing delay after delay by the Government.  It wants us to offer solutions.  We are doing so.  This motion would deal with some of the very real issues we need sorted.  First, with the admission by a Government Minister in recent weeks that he deleted text messages, we very clearly need to establish procedures in order that each Department ensures that Ministers no longer destroy records that should be maintained by the Department.  Second, either FOI does not seem to be taken seriously by the Government or it is not aware of its duties.  The Government must therefore ensure that all Ministers are aware of their responsibilities under FOI and that all documents are made available.  Crucially, we need to enhance the powers of the Information Commissioner to allow the commissioner to refer complaints under FOI legislation to SIPO for investigation.  If there is a concern that a public body or a Minister or relevant person has intentionally or recklessly failed to fulfil their obligations, there needs to be consequences.<\/p> <p> It has been said that democracy dies in darkness.  An FOI request is a way to shine the light into the darkest corners of our political systems.  It is time to recharge the batteries of FOI.  I implore the Minister to support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500045#TT00200","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631734200,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I welcome this motion.  I commend Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell on the work she has done on this issue and also on the lobbying Bill.  Stalling that Bill for nine months was ridiculous.  What was the purpose of it?  SIPO has been looking for those powers for years.  The Government has not delivered.  Its predecessors in government have not delivered.  Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and I have drafted the legislation and it is there.  Let us work on it and deal with this issue.  Maybe some of the stuff that has come to haunt the Minister's term in government which we have just dealt with and other issues would not have happened if we had that type of robust lobbying Bill in place.  The Government should stop the delaying tactics and let us move on now that that is going before a committee.<\/p>  <p>  Freedom of information is based on the premise that the public have the right to know, including the right to know how government arrives at decisions and who is influencing government decisions.  The question for us in the D&aacute;il is whether we really believe in that right to know.  That right has been undermined continually over recent years and it has got to a point where freedom of information legislation and the whole process is under severe pressure.  It is possible that in some cases it does not work any more.  I will give the Minister just a couple of examples that lead on from the conversation and the debate we had earlier.  We have a Government Minister who still has not apologised for deleting Government records and has not said he will stop doing it.  He destroyed departmental records that there is a legal obligation to hold on record.  He can do whatever he wants with his phone and delete messages and direct messages and so on, but only after he has made copies of them and placed them with the Department because the public have a right to know.<\/p>  <p>  He is not alone, however.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, deleted messages.  We would never have known about the #LeoLeaks controversy that has led to the criminal investigation if we had relied on freedom of information.  Why?  Because the selected messages from Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail to Deputy Varadkar - not all of them, since earlier messages are still there and were subject to freedom of information, but the ones seeking that confidential document and the ones arranging for it to be delivered - were deleted from Deputy Varadkar's phone.  Therefore, when we put in a freedom of information request, we were told that no record existed.  Let us look at that controversy further.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, was contacted by Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail on his phone.  We know this because the messages are in the public domain and a private citizen took screenshots of them, but when I put in a freedom of information request to the Minister, Deputy Harris, who was on the record last week on RT&Eacute; radio saying he does not delete his messages, for those messages and any other messages from Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail, the answer came back that the records did not exist.<\/p>  <p>  Then we had the Coveney affair, or Zapponegate, involving a freedom of information request that I and many journalists put in looking for the records relating to that issue involving the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, and the response came back that the records did not exist.  What is the excuse Deputy Varadkar peddled out?  \"I was on holiday.\"  That is not a relevant excuse and does not offer any protection under the freedom of information legislation.  He has a responsibility to provide the information.<\/p>  <p>  The problem here is that this is not just about the Zappone affair or the #LeoLeaks affair; it is that Government Ministers are using backchannels.  The question is how deep this goes.  Many Government Ministers have used private emails in the past.  We had Deputy Coveney telling an Oireachtas committee he does not use private emails but the record shows that he did in the past.  He has said he used private emails for Government business to arrange various events and so on that would be and should be subject to freedom of information.  Are backchannels now being used by Government Ministers that allow for a whole different road for lobbyists, developers and speculators to have access to the corridors of power, knowing they are outside of the reach of freedom of information and knowing they will never come into the public domain?<\/p>  <p>  The public have the right to know.  My colleague, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, has drafted legislation to reinforce that right to know.  There are many activists who have a lot of good ideas.  Let us get this right, bring transparency to the heart of government and close down the backchannels that have been left open by the Government for far too long for those on the inside.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500046#UU00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1631734200,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I commend my colleague, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, on both bringing forward the motion and her work with Deputy Clarke on the related legislation.  I want to broaden out the debate a little to some direct experiences I have had with FOI that really show why the public and very specific groups of people absolutely have the right to know.  These are reflections on my experience struggling to get responses to FOI requests, some of which I am still battling several years on.<\/p>  <p>  As Members of the House will know, in Millford Manor, Newbridge, County Kildare, there was a very serious fire a number of years ago due to very shoddy Celtic tiger-era construction work.  An entire block of terraced homes burnt down in 60 minutes when there should have been a 60-minute fire break between each home.  Deputy Kelly was the then Minister with responsibility for housing.  He commissioned an urgent study.  That study was completed.  However, it took us two years to get that report published.  Residents living in the surrounding houses who were living in homes built by the very same developer, potentially with the same defects, were denied access to that report for two years.  What better case for the right of the public to know than not knowing whether the home in which you are living is unsafe?<\/p> <p>I can see no reason many of us were denied access to that report despite repeated FOI requests.  The usual excuse is deliberation.  While that is acceptable for a short period, it was not for the full duration.<\/p> <p> More controversially, as Deputy Doherty will know well, it has been almost five years since the Mulcahy report, commissioned into allegations of planning corruption in Donegal, was completed following the request of the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  We have been submitting FOI requests in respect of that report every six months since 2017 or 2018.  Not only has the most recent request been refused but we have been told the Department has no timeline.  That may have been acceptable when these matters were matters within the Department but they are now matters for the Planning Regulator, and I can see no reason that report, which again relates directly to individuals who had to fight in the courts to clear their names and good standing, cannot be released.  Therefore, the Department and the current Minister seem to be following the approach of his predecessor in using various ruses to prevent access to that really important report, which may reveal significant issues relating to the ongoing controversy in regard to defective block and mica affecting thousands of families in Donegal.<\/p> <p> I am also fighting battles to get records of correspondence between Dublin City Council, Dublin Fire Brigade and Stanley Holdings in respect of two fire safety inspections in 2011 and 2012 at a housing estate in Belmayne, north County Dublin, again in regard to an issue of defects and whether systems failed between the council and the fire brigade, and in regard to what interactions they had with the developers between a fire safety inspection 2011 that found no defects and one in 2012 that did.<\/p> <p> I have other disputes in respect of the Land Development Agency and the shared equity loan scheme.  I have experience of submitting identical FOI requests to three State agencies and getting different responses from each of them.  While I appreciate there are rules and the FOI officers do a very good job, I am convinced that at a political level decisions are being made and excuses are being found in the legislation to deny the public access to this documentation unacceptably.<\/p> <p> For those reasons, I urge the Government not only to support the motion but also to listen to the concerns of the Opposition to ensure these other issues will be dealt with into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500046#UU00300","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631734800,"counter":402,"content":"<p>Most of us know there are serious issues with freedom of information procedures in this State.  I have had difficulties accessing information and have been denied access to information that ought to be obtainable under FOI, as has been the case for many Deputies, journalists and members of the public.  Nevertheless, the events surrounding the recent Katherine Zappone appointment controversy have shone a light on these issues and the need for clear legislative reform.  A proper, functioning freedom of information regime is essential in any democratic state and we do not currently have one, leaving us with a lack of transparency and accountability across government and public bodies.<\/p>  <p>  So bad is it that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, deleted official correspondence, in violation of the Freedom of Information Act, and he has yet to acknowledge that fact.  Moreover, a freedom of information request made by Sinn F&eacute;in to the Department of the Taoiseach was denied, with the Department stating that the records did not exist.  Subsequently, however, they were provided by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  Those records related, as we all know, to the legality of the Merrion Hotel event.  It is absolutely shocking.  It is not sloppy or careless but an abuse of ministerial office and the Taoiseach needs to take responsibility.  We need a commitment from the Taoiseach that Ministers will fulfil their obligations under the Act, and we need urgent reform of the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed a Bill to do precisely that.  No action has been taken by the Government thus far other than, apparently, a review of FOI mechanisms, which some Ministers were not even aware of.  We know what the problems are.  We need action, not wishy-washy excuses.  Some of the changes we are proposing include ensuring that SIPO will be given the power to investigate FOI failures.  We need to broaden the remit of the Act to ensure that bodies such as RT&Eacute; are fully covered under it and we need to ensure there is consistency across Departments and public bodies.  It is clear the Government is not willing to deal with this issue.  It is happy enough with the existing dysfunctional regime because it can be abused and it can hide behind it.  Sinn F&eacute;in will not stand by that and allow this to go on.  We want urgent reform and we need to reform how the parties in government do business.  This arrogant approach, this cronyism, just has to stop.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is the leader of the Government and it is his responsibility to ensure Ministers adhere to the law of the land.  We need leadership, but where is it?  What is the Taoiseach afraid of?  Is he afraid there is more to this, that more Ministers or Departments will be found out and that he will eventually have to accept this is an endemic problem throughout the State?  Is he afraid that if he pushes this too far, Fine Gael will pull the plug and that will bring an end to his reign as Taoiseach?  Either way, he needs to snap out of it and sort this out.  He needs to lead from the front, as does the Minister, unless he is happy to turn a blind eye to all of this.  If he is happy to do so, it means he does not have a problem with this sort of murky politics, which totally lacks transparency and accountability.  The proof will be in the pudding if the Minister does not support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500047#VV00200","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1631734800,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following: <br \/><br \/>&ldquo;recognises the importance of a well-functioning Freedom of Information (FOI) regime in establishing trust and transparency in public life; and <br \/><br \/>notes that:   \t&mdash; the objective of Freedom of Information legislation is to ensure openness and transparency around the conduct of the business of public bodies and to enable members of the public to obtain access to their personal information; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; in broad terms, indications are that Ireland&rsquo;s FOI system is functioning well; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the number of FOI requests dealt with by relevant bodies increased from approximately 15,000 in 2010 to over 41,000 in 2019; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the FOI regime covers a wide range of sectors, including Government Departments, State bodies, the Health Service Executive, voluntary hospitals, mental health services, third level institutions and local authorities; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Freedom of Information Act 2014 provides that FOI applies to an entity by default where it meets certain criteria; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; in 2020, even as every individual and organisation in the country was significantly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, 32,652 FOI requests were processed by public bodies; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; approximately four out of every five FOI requests were granted in full or in part, which is broadly in line with previous years and over half of the requests processed are for individuals&rsquo; personal information; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; review mechanisms are available for those who are not satisfied with the FOI decision received and internal reviews - those conducted at a more senior level on a particular request with the relevant public body - account for about three per cent of requests in most years and independent reviews by the Information Commissioner are sought in about one per cent of cases annually; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; there is scope to improve and strengthen the FOI regime; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced in June 2021 that his Department will undertake a comprehensive and careful review of the Freedom of Information Act 2014 that will:  <blockquote> \t&mdash; consider the experience of all stakeholders; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; take account of the transformation in the manner in which people seek, consume and interact with information since the Freedom of Information Act 2014 came into effect; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; review international good practice and developments; and <br \/><br \/>&mdash; consult with the Office of the Information Commissioner and other key stakeholders in the data\/information space;  <\/blockquote>&mdash; a consultation on the scope of the review will take place later this year, with further consultations to be undertaken in 2022; and <br \/><br \/>&mdash; while it is intended that the scoping consultation will determine the key themes of the review, the interaction between the FOI legislation, data protection legislation and records management requirements will be considered as part of the review.&rdquo;   <\/blockquote>  <p>I thank Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and her colleagues for tabling the motion.  I welcome the opportunity it affords to discuss Ireland's freedom of information system.  I think all Deputies are in general agreement that the principles of openness, transparency and accountability should be at the core of Government and public administration, and I certainly believe that.<\/p> <p>The FOI system is one key element of this broader movement.  I am glad to have the opportunity this evening to reflect on the operation of the FOI system, as well as on the challenges we undoubtedly face in moving forward.  In June of this year, well before the recent controversy, I announced that a thorough and comprehensive review of the FOI Act and related issues would be undertaken by my Department.  The approach to the review is currently being finalised and I will bring a memorandum to Government with the details.  I expect that we will shortly publish a roadmap setting out the process and the details of how anyone interested can get involved.  I want to put on the record that, from my perspective, this review is not about narrowing or limiting the scope of FOI; it is about strengthening it, modernising it, and reforming it in a way that speaks to our priorities for openness and transparency.  <\/p> <p> It is now almost seven years since the 2014 Act was put into being.  I want to acknowledge the architect of that legislation, former Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, for his great work in bringing forward what was genuinely reforming legislation, which has served us well.  Indeed, it is now almost a quarter of a century since the FOI model first became firmly established as part of Irish public administration.  When we think of the kinds of changes that have occurred in the intervening period, in how people seek out and interact with information, and the rise of the Internet and the information society, it is clear to me that a review at this point is timely and necessary.  At the time that FOI was first introduced, it was fairly unusual for households to have a home computer or Internet access.  Now, of course, the majority of us carry smartphones in our pockets giving us finger fingertip access to a world of information that could only have been dreamt of in 1997.  Undoubtedly, these developments present challenges to the FOI model, which was devised to deal with an operating environment where record-keeping was generally paper-based and relatively discreet, rather than the proliferation of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of electronic records generated on a daily basis across the civil and public service, scattered across various devices and servers.  These issues go far broader than just the FOI access mechanism, taking in knowledge management and record management in a more general sense.  Of course, every Department has its own records management policy, which reflects the legislation in place: the National Archives Act, the Data Protection Act and, indeed, the FOI Act.  <\/p> <p> Work has been ongoing in my Department, particularly in the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO, to support an approach to data and systems that is suitable and fit for purpose for the modern world.  In addition, a record management plan for the public sector is being developed as part of the data strategy to provide a baseline for the constant improvement of the handling and use of information in the sector.  Despite these challenges - and there are undoubted challenges, which I have readily acknowledged - in general terms, I believe that the overall system is operating well.  My Department monitors the operation of the legislation on an ongoing basis and it is likely, of course, that this review will result in the need for legislation.  I look forward to seeing the Deputy&rsquo;s legislation.  I have not yet seen it and I will engage with her on it in good faith.  <\/p> <p> I want to put on the record again some of the key figures.  The Freedom of Information Act 2014 widened the scope of FOI to take in approximately 600 bodies.  Between 2014 and 2019, the number of requests processed across the civil and public service roughly doubled to more than 41,000 requests in 2019.  The 2014 Act removed the application fee for making an FOI request.  In addition, no application or search or retrieval fees apply for requests or for reviews that involved requests for personal information.  As such, no fee whatsoever applies at any stage to the approximately 60% of FOI requests in most given years that involve individuals seeking their personal information.  Sometimes we forget that that is in many respects the use of the Act in its current form.  In the majority of cases, people are looking for their own personal information.  That, too, is important, as well as all of the other roles the Act plays.  In 2020, clients of public sector bodies comprised by far the largest single group of requesters - when we say \"clients\", we mean people, individuals - at 50% of the overall total, while journalists comprised 23% of requesters.  A range of supports are in place for the implementation of FOI across the civil and public service.  My Department maintains a range of guidance, documents and manuals, while the Office of the Information Commissioner has also issued guidance on the correct interpretation of the legislation.  In addition, my Department is put in place a standardised training framework that all bodies can draw on in meeting their FOI obligations.  More than 7,000 public sector employees have received training under the framework from its introduction in 2015 to date.  By and large, I believe they are doing a good job.  <\/p> <p> Independent review by the commissioner and his expert staff is the key oversight of FOI decision-making standards.  In 70% of cases in which the commissioner issued a formal decision, the approach taken by the public body was affirmed as having correctly applied the legislation, which is an important point.  I, therefore, believe that while there is scope for improvement and modernisation - which I absolutely accept and will implement - the overall FOI system has a lot of merit, providing a solid footing from which we can move forward.  I acknowledge that while these stats allow us to understand at a glance the basic outline of the system, standing alone they are not sufficient.  Indeed, the figures themselves suggested issues that may require further examination, such as whether there is a case for refining the system in certain areas, such as the large number of requests for personal information from the health sector and bodies such as Department of Social Protection.  It is for these reasons, and others, that I have directed a comprehensive review to commence.  The review process will allow an opportunity for stakeholders across the system, from public bodies and FOI officers, to journalists, academics, activists, as well as the public, and, of course, Oireachtas, to have their say. <\/p> <p> In conclusion, I want to ensure we have a system whereby we reduce the need for more and more FOI requests; that by default we publish more information; that we genuinely embrace openness and transparency; and that we reduce the dependence on the need to apply for freedom of information to access records that should be published in the normal course of events.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500047#VV00300","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631735400,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I note what the Minister has said with some interest.  There are legitimate and genuine concerns surrounding the current freedom of information regime, which are shared by journalists, researchers, citizens and victims of institutional abuse.  Yet, instead of building on the 1997 introduction of FOI and ensuring that there would be a complete and robust mechanism to access information, what we have now is a flawed system that feeds directly into a lack of transparency and accountability.  It is crystal clear that urgent action is needed to address the shortcomings in FOI.  That is why myself and my colleague, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, drafted the FOI (amendment) Bill.  Those shortcomings are being exploited in a manner that is simply wrong.  They are being exploited with a view to limiting public access to information.  The belief is now that there is a culture of loophole-seeking in order to obstruct requests.  The public has a right to know.  Yet, when they utilise legislation, the wagons are effectively circled to ensure that little or no information is provided.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen FOI eroded, almost under constant threat, and altered to protect political elites.  Information relating to former taoisigh's pensions is no longer included in FOI.  Yet, at the same time, the Government tried to lock away the records of the mother and baby homes scandal.  The recent admissions by the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs that they have both deleted relevant material from their phones erodes any level of public confidence in FOI.  That erosion will continue without urgent action.  It also begs the questions: \"who else?\" and &ldquo;what else is being deleted?&rdquo;  Ministers are using disappearing messaging apps on their phones, or worse, having conversations with their Secretaries General, knowing full well that when there are no records, there is no accountability.  We need robust procedures in every Department to ensure that Ministers can no longer destroy records that should be maintained.  FOI requests, appropriately, should be dealt with and relevant material should be provided when requested.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister quoted internal reviews in his contribution.  Is he aware that there are public bodies that ignore FOI requests, even at internal review level, to the extent that that is then sent to the Office of the Information Commissioner?<\/p> <p>I am sure the Minister will agree with annual reviews of all bodies to which FOI applies for consistency with principles, oversights, transparency and accountability.  He has said that guidance documents are produced, manuals are produced and standardised training frameworks are in place.  Would he not like to think they are being adhered to?  Would he not like to have proof that they are being adhered to?<\/p> <p> The powers of the Information Commissioner need to be enhanced because that body needs to be able to refer complaints under FOI to SIPO for investigation where a Minister or a relevant person has intentionally and recklessly failed in their obligations.  I echo what Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell said earlier; democracy dies in darkness.  The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, should not be the Minister who sees FOI die.  That is not something he would want as a legacy.  If he is genuinely serious about wanting to work with the Opposition to fix FOI, I would expect him to support our Bill when it comes forward.  After all, our proposals are also contained in his statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500048#WW00200","speaker":"1495","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631736000,"counter":407,"content":"<p>Robust freedom of information legislation acknowledges power.  That power does not belong to a Minister, a political party or the Government; it belongs to the people.  I commend my comrade, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, on tabling this pertinent Private Members' motion.  Fine Gael's proposed ham-fisted, naked crony appointment of an envoy to the UN saw a Minister delete information on Government business, removing it from scrutiny.  According to the Taoiseach, he deleted it in good faith.  However, on Government information, that is not the Taoiseach's assertion to make.  The integrity of office is at issue here.  The authority of the Office of Taoiseach is what is at issue, and not the personal authority of its current occupant who excoriated his own party colleagues while absolving Fine Gael.<\/p>  <p>  Fine Gael's treatment of public information while in office has been arrogant and reckless.  It has been too long in power and regards government as its political right.  Familiarity has bred contempt in the very people in whose name they hold office and information.  I believe that if my party had engaged in such political shenanigans, deleting texts on Government information and so on, the usual suspects would be outside doing a candlelit vigil or something, talking about democracy itself.  When it is Fine Gael, we got a turned cheek from Fianna F&aacute;il, a blind eye from the Green Party and a pass from their supporters.  They claim there is nothing to see here except mountains out of molehills and ask us to move along.  <\/p>  <p>  In the interests of democracy, Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled this motion on freedom of information, its proper retention and release.  We are constitutional enough to consider the holding of Government information not as a party right or as a political privilege, but as a public duty.  Government work is serious work.  It is not about slick videos or not-so-slick videos, jobs for the girls and boys, deletions, leaks or TikTok posts.<\/p>  <p>  Our motion brings pensions to former Ministers, taoisigh, presidents and senior officeholders within the remit of FOI, something the public will value given the new report urging at least 40 years' work to claim the State pension.  Crucially, it gives the Information Commissioner power to refer FOI complaints to SIPO for investigation where a public body, Minister or relevant person is believed to have failed intentionally or recklessly to fulfil their obligations under the legislation.  Overall, it seeks to return public information to its rightful owner, not to a Minister, a political party or a government, but to the people themselves, whom we serve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500049#XX00200","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1631736000,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I welcomed some of the things the Minister said.  Obviously, we will keenly watch his roadmap regarding the process of review.  As some of my colleagues said earlier, we are beyond the need for a review to tighten up and address the weaknesses within FOI.  I accept that the whole system should be constantly reviewed.  We are in a changing world, particularly regarding technological advances.  I also welcome the Minister's stating that he wants to see fewer FOI requests on the basis of greater openness and publication of Government material.  We need to get to that point, but until we get there, we need to ensure we have empowered the FOI system to the degree that it needs to be.<\/p>  <p>  I was not quite sure where regular people might stand on the issue we debated earlier today because I accept that politicians sometimes operate within a political bubble.  However, many people who interacted with me saw this as the continuation of cronyism and connectedness.  They saw this as just more of the same and that nothing had really changed.  Some of them were angered and some of them were absolutely case-hardened.  A number of them stated to me that they had a feeling similar to the feeling we got on the doorsteps during the last general election campaign - that the only thing that will change this is a change of government.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister now has an opportunity to deal with the specifics of FOI.  We previously dealt with Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell's legislation on lobbying.  Given the day that we have had here and given the last eight weeks we have had, we need movement on such legislation in order to stop that revolving door, and stop that connectedness or even the perception of it.  It is vital that we do this as soon as possible.  Many people have already said that we have issues with regular citizens, politicians and campaigning groups trying to seek the truth and trying to seek information from public bodies.  We are aware that certain public bodies are not under the rules of FOI.  We need to ensure all these gaps that exist are filled so that we can provide people with the light as opposed to the darkness where, as some of my colleagues have said, democracy goes to die.  We need to ensure this does not happen.<\/p>  <p>  What we are asking for is very simple.

We have learned a considerable amount over the past 24 years since the first legislation was enacted by my colleagues in the Labour Party.  The Labour Party is proud to be the party that created Ireland's freedom of information system.  Of course, the initial legislation back in 1997 was subsequently amended, to put it diplomatically, buy a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government, only for it to be, as the Minister has acknowledged, amended again to have that damage undone by one of the Minister's predecessors, Deputy Howlin.  I acknowledge that the Minister has recognised Deputy Howlin's commitment to reform in this space, and some of the practical measures he undertook to widen the scope of our freedom of information legislation and, generally speaking, to make it better.<\/p>  <p>  I also acknowledge the Minister's commitment to the notion that we should be reducing FOI requests based on the principle of open government.  I hope that is not merely a slogan or a form of empty words trotted out.  I take the Minister at his word and I look forward to engaging with the review when it is finally constituted.  <\/p>  <p>  The 2014 reforms are important in respect of the events that have fed into the tabling of tonight's motion.  Those reforms updated and modernised our FOI laws.  They widened the scope of the legislation where new provisions would apply to make electronic devices, relevant material held on phones and non-official email accounts holding relevant information amenable under the Act once the material concerned relates to functions of the office holder.<\/p> <p>As the Minister who designed the amended legislation, Deputy Howlin, told <i>The Irish Times<\/i>recently, that Ministers should be expected to embrace not just the letter of the law but the spirit too.  The same article went on to state that the report was borne out by a 2015 memorandum from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's central policy unit.  It states &quot;regardless of the form in which they are held&quot;, they are subject to the Freedom of Information Act.  All of that said, it would be wise to create more legislative clarity about what precisely constitutes a record under the FOI Act and the National Archives Act.  The Minister referred to the National Archives Act in his initial contribution.<br\/><br\/>We need to provide clearer rules and guidance on the creation of records by relevant bodies and individuals, the retention of such records, and provide for a stronger regime in respect of deletion and security, and when an offence is committed in the event of deletion.  In this regard, section 52 of the Act needs our attention.  I recognise that the Minister has embarked on a review of the freedom of information system.  I hope that section 52 and its provisions are focused on in the review of the operation of the Act.<br\/><br\/>The Department's code of practice on freedom of information was published in 2015 under section 48 of the Act.  Page 21 acknowledges the challenges that public bodies have with record-keeping with the advent of new information technologies.  It refers to a lack of clarity and knowledge deficits relating to the management of electronic records.  There is a compelling need for more sound management of electronic records and better practices and systems, notwithstanding what the Minister said in his earlier contribution about recent improvements.<br\/><br\/>The Minister will be aware that the Act is not itself a records management Act.  The 2015 code makes recommendations to public bodies about the drawing up of guidelines for their own record management procedures but it is devoid of detailed guidance or a framework around which to build such a system.  Some bodies have introduced their own systems but there seems to be a lack of uniformity and clarity in that space.  The National Archives Acts, 1986 and 2018, are also drafted with the natural assumption that public bodies will maintain records.  It governs their mandatory transfer to public access but like the FOI Act, it does not amount to a records management Act either, since its fundamental purpose is to regulate the transfer of records retained by Departments rather than to regulate what records they should retain.<br\/><br\/>As the FOI code adverts to, power is given to the Minister under section 19(3) of the 1986 Act to make regulations &quot;for the proper management and preservation of Departmental records in the custody or care of a Department of State&quot;.  It is interesting to note that no such regulations on records management have been made under section 19 and the result is that as far as departmental records are concerned, including but not confined to electronic communications, official practices regarding record retention and storage still exist in a kind of legislative vacuum.  We should all be concerned on that point.<br\/><br\/>We make all kinds of assumptions about what is available to us under the FOI Act and what should be retained and we think we know what constitutes a record or what does not, but it is something of a minefield and can be confusing for everyone.  The FOI code displays a somewhat confused approach.  On one hand, the code is addressed to other public bodies, which are statutorily obliged to have regard to its provisions.  On the other hand, its provisions regarding records management are, in important respects, addressed to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform itself, and the code calls for action to be taken under a second body of legislation, the National Archives Acts, to properly regulate records maintenance in Departments and bodies under the aegis of the Act.<br\/><br\/>Pending the making of regulations under the National Archives Acts, as recommended by the 2015 code from the FOI central policy unit in the Department, there is no precise legislative framework for the management and preservation of departmental records.  This is a yawning deficit in the system and it was pointed out six years ago.  Two Governments on, this significant matter of public policy relating to open government, good governance and transparency remains unaddressed.  Notwithstanding the prominence given to the issue by the FOI central policy unit in 2015 when it inserted its call for action into the published code of practice, I have reviewed this, and the issue does not appear to feature in the incoming Ministers' briefs in either 2016 or 2020.  This appears peculiar and suggests a certain resistance at senior level in public administration to tackle this head-on.  It did not appear in the briefing material provided to the Minister last year but I hope that this gap will not deter him from acting to deal with this lacuna as he is empowered to do.<br\/><br\/>Will he commit to addressing what should be a fundamental pillar of any freedom of information regime, with a transparent, clear system for the creation, management and retention of records, underpinned by legislation and regulation, in his reform programme?  This would be an important message for him to send about his commitment to real reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500049#XX00400","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631736600,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and Sinn F&eacute;in on bringing forward the motion, which is important.  There is no doubt that the FOI legislation is in need of review.  I welcome the Minister's statement and his commitment to ensuring that a review takes place.  It is curious that we are talking about a review of freedom of information this week, given all that has happened in recent weeks with the Zappone debacle.  An excuse put forward by several Ministers was that we needed to review freedom of information.  That was put forward as some kind of explanation for why some of our Ministers did not comply with freedom of information.  It would be a mistake to get into that kind of mindset, saying that we need a review and that the FOI legislation is problematic, which is why it was not handled properly.  That is not the case and this should not be used in any way to distract from the mishandling of FOI requests by both the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the T&aacute;naiste.<\/p>  <p>  I will talk about what is needed in the review but will first address what has happened in recent weeks regarding non-compliance with freedom of information.  This started when questions were asked about how this famous envoy position came up, with the fact that there was no transparency.  When the Minister, Deputy Coveney, was asked about that and for records of the communications that he had had with and about Katherine Zappone, he told us that he had deleted those text messages from his phone.  The excuse that he gave the first time was that he needed to create storage space on his phone.  The following day, he completely changed his story and said he did it for security reasons, because he had been hacked.  He did not seem to realise that the FOI legislation applied to him as an officeholder.  It is incredible that he did not seem to know that digital communications are covered by legislation on freedom of information.  At what point did he delete those text messages?  If he deleted them after FOI requests went to his Department, that is a serious offence.<\/p>  <p>  We never really got satisfactory answers about that on either occasion when he came before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.  It was because his responses were so inadequate and untrue on the first occasion that he had to come back the second week to provide further explanations about what happened.  That point has not been addressed adequately.  If he did it after the request came into his Department, that is an offence.  If he did it before the FOI request came into his Department, it is poor practice, at best.  Ministers and office holders are required to ensure that any records, digital or otherwise, relating to Government business are retained.<\/p> <p>If there was any reason for clearing his phone, and it is hard to imagine what reason there could be that would stand up, he was required to keep those texts to ensure a record of Government decisions or proposals was retained.  He did not do that.  His obligations are quite clear in that regard.  What is extraordinary is the fact that he did not understand what his obligations under FOI were, despite being a Minister for ten years.  If he did not understand those obligations, that is a serious matter.  It indicates a certain attitude and approach to FOI that is not acceptable on the part of a Minister.  We never got any proper explanation for that.  <br\/><br\/>The other aspect of this recent saga is the attitude of the T&aacute;naiste to FOI.  Early on in this whole debacle, FOI requests were sumbitted.  Jack Power from <i>The Irish Times<\/i>was one of the earliest people to submit a request to the T&aacute;naiste's Department.  After some time, he received a letter from the FOI officer in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  That letter, which Jack Power published, was very specific.  It outlined in quite a bit of detail the lengths to which the officer had gone to respond to the request.  He made it very clear that everything possible was done to try to identify whether records existed.  He said that he carried out a comprehensive search within the Department.  Not only did he do that, he also carried out interviews with a number of the T&aacute;naiste's advisers who said there was nothing.  Questions need to be asked about that.  How was it that advisers to the T&aacute;naiste gave replies?  Surely, they would have checked with him.  I accept he was on holidays but, nonetheless, an FOI request, especially in the circumstances in which those FOI requests were made, is a serious matter.  Did the advisers check with the T&aacute;naiste?  Why was it so badly and inappropriately handled within the T&aacute;naiste's Department?  Again, we never got an explanation for that.  Either the request was seriously mishandled and inaccurate responses were given or there is a similar lax and sloppy attitude to legal requirements on Ministers, and those advising them, in terms of compliance with FOI legislation.  <br\/><br\/>Either way, these are serious developments in the two Departments.  There are serious questions about the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the T&aacute;naiste in respect of their non-compliance.  I would add it was curious that within a short space of time the FOI officer in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment left his post.  You just have to wonder about that.  This whole matter just does not stack up and leads people to believe that this was, at best, a lax attitude to FOI and, at worst, a cover-up.  We still do not know which it was.  It is unacceptable behaviour either way on the part of senior Ministers, or any Minister for that matter.  That, along with many other things, was the reason many Deputies could not possibly vote confidence in the Minister tonight.  There has to be a mechanism for ensuring there is close compliance with FOI requirements by all office holders.  Steps have to be taken to ensure that that is the case.  Is there adequate training for staff, Ministers and advisers?  Can a system be put in place to ensure they are aware of their legal obligations?  There is a serious chance they are not and that is being charitable to them.<br\/><br\/>On the general issue of FOI, there is a need for a substantial review to be carried out for other reasons.  That is because of the frequent frustration of politicians and journalists when trying to access to information, which should be available to them as a matter of course when a parliamentary question is tabled or when a request for information is submitted to a Department.  It is not acceptable that on so many occasions requests for information are flatly turned down and people are left with no option but to submit an FOI request.  That is not what open government and transparency are about.  The Minister has an obligation to ensure that while it is good that FOI legislation is there, it should be an absolute last resort.  A culture should be developed within government.  There is no indication whatsoever that that exists.  An open government culture has to be created, which is about making as much information available as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500050#YY00200","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631737200,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I will open with some quotes from leading Fine Gael politicians.  First, \"I do not, as standard, keep text messages\" was not said by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, but by the T&aacute;naiste on 5 November 2020.  On 31 August 2021, Deputy Coveney stated: \"I do not hold on to text messages for long periods in terms of data on my phone and so on.\"  On 7 September 2021, he also stated that he cleared texts from his phones regularly when business was done, or something like that.  At the risk of pointing out the obvious, that is not normal behaviour.  Let us forget about Ministers, freedom of information or anything else; people do not do that.  Unless they have something to hide, people do not finish a text message conversation by saying, \"Oh, that's done, I'll delete that\".  It is not like getting a letter someone does not want and putting it in the green bin.  Unless people are like Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and have a Nokia that does not have enough space for text messages, they do not do that.  People do not delete text messages, in terms of normal behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  We are not, of course, dealing with normal, regular citizens but, rather, with Ministers who have obligations under the FOI Act to retain records.  In all of the earlier responses from members of the Government during the motion of confidence debate, what was most troubling was that their main line of argument - when they were not just attacking the Opposition, which was most of the time - was that the man apologised and what more do we want?  It was almost as if they believed we were engaging in cancel culture, were trying to cancel the man for making a mistake, and while the man has made a mistake, he has also done all this great stuff and he has apologised.  However, he never apologised and he never acknowledged the most significant aspect of all of this in everything that followed, apart from the actual act of cronyism, which was the deletion of text messages relating to official Government business and the breaching of the FOI Act by doing so.  He did not apologise for that and he never acknowledged it was a mistake.  He tried to simultaneously maintain, for example, on the second occasion he appeared before the foreign affairs committee, that while he had deleted the text messages relating to the appointment of Katherine Zappone as special envoy, he does not delete text messages relating to Government business because that would be in breach of the FOI Act, despite the fact that the two statements clearly contradict each other.<\/p>  <p>  What was most amusing, and made me raise my eyebrows the most during the defence of the Minister was Deputy McHugh's contribution, who at one stage wondered that if we voted no confidence in Simon Coveney, what message that would send out to young people thinking about getting involved in politics.<\/p> <p>Perhaps it would send a message to the young people getting involved in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael about careerism and there might not be much of a hope for strokes and so on because there are consequences for actions.  However, most people would say it is good to send a message that there are consequences if someone breaches the FOI Act and are engaged in blatant cronyism etc.  There should be consequences.  This stuff should matter.  <br\/><br\/>Clearly, there is a pattern, at least among some senior Fine Gael politicians, of consciously deleting text messages which are official Government business to avoid there being an electronic paper trail of controversial decisions and to avoid them being accessed.  There is now significant evidence to suggest that is a conscious policy.  The text messages to which the T&aacute;naiste was referring in November 2020 were messages he had sent to Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail, the chair of the National Association of General Practitioners, to whom he had leaked the draft GP contract with the Irish Medical Organisation.  There were text messages about the delivery of the contract.  It was obviously very convenient.  Technologically, they were WhatsApp messages.  Therefore, they should have continued to exist in the cloud but, apparently, they were also deleted from there, which would have required a special effort.  It is not in the normal business of people deleting messages that they are finished with and so on that somehow they are gone; it would require a special effort to remove them from that.  The T&aacute;naiste is under Garda investigation for that.  We will see what transpires.  I have previously given my views on that, but it is quite significant.  Then, we get to this issue of the other contender for the leadership of Fine Gael openly saying he is doing the same thing in terms of deletion of text messages.  <br\/><br\/>It is clearly a breach of the FOI Act.  Someone who deserves much credit for his work in trying to shine light on the murky business of Government and the use of the FOI Act, despite all the frustrations there are with it, is Ken Foxe from Right To Know.  A consequence of one of the many cases he has taken is the decision of the Information Commissioner that where email accounts or messaging on mobile devices are used to transact official business, such records should be filed as part of the record management process.  It is very clear that did not happen in the case of the T&aacute;naiste and the GP contract, nor did it happen in the case of the messages on Deputy Coveney's phone.<br\/><br\/>Another of the multiple aspects related to this, to which Deputy Shortall referred, is the text messages between Katherine Zappone and the T&aacute;naiste.  It is troubling that journalists were submitting FOI requests precisely for records, including on the T&aacute;naiste's mobile phone between him and Katherine Zappone and being told point-blank that such records did not exist.  Then the messages came out.  There is controversy about it.  The response of the T&aacute;naiste in a statement was:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe relevant FOI officer who received the request, checked all emails and records and found no records.  I was on annual leave at the time the decision was released and I wasn't contacted to check my phone for records. <\/blockquote> <p>Someone is somehow empowered to say, &quot;We have checked the phones and there is not a record&quot; - the phones are specifically mentioned - despite not having talked to the T&aacute;naiste.  It stretches credibility at the very least or certainly would indicate a real problem in terms of process.  What that indicates is that we have a significant problem.  That poses the question: how many times have journalists, Deputies or ordinary people been told that records do not exist when they do and they are simply not caught out on it?<br\/><br\/>All the blame is heaped on this anonymous individual in the Department.  I do not wish to make that individual not anonymous.  I do not want to heap any blame on that person.  They were presumably doing their job.  There is political responsibility here, but the twist at the end was when the T&aacute;naiste told the media that the person is no longer at the Department.  They just kind of disappeared.  One can imagine the staff photo from one year and there is a blank face the next year because all the blame is being put on that person.  This is another person thrown under the bus - this time to protect the T&aacute;naiste.<br\/><br\/>The final issue in this saga is that two or three days ago the T&aacute;naiste was on the radio speaking about all of this and precisely to avoid dealing with the repeated flagrant breaches of the FOI Act by the Government to cover stuff up, he announced we were going to have a review of the legislation while forgetting the fact there has been a review in process for two months and that we have a law and decisions about the law already from the Information Commissioner that need to be applied right now.  However, the T&aacute;naiste announced that we will have another review simply to distract attention and to pretend that there is a problem with the law as opposed to the implementation of it.  How about the Government implementing and obeying the law as it exists?  Then I would be all for reform of it, as I outlined, in the direction of making things more transparent, etc., but it is not an excuse for breaking the law as it currently exists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500051#ZZ00200","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631737800,"counter":415,"content":"<p>Gabhaim m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle agus le Sinn F&eacute;in as an r&uacute;n seo a thabhairt os comhair na D&aacute;la inniu.  T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach agus cinni&uacute;nach mar gheall ar na fadhbanna at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l sa St&aacute;t seo agus is rud iontach anois go bhfuilimid in ann labhairt faoi go h&aacute;irithe sa gh&eacute;arch&eacute;im seo.  Freedom of Information is a key part, one of the building blocks, of a functioning democracy.  It makes information easier to access.  It creates greater public awareness of laws, policies, regulations and procedures.  It improves public participation in democracy.  It also creates greater efficiency and responsiveness within a society.  More importantly and critically, it creates a transparency that is important for the proper functioning of a society.  It is the enemy of wrongdoing, corruption and cronyism, which often haunts democracies across the world.<\/p>  <p>  The 2014 Act was extremely important legislation.  As a Deputy, I would be lost without it.  I have used it frequently down the years but more frequently in recent times.  Our democracy has been significantly restricted during the past 18 months.  It is impossible to say it has not been.  We have seen D&aacute;il sittings radically reduced.  There have been fewer opportunities to question Ministers and table parliamentary questions, and less room for debate.  Anybody who is on this side of the Chamber who does not have the private mobile phone numbers of Ministers will say it is really hard to get people in Departments and in ministerial offices.  When you ring you are told that person is working from home and we will try to get that person to ring you back, instead of having some technological wizard of an invention to able to redirect a phone to a phone at home so that a person could simply answer your question.  <\/p>  <p>  I have used the Act for a number of reasons.  I recall, for example, getting access to an email that was on the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris's account, which showed that homeless students were being refused Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant assistance.  That was an incredible, jaw-dropping situation.  Students who did not have a roof over their heads were still being refused supports with respect to SUSI grant assistance in this country.  Another FOI request I submitted at the start of the pandemic inquired if the National Treatment Purchase Fund had written to nursing homes at that time and asked them to accept a surge of patients from hospitals into those nursing homes and through that I found that they had. <\/p> <p>We found out that, at the start of the crisis, we shifted thousands of the most vulnerable people from hospitals into the epicentre of the crisis, nursing homes.  That information came from a freedom of information request as well.  <\/p> <p> There is no doubt but that the job of the media, of the Opposition and of citizens to keep the Government to account and to know what it is doing would be radically more difficult if it were not for the Freedom of Information Act.  This issue has come into significant focus over the last while in light of the Katherine Zappone situation.  This is a shockingly unedifying situation in which the T&aacute;naiste and one of the most senior Ministers have talked about either not having information on their phone or admitting that they did.  Information pertaining to the running of the Government and involving communication between Ministers and other individuals about key decisions relating to the running of the Government is being shredded by Ministers of this Government.  That is a phenomenal situation.  I heard another Minister go on television and indicate that technology has moved on beyond some of the direct diktats of the legislation.  That is nonsense.  It is liking saying that one was not caught by the letter of the law but by the spirit.  With this motion, we are not just asking Ministers to abide by the letter of the law but to do right by citizens.  There is no other interpretation of that action, from a citizen's point of view, but that the relevant Ministers are seeking to hide information from them.  The only reason I can imagine for a Minister seeking to hide information from citizens in this country is that they understand that what they have done is wrong.  We had a debate here a little while ago on that matter.  It is very clear that the process involved absolutely no transparency whatsoever and that an individual made a paid position for a friend.<\/p> <p> I will also make a point on the lengths of time involved and the difficulties involved in accessing information under the current freedom of information process.  It can sometimes take phenomenally long periods of time for individuals to get information back.  Eons can pass.  Sometimes you get back an answer saying that the request you made was too broad.  Other times you are told the request is too narrow.  From this side of the fence, it often feels like those requests are often designed to stymie one in seeking that information.  I recall a request Aont&uacute; made regarding CervicalCheck.  We sent the same correspondence to the HSE and to the Department of Health.  The Department of Health told us that no such correspondence existed while the HSE gave us some 78 pages of correspondence.  Two organisations under the remit of the Minister for Health understood the exact same request in two different ways and, as a result, there were two different responses.  There are major problems with the freedom of information process in this country.  Until we fix it, there are going to be spaces for Ministers who are involved in wrongdoing to hide.  As a D&aacute;il, we need to prevent that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500052#AAA00200","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631738400,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I believe I am sharing time with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.

This motion was brought forward at short notice as Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party and some other cheerleaders who appear to be naively enmeshed in the present Administration - although maladministration might be a truer description - danced a dance earlier on to defend the indefensible actions of a Fine Gael Minister.  Sadly, this accurately reflects how these three parties stand on issues of openness, accountability and, most importantly, responsibility.  The motion highlights the confirmed failures of the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to understand or comply with our freedom of information, FOI, laws.  This shows that there is a widespread misunderstanding of FOI and, indeed, general data protection regulation, GDPR, legislation within the apparatus of the State.  There appears to be an attitude across public bodies in general that FOI requests are unnecessary prying by the public and that they should resist complying genuinely at all costs.  They seem to interpret the GDPR primarily as a tool to facilitate the suppression of information.  Somehow, the idea of openness and transparency has been lost.  This is not the purpose of either.  Confident and mature administrators at any level in the State would see these as tools to aid, inform and reaffirm their decision-making processes.  However, when leadership is sorely lacking at the highest levels of administration, what hope do we have?<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, this motion should not be required at all.  If we had the government we wanted, there would be no need for FOI.  Everything one can access through an FOI request should be available as a right and without a tortuous application process.  All decisions, minutes of meetings and considerations of decisions should just be available without the requirement to submit an FOI request.  Perhaps I am just being naive.  Maybe that is just pie in the sky.  If I had any doubts before, the amendment tabled by the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, has tonight bolstered my beliefs.  It is heavy on statistics and light on substance but that is no surprise to any of us in the Opposition.  We are often forced to fall back on FOI requests when we receive substandard replies to parliamentary questions.  I am sure that many of my Opposition colleagues will agree that we spend much time seeking information through FOI requests which should be openly available to us to allow us to properly scrutinise the actions of Government.<\/p>  <p>  Again, the Minister's amendment quotes selective figures on full and part disclosures arising from FOI requests, but that does not tell the full story.  How many of us have had to appeal a decision and then appeal again to the Information Commissioner?  How many of us have been told that records of phone messages do not exist?  Can we believe that any of these FOI requests were dealt with properly?  From the experience of recent weeks, it certainly seems we cannot.  We should look at the lengths the likes of Gavin Sheridan, Ken Foxe and others involved in Right To Know have gone to in order to force transparency on Government and public bodies and at what it has cost them.  We should be pursuing a policy of open government.  All records that relate to the deliberations and decisions concerning State grants, schemes, services and the administration of public moneys should, as a matter of course, be openly and easily accessible to the public.  At the very least, this would save the hours presently spent in dealing with requests and appeals.  It would also remove the sense that a miracle and political goodwill are needed for things to happen.  When your entire existence relies, as do those of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, on maintaining mystery around service access in order to peddle the impression, whether real or imaginary, that you are able to influence a process, sadly, we will never see real reform.  That is the situation.  I support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500053#BBB00400","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1631738400,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I thank all of the Members who have contributed to this debate this evening.  It has highlighted the timeliness of the review of FOI legislation my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, began in June 2021.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will undertake a comprehensive and careful review of the Freedom of Information Act.  The approach to this review is being finalised and a report will be published shortly setting out the process.  Collaboration and input from stakeholders across the public sector, academia and the media, as well as the experiences of individuals, will drive the issues to be considered in the review.  A consultation on the scope of the review will take place later this year, with further consultations to be undertaken in 2022.  While it is intended that the scoping consultation will determine the key themes of the review, the debate today has provided a valuable insight into the issues to be considered.  The review will consider the experience of all stakeholders and will take account of the transformation of the manner in which people seek, consume and interact with information since the Freedom of Information Act 2014 was enacted.<\/p> <p>It will review international good practice and developments, consult with the Office of the Information Commissioner and other key stakeholders in the data information space and consider interaction between FOI legislation, data protection legislation and records management requirements.  As some Deputies mentioned, it is a complicated area.<\/p> <p> While there are challenges to be met and benefits will accrue from strengthening the current FOI system, it is important to recognise that in general the system functions well.  As the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, set out earlier, the system saw and managed a doubling of requests from 2014 to 2019.  FOI requests since 2014 have been made to approximately 600 bodies.  Four out of every five FOI requests decided on in 2020 were granted in full or in part, which is broadly in line with what we saw in previous years.  Robust review mechanisms are available where a requester is unhappy with the outcome of the FOI process.  However, uptake of the mechanism has remained notably and consistently low.  In 2000, 3.3% of requesters sought an internal review, while 1.3% sought a review by the Information Commissioner, which is almost identical to what we have seen in each of the past five years.<\/p> <p> The 2014 Act removed the application fee for making an FOI request.  In addition, no application or search and retrieval fee applies for requests or reviews that involve requests for personal information.  As such, no fee applies at any stage in relation to approximately 60% of FOI requests in most given years that involve individuals seeking their personal information.  Effective support structures are in place to support decision-makers with quarterly civil and public service network meetings providing a forum for them to share experience and get input from the Department's central policy unit.  The Department for Public Expenditure and Reform maintains a central training framework from which FOI bodies can draw to ensure their staff are up to date on FOI requirements.<\/p> <p> More than 7,000 public sector employees have received training under the framework from its introduction in 2015 to date.  Guidance is available from the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Office of the Information Commissioner on the operation of FOI.  The purpose of these structures is to support decision-makers across the public sector in effectively meeting their FOI obligations.  Even in 2020, as the pandemic wrought unprecedented destruction across all sectors of Irish society, 32,652 FOI requests were processed by public sector bodies.  I take this opportunity to recognise the hard work and tenacity of workers across the Civil Service and public service who in the face of the pandemic have ensured that the FOI system continues to operate efficiently.  This has required innovation, flexibility and no small measure of determination on the part of public sector workers as normal working methods were subject to unprecedented disruption almost overnight.<\/p> <p> I encourage everyone with a view on the FOI system and how it might be improved to take the upcoming opportunity to make their voices heard so we can improve the system and ensure it is fit for purpose in the modern world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500053#BBB00500","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631739000,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Freedom of information legislation has become a bedrock of democracy across the western world.  It is in place to provide transparency, accountability and confidence in government.  It is in place to allow citizens access the decisions made and the process that led to them.  We have seen in recent weeks that, in Ireland, rather than providing such confidence, the actions of some Departments and organisations with regard to adherence to FOI legislation is diminishing it.  There are Ministers who have deleted and destroyed Government records related to how they carry out their work.  If we had a functional FOI system in place, that would not be tolerable.  Plenty of examples have been cited this evening of FOI requests being made which were denied, responded to with partial information or, in all too many cases, told information did not exist when it did.<\/p>  <p>  For example, a number of weeks ago I submitted an FOI request to each Department asking for all correspondence in relation to the infamous event in the Merrion Hotel.  I received a response from the Department of the Taoiseach which stated no record existed of any correspondence, documentation or minute related to that event.  From the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin's, Department I received documentation that indicated that the Department of the Taoiseach was in correspondence with that very Department.  It was only when the FOI information was printed in national media and it was inferred that the Department of the Taoiseach had indicated that no such documentation existed, that that Department released the document we already had from another Department.  That happens all the time.<\/p>  <p>  It beggars belief that in all the FOI information made available there is never a minute of a Minister sitting down for a meeting with a Secretary General deciding how decisions are made.  The most basic small and medium-sized companies would have minutes of their chief executive talking to the chairperson of the board, which is a similar relationship, particularly when decisions are made that impact on finances or policy changes.<\/p>  <p>  Other organisations are particularly adept at avoiding transparency.  The State broadcaster, RT&Eacute;, refused over half of all FOI requests last year.  I know from our interactions in the Committee of Public Accounts that if the RT&Eacute; board continues to operate as it does, it will have no credibility in declaring \"The truth matters\" on the banners it employs.  It is symptomatic of the way too many State agencies interact with requests for freedom of information.  This needs to change.  I commend Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell on bringing this motion to the House and all her diligent work to ensure more transparency, more accountability and better answers about how decisions are made.  Too often, we operate under a cloud of incense. <\/p>  <p>  We ask that Ministers stop leaking and destroying records relating to their work.  That should not be too big of an ask but apparently it is.  It is also important we ensure that minutes are kept of key decisions, particularly when they relate to expenditure or policy changes, regardless of who is in that meeting.  We need to have a record.  In many cases, I am sure it provides Ministers with cover.  When they come up with what might seem to be implausible stories, as we referenced earlier, would it not be helpful if a minute of conversations that had taken apparently place was available?  We call on the Government and each Minister to ensure that all agencies and bodies under their remit answerable to FOI legislation adhere to the letter and the spirit of that.  We want to see government based on transparency and accountability.  I think the people want that too and that the Government needs to start acting accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500054#CCC00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1631739000,"counter":423,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na Teachta&iacute; a labhair ar an r&uacute;n seo.  We know from the conversations and speeches tonight and from long before this evening that this regime is in crisis.  This is not new.  Transparency campaigners have been saying this for a long time.  All of us here who have tried to get information through the FOI regime will understand the frustration of those transparency advocates who have told us time and again that this is in crisis.<\/p> <p>We should not be fooled in this regard.  It was very clear today and over the past number of weeks that Ministers either do not have a clue what they are supposed to do in regard to the freedom of information process or they are simply ignoring it and do not think it is that important.  As was said several times tonight, the FOI system really is a cornerstone of democracy.  This is not an issue of Government versus Opposition; it is, simply put, a democratic issue and it needs to be dealt with at this stage.<\/p> <p> As I said earlier, I have raised this issue with the Minister in the past and he has said previously that he considers the system to be robust.  I take his point that he announced in June that he will undertake a review.  However, that is not good enough.  We do not need a review.  What we need now is action, not another review.  Some days ago, I heard the T&aacute;naiste speaking on radio and it was clear that even he is not aware this review is taking place.  What we have heard tonight and in recent weeks, as well as the fact Ministers are not aware that a review is taking place, shows the FOI regime is not being taken seriously enough and people simply do not seem to care about its importance.  The Minister's amendment states that there should be a review etc., but my view is that we have gone beyond a review.  We need only look to what has been said tonight and the fact we have Ministers claiming they did not know they should not delete text messages that relate to Government business.  That shows we need more than a review.  What is needed is action and what is being proposed is not good enough.<\/p> <p> The Sinn F&eacute;in Bill is not something that was just drafted at the last minute.  We have worked on it for some time.  This motion deals with much of what is covered in the Bill.  Why will the Minister not enact the motion and ensure the Information Commissioner is able to refer complaints, under the FOI legislation, to SIPO?  Surely that is of benefit to everyone in this Chamber?  Why not ensure that when public bodies are established under the Companies Act, they are immediately brought under the FOI legislation?  These are simple and practical steps we can take.  I urge the Minister to commit to doing an annual review of all the bodies to which the FOI legislation applies, including those bodies that are partially within the remit of the system.  This would ensure we are consistently doing our best in terms of transparency and accountability.<\/p> <p> I totally agree with the Minister about not needing to rely on the freedom of information legislation.  Although we will always need that legislation, I would love to have a situation where we do not need to rely on it to access information.  As it stands, however, we have the FOI legislation in place and we cannot get the information half the time.  We know there are breaches of the legislation.  While I agree with the Minister that it would be great to see the day when it is not needed, we are very far from there.

The pandemic has certainly brought remote working centre stage and work on this important legislation is well advanced.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will set out a clear framework to facilitate remote and blended work options, in so far as possible.

On 20 August, I published the views of members of the public and stakeholder groups on the new legislation.  The summary report of the 175 submissions is now available on my Department's website.  Informed by the public consultation and a review of international best practice, the drafting of the general scheme of the Bill has commenced and I will be seeking Cabinet approval for the drafting of heads of Bill in quarter 4 of 2021.  The Bill will be progressed through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible thereafter.  The intention is to introduce a mechanism for employees to request remote working that is fair but does not place undue burdens on employers.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, we will continue to provide up-to-date advice, guidance and information on all aspects of remote working for workers and employers.  On 28 June, I launched my Department's Making Remote Work campaign.

It includes guidance for employers and workers and a remote working checklist, all of which are available on the Department's website.

I have spoken before about how the pandemic has caused many of us to reconsider and re-evaluate what an essential worker is.  We now understand that it is a much broader group of workers than people would have originally described, many of whom are on low pay and in the private sector.  The Government has been clear in our belief that a legacy of the pandemic must be better pay, terms and conditions for everyone, but particularly for those on low pay.  We are committed, therefore, to honouring the Government commitment to progressing to a living wage over the lifetime of this Government.  In doing so, we need to recognise that many businesses have been badly affected by the pandemic and are struggling to pay existing wages.  We need to make sure that we proceed in a way that does not cause jobs to be lost in terms of the numbers of people employed, or would see employees having their hours cut.  To do so would be counterproductive.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year I asked the Low Pay Commission to examine the programme for Government commitment and to make recommendations on the best approach.  The commission is currently undertaking research on the topic and the terms of reference for this research were noted by Cabinet earlier this year.  The report will consider the policy, social and economic implications of a move to a living wage and the process by which Ireland could progress towards it.  It will do this by looking at international evidence on living wages, examining different calculation methods, examining the policy implications and outlining options for moving to a living wage in Ireland.  The findings and recommendations in the commission's report, which I expect to receive before the end of the year, will inform Government on the best practical approach to proceed.<\/p>  <p>  While the living wage initiative is being considered, the Government will be guided by the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission with regard to any future changes to the existing national minimum wage.

The T&aacute;naiste will be aware that a motion on a living wage that I introduced in November 2019 in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il was passed.  A living wage is vitally important to those workers on low wages and I believe it will be an important tool in ensuring that people remain in jobs that they would otherwise aspire to leave.  Some of them know that they cannot stay in those jobs on the wages they are on.

I expect it will come back to us with a method by which the rate can be calculated on an annual basis.  Perhaps that is the same thing, but it is an important point nonetheless.  There are two ways of calculating it.  It can be calculated as a percentage of median wages, for example, 50%, 60% or 65%, and there are different arguments as to which figure should be chosen; or it can be calculated based on what is called a minimum essential standard of living based on a basket of goods and services that people need to be able to afford to get by.  Then there is a debate about what should be in the basket or not.  That is the kind of work that is being done by the commission at the moment.  It is giving us advice on which method to go for and why.<\/p>  <p>  I think the Low Pay Commission is a good body.  It is a body that was established under the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government.  It does it the right way.  There is an equal number of employer and employee representatives on the commission, and there are a number of people who are independent figures who are not part of any sectional interest.  I know there are some groups that calculate minimum wages, but they exclude employers.  I imagine if employers had a group that excluded workers, it would come up with a different rate.  Therefore, it is important that we have everybody involved.  However, I have no doubt, because it is what happened in the UK, that whatever the living wage is set at there will always be a group of people who will say that it is not enough and they will then look for a real living wage.

All employers and business managers who are considering a phased and staggered return to the workplace over coming weeks should familiarise themselves with the updated protocol.  As workers return to workplaces, the role of the lead worker representative is particularly important, and this is emphasised in both the protocol and in the new LEEF guidance note published last week.  All workers, regardless of the sector of the economy in which they work, are covered by the provisions of the work safely protocol and I can assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to continue to work closely with employers and trade unions to ensure appropriate guidance is in place for this next phase of reopening.<\/p><p>The Deputy has asked about good communication.  I wish to emphasise that since Covid has hit these shores, we have been very lucky to have good engagement through LEEF and with the employee representative bodies through the unions and employers.  We have been able to bring forward the work safety protocol and update it on numerous occasions.  Most businesses have found it to be an extremely useful guide, as have their employees.  Hopefully, that engagement can continue in the next few days as we move on to the next phase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500057#FFF01000","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1631740800,"counter":458,"content":"<p>On the issue of health and safety and maximum consultation, the Government decided to implement 100% capacity on public transport at short notice the week that schools went back.

We continue to work closely with the agrifood sector to mitigate the impact of the new trading arrangements to operationalise the new EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, TCA.  We are also continuing to engage with our EU and UK colleagues on the introduction of further administrative requirements for trade.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, I met UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, MP, as part of Enterprise Ireland's trade mission and I discussed the additional measures proposed by the UK.  Since then the UK Government has announced an extension to the current grace periods beyond 1 October and, it seems, at least until the end of the year. <\/p>  <p>  The agrifood sector is a major and important contributor to the Irish economy, particularly our rural economy, and any further regulatory requirements will present additional challenges and costs for Irish exporters.  We are committed to ensuring that Irish food exporters fully understand any potential new UK import requirements and everyone in the supply chain is as prepared as possible.  Being fully prepared is not the same as saying there will not be problems.  Of course there will if there are new rules and regulations, forms to fill in and checks.  With this in mind, there is ongoing cross-departmental engagement involving my Department and Enterprise Ireland to put in place a range of financial and advisory assistance measures to help our businesses to prepare for this new environment.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, is leading on sector preparedness, and his Department and its UK equivalent, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, DEFRA, are engaging on the range of measures in place and proposed.  His Department has also run joint webinars with DEFRA on the UK import controls.  In a recent survey undertaken by Bord Bia, over 80% of Irish companies reported that they were ready for the new procedures proposed for imports into Great Britain of products of animal origin.  They were planned for October.  Therefore, if 80% are saying they are prepared, 20% may not be.<\/p>  <p>  While the UK has announced the extension of grace periods, I remain confident that solutions exist, within the parameters of the protocol, to deal with the issues that have arisen to date.

We would see encouraging people to go online as a very important response to the current sutuation in retail.  As the largest private sector employer, retail is a key element in providing for the needs of society and other sectors of the economy and it is vital that it continues to develop capability and remain competitive both on the high street and online to avail of all of those other customers that it can reach.<\/p>  <p>  Trading online is a very important route for retail businesses to grow and improve and will be an important element in their recovery over the longer term.  I welcome the significant progress made by the retail sector in Ireland to move to online commerce over the past 18 months. <\/p>  <p>  To enable retailers to increase their customer base and build a more resilient business, my Department initially launched a pilot online retail scheme, in 2018.   Some 40 retailers across Ireland were provided with &euro;894,636 in funding over two calls of the pilot scheme with grants of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;25,000 on a 50% matched fund basis.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2020, my Department launched the Covid-19 online retail scheme in response to the Covid-19 crisis and the urgent need for retail companies to increase their online capability.  The Covid-19 online retail scheme is helping companies in the indigenous retail sector that have already started an online journey to enhance and strengthen their existing online presence.  This will help them to respond to both domestic and international consumer demand competitively. <\/p>  <p>  To date the Covid-19 online retail scheme has provided funding of &euro;18.2 million to 503 retailers under three calls, bringing the total approved to over &euro;19 million.  I have provided the Deputy with the full amount of the online retail scheme funding approvals per county as part of the background to the answer to this question but the Deputy will see for the record that Cork will be second on the table at just over &euro;2 million.  I am sure that the Deputy will not be surprised at the success of retail in Cork.  Dublin now leads the field at over &euro;5 million.<\/p>  <p>  We are committed to supporting the needs of the retail sector through the retail forum, which I chair and which will meet again tomorrow, in developing their online capability and enhancing their competitiveness.  The online retail schemes to date are being reviewed and it is my intention to open a further round of applications for funding later this year and to build on that success in the years ahead as well.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Stanton will also be aware of the trading online voucher scheme, administered by the Local Enterprise Office network on behalf of my Department.  This scheme was transferred into our Department at the start of this year and has allocated funding of &euro;2.3 million to meet 2021 demand.  This included a capital carryover of &euro;10.2 million to meet outstanding liabilities from 2020.  For the record, more than 13,000 applicants drew down that scheme last year.  This year it will be a little less with 4,000 or 5,000 applicants, because of the big push last year.  We have been discussing that scheme for years in here and in other places in trying to get businesses to take it up and during Covid-19 there was probably time to address it but also-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500059#HHH01500","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1631742000,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and call Deputy Stanton.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500059#HHH01600","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1631742000,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

The online trading vouchers are to enable those who already have a digital presence to expand that and to increase their sales and rather than to just sell to people in Cork or their local county, they can sell from Cork to Belfast, the UK, to France and so on.  A big part of the work of this scheme which is administered by Enterprise Ireland is to try also to encourage that internationalisation of their business.  There is great potential there.<\/p>  <p>  We carry out a review after each round and make changes to the scheme to address that.  The overall area of these schemes and the online trading voucher is being reviewed again to see how we can best enable here.  Part of this is encouragement to invest in the digital online presence and to help with the skills and the marketing, to build on that and not just to have the presence.  We see a great deal of potential here.<\/p> <p>To put it in figures, at this moment in time more than 70% of online sales in this country are still purchases from abroad.  We believe that that is the opportunity to develop the retail sector, to make it more sustainable to complement the on-the-street presence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500059#HHH01800","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631742600,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I again thank the Minister of State for his response.

Deputy Stanton will have seen in the Housing for All document published just recently a drive towards town centre first.  That will support housing, people living in our towns and villages and the development of retail and other businesses there.  We really are committed on a regional basis, as well as addressing the difficulty in our cities now, to driving that town centre approach, which means people will be asked to spend money locally in the economy.  That framework will assist, but I believe the combination of the two are required if we are to have a sustainable retail sector that can challenge, grow and create jobs.

Our Department is overseeing the development of nine new regional enterprise plans which will bring us out to 2024.  The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and I chair eight of them and the T&aacute;naiste chairs the Dublin ones.  These are \"bottom-up\" plans, developed by regional stakeholders, which will identify growth opportunities, recognise vulnerabilities and enable job creation across the regions, including in the mid-west region, through collaborative regional actions.  As the Deputy will be aware, in his case that covers Tipperary, Limerick and Clare.<\/p>  <p>  The new mid-west regional enterprise plan to 2024 will build on the core activities of the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs with the wider range of State bodies involved in supporting enterprise development in the region.  A big part of that is the relationship with our education system.  In the Deputy's case, LIT is very much involved, as is the ETB in Tipperary.  As I say at all those regional meetings, a big driver of making this happen and the success of the regional plans are the local authorities.  That ringtone is a message from Joe McGrath to make sure I do not forget to mention local authorities.  I refer to the involvement of the local authorities in making these regional plans happen.<\/p>  <p>  In driving the delivery of the new plan in the mid-west we have engaged directly with the mid-west regional steering committee, made up of regional stakeholders and chaired by Professor Eamonn Murphy.  At this stage I think I have met Professor Murphy on four or five occasions.  As the Deputy will be aware, he is the managing director of the Irish Centre for Business Excellence.  As a region Tipperary is very lucky to have him as a chair.  He is really driven to make sure we have economic success across Tipperary, Clare and Limerick.  The last time I met the steering committee was physically, last week, on 7 September.  I am conscious that Deputy Cahill sent his apologies that he could not make the meetings we had in Limerick, and I thank him for that, but he was well represented by his colleague on the council, who put forward a very strong case for investment in Tipperary.<\/p>  <p>  The regional stakeholders in the mid-west region are working to finalise focused strategic objectives for their region and actions to deliver on these objectives and intend to sign off on the new plan in the weeks ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500060#JJJ00700","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1631742600,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

Zoned land is extremely scarce in that town and we have a number of employers in the town who are seriously under pressure for space to expand.  The IDA has sold off some of its portfolio but still had a small portion of land in the town.  When the county council endeavoured to negotiate on the behalf of the industries in the town that needed this land as they were extremely short of space in their present premises, the IDA's response was to put the land up for sale and public auction.  The land has no services or infrastructure to it, and the end result is that we have employers in the town thinking of relocating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500060#JJJ00800","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1631742600,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I took time when I was in Tipperary last week to drive up and down nearly every street and every part of Tipperary town and I could see exactly what the Deputy is saying.

It is fair to say the bypass will make a big difference and is important.  The message I got from all the groups I met in Tipperary was to make sure that that bypass happens and that the road upgrade happens to go along with that.  That is a priority and I agree it would open up the town.  Issues around IDA and Enterprise Ireland were mentioned to me as well and I was shown the options for the land.  I am happy to engage with the Deputy directly on that.  With the regional plan, I stressed to all the groups there that they need to focus in on that and that any key actions we want on a regional basis need to come through the regional action plan because that helps us as three Ministers involved in the drawdown of the funding from the different parts of Departments.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, his local authority is very much involved in driving the new actions in Tipperary under the Tipperary task force that was set up by the previous Government - just as it finished up - under my old Department.  That is also bringing forward a very useful strategy for the town.  I got a briefing on that when I was there last week.  There is great potential in it.

The asking price and the conditions the IDA has put on the piece of land that would be suitable for him make it economically unviable for him to relocate there.

It is not a statutory code of practice but it is admissible in evidence where somebody takes a complaint in respect of the Organisation of Working Time Act, for example.  After consideration, we just did not think it was the kind of measure we could include in primary legislation.  Workplaces vary so much.  Some are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., while others follow the clock.  We just did not think that could be legislated for in primary legislation, so we have done it through the code of practice giving people the right to disconnect.  While that is not statutory, if people have had their working times protections breached, they can use it and it is admissible in proceedings.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of younger workers, or any workers who might be in crowded accommodation such as a one-bedroom apartment or a studio, it is not envisaged that the employer would be required to provide a workspace in their private home.

Within the legislation, therefore, the T&aacute;naiste might consider the reality of that younger person, or that person starting off in the workforce, who does not yet have the capability to move out of the family home but needs some basic provision of support from the employer in order that he or she can be effective.

In that case, the employee is making the request and there is more of an obligation on him or her to provide the space from which he or she is going to work.

Some options to be considered for workers with caring responsibilities that preclude them from working their normal hours in the normal way pre-Covid may include: offering paid compassionate leave; allowing employees to work from home; altering shifts in order that employees can co-ordinate caring between themselves and partners or another person; allowing employees to rearrange holidays; allowing employees to rearrange parental leave; allowing employees to take paid time off that can be worked back at a later time; or allowing employees to take unpaid leave until they can return to work fully or part time.<\/p>  <p>  Now, with more than 90% of the adult population fully vaccinated, being a close contact of someone who has tested positive does not mean that a person has to self-isolate.

Reckonable service is service that is taken into account when calculating a redundancy lump sum payment.  The current situation is that the law provides that a period of lay-off within the final three years of service before redundancy is not allowable as reckonable service and is not included as service for the purposes of the calculation of the redundancy lump sum payment.  Therefore, as matters stand, an employee who is in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and who was laid off from their employment, that period of lay-off is not allowable for reckonable service.  I appreciate that this is an issue for certain employees who have been on lay-off for an extended period of time, as a result of the public health restrictions.  This is legally complex for several reasons, but I can assure the House that my Department, alongside the Department of Social Protection, has been examining the matter for a number of months to come up with a fair solution.  One the main considerations is to ensure that any proposal does not impose any further financial burden on employers beyond their current obligations under the Act.  Indeed, it is unlikely that we would be able to impose such an obligation on them retrospectively.  I intend to make announcement in relation to this matter and a solution that we have developed in the coming weeks, because we need to provide fairness to workers facing redundancy due to the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  As the House is aware, the section 12(A) emergency measure was introduced because the Government was concerned that the financial impact of redundancy claims on employers would have a serious impact on their business and on the economy as a whole.  This, in turn, could have resulted in significant insolvency situations and further job losses.  It is also considered important for employers to have a continued link to their job and a pathway to return to.  <\/p>  <p>  In June, I wrote to every registered business in Ireland to thank them for their efforts to date in keeping people safe during the pandemic and to update them on the suspension of section 12(A).  Companies that are genuinely unable to pay will be able to avail of a deferred payment arrangement, as confirmed in the economic recovery plan.  The current end date for section 12(A) is 30 September 2021.  The Government is not giving any consideration to extending this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500062#LLL00900","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1631743800,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s response.

We are trying to engage and find solutions to that.  Two of these relate to the employment permits system, which is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and-or labour shortages in circumstances where there are no suitably qualified Irish or EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that shortage is a genuine one.  The system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and the ineligible occupations lists, which are subject to twice yearly evidence-based reviews.<\/p>  <p>  A review of the occupation list is currently under way, with submissions received from the sectors Deputy Durkan mentioned, namely, the construction, hospitality and agrifood sectors.

Normally, the work of that review would be completed and published by November.  The commitment I have given to the various sectors is that we will try to have that work completed for October.  We are under pressure to do that, but we will try to do it and have it out for early October.<\/p> <p>In addition, applications for employment permits have seen a significant increase over the course of the year.

I thank all three Deputies for raising the issue of the impending closure of a general practice in Templemore following the recent retirement of Dr. Joe Hennessy.  The Government is committed to ensuring that patients throughout the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas in the future.  It is imperative that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly-qualified GPs and that services are provided in a way which is accessible to all patients.<\/p><p>The Government is aware of workforce issues facing general practice, including the influence of demographic factors.  In recent years, it has implemented a number of measures to improve recruitment and retention in general practice.  These measures include increasing investment in general practice by approximately 40%, to &euro;210 million, between 2019 and 2023 under the terms of the 2019 general medical service and general practice agreement.  The agreement provides for increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas, and for improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements.  In addition, the number of GP training places increased from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021, an increase of 94% over the 12-year period in question.  The intention is to continue to achieve annual increases in the number of training places available.  These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country.<\/p><p>Regarding the GP vacancy in Templemore, it has not, to date, been possible to source a locum to provide consistent cover for this practice.  Since July 2021, eight locum doctors have provided cover, which is not ideal for delivering a quality service and continuity of care for patients.  Two recruitment campaigns have been undertaken.  The panel was advertised locally, nationally and in the <i>British Medical Journal<\/i>.  In addition, the advertisement was shared with all GMS practices across the mid-west and with the mid-west training scheme in an attempt to attract newly-qualified GPs.  Unfortunately, the HSE has not been successful in recruiting a GP to this single-handed general practice in Templemore.  It is therefore planned that the group practice in the town of Templemore will take on the panel of patients on an interim basis.  An additional GP has been recruited by the practice, which means that three doctors will provide the additional capacity, to provide a safe, accessible and consistent service to the patients in Templemore and the surrounding area.  Additional nursing and administrative staff have also been recruited for the practice.  This reflects the developing trend in general practice to have larger practices, which can both improve the services available to patients and provide an improved working environment for GPs and their staff.<\/p><p>General medical card scheme patients have been advised of the new arrangements and how to access the new practice.<\/p> <p>While the HSE has no responsibility for private patients, private patients have been advised by practice staff of the need to source a new GP.  Private patients can contact the group practice, or any other practice of their choice, to request to be taken on as a private patient.  Should any private patient find it difficult to source a new GP, he or she can contact the local HSE primary care unit which can support him or her in accessing a GP insofar as it is possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500064#NNN00500","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631745600,"counter":575,"content":"<p>The scenario in Templemore is being replicated throughout rural Ireland.

Incentives must be put in place to make rural practices more attractive to GPs to avert a pending crisis.  As far back as 2015, the Irish College of General Practitioners stated that if measures were not introduced to support rural practices, further inequality of access to healthcare among rural populations would result.

It is important to recall that the beef exceptional aid measure was put in place to provide farmers with temporary financial aid in response to a prolonged period of depressed beef prices.  It was a recognition that farmers were on their knees.  The difficulty with the scheme from the outset was that it included a provision that farmers were required to commit to a 5% reduction in bovine livestock manure nitrogen, effectively meaning they were to reduce their stocking rate.  When you consider that most of the farmers availing of this scheme were suckler farmers, who are probably the most sustainable farmers and producers of beef in the world, it made little sense.  It was something I had a little concern about from the very start.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that, the scheme was beset with confusion from the very beginning.  Almost immediately, we heard reports of farmers waiting up to six weeks to receive figures from the Department, and farm advisers who had figures that were different from the Department's.  As a result of those debacles, a deferral or six-month extension to the scheme was secured, rightly, at the height of the third wave of Covid.  This was the least that farmers should have expected.  However, we now learn that 3,627 farmers within the State are now facing a clawback of &euro;5,227,820.  This is money that is now being taken from farmers who received the payment in the first place because of exceptional need.  <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State today instructed his officials to apologise for attempting to raid areas of natural constraint, ANC, and targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, payments in a very underhand manner.

The conditions of the scheme were extremely bureaucratic for hard-pressed beef finishers.  The fact that it was undersubscribed is a sign of how unattractive the scheme was for farmers.  For a scheme for beef finishers to be undersubscribed, told its own story.  It is now the case that many farmers who applied for the scheme are failing to meet the conditions and the money they received will have to be reimbursed.<\/p>  <p>  These farmers are still under severe financial pressure.  Beef finishing is still a very unprofitable business.  I ask the Minister of State to bring in a system similar to what we had for the super levy in 2016, when farmers incurred a very large super levy bill but were given a period of years by the Commission to pay back the money.  That is the very least that needs to be done in this case.  We should have a prolonged period of time to allow these beef finishers to pay back the money in instalments.

As has been rightly outlined, 2019 was a very difficult year for beef farmers.  There was a need for support to help them cope with market difficulties, which were largely driven by Brexit.   That is why we fought hard to get money from Europe to establish the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, which ended up with &euro;77 million being paid to 33,000 farmers in 2019, &euro;50 million of which came from the EU with the balance having come from the national Exchequer.  In return, farmers were required over the following two years to reduce by 5% their bovine organic nitrogen produced on the farm.  The European Commission insisted there was an element of restructuring of the Irish beef sector built into the scheme.  Money is never given without some conditionality attached.  That was clearly set out in article 1.3 of the Commission regulation 2019\/113(2) of 2 July 2019 and it was also in section 7 of the BEAM scheme's terms and conditions in 2019.  Such was the urgent nature of the market difficulty that the money was paid upfront, subject to the participants' compliance with the scheme requirements.<\/p>  <p>  Almost 19,000 farmers have now met their requirements and exited the scheme.  A further 11,000 farmers have opted to avail of the flexibility the Minister, Deputy McConalogoe, fought hard for and secured in January from the European Commission.  This allowed a farmer to opt for a later reduction period over which the 5% could be delivered.  The later period runs from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021 compared to the original period which ran from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021.  <\/p>  <p>  All 33,000 farmers in the BEAM scheme had the opportunity to avail of the later reduction period if they wished and if it was necessary.  Farmers could apply for the deferral between 19 March and 21 June.  The Department made it clear to farmers there was no downside to applying for the deferment option because we wanted to make sure everybody who wanted to apply for that deferment could do so without any fear.  Those who opted for the deferment but met the scheme conditions in the original period were automatically removed from the later reduction period because they had met the requirements.  Almost 5,300 farmer participants were in this category and have exited the scheme without recoupment.  The remaining 3,600 farmers decided not to opt for the later reduction period and, as of the end of June 2021, have failed to meet the obligations they signed up to under the BEAM scheme's terms and conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Of the 3,600 farmers, 66% or 2,396, who are in the recoupment situation increased their nitrates during that reduction period.  These 3,600 farmers will have some or all of the money they received in 2019 recouped.  The total being recouped is now &euro;5.2 million with the average recoupment per farmer at &euro;1,700.  Among the 3,600 farmers, almost 10% of cases involve less than &euro;200 and almost a quarter involve less than &euro;400.<\/p>  <p>  The rules on recoupment of interest are the same across all schemes.  They are set down.  There is conditionality with respect to European rules involving European money.  The Deputies highlighted concern for the farmers involved.  They had the option to continue on in the scheme but decided not to do that.  As I said, two thirds of these farmers decided to increase their nitrogen organic output.  The majority of those farmers made that conscious decision in the full knowledge that they were outside the terms and conditions of the scheme.  That was a business decision for them to make and they felt it was the right thing to do, which was their right, but the terms of the scheme mean that money has to be recouped.<\/p>  <p>  I accept the communication around the recoupment letter to the 3,600 farmers could have been clearer and was not handled properly.

Some 19,000 farmers met the scheme's requirements and have exited the scheme because of that.  Deputy Cahill is right in saying the scheme was not over-subscribed.  It was under-subscribed.  A number of beef farmers who were in financial difficulties, as were all beef farmers at that time, checked the scheme's conditions and decided not to participate in it because of the conditionality attached, and that was their right.  In terms of the decisions by farmers to join the scheme, lessons have been learned about the scheme's design.  If one were designing a scheme from scratch in normal circumstances one would not design like this one, but it was exceptional because the need was exceptional.  You would not normally pay in advance under such a scheme where the conditionality came to bear afterwards without some clawback.  In an ideal world one would not do that because it can give rise to difficulties.  Farmers have a right to make that decision in the full knowledge that, as two-thirds of the farmers have done, if they decide to increase their nitrogen organic output in the future -  it is their right to do that - to be fair to everybody in the scheme and to those who decided not to go into it because of the conditions attached, there has to be recoupment.  The rules on the interest rate and the recoupment periods are set down.  They are EU regulations.  Deputy Cahill mentioned the 2020 scheme and he rightly said that was fully Exchequer funded.  There is much more flexibility with Exchequer funded schemes.  There is not the same flexibility with EU schemes.  That means we have to stick to the rules that apply.  The flexibility shown in the earlier part of the year was hard fought for.

The so-called single malt allowed companies incorporated here to minimise their corporation tax bills by funnelling profits into low tax states, in this case Malta, with which we have tax treaties.

Thanks to what Christian Aid has described as the narrow drafting of the Ireland-Malta tax agreement, the deal that the Minister said in 2018 \"should eliminate any remaining concerns about such structures\" and which he said represented \"another sign of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to tackling aggressive tax planning\", it has turned out to be nothing of the sort.  The Maltese operate a generous series of tax write-offs against intellectual property including licences, trademarks and so on.  There is little that we in Ireland can do about that but, according to Christian Aid, it is the narrow drafting of the tax treaty that allows this abominable practice to occur in the first place.  This is Ireland's problem.  It is our problem.  This elaborate game of pass the parcel might be lawful, bizarre as that sounds, but it is disgusting and immoral.  The practice literally takes food out of the mouths of children in Ethiopia and Nepal, where Abbott sells Covid kits.  Taxes on sales profits in those countries ought to be paid there.

Ironically, it can be argued that the Abbott case has also come about due to the previous Government's failure to sign Ireland up to Article 12 of the OECD multilateral instrument despite warnings from Christian Aid and others at the time, including the Minister of State's ministerial colleagues, the Ministers, Deputies Michael McGrath and Darragh O'Brien, that this could lead to the kind of tax avoidance we have seen revealed by Christian Aid in the media today.

From the outset I must point out that, while the Deputy has mentioned the name of a particular company and has gone into its tax affairs in detail here in the Chamber, people will understand that it is absolutely not appropriate for the Minister for Finance to comment on the tax affairs of individual businesses.  That is a basic law and understanding of how this Parliament should work.  A Minister should not be going down the road of talking about the tax affairs of a named individual business or individual person.<\/p>  <p>  Recent years have seen significant progress in global action to address the issue of aggressive tax planning by multinational companies.  Ireland has fully engaged in the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process since 2013 and we have proactively and diligently reformed our tax code in line with emerging new international norms.   A lot has already been achieved.  We must recall that, today, we have far more robust international tax rules and safeguards to prevent abuse, arbitrage, base erosion and profit shifting than existed a decade ago.  Significant progress has been made.<\/p>  <p>  In respect to the issues highlighted in the Christian Aid report, it is relevant to note that the Revenue Commissioners entered into a competent authority agreement with the Maltese competent authority, its Ministry of finance, to counteract so-called single malt arrangements that could otherwise result in double non-taxation.  At this late hour of the night, people will forgive me for specify that when I mention \"single malt\", I am not talking about whiskey.  The word \"single\" relates to a business that has single residency in an area.  The word \"malt\" is short for \"Malta\" rather than having anything to do with whiskey, in case people thought that was what we were talking about here tonight.  Specifically, this competent authority agreement addresses issues where there is a mismatch of residence and domicile provisions which could otherwise result in double non-taxation.  I am advised that this competent authority agreement provision is operating as intended and companies should not be able to avail of double non-taxation on the basis of a mismatch of residence and domicile provisions.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is committed to taking action to ensure the Irish tax code is in line with new and emerging international tax standards as agreed globally.  The January 2021 update to Ireland's corporation tax roadmap highlights the actions that have already been taken, and which will continue to be taken, in this process of corporation tax reform.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to remember that in recent Finance Acts the Oireachtas has substantially progressed transposition of the anti-tax avoidance directives through: the introduction of controlled foreign company rules, anti-hybrid rules and a revised exit tax regime; the introduction of defensive measures against listed jurisdictions through enhanced controlled foreign company rules; the updating of transfer pricing rules; the introduction of legislation for OECD BEPS measures on mandatory disclosure rules; and a substantial widening of the scope of the exit tax regime with the result that, on the migration of a company from Ireland to another country of residence, the increase in the value of assets to the date of the company's departure will be chargeable to the full rate of corporation tax.  It should also be recognised that Ireland has a long-standing general anti-avoidance rule which goes beyond the standard required by the EU anti-tax avoidance directives.  Furthermore, in the upcoming Finance Bill, it is intended that we will complete the transposition of the anti-tax avoidance directives with the reintroduction of interest limitation rules and anti-reverse hybrid rules.  It is intended that these rules will be effective from 1 January 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500067#QQQ00200","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1631746800,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I too understand the rules, conventions and protocols in this House but I have no difficulty in identifying, as the media have today, firms that may be practising tax strategies that, although lawful, are immoral.  These are not the type of tax strategies or tax avoidance structures that should be facilitated in any way by this country.  This is where we interrogate important issues of public policy in this Republic.  We are elected representatives of the people and we have a constitutional obligation to interrogate and explore these issues, particularly when states such as our own and others across the European Union and the developing world are being deprived of resources that are rightfully theirs because of the arcane and elaborate structures that certain organisations are permitted to operate.  It is bizarre that these are lawful, as I remarked in my initial contribution.  We have seen the response from the firm involved to the media.  It is predictable.  It has said that it has done nothing unlawful so it is okay.  That is its defence.<\/p>  <p>  While I understand that the Minister of State does not want to make direct reference to this company, is he aware of any other schemes that are in place that may be similar to the single malt mechanism, which we had been told was closed down in 2018?  The Minister of State has gone to some lengths to describe the kind of due diligence that the the Department and the Revenue Commissioners may engage in to identify shelters such as this where they crop up but has any recent assessment been undertaken by his Department in respect of the corporation tax liabilities of Irish-incorporated companies that are tax resident in other tax treaty partner countries since the residency rules changes in the Finance Act 2014 came into force last December?  <\/p>  <p>  I will make a final point with the indulgence of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  This Abbott case again shows how taxable profits are being siphoned away from the poorer countries where sales are being made, in this case, Nepal and Ethiopia. I know that a spillover analysis was done by the Department regarding the impact of these kinds of measures on developing countries.  Will the Minister of State undertake a similar analysis in light of these reports?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500067#QQQ00300","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speech","time":1631746800,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy again.  I must reiterate that it would be inappropriate for a Minister or Minister of State to comment on the tax affairs of an individual taxpayer here in the House.  The competent authorities agreement that was signed came into effect in November 2018.  This effectively brought an end to the single malt structure the Deputy has been speaking about.<\/p> <p>The objective of the agreement was to counteract the arrangement that sought to take income out of the charge of tax in Ireland on the basis that the company was not tax-resident in Ireland but also out of the charge of tax in Malta on the basis the company was not domiciled there. <\/p> <p> The Christian Aid report provides no evidence that the competent authority agreement was ineffective in achieving that objective.  On the contrary, paragraph 18 of the report states that the 2018 competent authority agreement appeared to end the spate of new single malt structures that multinationals had begun to set up from 2015 onwards.  Since November 2018, only four companies have been incorporated in Ireland with a place of business registered in Malta.  The four were subsidiaries of one group, registered in 2019.  One case is being discussed and the Revenue is keeping a close eye on that.  <\/p> <p> In effect, the Christian Aid report acknowledges the competent authority agreement has achieved its objective in preventing double non-taxation that would otherwise arise from a mismatch of the rules.  The real story is why sufficient prominence was not given to the Christian Aid report in that regard.  Within a short period, it was effectively eliminated and there is only one case outstanding.  That is receiving close scrutiny.  The purpose of providing opportunities for double taxation is set out clearly in the various reports and Ireland has a proven record of improvements in our international corporation tax regime.  We have listed a number of the improvements that have happened year by year over the past couple of years.  There will be further developments in the coming budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500067#QQQ00400","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education","time":1631747400,"counter":594,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500068#RRR00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1631747400,"counter":595,"content":"<p>For young families to succeed, childcare must be affordable, accessible, of high quality and sustainable.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to ongoing learning and listening to providers, parents and guardians.  However, despite significant increases in funding and the welcome and ambitious First 5 strategy, Ireland still has one of the most underfunded childcare systems in Europe, failing to meet the EU average of UNICEF targets for investments.  We have one of the highest costs of childcare in the OECD.  It is over half the average wage in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In the early years staffing survey report for 2021, 97% of providers said they feel low pay and staff leaving the sector will have a negative impact on the provision of services.  More than 70% found it extremely difficult to recruit staff in the past 12 months and 42% of early years educators are actively looking for a job outside the sector, with 75% identifying low pay as the reason for leaving the profession.  Providers and educators in 4,500 early years and after-school settings in Ireland stepped up during the pandemic and the provision of quality care and education to children has been highlighted as a critical contributor to a functioning society and economy.  We have to get this right in the future.<\/p>  <p>  I have met and engaged with stakeholders on this.  I have met and listened to providers, parents and staff.  This weekend, I am meeting more stakeholders in Carlow and Kilkenny to discuss the issues in advance of budget 2022.  That will be crucial.  They have told me Ireland's early years system is not working for parents and is failing the educators.  Underfunding of childcare has led to a lack of options for educators who leave the sector, providers who close their doors and parents and guardians who cannot afford it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500068#RRR00300","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1631747400,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I am pleased to raise the hugely important issue of early years childcare services and the need to provide adequate funding in the next budget to ensure sustainable and accessible childcare services for 2022 at least.  I do not say it lightly but there is a crisis in the sector.  Early years educators are expected to work for approximately &euro;12 per hour.  That is untenable.  Is it any wonder up to 50% are actively looking for employment elsewhere?  Early years professionals, 98% of whom are women, are among the lowest-paid workers in Ireland with 50% earning below the living wage.  That is the value we put on early years education.  In the Netherlands, the hourly wage is &euro;26 per hour.  In France, it is almost &euro;20.  In Germany, it is &euro;18.  In Ireland, it is &euro;12.  An additional &euro;75 million is the minimum needed to improve pay scales and to ensure all staff earn above the living wage.<\/p>  <p>  Parents in Ireland pay the highest fees in the EU.  They are, on average, about &euro;184 per week.  Compare that to Sweden, which I acknowledge is at the lower end, where childcare costs &euro;31 per week.  If the Minister were to invest a further &euro;75 million in the upcoming budget, it would help ensure affordability for parents and, therefore, access to high quality, sustainable services.  I seek the Minister's commitment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500068#RRR00400","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1631747400,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  It is a key priority for me as the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to improve the affordability, accessibility and quality of early learning and care, ELC, and school age childcare, SAC.  Historically, there have been low levels of investment in ELC and SAC in this country, although in the past five years we have seen a 141% increase in investment.  That stands now at &euro;638 million per year.  This increase has funded a second year of the early childhood care and education, ECCE, preschool programme, an access and inclusion model, AIM, and enabled the introduction of the national childcare scheme, NCS.<\/p><p>Deputy Murnane O'Connor referred to First 5, the whole-of-government strategy for babies, young children and their families.  That was published in 2018 and committed to at least doubling our investment in ELC arid SAC by 2028.  A key vehicle for ensuring that such significant investment delivers for children and families will be the new funding model.  An expert group is leading on this work, which will include the development of appropriate mechanisms to fund services that will improve affordability, quality and sustainability and address issues such as staff pay and controls on fees paid by parents.  The expert group has undertaken extensive research and consultation and I expect to receive its recommendations in November of this year.  Its work has been informed by an in-depth process of stakeholder engagement and consultation, undertaken to capture the perspectives of parents, those who work in the sector, providers and representative groups.  Included in the expert group's terms of reference is a mandate to explore how greater public management of the sector, supported by greater public investment, can help deliver these policy objectives.<\/p><p>The draft guiding principles developed by the expert group states: <\/p> <blockquote> \tThe funding model should be based on an acceptance that ELC\/SAC is a public good... It should seek to support the delivery of this public value through the provision of high quality, affordable, accessible, and sustainable ELC and SAC services. <\/blockquote>  <p>It also states that the funding model should make best use of the available public management tools.  I expect this principle will inform the report of the group.<\/p><p>In recent months, I have met representative groups from the ELC and SAC sector to discuss, among other issues, the level of funding in the sector.  These meetings have been really useful in orientating me and my Department's plans.  In terms of budget 2022, my officials and I have received and considered pre-budget submissions from a number of representative groups and this will inform our budget bid.<\/p><p>Both Deputies raised the issue of pay and I firmly believe the level of pay in the sector does not reflect the value of the work that early learning and childcare practitioners do for children, families and society.  I am doing all in my power to address this.  As the Deputies are aware, the State is not the employer and the Department does not set wage levels but my Department has provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to provide better wages and working conditions, higher capitation for graduate payments and support for school age childcare to make it more attractive.<\/p> <p>Last December, working in partnership with SIPTU and Childhood Services Ireland-IBEC, I began a short process investigating the potential of a joint labour committee for the sector and how it might support a better wage rate.  We engaged Dr. Kevin Duffy, former chair of the Labour Court, to chair the process.  Following that, I wrote to the Minister of State, Deputy English, and he has since signed an establishment order for a JLC for the early years sector.  I regard this as an extremely significant and welcome development.  I know it has been welcomed by both employers and workers in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091500068#RRR00500","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1631748000,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and welcome the information he gave.

Will that model include a clear career path for educators and a clear guide to supports for providers struggling to sustain businesses under a significant administrative burden, which includes inspections, increased commercial rates and insurance costs?  There are many issues on which we need to give confidence to childcare providers, parents and staff.  That is going to be very important.<\/p>  <p>  This is a vital sector and it must be supported.

This sector, like many sectors of the economy, is coming out of an incredibly difficult time following Covid.  It is a sector that certainly stepped up during the crisis, which both Deputies recognised, particularly last January when it did not shut but continued to provide early learning and care for the most vulnerable children and the children of essential workers.  How we managed to deliver that was through the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and the sector exemption for childcare that I negotiated with the Department of Finance at the time because we knew, with the pods arrangement, that providers had an obligation to have more staff on site, which required greater funding.  We provided that through the EWSS.  All the providers I have met have recognised how important that support was up to this point.  They also recognise that we have been very clear there will not be a cliff edge in terms of the EWSS and that the support will be tapered out.<\/p>  <p>  We are now looking beyond Covid.
