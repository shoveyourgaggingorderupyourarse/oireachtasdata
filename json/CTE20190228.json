He is joined by Ms Deirdre Quaid, deputy director of audit.<\/p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputy Deering.<\/p> <p>  The minutes of the meetings of 14 and 21 February have been circulated.  Is it agreed that they be published?  Agreed.  Any matter arising will be dealt with in the course of the next topic.<\/p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence, the first of which is category A, briefing documents and opening statements.  The first items are Nos. 2010 and 2015, correspondence, dated 22 February 2019, received from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, providing a briefing note and opening statement for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Category B is correspondence received from Accounting Officers or Ministers, or both, as a follow-up to requests made at previous meetings of the committee.  The first item is correspondence, dated 18 February 2019, received from Ms Rhonda Evans of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, providing the minutes of meetings of the finance and construction committee.  They were circulated prior to last week&rsquo;s meeting and I propose that we formally note them today.  At our meeting on 14 February we requested the board to publish the minutes of its other meetings. I suggest it also publish these minutes.  It is not for the committee to publish the minutes of meetings of the board.  We will note the correspondence which was discussed at the previous meeting.<\/p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1999 received from Mr. Paul O'Toole, chief executive officer of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, in reply to the committee&rsquo;s request for a report on the review of the relationship between Cork Institute of Technology and certain named companies and entities.  Mr. O&rsquo;Toole advises that a draft report is in the process of being finalised by Mazars consultants and that the HEA will consider the report when completed and revert to the committee at the earliest opportunity.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  The field work has been completed and a draft report is being worked on.<\/p> <p>  The next item of correspondence which is dated 20 February 2019 is No. 2000 received from Ms Elaine Sheridan, vice president for corporate affairs and finance at Waterford Institute of Technology, providing information requested by the committee following its recent meeting at which we considered Special Report No. 104 of the Comptroller and Auditor General - Waterford Institute of Technology - Development and Disposal of Intellectual Property in FeedHenry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022800002#A00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1551344400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>There are a couple of issues with the letter received from Professor Donnelly, president, and Ms Elaine Sheridan, vice president for corporate affairs and finance at Waterford Institute of Technology.  It is on the back of the meeting regarding the special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General which mentioned several documents, one of which was a memorandum sent to Professor Donnelly by a subordinate highlighting concerns about the process involved in the establishment of FeedHenry and other governance issues.  I sought a copy of the memorandum.  If my memory is correct, it was accompanied by an email stating it should be sent to the president and the financial controller, but it did not reach them.  The president who was vice president at the time went back to the author of the memorandum and asked questions about its contents.  I am aghast that the correspondence states, \"In light of the threat of legal proceedings issuing on foot of any disclosure of the Memorandum, it would not be appropriate for us to provide it to the PAC\".  I do not understand why there would be any legal impediment to the memorandum being provided for the committee.  There has been an ongoing issue with transparency in dealing this matter.  That is one of the reasons the committee has looked into the process involved in the establishment of the companies.  However, there has been a full examination and the Comptroller and Auditor General has completed his report which mentions the memorandum, yet Waterford Institute of Technology is stating it cannot provide it for us for legal reasons which are not outlined, other than the possibility that certain individuals may be named in the memorandum.  However, it should be possible to redact the names of such persons.  <\/p> <p>  The committee also requested an information note on the shareholders in FeedHenry, given that WIT was one of the shareholders, but the correspondence states that information cannot be provided either.  The information is available on the website of the Companies Registration Office, but WIT is not in a position to provide it for the committee.  This goes back to the stalled HEA report.<\/p><p>We need to refer back to the Department and ask it if it has considered appointing a statutory inspector to deal with this.  If it is the case that with every item of information being sought, there is a legal impediment or legal advice is offered as to why we cannot get it, somebody with the authority to look at all of these memorandums and documents is necessary if the committee cannot get them.  I propose that we write back to the HEA and the Department, with copies of the correspondence we received from WIT, to ask them their current position with regard to having another look at the report, which is stalled at present, and what the next steps will be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022800002#A00400","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551344400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I have a question for Mr. McCarthy.

That is noted.<\/p> <p>  Nos. 2003 and 2007 are from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board regarding the committee's request for written consent from Mazars before the relevant document or any part of it is disclosed.  Ms Evans advises that permission was requested and is still awaited.  Mazars stated that the document is confidential and we cannot publish it until their consent is given.  We are waiting for that.<\/p><p>We note that is the position and we will publish that reply.<\/p><p> The next item is No. 2011 from Ms Carmel Whelan, Kildare-Wicklow ETB, providing information requested by the committee about the valuation report for a building in Arklow.  This is an extensive document and the valuation runs to several pages.  The final paragraph of the letter includes a note from the valuer stating that, in accordance with standard practice, neither the whole or part of this report, or any reference thereto, may be included in any document or circular without prior consent.  We have to ask Kildare-Wicklow ETB to get the consent of the valuer before we can publish it.  It should be standard practice that whenever this committee writes to an organisation seeking a report from a consultant, we should include in our first letter a request of the organisation to get consent from the consultant.  That would be better than us getting the letter and spending another couple of weeks writing back to ask the organisation to seek consent.  On foot of these types of issues arising, we need to put that request for consent in our original request. <\/p><p> In this case, we have the valuation report but we cannot publish it because we do not have the consent of the valuer.  We have seen it and can discuss it but cannot publish it without consent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022800002#B05100","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551344400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>We should make that standard practice from now on.

We will follow that up.  We will hold over this item because we are awaiting consent from the valuer.  We will not publish that until we get consent.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 2012 from Mr. Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer of the Office of Government Procurement, dated 25 February 2019 in response to the committee's request for information on his role as a member of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board about the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and the role of the Government contracts committee for construction.  We will note and publish this.  He will be coming in with Mr. Robert Watt next week and we will have a detailed discussion.  This is a comprehensive letter.  I do not expect the public to read all ten pages of it but I want to make a few brief points in order that people will know what Mr. Quinn is saying in this letter.<\/p> <p>  He deals with the role of the Government contracts committee for construction and he states that, in this instance, it considered a request for a derogation for the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board from the standard form of contract.  He refers to the standard form of contracts and deals with certain major contracts.  He gives a timeline on the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and confirms he is a member.  In the first paragraph of his letter, Mr. Quinn states that he accepts in hindsight that, in his letter to the committee of 25 January, he should have advised that he was a member of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, having been appointed in a personal capacity by the Minister for Health in 2013.  He states that is separate to his duties at the Office of Government Procurement.  He accepts that the committee should have been informed in that earlier letter that he was a member of the board.<\/p> <p>  I want to highlight one or two other points.  He states that there is a capital works procurement policy and refers to the capital works management framework, which consists of best practice guidance.  As a result of this, we are asking the secretariat to ensure we have a copy of this best practice guidance in advance of next week's meeting.  We might be sorry we asked for it but we should see it in advance of next week because it is important.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Quinn also gives the membership of the Government contracts committee for construction.  There are 22 members on that committee to consider the various items.  He gives a timeline in appendix summary 2, which we will publish.  There is a summary of engagement between the Office of Government Procurement policy unit, the construction contracts committee and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  In the second paragraph, he states that, from this early engagement, it became apparent that the scale, complexity and required delivery time associated with the hospital presented a range of challenges.  We want to know what timeline was suggested in that early consultation before next week.<\/p> <p>  In the fifth paragraph, Mr. Quinn states that the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board commenced its formal engagement with the committee in May 2014 with a view to securing a derogation.  He moves on to state that there were subsequent meetings.  I do not see the date the derogation was granted, and by whom, in this memo.  I want the minute of the meeting at which the derogation was granted, who attended that meeting and the full minutes of the meeting.  There are three references to the fact that there were meetings about this matter but no reference in the document to when the derogation was actually approved.  We want that in advance of the next meeting.<\/p> <p>  I am only mentioning those items.  There are a few additional bits of information we require before next week and I am flagging those so we have them here in advance.  This is very complicated.  There is a big issue we will take up with him but, in essence, Mr. Quinn is saying that he was appointed to the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board by the Minister for Health and, as a civil servant, he was responsible to the Minister for Health in that respect and not the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  He was appointed by the Minister responsible for this and he is essentially saying he is satisfied, based on the cost overruns that came to light during that summer - and I know Deputy Jonathan O'Brien wants to comment on this - that the matter was being progressed up to the HSE and the Department of Health in a proper manner.  That is why he felt no reason to raise it with the Minister.  He again reiterates, from his point of view, that the Minister for Health is the line Minister for this project.  He is also saying he raised it with neither the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform nor the Secretary General because they were not the line Minister.<\/p> <p>  In fairness to Mr. Quinn, I am giving his side of it because there has been much criticism on that issue.  We will tease this out next week.  To be fair to everyone, I wanted to say that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022800002#C02400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1551344400,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I think it should also be noted that we do not know when the Government contracts committee for construction, GCCC, signed off on it, but we know that Mr. Quinn was appointed in July 2013.<\/p><p>While the GCCC signs off and gives the derogation, that does not give an indication or direction on the negotiations that take place beyond that.  That is down to the contracting authority, which I presume in this case in the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB.

It is useful to have an example when we try to explore how something happened.  This issue is much wider in terms of capital projects and institutional gaps.

I must stress that the document sent to members by email was a working document produced by the secretariat based on its best summation of the meetings of the committee.  I am saying this in order to inform members of the media that when they receive copies of such a document, they must be aware that it is not a document into which members of the committee had an input.  It is not an official committee document.  What was printed in the report I read yesterday may not concur with the final document issued by the committee.  We intend to publish our report on Wednesday, 13 March, having signed off on it next week.  Those who attend the meeting next week will be given a hard copy.  No further electronic copies will be prepared or issued.  Some member of the committee has acted unfairly by circulating the working document, but I do not know what I can do about that matter.  There are 13 committee members, one of whom has acted unfairly.

While we invited them to attend in order to discuss matters relating to housing, they may stay on for the remainder of proceedings.  I hope they find our deliberations interesting.  The committee has discussed the fact that provision of funding to local authorities by central government is becoming more convoluted as the years go by and we are having difficulty getting our heads around what is involved.  That is why the Comptroller and Auditor General has written a specific chapter on the matter.  Our discussion might be helpful all round.<\/p> <p>  I remind members that the local authorities do not fall directly under the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.

Programme A, Housing, accounted for &euro;1.3 billion, amounting to almost two thirds of the Vote&rsquo;s gross expenditure in 2017.  Programme C, Local Government, accounted for &euro;388 million, or 19%, and the bulk of that expenditure was accounted for in the form of a transfer of &euro;365 million to the Local Government Fund.  Programme B, Water Services, accounted for expenditure of &euro;326 million, or 16% of the Vote total, of which &euro;292 million related to payments to Irish Water.<\/p> <p>  The income of the Local Government Fund in 2017 was &euro;1.86 billion.  This comprised motor tax receipts of &euro;1.02 billion paid directly into the fund, local property tax transfers from the Exchequer amounting to &euro;477 million and the funding of &euro;365 million from the Vote, as referred to earlier.  Members may wish to note that significant changes have been made in the fund&rsquo;s income streams from January 2018 and the Accounting Officer will outline some of those changes for the members.<\/p> <p>  The fund expenditure in 2017 amounted to &euro;1.83 billion.  It should be noted that this included a payment to the Exchequer, at the direction of the Minister for Finance, amounting to &euro;230 million.  As a result, the net expenditure from the fund on programmes and services was just over &euro;1.6 billion.  Almost 40% of this was accounted for by a subvention to Irish Water.  About 38% went directly from the fund to local authorities.  Some 22% went to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for roads-related spending, and a substantial part of this was subsequently transferred to local authorities for road construction and maintenance.<\/p> <p>  Because of the complexity of the various fund flows, chapter 4 is compiled to present an overview of the level of net funding provided by central Government to local authorities, the purposes for which that funding is provided and trends over time.  Central Government transfers to local authorities amounted to a total of &euro;2.66 billion in 2017, up almost 20% year on year.  Most of the increase was in regard to housing and urban regeneration, which accounted for almost half of the transfers.  There was relative stability in the funding provision for other programmes in 2017.<\/p> <p>  Members may wish to note that chapter 1 of my report for 2017 includes a summary of the Exchequer funding provided to Irish Water.  This amounted to a total of &euro;1.2 billion and comprised payments of &euro;292 million form the Vote, &euro;639 million from the fund and a capital contribution of &euro;270 million paid directly to Irish Water from the Central Fund of the Exchequer. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022800002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1551344400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I am joined by a number of colleagues from the Department, who have been introduced.  I am pleased to have been able to facilitate the committee&rsquo;s request to have attendance on this occasion from the local government sector of our two colleagues from the CCMA, who have also been introduced.  As requested, I have provided some advance briefing material for the meeting and I will, therefore, keep these comments short.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, I should note that, in 2017, a transfer of functions took place with the movement of a number of community-related programmes to the new Department of Rural and Community Development.  A further Revised Estimate for the year made the necessary technical changes to the Estimate to reflect the transfer and also provided funding in the Vote of almost &euro;293 million for Irish Water, arising from the Water Services Act 2017, to take account of the revenue shortfall due to the abolition of domestic water charges and the cost of related refunds.  In addition, in the course of 2017, a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;100 million was approved to meet costs arising under the local authority housing capital programmes.<\/p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s gross expenditure in 2017, as set out in the appropriation account before the committee today, totalled some &euro;2.087 billion.  In accordance with Government accounting practice, this expenditure figure reflects the position after the transfer of functions had been completed and these additional funding provisions had been made.<\/p> <p>  The Department had significant achievements in 2017 in delivering on key policies and programmes and I will comment briefly on a number of these.  As the committee is aware, implementation of the Government&rsquo;s six-year Rebuilding Ireland action plan is the core focus of our daily work in the Department and, indeed, across central and local government, as we strive to make meaningful, tangible and sustainable progress towards a better housing landscape.  At its meeting on 25 October last, the committee examined in some detail housing supply issues arising in the context of Vote 34 for 2017.  The Department&rsquo;s gross voted expenditure on housing programmes, as set out in the appropriation account, totalled some &euro;1.3 billion in 2017, including the additional &euro;100 million provided by way of Supplementary Estimate that I referred to earlier.  A further &euro;98 million was also available from local property tax, LPT, receipts to fund housing programmes of certain local authorities whose LPT allocation exceeded their LPT funding baseline, bringing the overall total resourcing for the Department&rsquo;s housing programmes to over &euro;1.4 billion in 2017.<\/p> <p>  As regards 2018, gross voted expenditure on housing programmes totalled some &euro;1.97 billion.  An additional &euro;92 million was also available from LPT receipts, bringing the overall total resourcing for the Department&rsquo;s housing programmes to over &euro;2 billion last year.<\/p> <p>  Table 1, which I have circulated in the briefing paper for the committee today, sets out the key Rebuilding Ireland targets for the period 2016 to 2021 and details the progress that has been made to the end of 2018.  At the October meeting, I shared with the committee information on progress achieved in 2017.  During 2018, significant further progress was made to deliver on the commitments in Rebuilding Ireland.  In overall terms, housing supports were delivered to over 27,000 households in 2018 through the range of social housing measures in Rebuilding Ireland, significantly ahead of the target of just under 25,500.<\/p> <p>  Roughly one in four new homes built last year was a social housing home.  The new-build figure was 85% up on 2017 and eight times higher than 2015, the year before Rebuilding Ireland began.  Wider housing supply also continued to grow in 2018 with the number of new homes becoming available for use in the full year reaching 21,458, an 18% increase on the corresponding figure of 18,209 for 2017.  Significant progress was also made in 2018 in advancing many social housing projects through the range of delivery mechanisms and programmes.<\/p><p>By the end of the year, a substantial construction programme of over 19,000 units was in place to deliver further increases in the number of new social housing homes being built in the coming years.<\/p><p> While the numbers of homeless households supported into more sustainable housing continued to increase significantly last year, regrettably, this did not match the numbers of new households presenting to homeless services.  This area of our activity, working with housing authorities and NGOs, will continue to be the focus of priority and sustained attention in 2019.<\/p><p> The 2019 Estimates provision for housing amounts to nearly &euro;2.4 billion, including local property tax, LPT, receipts, the bulk of which will be devoted to the achievement of the overall 2019 target of supporting almost 27,400 households across all our social housing delivery streams.  While much has been achieved in the first half of Rebuilding Ireland in addressing the issues in our housing sector, there is much work that remains to be done.  There are demanding targets to be achieved in the years ahead and these will continue to be the focus of the absolute highest priority by the Department.<\/p><p> As the committee is aware, responsibility for the provision of public water services transferred from local authorities to Irish Water on 1 January 2014.  Detailed information regarding Irish Water's progress in delivering water services is set out in its annual report for 2017.<\/p><p> The Government decided in September 2017 that, in line with the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, all State funding for domestic water services should in future be provided through the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  These new funding arrangements came fully into effect in 2018.  As regards 2017, over &euro;930 million in funding was provided to Irish Water from the Department, made up of almost &euro;639 million from the Local Government Fund, LGF, and almost &euro;292 million from the Vote.  The latter amount comprised &euro;114 million to take account of the revenue shortfall due to the abolition of domestic water charges and almost &euro;178 million for related refunds to customers and necessary administrative costs.<\/p><p> The second year of operating under the new multi-annual capital funding framework for the rural water programme was 2017.  The new structure provides greater funding certainty for priority investment needs and supports proper planning and sustainable development in rural areas.  The Department recouped just over &euro;15.3 million to local authorities during the year for capital expenditure across the six measures of the programme. <\/p><p> The chapter of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s annual report concerning central Government funding of local authorities, which we will discuss later today, provides an overview of local authority expenditure and income, detailing the range of programmes for which local authorities are responsible, including housing, roads and environmental services, and the range of related funding sources.  As the chapter shows, transfers of funding from central Government sources to local authorities in 2017 totalled some &euro;2.66 billion, an increase of nearly 20% on 2016.  The Local Government Fund accounted for 36% of this amount.  A range of Departments, including my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as well as other organisations, are involved in providing this annual funding to local authorities.<\/p><p> The Local Government Fund account for 2017 gives details of the operation of the fund during the year.  The income sources to the fund in 2017 totalled &euro;1.86 billion, made up of motor tax of just over &euro;1 billion, local property tax receipts of &euro;477 million and a payment of &euro;365 million from the Exchequer, through Vote 34.  The main payments from the LGF in 2017 were LPT funding to local authorities of just over &euro;500,000; a payment of &euro;639 million as subvention to Irish Water, which I mentioned earlier; a payment of &euro;333 million to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for works on non-national roads and for public transport infrastructure; and a payment to the Exchequer of &euro;230 million.<\/p><p> As the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned earlier, in January 2018, responsibility for motor tax transferred to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, with consequential implications for the Local Government Fund.  In particular, motor tax proceeds are now paid directly into the Exchequer, rather than into the fund, which is now primarily a means of channelling LPT revenues to local authorities.  Funding for Irish Water is now routed through the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  Funding for roads and public transport infrastructure, formerly routed through the fund, is now channelled through the Vote of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and a payment to the Exchequer from the LGF is no longer required.  Further details of these changes are in the briefing paper circulated for the meeting.  When taken together, the changes result in much greater transparency in terms of the various flows of funds involved.<\/p><p> In terms of accountability, under the existing policy and legislative framework, the Local Government Audit Service, LGAS, provides statutorily independent scrutiny of the financial stewardship of local authorities and other local bodies.  The LGAS audits local government bodies in accordance with a statutory code of audit practice, thereby fostering the highest standards of financial management and public accountability.<\/p><p> Where the annual audit has been completed by the local government auditor, the local authority is required to furnish a copy of the audited financial statement and any associated statutory audit report to every member of the local authority for his or her consideration at the next practicable council meeting.  In addition, the audit committee of the relevant local authority will review any audited financial statement, auditor&rsquo;s report or auditor&rsquo;s special report in respect of the authority and will assess any actions taken within that authority in response to either a statement or report, and will report on its findings.<\/p><p> Scrutiny arrangements for local government were also enhanced in recent years with the establishment of the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC.  NOAC scrutinises local government performance and supports the development of best practice and enhanced efficiency in the performance of local government functions.  The Comptroller and Auditor General notes in his chapter the increase in oversight of local authority spending since 2014 brought about through the operation of the commission.<\/p><p> Further areas of expenditure set out in the 2017 Appropriation Account include, in the planning area, meeting the costs of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which amounted to some &euro;17 million, as well as Met &Eacute;ireann costs of &euro;18 million.<\/p><p> The matters I have referred to illustrate well the broad range of programmes and activities for which the Department had responsibility in 2017.  I and my colleagues will be happy to respond to questions or issues that emerge in the course of the committee&rsquo;s further work today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022800002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551344400,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I would like to put the issue in context.  This experience is right across the country in dealing with the Traveller community.  In the specific case of Limerick we have had to go through the courts to have people removed from sites.  We have had to use emergency planning powers to begin to construct housing accommodation on site.  That required case management.  I had to sit down with representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the HSE, the ESB, the Department of Education and Skills and Tusla to look at individual families.  In some cases, the scale of the problem is challenging.  Therefore, consideration has to be given to those who best require protection and support.

We have talked at this committee previously - and the Deputy has referred to it again - about the extent to which issues in the housing space and the sub parts of the housing space are all connected with each other.

From a cost control point of view, this is the real value of the four-stage approval process.

There are broad parameters that any good valuation house or quantity surveyor house could provide, so that if Ms Maguire tells the Department 150 houses are ready to be built in Navan, she is happy with the design scheme, provides the cost and states all the local authority needs is the money, the Department can cross-check it against the market through quantity surveying expertise and give the local authority the money so it can get on with it.

I do not know how a local authority sets about building anything.  The expertise is available.  We are not talking a national children's hospital level of complexity.

This issue arose when water service related legislation was before the line committee, from memory, in late 2017 and early 2018.  I think the Minister indicated that he was favourably disposed towards exploring the potential for the Comptroller and Auditor General to play a role.  Again, the Comptroller and Auditor General can either correct or contradict me on anything I say, in case I am not entirely accurate, but there are a number of complexities.  Irish Water has been established under company law as a company and its accounts have to be audited by what is called a statutory auditor.  For these purposes the Comptroller and Auditor General is not a statutory auditor.  The matter is also complex in the sense that Irish Water is a subsidiary of Ervia, the accounts of which also have to be audited.  They are dealt with in accordance with the Companies Acts.<\/p> <p>  There is a third issue that needs to be considered, not so much perhaps from a formal audit point of view but from the point of view of value for money, similar to what the Comptroller and Auditor General might do in the case of the bodies he audits.  There are value for money review arrangements in place through the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities.  All of Irish Water's operating expenditure and capital plans have to be submitted to the commission which has to approve them.  It will only approve expenditure that it regards will be efficiently incurred.  There is a very elaborate value for money regime in place through the commission.  These issues are being looked at, but that is one of the matter that obviously will need to be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022800002#U01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1551344400,"counter":582,"content":"<p>Has the Department established metrics to show that the four-stage process had led to a saving of X or Y amount of money and an increase in the number of units available, or is there any such analysis available?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022800002#U01500","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551344400,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I can certainly give the Deputy case studies, but I do not want to mention the names of local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022800002#U01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1551344400,"counter":584,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022800002#U01700","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551344400,"counter":585,"content":"<p>There was one project where, at its highest point, the budget proposed was &euro;5.35 million.

How many households are supported by the Department through the help-to-buy scheme, HAP, Rebuilding Ireland home loans, acquisitions and new builds?  I will move on to the next question if someone is getting the answer for Mr. McCarthy.<\/p> <p>  I hear from my colleague beside me that the help-to-buy scheme has been a great success.  At the time, there was much talk that it was an inflationary proposal and that it would cause prices to increase and would not be successful but I have been informed that 10,000 people have taken this up, the budget is gone and the Government is looking at increasing the budget.  Could Mr. McCarthy talk me through the successes of the parameters set at that time?  I refer to the &euro;500,000 price cap, the maximum purchase price of &euro;320,000, the five-year tax rebate period and the successes of an initiative the Department came up with.  I am trying to be positive about housing.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of HAP, I read a Library and Research Service, LRS, document because I was struck by some of the commentary here - I was not here earlier but I was keeping an eye on proceedings - about HAP tenancies.  The figures from the LRS  not the Department's figures - show that 44% of notices to quit are because of arrears where people not paying rent.  Perhaps there is something I do not understand here but a person providing a HAP property is usually a private citizen, an accidental landlord or someone in the business, who has a property.  According to the LRS the number of people being given notice to quit for rent arrears is 44%.  One can combine the next two figures.  The figure for notices to quit because the landlord wishes to sell the property is 20% while the figure for notices to quit to because of family use is 8%.  I agree that a bit of messing might be going on within that 28% but I want to be sure that the correct information is going out from this committee.  It is almost being put out there that people are being thrown out of HAP homes under false pretences and that the house or apartment is then put on the market.  Could Mr. McCarthy elaborate on those figures in order that we can get the facts out today?

We recognised that in the early years of Rebuilding Ireland, as the build programme and other elements ramped up, we would be reliant on the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and the housing assistance payment, HAP, to a greater extend.  As one looks through the six years one will see that the mix of elements changes.  We aim to be assisting more households through measures other than HAP and RAS than through HAP and RAS combined when we get to the end of Rebuilding Ireland in 2021.

I hear from real people who are renting in the real world that sometimes it suits them to move out for a few weeks.  People often move back into the same unit because if a genuine landlord is trying to provide genuine high-quality accommodation, the landlord may put in insulation and do the pipes and a tenant with whom he or she has a good relationship may move somewhere for a few weeks while it is being done and then move back.

They were being held back by virtue of not being on a statutory footing.  I have always accepted that people have to live somewhere while houses are being built.  However, the way it is playing out is perhaps the most costly way by virtue of the time it is taking.  Other funds could have been leveraged from, for example, credit unions and the European Investment Bank.  In 2021, we are looking at 87,000 households, which will be enormously expensive.

Most of the turnkey developments are three-bedroom or four-bedroom properties, which are more suitable for families.

Our development plans can then determine what the mix should be.  That plan should allow for single accommodation, two-bedroom houses and three-bedroom houses as the need arises.  That is certainly the way we would approach any private sector developers coming to the table at this stage.  We want the appropriate mix, not just what might sell on the market.

I have a general observation to make about the Department and it is nothing to do with the Secretary General.  It is a historical issue.  I will put my question by way of giving examples.  If we ask the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for the number of people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance, it can provide that information every week.  If we ask the HSE for the number of medical cards it has issued, it can provide an answer today, tomorrow or next week.  It knows how many medical cards have been issued and cancelled.  In terms of the Revenue Commissioners and PAYE, everybody can have their tax credits up-to-date on a weekly basis and it is all done online in real time.  When we come to Mr. McCarthy's Department, and this is not personal to him, I ask him to address the historical deficit, as I would call it, in that regard.  He cannot do it now; it is a long-term project.  We ask for the number of people on the housing lists and the Department produces a list once a year.  Imagine if the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection only had information once a year on the number of claimants for all its schemes or the HSE only had information the number of people on medical cards once or year.  Imagine if the Revenue said it would issue one tax clearance or tax credit certificate to last for 12 months.  Mr. McCarthy's Department is almost medieval in terms of its statistics system.  He should not take this personally.  Every other Department is up to date.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government gets its figures from local authorities.  I cannot understand why, in this day and age, there is not a standardised system in the Department across every local authority.  Let us say the Department compiles its housing list in the middle of the summer and has 70,000 people on it.  It then processes 400 cases a week in the different local authorities and 26 people are taken off the list because they have been allocated housing.  It is beyond comprehension in this century that the Department does not have a list setting out the figures for each local authority every week.  That should be available every day if the system was up to date.  I find it strange.  The Department is very busy but we are used to people having up-to-date information.  Even the letter we got today in response to the question on net need refers to exclusions, for example, duplicate applications, those already in receipt of social housing support, which is one of the issues we have been talking about, or who are on a transfer list.  The next sentence states: \"While data is not available on the numbers of households under each of the above headings ...\".  If officials from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection came in here and made comments like that, we would be amazed.  As a long-term plan, the flow of information is extraordinary.

We do not want to add it to data collection we are doing from local authorities.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the housing list, unlike the number of claimants who are on jobseeker's benefit or something like that, those are the actual people who are in receipt of it.  That would be very obvious to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection or any organisation that would be managing that.  They would know exactly how many they are paying.  We can say through the local authorities and the approved housing bodies how many households are being supported.  The difficulty with the list, and the Chairman talked about having figures every week or every month, and the reason we have to do it as a once-a-year exercise is that what we will capture every week and every month is people who are going onto the list.  We will capture some who are coming off it by virtue of being allocated but we will not capture people who have come off the list by virtue of their circumstances changing.

That is the big issue we have with this.  The form is so complicated, it can take weeks on end to process.  I have never seen an application going in and being approved on the first presentation of the form because the volume of information is extensive, and rightly so.  We did not even talk about the number of unprocessed applications that are in the system.  If this was the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the debate today would be about the delay in processing.  We did not even talk about the cases on Mr. McCarthy's desk that have not been processed yet.  I ask Mr. McCarthy to take what I am saying as referring to automation.  I am not talking about manual work.  I am just saying that other Departments are more up-to-date in that regard.

Our colleagues will be coming in as the vote in the D&aacute;il concludes.  I want to ask a couple of questions about the Local Government Fund.  A few years ago, almost &euro;2 billion was provided through the fund.  There was &euro;1 billion in motor tax receipts.  We used to have the Exchequer contribution and the local property tax, LPT, as well.  That amounted to &euro;1.9 billion in 2016.  That figure has since decreased.  It is estimated that it will be &euro;650 million in 2019, mainly from the LPT and the Exchequer contribution.  I will ask a question about the Local Government Fund before I hand over to Deputy Cassells as the first lead speaker.  In a nutshell, the bulk of the funds that used to go through the Local Government Fund are not going to go through it any more.  The main item in there, aside from the Exchequer contribution used to fund local authorities, which is something that could be done directly through the Department's Vote, is the LPT.  By and large, the LPT is the other real source of income in there now.  That is actually collected by the Revenue Commissioners in any event.  Then it is transferred to this fund before being distributed onwards.  Does Mr. McCarthy, as the Accounting Officer who is responsible for that account, accept that there might be a case to be made for saying the fund is no longer needed, given that it has decreased to one third of the throughput it had a couple of years ago and most of what is now going through the account could as easily be dealt with through the Department's Vote?

I was a long way down the rabbit hole by the end, but I was none the wiser.  We will go at it again.  In his opening statement, the Comptroller and Auditor General spoke about the &quot;complexity&quot; of the issues pertaining here.  That is putting it mildly.  I want to start by asking Mr. John McCarthy about local authority current expenditure <i>per capita<\/i>by county, as a percentage of the total local authority current expenditure <i>per capita<\/i>.  The Department provided us with figures in respect of that last year.  I want to understand this because I spent 17 years on the council trying to grapple with these issues.  I know councillors are still grappling with them.  I am sure people in certain counties must scratch their heads when they look at the real disparities between counties.  According to the 2017 figures that were provided when we were doing the accounts last year, County Meath is at the bottom of the list with a spend of &euro;537 per head.  County Meath is at the bottom with 61%.  County Leitrim, which has a population half the size of Navan, is up near the top at 118%.  I know there have been good managers in County Leitrim in the past decade or so, but that is crazy.  I want to understand how the Department is working to try to reconcile these figures.  It is not acceptable that County Meath, which has a population of almost 200,000, is bottom of the chart.  Shortly after the start of this year, my town council Bill was killed during a private scrutiny hearing.  In course of the knifing that took place at the committee hearing, the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, mentioned that the Department, in coming forward with new initiatives, was looking at the methodology being applied to all counties.

In real terms, we were no better off.

This is one of the few areas where the council has a mechanism to raise money.  I have made the point in the past decade that dependency has continued to grow at a time when there was major restraint on the part of local authorities as a result of the recession.  I am conscious that the Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018 is before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  On Second Stage, I made the point that the Bill does not go far enough and that the dependency on rates nationwide is really worrying.  IBEC has also made this point.  Many of the statutory measures being brought forward reflect things that are already being done by councils.  Meath County Council has initiated many measures and some counties would have high collection rates.  Is the Department looking at trying to increase central funding and introducing other funding mechanisms in order to try to reduce the dependency to which I refer?  Having exercised restraint for perhaps the past eight years or so, the temptation is that the heads of finance of local authorities might be of the view that, in the context of this year's budgets, they might be able to bring in more funding via an increase in rates because the new councillors may not know what they are doing.

As previous speakers indicated, the area of local government finance is complex.  Revenue does not come from one source.  When we get funding from other Departments, it is for a specific purpose.  This means that money from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is spent on roads, etc.  It is increasingly more complex and the sources, not just from the Departments but also the State agencies, be it Enterprise Ireland, through the local enterprise offices, LEOs, the National Transport Authority or whatever.<\/p> <p>  We would all have a different view of the local property tax.  It is one area in respect of which we, as a representative group, would not agree.  I have to argue it from both sides.  Having spent some time in Leitrim County Council, I am aware that the county is a beneficiary but that, for example, County Meath is a net contributor.  Each local authority has been guaranteed baseline funding and that is required in order to deliver the service.  One then has to look to at where a local authority has discretion, which is in the area of other charges.  Predominantly, that would be commercial rates.  For the past ten years, there has been no significant increase in rates.  In the past two years, some local authorities have moved to giving a general increase in the commercial rate for specific purposes, be it within their own counties.  I know that we have not increased commercial rates in County Meath since 2007.  Our purpose has been to expand the rate base rather than increase the rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022800002#PP01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jackie Maguire"},{"type":"speech","time":1551344400,"counter":977,"content":"<p>Among Ms Maguire's counterparts in the CCMA, is the issue of funding a topic that would come up at meetings, particularly in view of the fact that it is the major contributor to the finance of local government and acknowledging that there is potential to increase the rates because the good times are back?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022800002#PP01300","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551344400,"counter":978,"content":"<p>No.  Local authorities general respect the need to work with the small and medium businesses in their counties.<\/p><p>They also contribute to sustainable communities because they have people working locally.

The legislation allows for a specific rate increase for a bid scheme or whatever, or if it is to be spent on a specific purpose.  Some local authorities have had the need to do that.  It is more that we consider how we can support our local businesses, maybe by giving them incentives to pay.  That has assisted in the collection levels, which have increased.  I refer to incentive schemes to pay on time or to pay electronically over a period.  That does increase the local authority's income take.

I am using the 2016 figures to comment on the gross expenditure of local authorities.  One cannot spend what one has not got, but I refer to counties, such as the ones that have been used in the analysis that I have seen, namely, counties Mayo and Wicklow, in describing how the local property tax works.  One finds the gross expenditure tracks the same, that is, one will find areas that are quite large net contributors in terms of local property tax that have a lower gross expenditure and a higher population than other areas.  If one were to land from Mars and look at this, one would say there was something very strange and that it would not be possible to do that review without a sizeable amount of additional money if it was to be a fair review for those rapidly developing areas.

The committee was supplied with a detailed briefing document on the various Votes in advance of this meeting.  I will outline the work of my Department and its proposed 2019 Estimate as well as the proposed 2019 Estimate for the President's Establishment, the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  While I have certain responsibilities to the Oireachtas for administrative matters in these offices, they operate independently of my Department.  My colleague, the Minister of State and Government Chief Whip, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, will outline the 2019 Estimate allocations for the CSO and will take any questions relevant to that Vote following the committee's consideration of the other Votes in my Vote group.  I am joined today by Mr. Martin Fraser, Secretary General of my Department, Mr. Denis Breen, head of corporate affairs, and Ms Geraldine Butler, finance officer.<\/p> <p>  The Estimate for Vote 1, the President's Establishment, for 2019 is &euro;4.43 million.  That includes &euro;3 million for pay and administration, with the balance of funding for the centenarian's bounty.  The 2019 revised Estimate for Vote 2, the Department of An Taoiseach, is &euro;35.26 million, which includes &euro;22.52 million for staff and administration costs.  The primary role of my Department is to support me in Executive functions as Taoiseach, to support the Government and to oversee the implementation of the programme for Government.  It also supports four Ministers of State who are assigned to the Department.  These are the Government Chief Whip and the Ministers of State with responsibility for defence, for European affairs and for data protection.  The latter is also assigned to a number of other Departments.  <\/p> <p>  In addition to assisting my work as Taoiseach and that of the Government, the Department's strategic priorities are as follows: building a sustainable economy; building a better and fairer society; building strong relationships in Europe and the rest of the world; Brexit; and future planning.  The Department is also responsible for a range of other issues such as State protocol, including, for example, the Papal visit last August, national commemorations and the organisation of the Presidential inauguration ceremony and State reception last November.  The Department also engages in the formulation and implementation of Government policy and advises me on the full range of domestic policy issues and on international affairs.  An important part of my Department's work is providing a secretariat for meetings of the Government and Cabinet committees.  The Department also funds a number of inquiries, including the Moriarty tribunal and the Cregan and Cooke commissions.  Other areas of responsibility include constitutional issues, relations with the office of the President, relations with the Oireachtas, the Government Information Service, GIS, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, the Policing Reform Implementation Programme Office, the Citizens' Assembly and the Dublin North East Inner City initiative.  <\/p> <p>  Last year the Government published Project Ireland 2040 which for the first time ever links a national spatial plan with a national development and infrastructure investment plan.  It gives us a framework for future development that will enable us to grow over the next 20 years in a manner that provides for better and sustainable regional balance, less commuting and greater vibrancy in our villages, towns, cities and rural areas.  Ireland continues to experience sustainable and balanced economic growth.  Employment continues to rise and now stands at just under 2.3 million, a record high.  Unemployment was down to 5.7% in January, the lowest since August 2008.  The Government&rsquo;s focus now is on achieving full employment, that is, a job for everyone who wants one and on ensuring that the jobs created are quality jobs.  By this I mean jobs that raise living standards, reward employees and provide for protections and pensions.  Quality jobs must go beyond salary and include good working conditions and benefits, including pension coverage on retirement.  Last year, alongside the Ministers for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Finance, Deputies Regina Doherty and Donohoe, I published a five year roadmap for pension reform, including the introduction of an auto-enrolment pension scheme for private sector workers, with first enrolments taking place in 2022.  A wide ranging public consultation has been completed and the Government will shortly make decisions on the next steps.<\/p> <p>  The enactment of the Technological Universities Act means our focus is now on working with the various consortia to get these new technological universities up and running.  Project Ireland commits the Government&rsquo;s financial resources to the development of technological universities, with a particular focus on the establishment of a technological university in the south east where there is currently no university.  <\/p> <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, &euro;21.8 billion is committed to the objective of transitioning to a low-carbon and climate resilient society.  This is the highest amount allocated to any of the ten national strategic objectives of the plan.  We have strengthened existing measures such as retrofitting homes to improve energy efficiency.  We have also made major decisions such as the banning of the registration of any new non-zero emission cars from 2030 onwards and taking coal off the national grid by 2025 and replacing its use at Moneypoint with a cleaner alternative.<\/p><p>It is important to Government that gains from the growing economy and prosperity are shared fairly with all Irish citizens and felt in all parts of the country.  We want to create a society in which there is true equality of opportunity and where nobody feels left behind.  The Department supports the work of shaping and reforming public services, especially those requiring a cross-Government response, through the Cabinet committee structures.<\/p><p> Over the recent period, Government has introduced reforms that seek to improve lives and living standards.  To ensure the youngest in society are provided with the best possible start in life and afforded every opportunity to grow into engaged and active citizens, the Government launched First 5, A Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families.  This is very much led by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs but is a cross-Government strategy.  The aim is to assist families and babies at this critical juncture in their lives, create a well-functioning early childhood system and broaden the range of options for parents to balance working and caring.  As part of this, Government announced an additional two weeks paid parental leave in the first year of a child's life to take effect from November.  Government has also made significant progress in delivering the affordable childcare scheme.  The scheme&rsquo;s primary legislation, the Childcare Support Act 2018, has been enacted with work on regulations, policy guidelines and IT systems ongoing. <\/p><p> During 2018, a set of actions to improve gender equality were advanced, including efforts to reduce the gender pay gap, promote wage transparency and increase women's membership on State and corporate boards.  The Government approved a General Scheme of the Gender Pay Gap (Wage Transparency) Bill.  The Bill will promote wage transparency by requiring companies to complete a wage survey periodically and report the results showing the gender pay gaps.<\/p><p> Work on the north-east inner city initiative continues with the programme implementation board, which is assisted by my Department, meeting on a monthly basis to oversee and progress the implementation of the 54 actions set out in the Mulvey report.  The board recently published its 2018 annual progress report, which highlights some notable achievements, including new garda&iacute; assigned to the area, refurbishment works of the Lourdes day care centre and the P-TECH initiative in three second level schools to link industry and education through mentorships and internships.  The board's aims for 2019 include initiatives to improve supports for families affected by addiction and drug-related intimidation, to build on relationships with local businesses and employers to create sustainable employment and improvements to the physical environment to make the area a better place to live and work.<\/p><p> A new initiative, Better Balance for Better Business, was announced in 2018 to increase women's representation in governance and senior management positions in the private sector.  In June 2018, the Government published the world&rsquo;s first LGBTI+ youth strategy, which aims to create a safe, supportive and inclusive environment for LGBTI+ young people.  A youth advisory group was created to ensure that young people were at the heart of the strategic planning process with input from almost 4,000 young people.<\/p><p> Housing and homelessness continue to be among the greatest challenges we are facing as a Government and society.  Increasing the supply of housing of all forms is our focus.  In 2018, 21,450 new homes became available to live in, of which 18,072 were new dwellings.  This is encouraging considering that in 2012, housing output was at less than 9,000 and most of that consisted of one-off houses in rural houses.  Progress has been made but it is evident that much more needs to be done.  We need to increase this to 25,000 units this year, which is our target.  In August 2018, the Government published our Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy, which sets out a vision for the future of healthcare over a ten-year period.<\/p><p> My Department supports me in an extensive programme of international engagement to advance Ireland's strategic interests both within and beyond the EU.  In June 2018, we launched Global Ireland 2025, a strategic initiative to double the scope and impact of Ireland's global footprint by 2025.  This is the most ambitious renewal and expansion of Ireland's international presence ever undertaken in terms of diplomacy, culture, business, official development assistance, tourism and trade.  We have made considerable progress in implementing the Global Ireland strategy.  In 2018, Ireland opened a new embassy in Wellington and a new consulate in Vancouver.  Throughout 2019, we will open six new embassies and four new consulates.  We will also strengthen existing missions and expand our international State agency presence.  This increased engagement and presence internationally will enable our Departments and agencies to take on more ambitious targets during the coming years.  Also in 2018, the Government launched Ireland's campaign for election to a seat on the UN Security Council for the 2021-2022 term.  Our candidature reflects Ireland's continuing engagement on issues of international importance and the centrality of the UN to our foreign policy.  <\/p><p> Earlier today, alongside the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, I was pleased to launch the Government's new policy for international development entitled A Better World.  This policy sets out the context in which we will increase our official development assistance, ODA, over the coming years and the priorities we will focus on.  The policy restates the Government&rsquo;s long-standing commitment to increasing ODA to 0.7% of national income by 2030.  It highlights that Ireland's international development policy will focus on gender equality, reducing humanitarian need, climate action, strengthened governance and the pledge of the sustainable development goals to leave nobody behind and to reach the furthest behind first.<\/p><p> At EU level, Ireland is also actively engaged in the debate on the future of Europe where we have highlighted the need for an ambitious and forward-looking agenda.  EU leaders will discuss this further at our informal summit meeting in Sibiu in Romania on 9 May ahead of agreeing a new strategic agenda for the period ahead at the June European Council.  The EU is the common European home we have helped to build.  As a small country, our experience regarding Brexit has only served to reinforce our commitment to EU membership.  Ahead of the summit in Sibiu, it is intended that the Government will publish a statement on Ireland's perspectives on the future of Europe, which will be informed by last year's citizens' dialogue led by the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, as well as the Oireachtas engagement that will take place in the coming weeks.<\/p><p> The withdrawal agreement agreed last November reflects the Irish Government's priorities in the negotiations on Brexit.  These are to protect peace and the Good Friday Agreement and to ensure the continuation of the common travel area in all circumstances.  It sets out arrangements required to avoid a hard border on this island in light of the UK Government's own red lines and our need to protect the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union - our Single Market and our customs union.  Since the vote in June 2016, we have been very conscious of the need to ensure that the rights and citizenship protections currently available to all the people of Northern Ireland under the Good Friday Agreement are not undermined by the UK's withdrawal.  The deal that is on the table contains a commitment from the UK that Brexit will not result in any diminution of the rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  This is a firm undertaking made in a legally binding international agreement.  <\/p><p> One of the most striking things about what has unfolded since the UK's decision to leave has been the remarkable solidarity and unity on the EU side.  It has been strong and resolute.  Ireland's concerns on the Border have become EU concerns.  Our insistence on a legally binding and operable means to avoid a hard border has become an EU insistence.  In my recent contacts with the Presidents of the EU institutions last week - Presidents Tusk, Juncker and Tajani - I was again assured in the strongest terms that the EU stands by the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish protocol and the backstop therein.  <\/p><p> Unfortunately, the political situation in the UK and the rejection of the agreement by Westminster means that the terms on which the UK will depart are unclear.  The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March.  Augmenting the ongoing work of my Department's international, EU and Northern Ireland division on Brexit is the Brexit preparedness and contingency planning unit, which assists the Secretaries General group overseeing ongoing work on national Brexit preparedness and contingency planning.  The unit works closely with other divisions in my Department, including the economic division, and with colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which has overall responsibility for Brexit.  The work led by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has overseen the detailed preparations for the negotiations at EU level, engagement with the administrations in Belfast and London and the co-ordination of planning around the economic impacts of Brexit.  Across Government, relevant Departments, agencies and overseas missions have also been further strengthened to deal with Brexit.  Preparation and planning for a range of Brexit scenarios, including contingency planning, was initiated well in advance of the UK referendum.  Over the past 18 months, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade has led efforts to deepen and intensify this planning.<\/p><p>The whole-of-Government response to Brexit is underpinned by a comprehensive set of Government structures, which ensure that all Departments and their agencies are engaging in detailed preparedness and planning, including through the development of sectoral action plans.<\/p><p> While the Government and the EU are committed to securing a negotiated outcome, that has not yet been achieved and we are now 29 days away from the UK's withdrawal from the Union.  Government therefore considers that preparations for a no-deal outcome must be intensified as the risk of a no-deal Brexit increases day by day, posing unique and unprecedented challenges.  The unprecedented risks associated with the departure of the UK from the EU featured strongly in the 2018 National Risk Assessment &ndash; Overview of Strategic Risks, published by my Department in August last.  Among the geopolitical, social, economic and environmental risks identified were new risks associated with the impact of social media on public debate and elections and the risk of an overheating in the economy.  Brexit brings great uncertainty and risks which require steady and strategic management in both our policies and relationships.  We must continue to manage the public finances and protect the economy and seek new opportunities to diversify and grow.<\/p><p> Technological developments are transforming lives and driving change in every corner of the world and it is essential that Ireland should be at the forefront of these developments and engage with emerging issues.  For this reason, my Department organised the data summit in September 2018 to demonstrate Ireland's leadership in digital and data.  The summit brought together stakeholders from across the world to discuss emerging issues such as the ongoing implementation of the GDPR and the implications of artificial intelligence for society.  Preparations for a similar event in 2019 are under way.<\/p><p> An advisory group, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, is developing a vision and roadmap for the Grand Canal innovation district.  The advisory group will submit a report to the Government in the second quarter of 2019.  It will have a particular focus on strengthening links between existing multinational companies in the area, small and medium enterprises and start-ups and academic and research institutions to build a better innovation ecosystem.  The Department, in conjunction with others, is also leading the development of a new overarching national digital strategy. The strategy will set out Ireland's vision and ambition to help Ireland to maximise the economic and societal benefits from ongoing digitalisation and its transformative effects.<\/p><p> My Department also assists the National Economic and Social Council in providing forward-looking, strategic advice on economic, social and sustainable development issues.  The current NESC work programme includes housing and land - transport-led development and housing policy; social insurance and the welfare system; and towards a sustainable developmental welfare state and climate change and low-carbon transition.  The Secretary General and an assistant secretary from my Department serve as chair and deputy chair, respectively.<\/p><p> Vote 3 is the Vote of the Office of the Attorney General.  The 2019 Revised Estimate for the office is &euro;15.59 million.  The majority of administrative expenditure relates to staff salaries, which will cost just under &euro;12 million in 2019.  The next largest expenditure item is the grant of almost &euro;2.3 million to the Law Reform Commission.<\/p><p> Vote 4 relates to the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  As I mentioned, the Chief Whip will present the 2019 Revised Estimate for the CSO to the committee.<\/p><p> Vote 5 is Vote of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The 2019 Revised Estimate for the office is &euro;42.8 million.  The Estimate for 2019 represents a decrease of 2% on the 2018 Estimate.  This principal reason for this decrease is a reduction of &euro;1.54 million in input A3 &ndash; fees to counsel.  This is partially offset by an increase of &euro;540,000 in the provision made in subhead A5, for the local State solicitor service.<\/p><p> Vote 6 is the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor's office.  The 2019 Revised Estimate for the office is just over &euro;34.6 million.  Salaries, wages and allowances account for just over &euro;18 million out of a total administrative budget of &euro;20.5 million.  The remaining &euro;2.4 million is attributable to the general running costs of the office.  A provision of &euro;15.8 million is allocated for the payment of legal fees incurred, of which &euro;13.5 million is for counsel fees and &euro;1.3 million for general law expenses, which includes expert witnesses and stenographers.  The balance is for use of external solicitors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019022800002#A01000","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551364200,"counter":1343,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his presentation.

In addition, in terms of divisions and business units, the Government Information Service, GIS, has 16 staff and the corporate affairs unit has 32 staff.  In terms of the discussions we have had over the past year and a half about the Government's messaging, one of the Taoiseach's innovations on taking office was to have common Government messaging and a common banner on all Government messaging under <i>mygov.ie<\/i>.  The Taoiseach stated recently in the D&aacute;il that he is transferring this function to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  His Department still has a significant number of staff dealing with public relations, messaging, etc.  What do these staff do now that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform taken control of the spin unit and <i>mygov.ie<\/i>?<\/p><p>The Taoiseach spoke at length about housing and is obviously concerned about the issue.  What I do not understand, and this applies to all constituencies, not only the constituency I share with the Taoiseach, is that the figures published today show that significant numbers of children are in long-term homelessness.  As with long-term unemployment among young people, particularly young men, homelessness among young children is very damaging.  When children do not have a place to call their own for a protracted period, which is generally considered to be more than six months, the damage done to them can be severe.  What does the Taoiseach do to have himself briefed on the crisis, particularly affecting children living in homelessness with one or both parents?<\/p><p>The Taoiseach has said on many occasions in the D&aacute;il that he does not like the style of Cabinet sub-committees where detailed papers from various Departments or institutions are discussed.  I accept that his style and preference is to discuss everything at the full Cabinet with his colleagues around the table.  That is a fair choice.  Who in government now examines and audits the many detailed reports that are available on the devastating impact of homelessness, in particular, on children?  I note the paper appears to have a target of building 25,000 houses per annum.<\/p><p>As 18,000 of these were new dwellings, I presume the others are boarded-up houses that are being brought back into use.  The Taoiseach might clarify the position in that regard.  All housing experts have suggested that for the next five years, as a result of the backlog and the base from which the country is coming, we would need to increase the number to approximately 35,000.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach, as head of his Department, has stated that he has overall responsibility for social advancement, for people's well-being and for the headings he read out.  How does he address those matters?  Who now discusses and examines the detailed briefings on a range of issues that are provided from a variety of sources?  Those issues used to be discussed, possibly at excessive length, by Cabinet sub-committees.  In my experience, the time for detailed discussion in Cabinet is relatively short.  No one has suggested that this Cabinet sits for very long.  The general understanding is that the meetings are brisk enough, as we would probably expect.  Where does that discussion now take place?<\/p><p> It would also point to questions regarding what is happening with the children's hospital.  In the context of the Cabinet, which is the Taoiseach's responsibility, there no longer seems to be a space for those issues to be discussed in detail.  I presume there must have been some warnings that not everything was right with the cost structure and the progress on the children's hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019022800002#C01000","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551364200,"counter":1353,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  The first one relates to tribunals.  I imagine she is including commissions of investigation in that because the Moriarty tribunal is the only tribunal extant under my Department.  It is never possible to know what the final cost will be because it will depend on third-party legal fees and many other things.  When it ends will depend on how long it takes for it to do its work.  To give some approximate figures, the spend to date on the Moriarty tribunal has been &euro;65 million.  Our best estimate - it is only an estimate - is that it will top out at approximately &euro;75 million, depending on further legal cost awards.<\/p> <p>  The spend to date on the Cregan commission, which is the Siteserv-IBRC commission, has been &euro;7 million.

Again this is something we should all bear in mind.  Not a week goes by that an Opposition spokesperson or leader does not call for an inquiry, commission of investigation or tribunal to investigate something.  While they may well be merited, we need to bear in mind the time they take and the fact that they often do not give people the answers they want or need and that they cost the taxpayer a considerable amount of money.  We all need to bear that in mind in our demands for further inquiries, commissions and tribunals in the future.<\/p><p>The Deputy asked about the 20 politically appointed staff.  They, of course, are for the entire Department and not just for me.  They include civilian drivers for the Ministers of State and constituency staff and staff for the Ministers of State and also for staff for the Independents.  From answers given in the Chamber people will know the amount spent on politically appointed staff by me, as Taoiseach, is less than my last three forebears holding the office.  I intend to keep it at that notwithstanding increments, pay rises and all the rest of it that cause it to edge up bit by bit every year.<\/p><p>While I may be wrong, I believe <i>mygov.ie<\/i>has always come under the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It never fell under the remit of my Department.  It is headed up by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO.  The only role my Department had with <i>mygov.ie <\/i>and <i>gov.ie<\/i>was that mine was the first Department to embrace it and transition its website over to it.  However, we never ran the project; that is being run from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>The GIS has a press function.  It provides a press office, takes queries from journalists, organises press conferences, organises events and launches, and, obviously, is responsible for <i>merrionstreet.ie<\/i>, which is the Government news website set up 15 or 20 years ago.  We have really reverted to the previous model with campaigns - where they happen - generally being run from outside the Department from the line Department with a degree of co-ordination from my Department.  I still take the view that it would work better were it centralised, but it became such an area of political controversy and distraction that we took the decision to wind it down.  As I think Deputies will acknowledge, all the inquiries since have found that the vast majority of charges and allegations made were without foundation, but that is all history now.<\/p><p>On housing and homelessness, of course the figures for those in emergency accommodation were published yesterday, which, again, are bad and very disappointing for all of us struggling to deal with the issue but, most of all, for the people who are affected by it and who are forced to live in emergency accommodation.  On the positive side, to the extent that there is a positive side, it shows that the number of families in emergency accommodation is down to its lowest for a year.  The number of families in hotels is also down as we move more towards the use of family hubs.  However, there is nothing to celebrate in any of that.  The figures seem to be stabilising at around 10,000.  That is where they have been for the best part of a year, but that is not good enough.  In the next couple of months, I want to turn the corner and start to see those figures reducing rather than stabilising.  That is definitely where we want to be in the next few weeks.<\/p><p>I do not have the figures for length of stay in emergency accommodation.  I am advised that the average length of stay for a family in emergency accommodation is approximately six months.  I take the Deputy's point about the long-term psychological impact that stays longer than that can have on children.  However, in some cases where it is longer than six months one will find that offers of accommodation have been made but have not been accepted.  That is also part of the mix that we need to bear in mind.<\/p><p>As the Deputy can imagine, I receive many briefings on housing.  I have a big one on my desk for a trilateral meeting with the Ministers for Finance and Housing, Planning and Local Government, and their officials and advisers.  We discuss these things in different formats: sometimes at full Cabinet; sometimes at Cabinet sub-committee; and sometimes at a meeting of the three or four key Ministers, which I find to be quite useful.  Cabinet sub-committees have their value but they involve 50 or 60 people.  Sometimes a meeting of seven or eight can be more productive.  Those of us who spend a considerable amount of time at meetings will understand why that will be.  All formats are used and it depends on which is the most appropriate.<\/p><p>I also receive briefings from the CEOs of the major NGOs working in the homelessness and housing sectors.  I have been involved in round-table meetings on two occasions with all the CEOs from Simon, the Peter McVerry Trust and Focus Ireland.  I had a very good one a few weeks ago and will follow that up again later in the year.  I get briefings, of course, directly from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  NESC, which comes under my remit, has done some really good work on land use and housing.  I would have been briefed directly by NESC on that.  Obviously, one of my political advisers also follows housing and looks at a considerable amount of the reports and research that exists.<\/p><p>Housing and homelessness are two issues in respect of which we make good use of the Cabinet sub-committee system precisely because they relate to a few Departments.  I think the last Cabinet sub-committee meeting on infrastructure and housing was last week or the previous week.  At that meeting, we particularly examined the inter-agency report on homelessness because that requires a response.  We all know that homelessness is about much more than housing.  Dealing with homelessness requires a response from the Departments of Health, Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Finance, and Justice and Equality in respect of immigration.  There is a big focus on that with the last Cabinet sub-committee really putting pressure on the other Departments to do their bit and understand that housing is not just a problem for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  As there are immigration issues, the Department of Justice and Equality needs to be on board.<\/p><p>We do not know the exact figure but approximately 20% to 30% of people who are in emergency accommodation are non-EU citizens.  Some of them may not have a right to be here.  There are also issues around addiction and mental health.  Lifting people out of homelessness requires action from the Department of Health, particularly when it comes to issues around better addiction and mental health services.  We have had a detailed discussed around that issue and what we are going to do with the Simon Community, in particular, in responding to some of its requests.  There are also issues around social protection.  The Cabinet committee system is used, where appropriate.  It is often equally appropriate to have discussions with the full Cabinet.  In fact, we took that memo from the Cabinet sub-committee to the full Cabinet this week.  In addition, I meet Ministers on a one-to-one basis and on a trilateral basis, which I find quite useful.  <\/p><p> On housing supply, the Deputy is right that the target is 35,000 new homes annually.  We want to move away from what we had in the past in terms of the provision of 80,000 homes one year and 10,000 the next year.  We want to achieve a steady stream of approximately 35,000 per annum but we are also realistic that we can only ramp up at a certain pace.  There are limiting factors.  Approximately 20,000 new homes and apartments were built last year.  In regard to the Deputy's request for me to expand on those data, that total includes ghost estates being finished and voids being brought back into use.  Approximately 19,000 new homes and apartments were built last year.  The target for this year is 25,000, with a view to getting to 35,000 but we are being practical, honest and realistic about how quickly we can ramp up housing construction in a sustainable way.  Even though the number of houses built last year was greater that in any other year this decade, we think a reasonable target is 25,000 this year, 30,000 next year and 35,000 the following year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019022800002#D00400","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551364200,"counter":1357,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach made three comments by way of explanation for some of the difficulties in housing, which were of a similar shade to those made last weekend by the Dublin city manager.  For example, he referred to one of the causes for homelessness being that people refuse offers.  Another cause was that 27% of people are international people who have come to Ireland.  The figure of 27% is relatively low in terms of the number of international people who have come to Ireland in the past.  The third cause cited was addiction.  I asked the Taoiseach about children in homelessness.  I recognise that a lot of people who are homeless have problems.  As far as I am aware, the people who sleep rough and have serious mental and, possibly, addiction problems are not included in the housing statistics published this morning.  As with women in refuges, they are taken account of but they are not actually, as far as I am aware, included in the figures published this morning.  According to the Taoiseach, everything is the fault of people who are homeless but the real cause is the serious breakdown in our housing provision structure, which is worsening.  <\/p> <p>  I am glad the Taoiseach responded to my question regarding the 35,000 target.  Is there a Government plan to increase output from 25,000 to 35,000, which is what we need to do if we are to catch up?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019022800002#E00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1551364200,"counter":1358,"content":"<p>I would respectfully ask the Deputy not to put words in my mouth.  This is too important an issue to play politics with.  The cause of homelessness and the housing crisis is a lack of supply of housing and a lack of affordable housing but there are plenty of other factors involved as well.  Those of us who are interested in this area and have spent time visiting facilities and NGOs will understand that there are other factors at play as well.  As the Deputy mentioned, for many of those who are rough sleeping mental health and addiction are at play.  There are lots of people who, thankfully, are in shelters and emergency accommodation, who also have problems with addiction and mental health.  For this reason, just providing housing is not enough.  We are trying to adopt a holistic approach, particularly under the banner of Housing First, which is providing shelter and housing, as well as the additional supports that are needed to help people maintain tenancies and not fall back into homelessness.  These are the things we need to do, and are doing, around mental health and addiction supports.  We are working with Simon in this area, which is a splendid NGO in the work it does in terms of ensuring people discharged from hospitals do not end up in homelessness.  There are other initiatives around addiction in particular on which we propose to work with Simon into the future.  Dealing with homelessness requires a holistic approach.  It cannot be resolved by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government alone.  We could build 40,000 or 50,000 houses in a couple of years' time and still have homelessness because it is a social problem as well as one that is related to the number of roofs in the country.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that the rough sleepers are not included in the statistics published today, nor are people who are in domestic refuges but people who do not have an entitlement and people who have turned down offers of housing are included.  The figures will never be exact.  I do not like to get involved in statistical debate.  No matter what the correct figure is, there are too many people in emergency accommodation and we need to change that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019022800002#E00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1551364200,"counter":1359,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for making himself available today and for his extensive presentation on the Revised Estimates associated with his Department and others under his remit.  I will concentrate on a few key issues, in particular, the primary role of the Taoiseach's Department, which is to support him in his executive functions as Taoiseach, to support the Government and to oversee the implementation of the programme for Government.  Allied to this are the key strategic priorities of the Department of the Taoiseach to ensure that happens.  In terms of progress and efforts around relationships with Europe and the wider world and in regard to Brexit, in respect of which there is unanimity in the D&aacute;il in support of the Government's stance and efforts to ensure the least worst outcome emerges, we applaud and support all efforts in that regard.  We expect the Department's whole commitment to that effort and we support the provision of any funds required to ensure the least worst outcome.<\/p> <p>  I propose to focus on four issues.  I am conscious of the Taoiseach's role in implementing the programme for Government and his efforts in that regard while at the same time maintaining a sustainable economy and planning for the future.  The areas of critical importance in the public domain, in the context of the success of this Government's time in office, are health, housing, insurance and broadband.  Without getting into the debacle associated with the existing and potential further overrun in the Department of Health or by the board of the national children's hospital, the Taoiseach mentioned in an interview this morning that he found the whole episode scandalous.  What aspect of it specifically did he find scandalous?  That being the case, what actions are under way that will arrest the overrun and eradicate anything of that nature happening again and thus ensure value for money is achieved?  As has been said on many occasions, we all welcome the provision of a children's hospital and we want to ensure it is provided as quickly as possible but that does not mean we should not investigate forensically the contract provided in the first instance, how it was arrived at, whether it was porous because of the rush to get on site such that we are now being punished.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to housing, in the final paragraph on page 27 of the Revised Estimates it states that a new council was appointed in May 2017 and that its work programme up to September 2019 comprises three themes, one of which is housing and land, which is to be a transport-led development in housing policy.  How many times has this council met?<\/p><p> In the budget of October 2017 the Government set up the Land Development Agency.  I welcomed that and hoped it would be afforded the right legislation, authority and remit to implement policies that could help and assist in ensuring it made a difference.  Yesterday, I heard its chair, John Moran, say it had met for the second time recently.  I do not know when he was appointed but it was October 2017 that this agency was being put in place in the first instance.  In response to Se&aacute;n O'Rourke, when he was asked how it would help and assist in regard to the housing crisis, addressing the issue of homelessness and the huge and terrible figures associated with that, Mr. Moran said it was not necessarily his remit, job or role.  He was quickly reminded that it would not have been set up were there not a housing crisis.  Many councils throughout the country, unfortunately, do not necessarily have the capacity or the sort of professionalism and commitment to the provision of houses that they had previously.  With that in mind, this agency could have had a greater role in so far as it could have provided a vehicle for either public or private finance to engage private developers to build houses on State lands, and rent them to local authorities for 100 years, if necessary.<\/p><p> I am particularly conscious of credit unions and the role they can play.  The credit union in my county this week had &euro;285 million at its disposal; it has &euro;65 million out in loans so it can adequately cater for that; and it was laying off &euro;50 million this week and getting 0% return.  It does not have the capacity under present legislation or Central Bank rules to participate in a scheme such as this, when it is more than willing to do so and more than willing to get a return on it.  Any return would be far greater than 0%, and if it was only 2%, it would be 200% better than what it is getting at present.  I hear the Taoiseach ask what difference exists between us and the Government in regard to policies or what recommendations we are making.  That is a recommendation I made some time ago and I was given to believe we were moving in that direction, yet here we are, nearly two years later, and I do not see any progress in that area.  I would like the Taoiseach to respond on that also.<\/p><p> In regard to broadband, I am nervous that this too could end up like the children's hospital.  To date, &euro;22 million has been spent and not an inch of fibre optic cable is in the ground yet.  The Taoiseach said in response to a question in the D&aacute;il yesterday that he is afraid the cost might be many multiples of what was initially envisaged.  The national development plan provides for &euro;275 million this year.  If it is many multiples of that, when we will know how many multiples it is?  Will a decision be taken to share that information with us before the contract is signed or afterwards?  It it materialises to be many multiples, apart from the ability of the contract to deliver or the quality of it, what then happens with regard to the commitments in the national development plan?  We have yet to get much of the detail associated with the &euro;100 million that is to come off this year's spend in regard to capital development in the national development plan, let alone the spring statement that is to tell us what the story is for next year, given &euro;100 million-plus is to come off it for the next four years, in light of the commitments that have been made since the launch of Project Ireland 2040.  If this cost is many multiples of that, where do we stand and when will be put on notice as to what the consequences of that overspend is going to be in regard to the national development plan?<\/p><p> I want to raise the issue of insurance.  I am talking broadly because I acknowledge the detail that is contained with the Estimate and the spend within the Department of the Taoiseach.  As the Taoiseach said in his initial statement, the primary role of the Department is to support him in his functions as Taoiseach, which in turn supports the Government and oversees implementation of the programme for Government.  In regard to insurance, is it true to say the delay and procrastination in regard to the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill is blocking the efforts of the Department of Justice and Equality to bring forward a judicial council which might assist in regard to the whole area of insurance, which is a major difficulty for business, unfortunately, and the ability to do business in many parts of the country.  Is that the case?  I would have thought the Department would be well able to multitask and that this legislation could be brought before the House in parallel with the other issue.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach answered questions in regard to Project Eagle and the cost associated with it.  I take the point he makes and it is well made, yet there is an interest and expectation on the part of the public, further to the recommendation of the D&aacute;il, to ensure that information in that regard could be brought back for adjudication on people's involvement in it, and so on.  That was to be ready last June and we are now told it will be reporting this June.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019022800002#E00400","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551364200,"counter":1361,"content":"<p>What is that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019022800002#F00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1551364200,"counter":1362,"content":"<p>The commission of investigation into Project Eagle.

He asked me about my interview this morning on Newstalk.  I was asked if I found any aspect of the national children's hospital controversy scandalous, and I said that I did.  What I found to be scandalous was that some of our agents - agents employed by Government, albeit indirectly through the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board - underestimated the costs so significantly.  They did, and while I was not terribly surprised the hospital might turn out to cost more than we thought, I was really shocked that it was &euro;450 million more than we thought.  That was down to a number of factors, ranging from VAT to construction inflation, which nobody could have controlled, but the underestimate of some of the costs could have been foreseen and should have been foreseen earlier.  That is the element I said I found scandalous.  Obviously, as Head of Government, I take responsibility for that.  I cannot come in here and claim credit for the public finances being in balance, for full employment or for all of the aspects of the capital programme that are happening on time and on budget, whether Luas cross-city, the Gort-Tuam motorway, the schools programme or pretty much everything else for the past ten years, and then wash my hands of this.  I take responsibility, as Head of Government, for the fact people we employed and trusted to get their numbers right got them so enormously wrong.  That explains a significant chunk of the unanticipated higher cost of the children's hospital project.<\/p> <p>  As to what we are doing about it, first, the PwC analysis is being carried out to see what can be learned and also to see if there are ways that we can pare back the cost.  I am sceptical as to whether that will be possible but we have to leave no stone unturned in seeing if there are ways that we can pare back the cost of the project, provided it does not in any way result in downgrading, diminution or de-speccing of the project.  We had that before with new hospitals built 20 or 30 years ago, where corners were cut and phases were removed, and we spent 30 years adding all that back on at much greater expense.  I would only be in favour of cost-cutting if it did not diminish the value of the project in terms of healthcare and paediatric care.<\/p> <p>  The project is now very much under way.  It is something that has been promised for as long as I can remember.  It was first talked about in the 1960s, first called for by doctors in 1993 and it is now well under construction.  The first aspect of it, the satellite centre in Blanchardstown, will open to children this year, Tallaght next year and then the main campus at St. James's in 2023.  At long last this is being done, albeit at 50% more than we anticipated it would cost.<\/p> <p>  There are definitely lessons in terms of public procurement into the future.  While we have made no final decisions on this, among the areas we are examining is factoring in a risk premium around big projects when we are projecting the cost of a project.  There is always a degree of what is called optimism bias or promoter bias, where the people or the agency promoting the project will often believe it is going to come in cheaper than it really does, and that applies from all-weather pitches to major projects.  We would factor in some risk premiums around that.  The other thing we are considering is whether we should pay a bit more attention to the median price of the bids.<\/p><p>There has been criticism from some quarters that, in the public sector, we tend to go for the lowest priced bid or tend to weight very heavily who comes in with the cheapest price.  Perhaps that is not the right approach.  Maybe we should look at the median price and then give a score to those who are below it.  I will talk about that in the future.<\/p><p> The third is one that I strongly believe in and I am determined to make happen, that is, what I call a past form or public sector reference clause.  It is not possible for us under EU procurement law to ban a contractor from tendering for a job even if it has not done a very good job in the past.  I am not talking about any particular contractor.  There are numerous examples, quite frankly, of companies that have done a bad job in providing public buildings or doing other work for the Government.  I would like to see written into public procurement a sort of reference.  If the Deputy was going for a job in any office in this city or any business around the country, he would come with a reference based on what his previous employers thought about how he did.  I would like to work something like that into public procurement so that, in respect of those companies - contractors and professional services companies, whoever they are - we would be able to take and weight more heavily their previous form in doing work for the Government.  These are the kinds of reform that we should make in future.<\/p><p> The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, has done three reports relating to housing.  There is the Urban Development Land, Housing and Infrastructure: Fixing Ireland's Broken System report, which was published back in May.  There are also the International Approaches to Land Use, Housing and Urban Development and the Land Value Capture and Urban Public Transport reports.  They are all very good and worth a read.  They helped to inform the decision to establish the Land Development Agency, LDA, which I see as an ESB for housing.  I see it as a semi-State and as the Government getting involved more in the business of development, construction, building houses and building communities.  A lot of that is done through local authorities already and through approved housing bodies, but this is additional to that.  That is what we need - additionality.  We need councils building more and we need approved housing bodies building more, but we also need the LDA, particularly when it comes to high-density, high-rise sites in more urban areas.  What it will do is build housing of all sorts - social housing for people who are on the housing list; cost rental housing, which is a model that we have not used much of in Ireland, but it has merit and is going to start in places like Emmet Road; affordable housing scheme houses, particularly in urban areas where there is a real affordability issue; and houses for purchase.  However, the LDA is only getting started.

The LDA offers a vehicle by which that construct can be put in place.  It would also allow for private investment, including by pension funds.

I was on a council from 1992 on.  It is no reflection on councils' willingness to do this work, but the professionalism, capacity and expertise that they possessed in this regard 40 or 50 years ago is not there anymore.

These are the opening of a second catheterisation laboratory for the hospital, the establishment of a technological university and the development of the north quays.  These are all part of developing Waterford as the major growth centre for the south east.  A technological university can be a significant benefit to a region.  It means more students will stay in the region at least have the option of staying in it, more students will come into the region and more jobs, investment and employment will be spun off for the region.  Attending the inauguration of the technological university for Dublin was bittersweet in a way.  It was great that we had our first technological university and that it has a campus in Blanchardstown in my constituency.  However, it is another university for Dublin when there is no university in the south east.  That is why I am determined to get this done.<\/p> <p>  The major issues and hold-ups appear to be caused by differences and disagreements between the institutions that will make up the technological university of the south east.  The process has been completed in Dublin.  It is likely that the technological university in Munster will come in ahead of the south east, which should not have been the case.  The south east should have been the first region to get a technological university over the line.  I talk to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, and the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, but the problems seem to relate to some industrial relations questions and disagreements between the different sites and campuses.

I am from a county that neighbours Deputy Deasy's county and we realise how important this is for the south east.  If the university is to go ahead, it is wrong that the participants in it should be dragging their heels by not submitting the applications.  The Taoiseach mentioned a catheterisation laboratory and cardiac care.  The Taoiseach needs to consider that, in the context of the second laboratory, the argument being made is for 24-7 care.  This is an issue on which thousands of people have marched in the streets and it is worth pursuing.<\/p> <p>  With regard to inquiries, we have spent &euro;74 million and the figure will probably double.  Has the Taoiseach studied other ways of having these inquiries with the Attorney General and advisers in his Department?  I appreciate his point that Deputies ask for all sorts of inquiries.  While some of these inquiries are needed, they cannot be open-ended.  It would assist in some of these matters if the Department of the Taoiseach undertook work on devising new ways of having different tiered inquiries.  The inquiry approved by the D&aacute;il into the death of Shane O'Farrell should be a public inquiry but it has been kicked into some other arrangement, much to the annoyance, dissatisfaction and disappointment of the family.  There should be a new, cost-effective inquiry with a tight timeframe rather than going down the same old route all the time.  Has any work been done on that?

One of my special advisers has a particular remit to try to get this over the line, working with the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, and the Minister, Deputy McHugh.  I am determined that we will get it done.  It appears that Munster will have its application in before the south east which is great for Munster but very disappointing for the south east.<\/p> <p>  The Commissions of Investigation Act was intended to do exactly as the Chairman suggested for commissions of inquiry.  At one stage, we had many tribunals running at considerable cost and for a long time.  I accept that some were necessary inquiries that did good work but they took a long time and cost a lot of money.  There was a view that commissions of inquiry would work better and to a significant extent they have worked better.  However, they are also imperfect and there have been delays in many of them.  The ideal inquiry, which everybody wants, is one that is quick, takes place in public and does not cost a large amount.  I am not sure if that is achievable in the real world.  If something involves findings of fact or potentially significant damage to people's reputations, people have a right to legal representation and to recourse to the courts.

The statements are fine but, as for actions, those who are caught up in issues pertaining to vulture funds and so on have been put through the wringer.  I would love to see the Government acknowledge this in some way and in particular try to improve these people's lot.  Dealing with banks and these funds, while it is said there is protection with existing regulation or legislation, there really is not in practice.

That is a very informative report and paints a more nuanced picture than what often comes across in the media as to how vulture funds deal with debts and with resolving them.  We have also accepted legislation from the Opposition to extend regulation to vulture funds.  We also have legislation going through at present, championed by the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, requiring the courts to take many more factors into account before issuing repossession orders.  That is the work being done to extend consumer protections to people who are in arrears, to have a code of conduct for mortgage arrears, to extend regulation to the vulture funds and to require the courts to take even more into account before they issue repossession orders.  That is quite a large body of work.  We know that Ireland, relative to other countries, has a very low rate of repossession but we also need always to be aware of the bigger picture when it comes to these things.  It is a difficult thing to say but we live in a country where hundreds of thousands of people are paying mortgages and paying interest at higher rates than those in other European countries.  Some of this is down to inadequate competition in the banking sector.  If increasing numbers of people do not pay back their loans and do not surrender the security, the effect will be higher interest rates for hundreds of thousands of people who are paying their mortgages.  It will also make it much harder for tens of thousands of people who want to get their first mortgage to get credit.

I want to avail of this opportunity to say to him directly in this formal setting that the vulture funds are extremely difficult to deal with and are becoming even more difficult.  The banks are now as aggressive and as arrogant as they were during the time of the crash and afterwards.  I am talking about people who want to pay and want to engage with the banks.  In spite of what the banks would say about the engagement, the banks are not engaging.  That has been the experience of the hearings we have had at this committee time and time again.  Tracker mortgages are another example.  I am taking the opportunity to highlight these matters.  I know the Taoiseach is aware of them.  There is a different point of view, and that is fine, but we need to take into account the commentary of the individuals concerned, that is, the many thousands of people caught in bad mortgages, their cry for help and the fact that they continue to tell us that it is an issue of non-engagement from the side of the banks.  That is the point I am making.<\/p> <p>  I encourage the Taoiseach to look at the Comptroller and Auditor General legislation suggested by my party.  We have had an overrun on the cost of the children's hospital and we have issues, I will call them, with broadband.  That is not an overrun, as the Taoiseach says.  It is still at an early stage.  There is an overrun on the works on Leinster House.  This was flagged for us by the Department of Finance.  Really, it is time to update the Comptroller and Auditor General legislation to give that office a greater role in the examination of the spend of public moneys running right down through the various organisations.  If that were to be done, it would be a reform that would have a very positive impact on the activities of Government, Government officials and so on and would certainly raise the flag of value for money in this House.

However, it might be a useful additional role if the office is able to take it on.  At least we would then have a body that could look at issues such as the extra cost of the children's hospital and then come back to us and be able to tell us it has looked at the matter and that the overrun was unavoidable.

Alongside satisfying the statistical requirements of Government, the information published by the CSO is also used by an extensive variety of public bodies, businesses, third-level colleges, research institutes and the general public. There is a significant international dimension to the work of the CSO.  The EU institutions, the International Monetary Fund, IMF, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD and other international bodies are all important users of official statistics.  These bodies also have a significant role in defining and monitoring standards for the compilation of comparable information.  The CSO subscribes to the standards set out in the UN's Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics and the European Statistics Code of Practice.<\/p> <p>  The CSO net allocation in 2018 amounted to &euro;48.746 million.  The net allocation for 2019 is &euro;54.714 million.  The funding provided reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to allowing the CSO to actively respond to significantly increased user demand for the development of new outputs.  It also supports the development of the Irish Statistical System, ISS, in line with obligations under national and EU law and consistent with Government strategy for the development of trusted and robust official statistics.<\/p> <p>  As part of preparing for the census of population in 2021, the office will have to source a census processing system in 2019 and progress the development of a digital census enumerator record book that will replace paper recording and tracking.  Technology systems support is increasingly required at every stage of the production of the CSO&rsquo;s progressively more complex and varied outputs.  The funding will allow for the upgrade of legacy office systems and improve digitisation of data analytics that are aligned to both the public service ICT strategy and the Government data strategy.  The CSO will commence scoping the development of a significant new national survey on the prevalence of sexual violence in Ireland.  The Growing Up in Ireland, GUI, survey is the national longitudinal study of children and youth.  The GUI study was started in 2006 and the CSO has been requested to take over responsibility for GUI from 2023.  Planning for this will commence in 2019.<\/p><p>Since 2008, the CSO has continued to reduce the response burden of its non-agricultural business surveys, as measured through the response burden barometer.

The CSO has provided a report on this work to the cost of insurance working group and that report will be published shortly.  One of the findings relates to the lack of international precedent for a price index for business insurance and the difficulty of measuring price changes in this area.  The report assesses several potential data collection methods and outlines a specific approach the CSO will pursue further.  The CSO will continue its research into business insurance in 2019 before deciding whether to begin collecting and compiling a price index on this topic.

My query relates to one issue.  The Minister of State will be familiar with the sexual abuse and violence in Ireland, SAVI, report.  There was an announcement some time ago that this survey was to be undertaken again.  It was last published in 2002.  It is a very extensive survey of several thousand people in respect of sexual violence against men, women and children in Ireland.  It is considered a key survey by most people involved in issues relating to violence.  The CSO is taking it on.  The lead on it the last time was Professor Hannah McGee from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  She and her large team carried out an extensive survey which is well regarded by people who work in the field and is considered essential by the rape crisis centres and other bodies that provide services to people who have been subject to sexual violence.  Everybody who works in Leinster House is aware of the issue of sexual violence, whether it involves children or others, and we had a discussion yesterday with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, on the issues arising in Scouting Ireland, or other aspects of sexual violence.<\/p> <p>  The last time the survey was done it took three years, plus preparation, before it was finally published in 2002.  It remains the only such survey until now.  On balance, the CSO taking it over is a good thing and I support that.  However, I see a reference here that the CSO is simply going to commence a scoping exercise.  Issues relating to sexual violence in Ireland are very serious issues for our society so I am very disappointed that only a scoping exercise will be commenced.  CSO surveys take a long time.  Typically, the survey on income and living conditions, SILC, takes a minimum of a year and a half, and many of the changes take very long periods of time to establish.  Can the Minister of State say when he expects the survey proper to commence?  How long does he expect it to take?  How long will the scoping exercise, as it is described, last before the CSO commences the survey?  It is incredibly disappointing for all the organisations that work with victims of violence.  It is also an important survey in assisting the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019022800002#N00900","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1551364200,"counter":1518,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Burton for an important question on what is a challenging subject.  The CSO has been charged with undertaking this important work.  That will involve the CSO scoping a means of collecting sensitive personal data in a manner that is confidential, ethical and designed to support accurate and reliable survey results.  Protecting the privacy and supporting the needs of all involved must be the priority in doing so.  The challenge of SAVI is a departure for the CSO.  For the data to be robust, explicit questions regarding behaviours associated with sexual violence will have to be asked of respondents.  It will require specialist expertise and training, consultation with key stakeholders and consideration of best practice from international statistical organisations regarding the appropriate collection methods.<\/p> <p>  In view of the complexity and sensitivity of the survey, it is envisaged that the entire process of scoping, planning, executing and reporting may take approximately five years.  Exact timelines will only emerge as the scoping exercise progresses.  Obviously, we all hope that period could be reduced but if a five-year timeframe is due the complexity of the issue, then that is what will be required.  However, if it can be reduced, it will be.  The provision of reliable, robust, objective and internationally comparable information requires that the planning and execution of the survey are undertaken in a professional and comprehensive manner.  There is an amount of preparatory work to be done in regard to what form and shape the survey will take.  Then there will be a degree of training of the people who will have to conduct interviews about sensitive information where confidentiality is a must.  People will not take part in a survey unless they can be assured that the confidentiality of their data is protected.  We would love if this could be completed more quickly, but it may take approximately five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019022800002#N01000","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speech","time":1551364200,"counter":1519,"content":"<p>That is terribly disappointing.

The Act only allows for Part 9 to be commenced by order of the Minister.  As it has been more than 46 months since the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 was enacted and key Parts have not yet commenced, this amendment proposes to make October 2019 the latest date on which Part 9 can be commenced. <\/p><p>I am aware that Parts 2 and 3 are not included in this amendment and they must be commenced in tandem.  However, their inclusion would not have been permissible under Standing Orders.  Since the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 was enacted in April 2015, we have had a referendum on civil marriage equality, the Marriage Act 2015, two amendment Bills aiming to fix typographical errors and six deadlines missed by the Department of Health.  All of that has happened in four years, during which time same-sex parents have conceived and raised children and their families have not been recognised.  Some very important civil rights are absent from the family unit.  I outlined all of that during the Second Stage debate and I am acutely aware that the Minister and committee members are aware of how serious this matter is and how vulnerable it makes families.  The legislation that was proclaimed as embracing their family formation before the law has now turned into a headache and disappointment as deadlines have been missed time and time again and many delays have been announced. <\/p><p>Parts 2, 3 and 9, as I mentioned on Second Reading, were originally supposed to be commenced one year after the enactment in April 2016.  The delays have occurred and we cannot fix them now, but we can ensure that Part 9, without which this Bill is useless, will be commenced in a reasonable timeframe. <\/p><p>During the Second Stage debate the Minister said &quot;a small amount of administrative work needs to be done in the Department of Health and the HSE&quot;.  The amendment I have brought forward will ensure that this will be done in the next eight months.  From what the Minister has told us, that is a reasonable timeframe.  She will probably give us a deadline which her Department and the Department of Health are working towards.  I have no reason to doubt that but, unfortunately, too many timeframes have passed and too many deadlines have been missed.<\/p><p>This is an important amendment.

That it is the only non-Brexit Bill being dealt with in the House should show how important an impact we all believe it will have.  I acknowledge Members' support.<\/p> <p>  The amendment's effect would be to bring Part 9 into operation by default on or before 6 October if commencement of the Act has not happened prior to that date.  As I have stated on Second Stage, I have no intention of delaying this Bill.  In fact, I will commence it immediately once it has been passed by the Oireachtas.  I have no issue with the 6 October deadline - I do not know why the Deputy magically chose that date - because I will have surpassed it.  However, I will oppose the amendment on the basis that, as drafted, it would make commencement of Part 9 the sole responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who is the relevant Minister under the 2015 Act that the Deputy referenced.  The amendment removes the obligation on that Minister to consult with me as the line Minister with responsibility for the General Register Office, GRO, and our registrations unit regarding any change that is made or considered prior to the Bill's enactment.  The arrangement for consulting is provided for in section 17 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, and for good reason, as that Act covers numerous Departments and ministerial responsibilities.  Therefore, removing my responsibility over legislation would not make much sense.  On that basis, I will oppose it.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make Deputies aware of the other piece of the picture.  The commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the 2015 Act is the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  I wish to flag to the Chair that the Department of Health has indicated to me that a short technical amendment may be needed on Report Stage.  If so, I will move it.  The Department is engaging with the Office of the Attorney General to seek specific legal advice on an issue regarding the interaction between certain transitional provisions under section 26 of the Act and whether a certificate issued by a donor-assisted human reproduction, DAHR, facility to the intending parents that enables them or her to register the birth of the child born following a DAHR procedure may be required.  The advice may be that the existing provision is fine, in which case an amendment would not be necessary, but I just wanted to flag the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2019022800002#D00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1551352200,"counter":1540,"content":"<p>The Minister referred to the Bill being fast-tracked and to her hope of having it in place before the timeframe of 6 October that I have laid out in my amendment.
