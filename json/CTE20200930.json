It is unfortunate that we have the Minister for Health, the acting CMO and a number of key figures from NPHET in the same session.  This is problematic for a number of reasons.  We now have to choose to whom we put our questions; and some members only have five minutes which makes it impossible to put questions to the Minister, the acting CMO and the members of NPHET.  We are not doing the committee any service and it is bad form.  There is a conflict here in even doing this because the Minister gets advice from NPHET and the acting CMO and I do not want members to be in a situation where they put a question to the acting CMO or NPHET and it is then spun, as could happen, that we were somehow trying to play one against the other.  <\/p> <p>  There are clear lines of demarcation; NPHET gives advice, the Government has to act on that advice and senior civil servants have to implement the decisions of Government.  To have NPHET, the acting CMO and the Minister for Health in the same two hour session, notwithstanding it is impossible to ask questions, muddies the water between the role of NPHET and the role of Government.  It is bad form and a bad end to this committee; I do not say that lightly because we have done a very good job when no other committees were in place.  The clerk and the secretariat have also done a first class job, as have you, Chair.  I am sincere in saying that because a good job was done over a long period but having all of these people here today in one session creates practical problems and other issues around conflicts of interest.  I want to make that point strongly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020093000002#A00300","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1601420400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Thank you Deputy Cullinane.

I therefore strenuously object, as I have done over recent weeks, to the fact that we do not get a dedicated session with the CMO and NPHET to discuss the issue of strategy.  I really do not understand why there seems to be such difficulty or where the block is coming from.  I would really like to know what the problem is.  Every single night the CMO and NPHET do a press conference yet we have difficulty getting them before the committee once over a couple of weeks.  I just do not understand that.  It is absolutely imperative that we have an open and transparent discussion about the strategy, particularly in the context of rising infections and the hardships people are enduring.  Nobody should be afraid of that discussion.  It raises concerns and anxiety when there seems to be a reluctance on the part of somebody - I do not know whether it is the Government, NPHET or the Department of Health - to have an open, honest, in-depth discussion.  Such a discussion is not possible now that we have collapsed these two sessions in together.  Deputies will have a minimal amount of time to ask questions and will have to make impossible choices between posing a question to the CMO and NPHET or posing it to the Minister for Health.  It is not acceptable and I would like an explanation.  I do not accept the logistical argument.  As these invitations went out weeks ago, I do not accept that it is beyond the ken of the organisation of this House or not possible to have a dedicated session with the CMO and NPHET in order that we can have an in-depth discussion about these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020093000002#B00100","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1601420400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I have already expressed by email my complete dissatisfaction with this arrangement and I really want to know how we have found ourselves in this situation.  It is entirely unsatisfactory.  It is absolutely reasonable of us to expect to have at least one session with NPHET because there are endless outstanding questions about the decisions being taken.  As the representatives of the people, we have a right to pose those questions.  Various people from NPHET make themselves available very generously every single night to take questions from the media, so I cannot understand how a session here with Deputies could not be facilitated.  We spoke about this yesterday and agreed we would make ourselves available at any time, day or night, this week to facilitate NPHET for that exchange.  Then, out of the blue, yesterday, at 6.15 p.m., we got a notice stating that the two sessions with the Minister and NPHET were to be run in together.  I want to know who took that decision, how it was taken and how it was that the media were notified about this by the Department of Health before the committee was notified.  My understanding is that it is the job of the committee, not some nameless person in the Department of Health, to arrange its business.  I want to know why we were not consulted about this proposal.  It is entirely unsatisfactory.  We cannot have any kind of decent engagement with both the Minister and NPHET over the space of two hours - less than two hours now.

I make it directly to the Minister because it is the case that we were told that it was an official in the Department who was the problem or the difficulty, or at least it was alleged that that was the difficulty in getting NPHET before the committee.  There is a wider point, however, and it goes back to the fact that in the very early stages of this pandemic there were high-level briefings for party leaders and health spokespersons.<\/p><p>That is no longer happening.  No briefings are taking place on big decisions being made.  There are some for local Deputies in some circumstances but, by and large, we are not getting the level of quality information that we in opposition deserve.  This is part of it again.  It took us a long time to get representatives of NPHET to come in.  With respect to Deputy O'Dowd, I accept it is good they are appearing today.  We have a two-hour session where members who have five minutes need to make a choice as to whether to put a question to the Minister for Health or to the representatives of NPHET, which is not fair.  It is not right to put the public health officials against the Minister in the same session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020093000002#B00500","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601420400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The Deputy has made that point very clearly.  The committee agreed that we would invite representatives from the HSE and NPHET, and the Minister who ultimately makes the political decisions in conjunction with Cabinet, which is collectively responsible.  We learned that representatives from the HSE could not come initially last week because the winter plan had not been published.  They came in this week.  Representatives of NPHET and the Minister were not available last week; they are available this week.  From my perspective, it is very regrettable that we were not able to have two different sessions.  I learned last night in a tweet from a journalist that representatives from NPHET were available and would be coming in.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately NPHET, from a legal perspective, is an advisory body within the Department of Health.  The committee secretariat was in extensive discussions to try to organise the meeting, first to try to organise to have the Minister come - I welcome the Minister and am glad he has come - and second to ascertain the availability of representatives from NPHET.  As I said, I learned in a tweet from a journalist last night that representatives from NPHET would be available.  It is regrettable that we are not having two sessions.  I spent a number of hours yesterday evening in discussions with the secretariat and senior officials in the Houses of the Oireachtas to see if we could use the Seanad Chamber which is empty at the moment, but apparently there are not enough staff in the Houses of the Oireachtas to facilitate a second meeting.  I share Deputy Shortall's view that that is unsatisfactory.  Nevertheless, the witnesses are here now to answer questions.

I am joined by the acting Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ronan Glynn, the director of the national virus reference laboratory, Dr. Cillian de Gascun, and the chair of the Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group, Professor Philip Nolan.  Since we last met the committee five weeks ago, more than 7,000 people have tested positive for Covid-19.  The numbers in hospital, including in intensive care, have risen considerably, with some hospitals now dedicating multiple wards to Covid activity and patients.  Since March, 1,803 people have died.  I would like to express my deepest sympathies, on my own behalf as well as on behalf of the Government, to their families and friends.  I would also like to pay tribute to our healthcare workers and to their ongoing efforts this year in our fight against Covid-19.  Some of them have also paid the ultimate price and lost their lives while working to keep the rest of us safe.<\/p> <p>  Since we last met the committee, a great deal has been done in Ireland's fight against Covid-19.  One million students have returned to school.  Hundreds of thousands are now returning to third level education.  The Government launched Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021, the cross-Government approach to managing the pandemic for the next six to nine months.  Chapter 1 of Ireland's efforts in response to Covid-19 involved closing down much of the country to flatten the curve.  This roadmap is how we navigate chapter 2, keeping the country open by suppressing the virus.  The strategy is to suppress the virus.  It is public health-led and involves acting quickly and locally in targeting how the virus spreads in order to protect lives, health services, schools, colleges and jobs.  I know the committee is keen to discuss the approach at today's session.<\/p> <p>  There are several other initiatives I would like to outline for the committee that relate to our fight against Covid-19 in the coming months.  I am delighted to be able to share with the committee that I have sanctioned a doubling of our public health workforce capacity compared with pre-Covid levels.  Building and supporting well-resourced and permanent public health teams is vital, as called for in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  During the  pandemic these teams have been charged with critical jobs including outbreak management, clinical queries, surveillance management, the operational management of surge capacity and complex contact tracing.  They also play a key role in protecting all of us from other communicable diseases and environmental hazards.  Prior to Covid we had 254 people working full-time across our public health workforce.  We are going to double that number.  In the next two weeks, the HSE will begin a recruitment campaign for 255 staff including public health doctors, nurses, scientists and support staff.  I am also creating consultant posts for public health doctors.  Yesterday, Cabinet approved the legislation necessary for this, and I will be progressing with this in consultation with unions.  I would also like to share with the committee that I am today sanctioning &euro;30 million for the continuation of the temporary assistance payment scheme for nursing homes.  This will extend this much-needed support to nursing homes up to the end of this year.  Further supports will be examined for next year in the context of the budgetary process.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, last week we launched the winter plan.  As a result of Covid, this winter is going to be one of the most challenging our health service has ever faced.  The winter plan is one of the ways we are supporting patients and our healthcare workers at this time.  It is a &euro;600 million plan that accelerates Sl&aacute;intecare, keeping people in their homes, treating them in the community, investing in eHeaIth, providing GPs with access to diagnostics and funding 530 community beds, 57 community specialist teams and community assessment hubs.  It also builds capacity in the hospital system.  This includes funding for nearly 900 hospital beds, resources to triage Covid and non-Covid patients and additional resources for critical services, including cancer care.<\/p> <p>  Regardless of any amount of additional funding, we are faced with unprecedented challenges in healthcare in the coming months.  What we have on our side is extraordinary healthcare workers in every county, city and town, in our hospitals, GP practices, community health teams and other healthcare facilities, in our nursing homes and voluntary sector organisations.<\/p><p>The healthcare system has shown since March an unparalleled ability to respond, innovate and adapt.  We all owe health staff a great debt of gratitude.  It is that spirit, dedication and professionalism we need in the coming months.  All of our work starts and ends with patients.  We are doing all we can to support patients and keep the public safe during these difficult times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020093000002#D00200","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601420400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and the members of NPHET.  We listen to everything NPHET says.  Its message is very important and is certainly getting through in County Louth.

That is a significant change but it is still not low enough.  NPHET's message is getting through, people are listening and it is working.  That is of great importance and shows NPHET's credibility and integrity.  By coming here today, NPHET is showing where the truth lies.

Again, it depends on the number of tests being done.  I am sure we will come back to this issue again later but there is no one metric that supersedes all others.  If there was one metric, such as the 14-day incidence rate, that superseded all others, we probably would have gone further in relation to Louth in recent days.  We did not do so because we had other information about the nature of the cases in the county and we felt we could wait to see if the position improved, which it did.

My first question is to the Minister.  The HSE appeared before the committee yesterday, and Mr. Paul Reid stated that the HSE was recruiting up to 3,5000 new staff to increase its test and trace capacity.  Will this be sufficient to meet demand in the coming months?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020093000002#F00800","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1601420400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Quite rightly, there is a lot of commentary around testing and tracing at present.  First, I make the point that we currently have one of the highest levels of testing anywhere in the world.  I recently looked at international comparative data in respect of tests per 100,000 people, and I estimate that we currently rank at 12th out of 110 countries, some of which are very small states.  When these are removed from the data set, we sit in the top ten countries for testing.  The HSE deserves huge credit.  From a standing start in March, when we had no history of these types of regimes, it created, from nothing, one of the most comprehensive testing and tracing regimes.<\/p> <p>  I know people are concerned about turnaround times and it is an issue raised by this committee several times, including, no doubt, with the HSE yesterday.  We all want the turnaround times to be as quick as possible and we are constantly working to improve them.  It is worth noting that, relative to many countries in Europe, our turnaround times are pretty good.  I do not suggest they are the best but the HSE has done and continues to do a good job.  At present, we are transitioning to a full-time workforce of approximately 3,000 people.  I believe the HSE is recruiting 1,300 or 1,400 of those staff members.  This is critical work which will enable us to redeploy clinicians back to their front-line roles.<\/p> <p>  I asked the HSE some time ago to investigate additional options for increasing testing capacity further.  As members are aware, we have the capacity to carry out approximately 100,000 tests per week and in the past seven days, more than 96,000 people have been tested.  I would like to see increased capacity.  It is worth noting that this is a highly competitive market internationally and some other countries would bite our hand off for some of the capacity we have and some countries have asked us for that capacity.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to state that we also have tasked HIQA with an urgent technology review.  I believe there are rapid testing technologies available that we need to get on the ground and rolled out as soon as our experts state they are ready to deploy here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020093000002#F00900","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1601420400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Glynn and thank him for taking the time to appear before the committee.

There are 23 schools or childcare facilities where more than one student or staff member has been identified as having Covid-19.  That is not to say that there are 23 schools or facilities in which more than one case has been linked to another case as a result of some interaction within those facilities.

There needs to be a much deeper appreciation of the impact that Covid-19 is having on young people, especially those of college age but also teenagers.  I am very mindful of what form some of the social media commentary can take.  Of course there are lapses and we see things that are unacceptable but a lot of good work is also being done by young people.  I am deeply conscious of people going to college.  There are issues around them not being able to socialise and having to attend college in a much different way, which will have an impact on mental health.  There are stresses for children going to school, particularly leaving certificate students.  There is youth unemployment.  Crucially, social outlets and social opportunities have been turned off like a tap.  We need to ensure we give opportunities to these young people.  How does Dr. Glynn believe we can change the tone of the commentary relating to young people?  When will we reach a point where we can give young people more social opportunities?<\/p> <p>  In the context of the five-level plan, Dublin is in level 3 which imposes restrictions on what social opportunities are available to people.  The plan promised that we could live with the virus.  Will Dr. Glynn speak to young people today on that issue?  I ask him not to tell them what they cannot do but what they can do in their social life.  That is an important distinction to make and Dr. Glynn has an opportunity to do that today at this meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020093000002#G00400","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1601420400,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his specific question because it is probably the most important element of our response to Covid-19 at the moment.  The narrative around Covid has changed dramatically in this country over the past two months.  It has evolved into something of a blame culture in which we look for the next target or the next reason for not being able to control this disease.  The latest of these is young people.  I have been at pains for a number of weeks to point out that this disease has had an absolute disproportionate impact on the social lives, education, employment opportunities and relationship opportunities for young people.  We need to co-create solutions with this cohort of people.  They are the ones who will tell us how to do things better.  We need to work with them to find how they can socialise and work more safely.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked when can we create more social opportunities.  The social opportunities are there now but they must be done differently and more safely.  I know people are sick of it but it is the same message again and again.

We must change the tone and change how we communicate with young people, and get the message to them in a better way.  There is a role for all of us in that.<\/p> <p>  When Dr. Glynn talked about young people, I also wanted to put a question to him about other elements of society which are affected by this.  One from an economic perspective is restaurants; those which are closed in Dublin and others we may see closing in counties moving up a level.  It is hugely difficult.  These are not just places where people eat; they are places where people work.  There was a huge shock to the economy in Dublin and elsewhere before the restrictions changed.  At what point can we get to a situation where Dublin, for example, can get back to level 2?  We were told it was for three weeks.  Next week, that three weeks will be up.  What are the numbers looking like?  Is it likely?  People need certainty and they want honesty.  We said this all along.  People just want to know where they are going to be.  We are in what I call a snakes and ladders, up and down, yo-yo approach of moving between levels.  It is not where people want to be but it is where we are.

Yesterday, the HSE was before the committee.  I welcome the recruitment of 700 swabbers and 500 tracers.  I accept that it is good to have additional capacity for swabbing and, as the Minister said, the testing regime is complicated.  It is not straightforward as there is swabbing and then the testing itself in laboratories.  I believe we have two industrial laboratories and laboratories in hospitals that do the testing.  We were told yesterday there are 350 staff at the moment and that will increase to more 1,000.  That is a 300% increase.  However, if these additional staff are recruited, where is the additional laboratory capacity?  If more swabs are being done , we do not want to create a bottleneck where we do not have the additional laboratory capacity, which, in fact, will not make the difference it should.  Where is the corresponding additional laboratory capacity to meet the increase in capacity in swabbing?<\/p> <p>  I have been contacted by the Diabetes Ireland, the Irish Dental Association and the Irish Heart Foundation who said that specialised nurses, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists were seconded into testing.  Perhaps I am wrong, but I was told that some of them were directing traffic.  These are specialist staff who should be doing what they need to be doing.  Will they be seconded back to what they were doing as part of the recruitment of the 700 staff?<\/p> <p>  I will make final point on this because we do not have time to go over and back.  I was disappointed that in the living with the virus plan we are discussing today there was no target regarding the number of tests and what capacity we have beyond the figure of 100,000.<\/p><p>The Minister said he is looking for an options paper from the HSE.  It is still not clear whether that has been given to him.  We need clear targets on this.  We also need clear turnaround time targets but they were absent from this plan.

We have an existing contract with a German lab for a few thousand which we can use, but it is important to say that the testing capacity is on the island.  It is for 100,000 tests.  The additional staff the HSE is now hiring are to that capacity, so the additional swabbers are to replace exactly the therapists Deputy Cullinane talks about.  He quite rightly says, however, that we are increasing capacity further.  This is one of the efforts the HSE is going to in order to make sure we have the tightest possible turnaround times.

There are not multiple sectors of society willingly doing the wrong thing.  People are tired and fatigued.  Every one of us slips up at times.  Equally, the vast majority of people in this country continue to do the right thing.  As a society, we need every sector, sporting organisation, restaurant and business to look again, with the type of vigour and enthusiasm that they looked at this issue back in March and April, and see what more they can do.  A retail outlet can consider whether there are too many people coming and going.  A transport operator can look at whether there are too many people on a conveyance.  A restaurant can examine whether there is more it could do to protect its customers and staff.  Do we need to do more around enforcement?  I think we do.

As we have tried to get more nuanced in our approach, perhaps some of the clarity on messaging has been lost, and I accept that.

My area struggles with access to GPs because there are not enough of them.  Some parts of the constituency have very low levels of car ownership because of disadvantage, yet people are being sent to the National Show Centre or Croke Park and have to use public transport.

Last March, when we did not have enough testing capacity at all, a key point we had to keep making - perhaps this message has got lost in recent times - was that a test shows someone if he or she is positive but that, in the vast majority of cases, it does not change what people need to do.  While no delay is acceptable, and I would be the first to argue we need a faster turnaround, I contend that, regardless of whether someone receives an appointment in the morning or afternoon or the next morning, if he or she is isolating and if his or her family and household contacts are doing the right thing and restricting movement, there should not be a knock-on effect.  That is an important message which is perhaps getting lost.  Testing is really important.  People need to know whether they are positive but, regardless of whether they are, the message on what they should be doing while waiting for a test needs to be circulated.

The committee has not really considered chapter 3.  Reference was made to chapters 1 and 2.

In the very early days of the AIDS epidemic, the approach was based on closing facilities and it often involved stigma.  Eventually, it became about education and safe practice.

NPHET's view at present is that it would not be the highest priority in terms of the deployment of our testing capacity.  However, I refer the Deputy to a major event or progress happening in foreign travel in that, as I am sure he is aware, we have agreed to move towards the European Commission's system for the EU, which, essentially, will be a traffic lights system.

People may not have symptoms, yet they are spreading the virus.  We are all agreed that we need fast test turnaround and extensive swabbing.  The WHO and a number of First World peer countries have all introduced point-of-care antigen testing.  I know NPHET has examined this.  What is its resistance to introducing point-of-care antigen testing in addition to the PCR test activity we are already undertaking?  The turnaround times can be as low as 20 minutes and the costs are a fraction of PCR testing, at about &euro;5 for an individual test.

For clarity, NPHET has absolutely no resistance to the introduction of any tests that have an evidence base behind them.  I look forward to the day when we can utilise, on a mass basis, an antigen test.  We have asked HIQA to update and look at the evidence around all rapid testing technologies and we expect that to come to NPHET next week.

At the moment we have the most accurate, specific and sensitive test in real time, namely, PCR, and we have available testing capacity.  Is there a role for a less sensitive and specific test?  Yes, there may well be.  It is primarily recommended at this point in time for use in low and middle-income countries where access to PCR is not readily available.  It is also not routinely recommended for use in the screening of asymptomatic individuals purely because the test performance is not yet proven.<\/p> <p>  We continue to keep antigen tests under review and will start evaluations on the island within the next couple of weeks.  It is a component of the testing armoury that could be used in an outbreak setting.  The reduction in sensitivity with antigen testing needs to be compensated for in some way.  The way that can be done is through frequency of testing, that is, retesting the same individual on a repeat basis, or by the amount of tests that are carried out.  For example, if 20 or 30 individuals who are sick in an outbreak setting are tested, it is very unlikely that there will be false negatives in all of those individuals.  Another way to compensate is by retesting an individual with PCR.  At this point in time, antigen testing will not supplant PCR.  As I said, it is complementary and, as Dr. Glynn said, we look forward to the day that we can use it as an adjunct to our existing testing strategy.<\/p><p>Rapid tests are available across our hospital laboratory network and in the community laboratories for use on an as-required basis.  For example, in the situation where somebody is admitted to hospital and needs to go to emergency surgery and needs a SARS-CoV-2 test before he or she can have that surgery, rapid testing is available.

When will consideration be given to locking down based on a case rate per 100,000 people in a local electoral area, which I understand is being done in parts of the Continent?

My first question is open to answer by anybody on the panel.  Earlier, Deputy Mick Barry touched on an interesting scenario.  I live in the constituency of Cork South-West, which has a geographical spread of 150 km, which is massive.  As Cork is far bigger than any other county in Ireland, surely it has to be looked at differently.<\/p> <p>  I heard the Taoiseach say in the last week that rising numbers of Covid cases in four named counties were on a citywide rather than a countywide basis.  The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, on Sunday reverted and spoke of counties Cork, Galway, Waterford and Kildare, such that he is looking at cases on a county-wide basis.  As I said the Taoiseach appears to be looking at it from a city-wide basis.  We had one, which is one too many, Covid case in Cork University Hospital last weekend.  In a situation where, say, Bantry, Kinsale or Castletownbere is Covid-free and there are, unfortunately, a high number of cases in the city, is it proposed to lock down the county?  I had business owners of restaurants, cafes and so on contacting me last night asking if they should order stock for the weekend or not.  I cannot answer that question.  Business are concerned they will have to close.  They know there are few or no Covid cases in their town and that they have been meticulous in managing their businesses but they are seriously concerned.  It must be borne in mind that a geographical spread of 150 km is massive.  County Cork is slightly different to any other county in the country.  I ask the witnesses to explain how they can justify the lockdown of, say, Clonakilty because there is a high number of cases in Cork city.  As I said, the county area has to be looked at differently.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to ask about rapid testing.  I called on the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, to set up rapid testing in our airports but that was not done because he said there was of a cost factor.  I accept that but the situation is costing the country far more now.  How far ahead are we with rapid testing in our airports in order that they can fully reopen?  I know that rapid testing is not 100% foolproof but it at least offers some proof.  I would like to also comment on the community hospitals in west Cork.  I have been told that, unfortunately, they are taking in fewer patients and consequently, nursing homes are being forced to take in more people.  I do not see the sense or the logic in that.  I would welcome answers to those questions.<\/p><p>Is it a fact that some counties are getting people for Covid tests who are from other counties?  If one of those people tests positive for Covid is that case attributed to the area that the person came from or is it being added to the area where the test was done?  Could it be happening in Cork that where other counties may not have the facilities to test, when there is a positive case it is added to the Cork list?  That is a very serious worry.  It may not be the case but certainly the 150 km spread in our county has to come into call here somewhere.  Businesses are shutting down all over west Cork and there is worry that there might be a further shutdown.  I can quite understand if there is an increase in cases but it cannot be a situation where some areas have an increase and more areas do not yet they are all pushed under the one category.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020093000002#Q00400","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601420400,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I will start and will then ask Dr. Glynn to come in on the rationale for counties and not smaller areas.  It is a very fair question.  In my own county, for example, there is a very similar situation.  We have a very high prevalence in the north of the county and a very low prevalence in the south and west of the county.  People are understandably asking if we can do it by town, village or electoral district.  There is no right answer to this.  There are good reasons which Dr. Glynn will go into.  If I can just draw the Deputy back to Kildare, Laois and Offaly, when the measures were introduced in those counties a lot of people very understandably made exactly these arguments.  In Kildare, for example, people were saying it was not in the north east where there is a very close connection with Dublin and asking if the restrictions could be more localised.  People in Laois were saying the meat processing plants were not there.  NPHET's recommendation to Government was for the counties, for many of the reasons Dr. Glynn can go into but partly because while people may have worked in the meat processing plants, they were living and socialising and mixing right across the three counties.  Similarly, in the north east of Kildare right now, in that electoral district the incidence rate per 100,000 of population is now north of 300.  What worked at the time was that thanks to the efforts of the people in those communities, the rates did come down although they actually went up right across the other side of the Dublin border.  It is very frustrating.  I would just say to the Deputy that the evidence we have from the work of Kildare, Laois and Offaly and the efforts those communities made, shows that the county-by-county approach, while it can be very frustrating, has worked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020093000002#R00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1601420400,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations and for the work they are doing.  On the long-term planning, we have had a huge increase in population in the Cork area.  Our hospital services are not able to cope with the demand.  In the context of Covid, can the Minister tell me if there has been any engagement with the private hospitals in Cork as regards accessing facilities?  For instance, I refer to accessing facilities in the Mater private hospital whereby the consultants from CUH were able to do day case procedures in gynaecological services and were able to significantly reduce the numbers on the waiting lists.  Has there been engagement with the private hospitals about getting access to services?  It is not necessarily about the private hospitals doing the services but that the consultants who cannot get operating space in, say, CUH or the other two hospitals would have access to other facilities to do the necessary, especially in respect of elective surgery and day case procedures.<\/p> <p>  For the Department of Health, the HSE and all those involved in responding to Covid it is in the here and now and is changing by the day.  However, we also need to do long-term planning.  Where are we in respect of the elective hospital for Cork?  My understanding is that the South\/South West Hospital Group has made a submission to the HSE at central level but the HSE has not sent the information on to the Department.  Perhaps that would be clarified.  Why is there a delay?  Even if we identified a site today, to go through the planning process and get it built and delivered would take another three to four years.

We know we were detecting one in three cases of the virus.  The mortality rate for those aged over 75 since August is 5%.  Let us be clear that we are seeing very few cases in older people yet, but the risk of those people dying when they catch the virus remains very high.  It was artificially high back in April and May, because we were not detecting mild or moderate disease in those older people.  Now that we are detecting the vast majority of cases, we are seeing something close to the true infection fatality ratio of approximately 5%.  It would be very dangerous, therefore, to underestimate the capacity of this virus to kill people when it infects them.<\/p> <p>  We have seen 269 hospitalisations since the beginning of August.  Of those, 153 patients are aged under 65, and 56 are under 40.

Those restrictions have a major impact on everybody's life, the ability to visit relatives in nursing homes and everything else.  People are struggling with this.

The disability providers are doing an extraordinary job in making services available.

Despite their best efforts, and financial support from Government, it simply is not possible for them to ramp back up.  Some of the providers told me that it will require a vaccine and we will need to move to a post-Covid world before they can resume being fully operational.  Along with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, I want to ensure those challenges are considered as part of the Estimates process because we will need to do everything we can to support these providers.

Yesterday, I asked a question and it is important that we get more information on this.  In respect of PCR testing, we were told that there is a number, albeit a small number, of false positives.  There are also false negatives, which, I have heard from various doctors, are a bigger problem.  Then there is the issue, we were told yesterday, that the testing picks up incidents where people have had Covid-19 in the previous weeks or months and are no longer infectious.  Could the Minister reply in writing as to what percentages he thinks are false negatives and false positives, and the numbers detected who have had Covid-19 in the past and are no longer infectious?  It is important that some shape be put on that.<\/p> <p>  The HPSC confirmed that if somebody is brought to hospital, for example, because he or she breaks his or her leg on a sporting field, and tests positive for Covid-19, obviously that person has to be segregated from the rest but he or she is also counted as somebody who is hospitalised with Covid-19, correctly so.  It is important that we get some indication, although I appreciate it will change from week to week and day to day, of approximately what percentage of people who are admitted with Covid-19 are hospitalised for the primary reason of treating the virus rather than some other condition.  Likewise, in the context of people who die, for example, as a result of a heart attack but who have been asymptomatic of Covid-19 and it has not been an issue, they are counted as deaths resulting from Covid-19 until a coroner's report determines otherwise.  Again, if we have any idea of the percentages they represent, that would be important.  Could the Minister provide that information in writing so that Deputy Shortall can ask a couple of questions?  Unless, that is, he or Dr. Glynn have very ready answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020093000002#Z00500","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1601420400,"counter":252,"content":"<p>We can provide the answer on PCR in writing.

These issues all relate to transparency.<\/p> <p>  I very much agree with the point the Chair made.  As representatives of the people, we should be supporting what the witnesses are doing but the actions they are taking have to make sense to us.  We have to be provided with the underlying evidence which supports the decisions.  That is not always the case.  What we discovered a couple of weeks ago in terms of the lack of contact tracing back more than 48 hours was a bit of a watershed and caused much concern.  If decisions are being taken on the basis of the evidence, then the evidence must be provided.  I have been saying from the very beginning that all of the data, and there are vast amounts of it, should be open source.  I have to say I have had the experience over the past six months or so, along with other Deputies and many in the media, of going to great lengths to try to get my hands on basic information.  That should not be the case.  The more information people have, the better informed they are and the more some of these decisions can make sense.<\/p><p>We had the conversation at the start this meeting.  I am really concerned now that there will not be a forum, however unsatisfactory, for getting access to that data.  I encourage all of our witnesses to make that data available.  The Minister said that data is now provided on cases on an electoral division, ED, basis.  It is not, actually, as I have been looking for that for months.  It is provided on a local electoral area, LEA, area basis rather than an ED.  I cannot understand why it is not provided on an ED basis.<\/p><p> It would again help to get the message across to people that in our local area of, for example, Santry or Stillorgan, these are the rates and we have to work together to get them down.  That would help to achieve buy-in from the public which is really important together with the whole issue of transparency.  I hope that there will be a change in approach to public representatives because it has not been satisfactory to date.  <\/p><p> I raised earlier with the Minister the question of the status of the workforce that will be recruited for testing and tracing.  We are talking about a very large number, 3,500, employees and I asked whether they will be temporary contracts or what their status will be.  <\/p><p> Coincidentally, after I left here earlier, I looked at a reply that I got this morning from the HSE which is talking about recruiting a permanent workforce.  I am concerned about that.  Can I have a complete breakdown of the proposals for the recruitment of that workforce?  It does not make sense that it should be a permanent workforce.  Hopefully, there will be other developments which will negate the need for that level of staffing.<\/p><p> The other point is that the HSE spoke to me in that reply about leveraging existing community services.  I would be nervous about that.  The existing community services, as we all know, are very inadequate, whether that is the number of GPs or therapists, and there are long waiting lists for all of those community services.  I hope that the HSE will be looking at arrangements so that the existing level of provision of community staff would not be impacted.  In that regard, what consideration-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020093000002#Z01800","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601420400,"counter":266,"content":"<p>We only have five minutes remaining, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020093000002#AA00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1601420400,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Is that generally, Chairman?<\/p> <p>  The HSE is talking about bolting the testing and tracing on to community services.

There is a growing narrative that if we had just one more data point or piece of information that we would be able to control this in a better way.  There are acres of data out there.  Every time we make a set of recommendations, the data upon which we make those recommendations is published within hours of a Government decision.  The reason that we do not publish at ED level is that, as of a couple of weeks ago, there was nowhere in Europe publishing data at an ED level.  We engaged extensively with the CSO to find the lowest level that we could publish on which that office would be confident would not be breach confidentiality or have unforeseen consequences.  That level was LEA.  I do not believe that there is anybody in this country, if they are really interested in what is happening in their area, who cannot go online and see data.  There are acres of data on the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HSPC, website.  We publish data on hospitalisations, intensive care, deaths and underlying conditions.<\/p><p>On one hand, we are being told we need to stop the daily briefings because we are worrying people and giving too much information.  On the other side, we are being told we are not giving enough.  We have to manage a pandemic in the middle of this.  I contend that there is no lack of data.  That is not the issue when it comes to managing this.  It is for certain sectors which are looking to postpone what they might have to do to take on their share of what needs to be done.  However, there is more than enough data on this pandemic at this point for every sector and every part of this country to know what to do to protect itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020093000002#AA00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ronan Glynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601420400,"counter":273,"content":"<p>One area on which there is a lack of data, and this is not a Covid issue and does not fall within NPHET's responsibility, is the national self-harm registry.

I indicated that we were launching the winter plan the following day and, as such, it would be difficult for us to appear on that day, particularly with just three days' notice, but we would immediately make ourselves available again whenever the committee wanted.
