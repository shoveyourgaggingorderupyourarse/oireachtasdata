I set out a very clear amendment aimed very specifically at assuring the public about how the Government might respond to the collection of a carbon tax.  From my point of view, I have supported a carbon tax and I acknowledge, accept and appreciate the advice that was given at the Citizens' Assembly and, indeed, that of the Climate Change Advisory Council.  In conjunction with setting out the trajectory and the numerics, it is important to set out information for the people who will be most affected by the increases in carbon tax, which I and my party accept fully are a necessary component to assist in the behavioural change to wean this society off fossil fuels.  What we do not accept is for the committee to decide on this now without assisting the information deficit among the public and of people who will recognise the impact of an increase on them, particularly on those in the category of fuel poverty who will not be in a position to do a deep retrofit or insulate their home.  All this amendment presents them with is a tax and a charge but they are not being given any significant outline of what it is that the Government intends to do, or what we are suggesting from a committee perspective, to assist them in meeting those increased charges.  It is important that we do this in step and in parallel and I am not prepared to accept the amendment until such time as the work is done in setting out in a very clear and concise way how we are going to assist people in making that transition away from fossil fuels.<\/p><p>I accept that it is happening and I support the principles but it is not good enough to just talk about a tax on the one hand while on the other hand not to talk in any meaningful way about the capacity to assist people, particularly those experiencing fuel poverty, to whom I referred, and those who are struggling to pay their mortgages and their rent.  We must set out in a very clear way how we will assist them in the transition away from fossil fuels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019032700002#M00400","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553695200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>We need to be careful about what this amendment is about.  It is about multiplying by four the carbon tax that we have at the moment, from &euro;20 per tonne, which brought in about &euro;450 million in the past year, to &euro;80 per tonne.  This is happening without any consideration for the impact it will have on low and middle income households or, indeed, on businesses and on rural dwellers, in particular.  What we are doing here if we go ahead with this amendment is that we are simply loading on another layer of tax on top of citizens who are already under serious pressure with mortgages and all the other increases in charges that they have as well.  We are doing it without any firm international evidence that can show that this has worked.  We are also doing it without having the alternatives available for citizens to make the transition.  We want citizens to make the transition to more eco-friendly living in using public transport and electric vehicles.  We do not even have the network for charging electric vehicles and there is an affordability issue with them.  There is the issue of public transport, which, outside the M50, does not exist in most of the country.  The poorest and the lowest income households in this State are those that most need retrofitting.  On microgeneration, I have a Bill sitting on Committee Stage that needs to be progressed to allow citizens, small businesses and householders to generate electricity.  We are doing it at a time when we have not made a switch in how we generate our power.  If we are going to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, we are talking about the electrification of our heating systems and of large parts of our transport systems and we have not made any changes in how we generate that power, except to continue to do so mainly from fossil fuels.  Our party has put forward proposals on that to move to 80% renewables by 2030.  For those reasons, we will be opposing this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019032700002#N00200","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1553695200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I will try to keep members' contributions to two minutes each if possible.

While, by and large, there is a recognition of the &euro;80 per tonne by 2030, which was set out by Professor FitzGerald and others, there is also a need for actions built into the recommendations of this committee to ensure there are plans to ensure that funding is put in place to protect those people who are in fuel impoverished households and, in particular, those who are on low incomes.  We are all very mindful of that.<\/p> <p>  I seek clarification from the Chairman on what is actually before us as an amendment.  As I understand it, we are to divide on one element of the recommendation, namely, the word \"accepts\" versus \"agrees.\"  In other words, we either accept the expert advice in favour of this measure from the CCAC for a carbon price trajectory that rises to &euro;80 per tonne by 2030 and that this should be supported in legislation by 2019.  The rest of the wording of that paragraph speaks to the issues here in supporting Citizens' Assembly, recognising the negative impacts for people who are on lower incomes and so on, accepts the international consensus around the need for behavioural change and increased investment towards mitigation and away from fossil fuels and agrees that carbon pricing should be ring-fenced.  The clarification I am seeking is on whether we are dividing on the issue of whether we accept the 2030 target, as set out by an independent body outside of this House, or whether we can find a mechanism to recognise that target and not divide the committee.  There may be a compromise.  Instead of using the word \"accepts\" for the expert advice, perhaps we could say that we \"recognise\" the expert advice of the CCAC for a carbon price trajectory.  Therefore, we would be acknowledging the outside expertise on this issue and we would be obviating the need to divide the committee on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019032700002#N00400","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1553695200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I want to clarify the amendment to the amendment that Deputy Corcoran Kennedy has put forward.

Those are the three key points, namely, that: it accepts the advice rather than acknowledges it; that the carbon price would be set at &euro;80 per tonne by the year 2030, which is in 11 years' time; and that this should be supported by legislation in 2019.

It is important that the committee starts to take responsibility.  We have been here since last July, we have engaged quite constructively over recent weeks and months and the engagement has been particularly intense in recent weeks.  It is about taking responsibility now.  The time for talk is over.  We have all engaged with those in our constituencies and at local and national levels, particularly with children and students in recent weeks.  They want us to take action and they expect us to take action on this.  While it is easy for some of us to say we will do this, that and the other in the media and elsewhere, now is the time for action.

We are playing catch up in this regard.  There is a great cost to this and somebody has to pay for it.  We have been down the road with different issues in the past where expenses were involved and members of other committees did not take responsibility.  We will see the end result of that over the next period of time because of certain members who spoke quite loudly and were prepared to bully members into making decisions and frighten members in respect of different decisions but now is the time that we stand up and take responsibility for our actions.

The words of the proposed amendment appear innocuous enough when looked at in black and white and one could say the amendment is acceptable.  However, we also have to consider how little the Government has done in recent years.  There has been no clarity on what it will do about the carbon price, which stands at &euro;20 per tonne.  My problem is that I do not trust this Government and would not trust any other Government enough to give it <i>carte blanche <\/i>to increase the carbon price to &euro;80 per tonne immediately.  It is vital that we retain ownership of the figure of &euro;80 per tonne and tie it in specifically to measures that will help those who cannot afford to meet the requirements imposed by climate change.

Since January, we have been meeting in private session to try to achieve cross-party political consensus and produce a powerful all-party report.<\/p> <p>  The children who went on strike from schools and marched on the D&aacute;il and in my constituency were saying we need action.  I explained to them that this committee is important because when members reach an agreement across party lines it carries considerable weight and gives the Minister of the day significant power to act upon its recommendations.  It is easy to get consumed by the knowledge that the Minister is from the Fine Gael Party but we could have a Fianna F&aacute;il, Labour Party or Sinn F&eacute;in Minister dealing with these issues tomorrow.  I guarantee that we will have Ministers from other parties before 2030.  That is the nature of politics.  If we look back 11 years, Ministers have changed and they will change again in the future.  We should not become fixated on who is in government and whether people trust it.  The issue is this committee, as an all-party group, agreeing what is the best way forward.  That gives us considerable power and we should not underestimate that.<\/p> <p>  It is disappointing that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party amendment proposes to acknowledge rather than accept the need for increases in the carbon tax.  Deputy Dooley states he wants an increase in carbon tax but his party, in this amendment, is watering down the wording of the recommendation by using the word \"acknowledge\" rather than \"agree\".  This removes the proposed trajectory for the carbon tax increase, which would give absolute certainty to individuals and businesses and give them a roadmap showing how we would reach a figure of &euro;80 per tonne by 2030.<\/p> <p>  A key point to remember is that this is not a revenue-raising tax but a means of achieving behavioural change.  If we remove the trajectory and tell people where this carbon charge will go, we will not achieve the crucial change in behaviour we are trying to bring about.  It will be a fudge and the other positive elements of the report will get lost because the headline will be that the committee was not brave enough to set out a trajectory for carbon tax.<\/p> <p>  I do not have a problem with ring-fencing revenue generated from increases in the carbon tax.  We should discuss how such ring-fenced money could be spent but I question the view that we can dictate now how everything will be spent when we do not know what will be the spending plans of Governments of whatever parties in 2026 or 2027.  That is where consultation is key.  Fine Gael has been passionate about getting buy-in on carbon pricing.  In the next two or three months, we intend having engagement, which will be led by the Department and involve town hall meetings being held across the length and breadth of the country.  Every Tidy Towns group, local executive of the IFA or ICMSA and all other sectors of society impacted by this would have their say on how best to use an increase in the revenue raised to achieve behavioural change.  That is what we need to do.  Removing the proposed trajectory for increases to the carbon tax would weaken and water down the report and would be a retrograde step in the context of all the work we have done since July last.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019032700002#O00300","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speech","time":1553695200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>If members of the public are confused about the reason the discussion has started on this issue and the way we are discussing it, I do not blame them because I am also confused.

That is what is being said to us in different ways here about carbon tax by both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  Nobody should be fooled by this dancing on a pin about words such as \"accept\", \"acknowledge\", \"believe\" or anything else.  This is about implementing a carbon tax on ordinary people that will rise fourfold in the next ten years without taking into consideration the circumstances in which they live.  People living miles away from their workplace are forced to drive into work because we have poor public transport services.  Others live in substandard accommodation that is damp, does not have double-glazing, has doors that do not fit or where there is no retrofitting and the occupant cannot afford to lag the attic.  This goes on all over this country.  I have an amendment proposing that Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il look at the fuel poverty in which people live before they even consider having this discussion.  It is disingenuous and disrespectful of the Citizens' Assembly to say to the public that we must sort out this before we sort anything else out.  It is unbelievable.

We have been working on this issue of climate action for the past seven months and, as we all know, we are under time pressure.  The clock is ticking on how we deal with climate change.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, is waiting on our cross-party report to feed in to his whole-of-Government plan.  The reason we opened in public session on this issue was that we were to go into public session today and tomorrow and have a report published tomorrow.  There was one issue that came up at very late notice last night and again this morning which created an obstacle.  We had to overcome that stumbling block if we were to publish tomorrow.

It almost seems inevitable that the issue of carbon taxation dominates.  Certainly it is the first question that is always asked and then one does not get onto the wider work.  It is important that we do so.  I support the amendment because I want to keep that certainty in the ten-year period in order that we can start concentrating on the matters on which we really need to concentrate and on the big ticket items we need to get right.  The committee has done really good work on setting a higher renewables target of 70%.  The Government has responded to this and it was not going to do that at all.  What we have said about needing a national land use plan is significant and important in terms of helping with the revised Common Agricultural Policy and a completely different future for Irish forestry and farming.<\/p> <p>  We must consider the scale of the change we need to make.  We are all in favour of retrofit but we should recognise that the national development plan, which will have to change, states that by 2021 we will be deep retrofitting 45,000 houses to a B rating or higher.  Last year we did 220.  How will we go from 220 to 45,000 in two years?  We do not have the workers or the financing mechanism set up.  There are so many things we must do and it requires the political system.  As we will not put the blame or guilt on the individual, it is up to us in the political system to work together collectively to make this transition.  Irish people will be, can be and want to be good at it.<\/p> <p>  Carbon tax will not be the key measure but it will help.  We heard research from UCD environmental policy masters students who are reviewing the literature that it will depend on what level it is set at but it could achieve 5%, 10% or 15% of the job.  The analysis we got from the ESRI is that if we use the fee and dividend model, it would give an emissions reduction of approximately 17% by 2030.  This is not exact but they are our best independent scientific experts who have applied their best independent thinking to come up with this figure.  It could be lower or higher but it is not insignificant.  It would help a country facing fines of &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million a year.  The Irish public would really find us guilty if instead of going into social welfare, housing, health and education, money was going out of the country because we failed to take the type of action we need to take.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Dooley made a good point yesterday but he was reiterating the point we have all been making throughout the process, which is that if we are going to do anything on carbon tax, we have to make sure we do everything we can to protect those on lower incomes.  There are different views as to how we could and should to that.  My understanding is we have all pretty much agreed that we need to spend the next four or five months working out with the Government the best way of doing this.  We need to do this because by the end of this year, we as a country need to go to the European Union and agree a plan that is real and justiciable, in the sense the European Union will hold us to account on it.<\/p> <p>  The wording here is \"acceptable\", in that the word \"accepts\" is not as strong as the word \"agree\" that we had earlier but it accepts the expert advice.  It accepts what we heard from the Climate Change Advisory Council, which is our best independent adviser on the issue, on what we need to do.  We are saying we will do it gradually.  We will need to do a whole body of other work after that.  I will be honest and say we will not get it all done in the next six months and we will probably not even get it done in six years.  This will be a two or three-decade project of massive ambition, transformation and transition for our country that, first and foremost, has to be a just transition.<\/p> <p>  I would love to have a debate such as the one we are having on that just transition, forestry and transport.  My God, we need to talk about transport.  We are still heading completely in the wrong direction.  Our entire transport plan has to change.  A carbon tax will not do this; it will require political decisions of the Government to make it happen.  However, we can start concentrating on it when we get over this issue that is dominating.  It is the only issue ever discussed.  Agreeing the amendment will not provide certainty because we are not agreeing the budget here but it will give a political signal and allow us to concentrate on what we need to concentrate on, which is how we protect those on lower incomes, transform our transport system, tap into the energy potential we have as a country and retrofit our homes.  These will not be easy but they are doable.  However, they will not be doable if we just break down on this issue at the very start.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith that it should not have been given such prominence.  It should not be first up.  Unfortunately, that is the nature of the politics and how it is played out.  We should not divide on it.  Even if we divide in a vote we should not lose what has been good on this committee, which is the collective approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019032700002#P01800","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1553695200,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan and I reiterate the excellent work we have all done, and I include all Deputies and Senators, on the report.

Deputy Deering and others spoke about taking responsibility.  Many people have stated we need to take responsibility and accountability but the committee has done so.  We are coming to the endgame now and we are thrashing out what we believe and agree on.  We agree the youth movement, whom I invited before the committee, made a fantastic presentation.  The youth movement throughout the country, and not only those who were on strike, are very vocal not only on this issue but also on social justice.  They stated they went on strike for the environment and to give the legislators a kick in the ass to do something.  They also stated that in no way should the poorest in our country who suffer fuel poverty be landed with the tax or whatever it will be called, and as far as I can see it is a carbon tax.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan said we will not put blame or guilt on people or individuals but we will.  We will put blame, guilt and cost on individuals because the simple fact is that while we may have a fee and dividend system, we will expect people to move into a green economy and a green way of living, working and enjoying life without offering an accessible and affordable alternative.  We speak about behavioural change.  In a psychological sense, if people were having therapy they would sit down and go through the need for change and how to do it but they would make sure it was realistic and the change that needed to be done was actually doable.  I do not think we have got to that point with regard to affordability and accessibility and what people will use instead of fossil fuels and diesel cars.  There are electric vehicles but at present they are quite out of the reach of a lot of people.  A carbon tax would be punishment on people already trying to get on with life and to do their best.  We have seen the capacity to change in this country and we are great at it.  We have seen the capacity to have a green environment but not at the cost of pointing the finger at the people who can least afford it.

There is a lot of talk about certainty.  We need absolute certainty for the people who will be impacted by the measures to increase carbon taxation, which I support and agree with.  I have done so at and outside of this committee.  I support and accept the position of the Climate Change Advisory Council in that regard.  It and the language in the report set out the trajectory very clearly.  Fine Gael in particular seems to be clear about wanting absolute certainty on the value of the tax.  It is less clear, however, on providing certainty on how it will be spent, what it will be spent on and whether it will address the real needs and concerns of the people who will be affected to the greatest extent by the taxes increasing over time.<\/p> <p>  Somebody talked about bravery.  I will take no lecture from anyone in Fine Gael about bravery on climate action.  Fine Gael has been in power for the past eight years and has done absolutely nothing to address climate change.  All of a sudden, we now have a panic attack in this committee and need absolute certainty for everyone concerned.  Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party introduced the carbon tax, which has resided at &euro;20 per tonne since.  Had Fine Gael shown any regard for an increase in the carbon tax, it could have done so over the last eight budgets.  It could certainly have done so last year with the public campaigns on recognition of addressing climate change, but it sadly failed to do so.  Fine Gael, through its stewardship of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and public transport generally has failed absolutely to address climate change.  This year alone, we are purchasing 110 dirty diesel buses.  It has shown scant regard for people who want to address climate change through feed-in tariffs from their own energy generation within and around their own businesses, whether solar or wind energy.  It has brought forward no proposals whatsoever for planning guidelines to assist with the continued roll-out of onshore wind energy.  No supports have been provided for solar energy for the farming community who might want to use lands that would assist in generating an income and also contribute to the renewables.<\/p> <p>  Will Fine Gael help me in trying to understand why this newfound interest in climate change is of such magnitude that Fine Gael seeks to undermine what I have already set out in my documents?  The party that I represent has, at all times, both in government and in opposition, taken a really responsible approach to climate change, long before it was fashionable.  We protected the environment through the introduction of the levy on plastic bags, if one wants to go back that far.  It was not exactly welcomed at the time but had phenomenal benefits.  We introduced the carbon tax with the Green Party, at &euro;20 per tonne, where it has resided since.  This additional amendment is unnecessary and I hope that the committee will not support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019032700002#Q00100","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1553695200,"counter":56,"content":"<p>It is fair to say that the carbon tax is just one small part of the report but nonetheless the report and this amendment propose a fourfold increase in carbon tax.  The current Government and past Governments have done very little on this issue, and we are facing hundreds of millions in fines every year because of the lack of Government action.  It is typical that tax is always the first response.  We have to encourage behavioural change but the way to do it is to assist people to bring it about in order that they are enthusiastic about that behavioural change, but not without putting measures in place first.  Other people mentioned our public transport system.  It is on its knees.  It has been starved of investment for years.  There are parts of rural Ireland where people have no other option but to use their car.  Parts of rural Ireland do not have a bus from one end of the week to the other.  That is how bad it is.  Our national rail service, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, is so badly underfunded that there are serious safety issues within it.  Most ordinary people just cannot afford to retrofit their houses.  It is not at the top of their agenda.  Spare money is not sitting there for that.  While a fourfold increase may not affect many people here or the proposers of the amendment or the Government, one has to consider home energy consumption and fuel poverty.  The Government has to accept responsibility for bringing about that change by supporting people, by investment and by making it affordable for ordinary families to make that change.

As others, including Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, have said, I would have loved to be able to come in and have public debate in other areas such as about public transport or public procurement.  There is significant potential for this report and this committee to transform the landscape with regard to climate change.  I have some difficulty with this because I understand the distrust and the concerns that have been expressed.  I believe that there are valid questions.  It is, at times, difficult to see the urgency spoken of by Government when action has not been taken in the past.  We hope that the urgency being reflected in this debate is also reflected in support for the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018 this week in the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>  I note the mention of carbon pricing and I believe that carbon has a cost that needs to be recognised.  The cost of carbon is not simply when people are purchasing fuel and the pricing of it.  The cost is also for the damage which has been done to date, which is why I hope this committee will also look at levies on some of the sectors which have driven us to the point that we are at and contributed most to our carbon emissions in the past.  There is also a cost of carbon that needs to be factored into public procurement, so that when we are spending, we think in a holistic way about it.  When we look at the long term, 11 years in the future, knowing what we know about the 12 years remaining to avert catastrophic climate change, the greatest cost of carbon will be from climate change.  The cost of not cutting our carbon usage will be felt by the most vulnerable, not just here in Ireland but around the world.  That is why, even though it is with great difficulty and concern, I need to accept the advice of the Climate Change Advisory Council on this issue.<\/p> <p>  However, I believe that the rest of the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment is much stronger than the original text.  It addresses the balance and the issues of fuel poverty.  I know we are discussing an amendment to an amendment, but one aspect of the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment allows me to support it.  It is that prior to the introduction of any increase in carbon pricing, there must be an examination and specific policy measures brought forward to assist certain people.  Everybody would be given assurance if the Government indicated that the legislation in 2019 will not be brought prior to the specific policy measures mentioned in this text being brought forward.  If that is not the case, I will battle these issues in the legislative space in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019032700002#Q00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1553695200,"counter":58,"content":"<p>This is one of the most important committees that I have ever sat on.

Nobody has a monopoly on caring about the country, the environment or anything else.  We were in a period of austerity and while I would have loved to have seen much more progress being made on the environment, that was not possible because we had no money at the time.  Things have changed, however, and the new Government formed in 2016 appointed a Minister with specific responsibility for the environment.  It also established a Citizens' Assembly to specifically examine how we could be leaders in climate action.  This committee was then established to examine the report of the Citizens' Assembly and how we might achieve this goal.<\/p><p> The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton announced &euro;500 million for the climate action fund earlier this year.  Deputy Stanley stated that the carbon tax raised &euro;150 million.  We want to see much more progress.  I completely accept the point that the carbon tax is just one aspect of a major debate that we must have.  There is much more work to be done and many more things to be talked about.  While I accept the bona fides of members, it is with some disappointment but not a surprise that Deputy Dooley has sought to be so political about this.  I was happy to see his fine video produced at the weekend in which he seemed to be moving in the direction of accepting a carbon tax.  He says he accepts a carbon tax but does not want to put a price on it.  What we are suggesting here is to be realistic and to put a price on it.  We all say we accept it to a degree but there should also be a price on it, which is something we have to do.<\/p><p> Senator Alice-Mary Higgins made a point that I had intended to make to allay Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's concerns around fuel poverty.

For this reason, I am glad the fee and dividend approach will be considered and that those in fuel poverty will be protected.  That is accepted and it is also provided for in the amendment.

New climate change legislation be enacted by the Oireachtas in 2019 that will include, with regard to a new governance structure:a. That action on climate should be considered a priority activity across all of Government;<br \/><br \/>b. the establishment of a new Climate Action Council to supersede the Climate Change Advisory Council;<br \/><br \/>c. The establishment of a Standing Committee of both the Houses of the Oireachtas on Climate Action;And with regard to mitigation targets and performance:d. A target of net zero economy-wide emissions by 2050;<br \/><br \/>e. A provision for a 2030 emissions target, consistent with the emissions reduction pathway to the 2050 target, to be set by 2020 by Statutory Instrument requiring the formal approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas following receipt of advice from the Climate Action Council;<br \/><br \/>f. Provision for five-yearly carbon budgets consistent with the emissions reduction pathway to 2030 and 2050 targets, to be set by Statutory Instrument requiring the formal approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas following receipt of advice from the Climate Action Council;<br \/><br \/>g. A target for the renewable share of electricity generation of at least 70% by 2030; and<br \/><br \/>h. Strengthening the statutory obligation on public bodies to require that they perform their functions in a manner consistent with the 2050 target and interim targets. (See Sections 1.3. and 1.4)Recommendation No. 2 provides:A stronger mandate, expanded secretariat and budget should be given to the Climate Action Council.  That mandate shall include the responsibility for developing and proposing five-yearly carbon budgets.  The legislation should ensure:<blockquote>a. that the board of the Council has a mix and balance of both gender and expertise; and<br \/><br \/>b. the Council be given access to the data and expertise held by Government Departments. <\/blockquote>Recommendation No. 3 provides:The Standing Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas on Climate Action should:<blockquote>a. hold Ministers and public bodies to account for their climate action performance;<br \/><br \/>b. examine selected public policy proposals for climate implications; and <br \/><br \/>c. Report annually to both Houses of the Oireachtas on the performance of the State in meetings its obligations.<\/blockquote>Recommendation No. 4 provides:A coherent all of government approach, supported by the Climate Action Implementation Board, should be adopted for the delivery and management of climate actions.

What we want from Fine Gael is absolute certainty in terms of the cost that will be imposed on the citizens, but when it comes to measures appropriate to assisting people in addressing climate change from their own perspective or within the curtilage of their own home, Fine Gael is very clear that, from a Government perspective, it wants to do it at least cost.  I certainly will not be supporting this amendment because it is indicative of a plan by the Government to try to use this committee and this report as a means to support what it has been doing, which is very little in that it has failed to recognise the challenges that exist and is attempting to do this on a shoestring.  We know that if we are to make that seismic shift, the Government will have to invest very significant sums of money in the way it does its business.  If we note what Deputy Corcoran Kennedy sought in her previous amendment, she has no issue with setting the burden on the shoulders of the taxpayer, outlining that at an early stage, but not providing any clarity or certainty in terms of what the Government will do.

This is a great Trojan Horse.

That shows why we need clarity on the other aspect of the report and why Deputy Dooley's earlier amendment was needed.  It seems to be the intention of the Fine Gael Party to give a licence to Leo to introduce the tax, but when it comes to everything else in this report, there is a contradiction and compromise.  We should not give that licence to an Executive that has not shown any leadership in this area during the past eight years.  We need to front up to that reality.  Consensus works both ways.  The Government cannot have a licence to tax to get clarity while at the same time wanting to fudge the leadership issue, not wanting to give back to the working families who need support and a bit of help with the cost so that they can deal with this issue in their homes, and wanting to lower the cost and fudge the issue of investment for working families.

A Just Transition Task Force be established in 2019 to proactively consider the likely upcoming challenges of the forthcoming rapid transition to a low carbon economy.  The Task Force should have an Independent Steering Committee and Chair and will involve workers and their unions, employers, communities, farmers, Government and civil society to plan the detail of delivering security and opportunity for workers.  The Task Force should be invested with the requisite authority and resources, including a specialist mediation service and the facility to draw on expertise as needed.  The Task Force shall:- commission research in 2019 examining which regions and sectors of the economy are most likely to experience serious disruption over the next decade as part of our transition to a low carbon economy.<br \/><br \/>- address the need for sound investments in low-emission and job-rich sectors and technologies by:<blockquote>(i) Carrying out early assessments of the social and employment impacts of climate policies;<br \/><br \/>(ii) Addressing training and skills development;<br \/><br \/>(iii) Identifying social protection needs in the changing industries, along with active labour market policies and [there is an amendment to this from Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, to which I will return];<br \/><br \/>(iv) Developing local economic diversification plans that support decent work and provide community stability in the transition.<\/blockquote>The implementation of agreed interventions for transition, as developed in the framework, should involve a partnership approach involving Government, employers, farmers, trade unions and civil society (Section 2.4).<\/blockquote> <p>The second recommendation in this chapter states:<\/p><blockquote>5. With regards to the immediate need to address the ongoing transition in the Midlands region, the Government should direct as soon as possible in 2019:a. The Midlands Regional Enterprise Plan (REP) Committee to devise a Midlands Just Transition Strategy, in order to sustain the economic and social fabric of the region in a post peat extraction era.  The strategy should make provision for specific funding, to finance amongst other things, a major project to rewet denuded peatlands in the Midlands.  This should start with the peatlands owned by Bord na M&oacute;na<br \/><br \/>b. Bord na M&oacute;na to undertake a review of the employment potential of deploying its current workforce to a peatlands restoration project for its landholding.  This review should also outline the full cost of such a project and contain an assessment of the carbon impact of creating a carbon sink; and<br \/><br \/>c. The SEAl to examine how best to deliver a major house retrofitting programme in the Midlands (Section 2.5)<\/blockquote> <p>Those are the two recommendations in chapter 2 in regard to &quot;Supporting a Just Transition&quot;.  There is one amendment from Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, who proposes, after &quot;active labour market policies&quot;, to insert that the reference to active labour market policies in this context excludes any obligation being placed on those made redundant as a consequence of the transition away from carbon-intensive industries to participate in the State's JobPath or similar programme.

If we do not insert something that alleviates the fear of people who are facing unemployment that they will be used in this way and subjected to the systemic manner in which these companies deal with unemployment, we will not reassure them we are serious about a just transition for workers.

That was the point or philosophy behind the ICTU's submission to the committee.  I accept the amendment that Deputy Smith is making but I would not want to introduce issues - I will not call them extraneous issues - into the purity of the just transition task force.  However, if there is a critique to be had of social protection policy this might not be the chapter or the forum in which to do that.  I accept the Deputy's right to bring forward the amendment, but I ask that we do not diminish in any way the success that we have managed to secure in this report through the mere existence of a just transition task force.

We put a lot of work into this and have met union officials and workers.  It is particularly relevant in the midlands, and a major issue in Laois and Offaly is that the area does not become the rust belt of the country.  It is very important that we have that.  We had a section in the report, which was deleted, to insert the International Labor Organization, ILO, framework for a just transition, which we believe would have strengthened it.  We are not 100% happy that it was removed and we would have preferred if the report was stronger to give some of the protections to which Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith referred, but the final recommendations provide a lot of protections.  What happened in the past is that industry closed down, whether it was Bord na M&oacute;na or whatever else, and the fire engines arrived afterwards, or a task force was put together after the event.

We heard about the return to third level and training.  One of my key concerns, which emerged in the hearings on JobPath, is that the programme makes it difficult for people to move into education or training.  By its nature, it tends to push people towards employment opportunities only.  In many cases, where an industry is changing and shifting, education and retraining are fundamental.

The results of this review and the preliminary report on the Warmth and Wellbeing Scheme should both be published by June 2019. Following this publication, if the evidence supports it, the HSE and DCCAE should bring forward a proposal on a national roll-out of the Warmth and Wellbeing Scheme.

We will consider what we know so far and what is predicted.  However, many international studies have been conducted as well.  Will they be taken into account?

Sadly, they are not and there will be a role for us to continue to ensure a just transition where jobs are lost in the circumstances in question.  The State, as the shareholder in the ESB, can play a role in that regard.  I hope we can achieve consensus on it.  I certainly believe we should not divide on it.  It should not be for us to second-guess how the Attorney General might address this but we should flag it and include it, purely as an indicative position to protect workers.

Perhaps I am wrong, I hope I am, but what I think is at the base of this is that Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith somehow wants to penalise the companies that are part of the ecosystem that is our agrifood business.  Some of these companies are co-operatives while others are public limited companies but they all run on the same basis of profit and loss.<\/p><p>If the cost of production and sales goes up, a couple of things will happen.  The companies will force down the price they pay to their primary producers, whether they are co-ops or PLCs, meaning the farmer will certainly take a hit.  They will also look at the elasticity within their employment numbers and the livelihoods of the 167,000 workers Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith has been trying to assist and protect will be affected, whether this is by restraining the capacity to get pay increases or reductions in their numbers.  It might look well, from an ideological point of view, to go after big business and it might constitute a great slogan but the effects will not be on the directors or the shareholders so much as on employees and the people who supply the primary produce to the company.<\/p><p> We should look at this right across society, rather than targeting the agrifood sector.  One section addresses agriculture and how we mitigate the effects of measures to deal with emissions in the sector.  The approach is broad-based but this suggestion will have no meaningful impact on reducing emissions.

There is a potential negative impact on prices at the farm gate and, in the co-operative model, there is a risk that employees who are not shareholders, such as accountants, technical advisers, marketing and sales staff, will get the chop if there is a profit warning.

This should include:a. Prioritising the categories of houses to be retrofitted with a focus on those with the lowest building energy rating (BER);<br \/><br \/>b. For all housing where the State is landlord, the DHPLG should set annual targets for each local authority to deliver deep retrofits of all of its public housing stock by 2030.  The DHPLG should allocate necessary finances through the capital budget and explore finding support from the European Investment Bank (EIB);<br \/><br \/>c.

If something is being done in a rural area, we know that we can put up a worker, whereas in Dublin it is very difficult to find accommodation for someone.  This might be beneficial because we will want to protect rural communities if carbon prices increase.  There are, however, other circumstances and factors that we have to take into account.  If we were to just go with cost abatement curves, we would sometimes miss the social priorities we would have to apply.

That may not be the specific intention, but it could be interpreted in a way that would be too technocratic.  We want to ensure we will develop infrastructure that will have the requisite skill set and the pot of money required to do this and set clear targets for retrofitting.  The 45,000 target is too low, notwithstanding the fact that in reality far fewer than that number are achieved on an annual basis.  There is scope to beef up the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and work with stakeholders such as the Construction Industry Federation and academic institutions to develop short courses, for instance, to try to get more highly skilled graduates into the space to create a demand for retrofitting.  We need to create an infrastructure that will ensure the primary user will not face an arcane or overly bureaucratic set of guidelines when he or she applies for a grant.

An earlier comment referred to the scale of the challenge we face.  No climate assessment was carried out in respect of the current national development plan and Project Ireland 2040.  We learned that in our hearings.  We also learned that even with all the projects that are included, the National Transport Authority, NTA, is projecting a 30% increase in transport emissions, rather than the 30% reduction that we need.  We heard from the Secretary General of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport that the Department has no plan or understanding of how to bring emissions down.  Clear and irrefutable evidence of this was presented.  No major public transport projects were built in Ireland last year, and none will be built this year or next year.  More than anything else, in my own city of Dublin we are widening all the approach roads.  That is what is happening in reality.  We know how difficult it is to change this approach because we heard it in our own committee hearings.  All of these roads are popular.  The most difficult thing for this committee to achieve would be to stop the development of a road.<\/p> <p>  The national development plan was not assessed.  When it was assessed later as part of our work, we realised that it would deliver 30% of the emission reductions targets we have committed to for 2030.  We have a 100 million tonne gap to close and there is no clear sense of how we are going to do so.  We did not do a lot of work on reducing emissions in transport planning.  We have to go back and do more work in respect of transport.  We have a significant problem.  If we are going to accept the Citizens' Assembly recommendations, the reality that we have to switch our transport spending to the ratio the amendment outlines must be front and centre.  The ratio of spending on roads to public transport is currently 2:1.  We have to switch that.  If we do so it will be a better outcome because our people are being stuck in traffic.  Dublin faces congestion costs of &euro;2 billion, a figure which is growing every year.  We have to be ambitious in switching the transport budget.  I could make the same comment with regard to the other amendment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019032700002#KK03100","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1553695200,"counter":430,"content":"<p>The Deputy is referring to No. 44.

Several public transport projects have been proposed and we want them to be pursued.  We have to perform a balancing act here.  Project Ireland 2040 is projected to deliver a 30% reduction in emissions, as was outlined.  We also have to look at this economically and socially.  We have to consider it in light of the <i>status quo<\/i>with regard to infrastructure and how to get from here to there.  We cannot move from one transport infrastructure to another without a transition.  We are always talking about transitions.  It is important to manage that.  Reading the recommendations, I note that a 2:1 ratio will have huge impact on the building of motorways and projects that are already moving through the planning process, projects that are shovel-ready and projects that are now under construction or to which commitments have been made.<\/p><p>Examples include the Cork to Limerick motorway and, to be parochial, the Limerick to Foynes motorway through County Limerick.  These are all major infrastructural projects that are economically required.  The country needs them.  Distance is now measured using time rather than kilometres.  We talk about getting from A to B in half an hour instead of it being 40 km.  This is important for our economic development, particularly for areas such as Shannon-Foynes Port.  Some traffic is already using the motorway to come there from Kildare.  That will probably increase and the best possible competitive advantage is needed.  <\/p><p> The other side of this matter concerns rural Ireland.  I understand Deputy Eamon Ryan may be speaking about Dublin city but I am referring to people in rural Ireland, who rely on cars and related infrastructure.  What kind of knock-on effects will this recommendation have for road budgets and the resurfacing of rural roads?  We will have to examine the implications of this recommendation for a 2:1 spend when a road budget is being drawn up for rural roads in County Limerick, or any county for that matter.  We want to see an increase in public transport, of course, but to suggest there is going to be public transport in every town and village in rural areas is unrealistic.  We are fighting to get public transport as it is.  I am trying to think of the practicalities of this recommendation.  I have major reservations.  We have to think critically about this.  We need to balance the reduction of emissions with economic development and how people in society currently interact.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019032700002#KK03900","speaker":"1328","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553695200,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I also have an issue with this, particularly the 2:1 spending aspect.  Regarding lack of investment in public transport, we have to talk about what is actually happening.  A bus running on renewable gas, which is carbon neutral, was launched in Cork yesterday.  We cannot just be talking ourselves down.  We have to acknowledge positive stories like that and what is happening on the ground.  There has been significant investment in bus services in my area.  The public wanted that.  Bus services from Kinsale to Cork have doubled in the last 18 months.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to the bare bones of infrastructure, we have 12,733 km of roads in County Cork.  Maintaining those roads is one of the biggest challenges we have, never mind building new ones.  That is what people want in rural Ireland.  They probably do not have broadband but they want to have a road and the ability to get to and from a location.  People are struggling to do that at the moment.  If we were to bring a recommendation forward of a 2:1 change regarding public transport we would lose a huge cohort of people.  We would lose a real aspect of society.  <\/p> <p>  This report could become centred on Dublin and that is a real worry for us.  I refer to bringing people with us.  I fear this proposal will do damage not alone to rural Ireland but to the report itself.  I refer again to 12,733 km of roads in County Cork.  There are no new roads being built and they are not needed.  We need to maintain those we have.  The budgets, unfortunately, are not available for that to happen at the moment.

I wonder if the two can be separated and whether there can be compromise regarding the amendments.  If we have to recommend that all current transport infrastructure programmes be revised, I imagine the assumption is a revision downwards or away from investment in some of the projects Deputy Neville, for example, outlined.  The people I represent rely heavily on cars.  Deputy Eamon Ryan hopes there will be a transition from diesel and petrol cars to hybrids and electric vehicles, EVs.  He is hoping that will happen as soon as possible and transport will be decarbonised in that way.<\/p> <p>  My fear is that large infrastructural projects will be taken off of the table.  I refer to those necessary to move people and sustain their livelihoods.  These projects are required to allow people get to their places of work, to college and to hospitals to access medical appointments and services.  The transition from car to bus or train will not happen quickly enough if we start questioning or recommending another mechanism.  I would like to see the standing committee take part of this amendment and have robust engagement on what a 2:1 ratio actually means.  I refer to having real analysis of that suggestion and bringing in witnesses regarding what that means.  <\/p> <p>  I am broadly in favour of what Deputy Eamon Ryan is trying to achieve.  It would mean having to axe current infrastructure projects in the short term, however.  That could have a detrimental impact on livelihoods.  What the Deputy is proposing can be done in Dublin, Limerick or Galway.  I am not sure it can be done in the towns and villages in between those cities.  I would like to keep an open mind, however.  I would also like the standing committee to engage further on this matter, if we are keeping in line with the recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019032700002#LL00400","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1553695200,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I call Senator Higgins.

That does not necessarily mean a massive revision downwards.  This is about increasing the ambition for public transport.  If we are to get anywhere near achieving our targets, we are going to have to massively increase our ambition for public transport.  New strands of funding can and should be drawn on to do that.  EU Invest has been unveiled at a European level.  Sustainable infrastructure is a theme within that and, potentially, includes public transport.  We need a clear and ambitious target for public transport investment as there is a chicken and egg effect in that we will not be able to access those EU funds unless we have clear plans for delivery.<\/p> <p>  I grew up in the west of Ireland and I sympathise with Deputy Neville.  He spoke about it already being difficult to access public bus services in towns and villages.  I worked with young unemployed people in rural areas who told me about their difficulties in being able to access employment opportunities.  The problem at the moment, however, is that the case for rural public transport tends to be presented counting only people who may want to use the service from that a certain town or its environs.  To my mind, that actually strengthens the case for public transport in our towns and villages.  Public transport might, indeed, include school transport.  There is potential for us to examine many more layers to public transport in seeking to fulfil what is an ambitious target.  <\/p> <p>  I also support the target for cycling.  While we are looking at 10% of journeys, let us also have 10% of infrastructure.  That might change down the line.  At this stage, we need a big capital investment in cycling infrastructure because it is missing.  It should not, however, be the case that people in rural towns and villages feel they cannot cycle.  People often feel safer cycling in the city than in the countryside.  That is ridiculous and it is just because the infrastructure is not there.  This is an all of Ireland proposal.

It should be a no-brainer.  We have to get cars, trucks and all other vehicles that are spewing out carbon off the road.  I really do not understand the fears of Deputies.  Years ago, there used to be loads of rural bus and train links.  When the country had very little money, it had railway tracks to every lpart of east Cork, Kerry, Donegal and Sligo.  We destroyed them and made a bags of public transport as the State developed.  We could get them back by implementing these amendments.  In rejecting them on the basis of fear we are not living up to what the IPCC report, the United Nations and the plethora of stuff that has hit us in the last while are telling us about climate change.

It is not that I am in disagreement with Deputy Eamon Ryan in where he is coming from.  In terms of behavioural change, for me, what we need to try to do is get the carbon emitters off the roads.  We are still going to need roads for public transport vehicles and so on.  We really need to focus on having people switch from fossil fuel generated carbon spewing vehicles to electric vehicles.  There are significant road blocks, the removal of which needs investment.  We would be burying our heads in the sand if we were to suggest they should somehow go away.  The ratio of 2:1 is a nice one, but what would it mean in effect?  We have rightly identified the necessity to look at the carbon emissions impact of projects in the plan to 2040 to see whether they make sense in that respect.  On putting another limiter on it that does not look into the detail, it is overarching and I do not know how it necessarily deals with the issues that arise, but it should not be seen as not wanting to invest in public transport.  We need to invest aggressively in public transport, but I do not know if setting it against what we spend on roads on a ratio of 2:1 would benefit anyone or if it is necessarily the right thing to do.  We should develop a comprehensive framework for what we need to do with public transport.<\/p> <p>  We can have a misty-eyed view of the past and expect everybody to toddle onto trains, but that is not going to happen either.  We cannot expect people to somehow wait for the bus that comes every two hours, even if we were to increase provision massively and provide a service where there was none heretofore.  In the rural constituency I know best we would need to put a lot of money into the roads to service the buses that would need to be put in place to provide a comprehensive service to meet the needs of a society that has largely become dependent on the just-in-time service provided by their own personal vehicles.  We have seen an evolution away from crowds walking the roads together when they wanted to go to wherever they wanted to go.  That does not happen anymore.  Sadly, we are in a situation where there are three or four cars in many homes throughout rural Ireland, where sons and daughters still live at home.  The first stage is to reduce emissions from the vehicles in which people travel.  Over time we need to enhance and increase public transport in densely populated areas.  That involves dealing with issues in planning and how we will develop cities into the future.  We talked about this issue in the past of urban and suburban planning.  I agree with the vast majority of what came from the Citizens' Assembly and would not like to fall out with it over this, but the 2:1 ratio is somewhat crude in meeting the objective we are trying to achieve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019032700002#MM00300","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1553695200,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I have no problem with the ratio of 2:1 as it makes sense.

I thank everyone for his or her honesty in responding and think people will agree with a lot of what has been said.  It shows the scale of the challenge we face.  Someone said we could not have public transport passing through every town and village.  We should set ourselves a target that every single village and town will have a public transport service.  That is exactly what we should be doing.  On cycling infrastructure, the first priority is that we set ourselves a goal that there will be a safe route to every school in the country.  We should start with secondary schools.  Currently, more secondary schoolgirls are driving than cycling to school.  That is the reality in modern Ireland.  It is also the reality that 30% of morning rush hour traffic is taking kids to school.<\/p> <p>  The car adverts always show us the ideal of a car moving down an empty road, while Deputy Dooley mentioned a just-in-time service, but we all know that has gone out the window in this country.  There are cars everywhere.  When officials of the Department were before the committee, one of them said we were at peak car use.  We literally cannot cope.  Adding two roads will not solve the problem.  All it will do is add further to maintenance costs.  Deputy Neville is right, or perhaps it was Deputy Dooley - I cannot remember who said it - that there is a terrible maintenance cost.  If we keep building more roads, we will have greater maintenance costs and less for public transport.

There is a similar amendment described as a new priority recommendation which states all current transport infrastructure programmes should be revised immediately to achieve a expenditure ratio of at least 2:1 in favour.  My question is as follows.  When discussing all current transport infrastructure programmes, is the Green Party talking about all road programmes, including rural road maintenance programmes and local improvement schemes, as well as county council budgets for rural roads?<\/p><p>I am curious about how it would work.  I can see how it would work in a city, but I am curious about how it would work in at least 22 of the 26 counties.  I am thinking about the effects of the change.  If it were done over a period of two years, public transport services would not have roads on which to drive.  The aim is good and laudable and I can see how it might work within the four larger cities, in particular, as they are choked with traffic.  We all want to use public transport which I try to use as much as possible.  However, if one were to do this in the roads programme as it applies to any of the 22 counties which do not include a major city, the effect would be that there would be no roads.<\/p><p> The reality is as follows.  As a Deputy and, previously, as a county councillor, I have faced situations where a person operating a school bus has refused to use roads because of their condition owing to lack of investment and maintenance.  Where that happens, the 25 to 30 children using the bus have to be driven to school.  Deputy Eamon Ryan is correct in saying it is very frustrating to see children being driven to school in cars.  There is no car-pooling for a lot of them.  There are ten cars leaving one housing estate to drive ten children to school.  I see it happening and agree that we need to change these practices.  However, the effect of the proposal would be to stop the school bus from travelling on rural roads.  It would also affect Irish Rural Link which is being rolled out in some counties.  Irish Rural Link and rural transport services would cease to function because the drivers and owners of the buses would refuse to travel on a lot of roads.  While in my county, Laois, there are reasonably good roads by comparison with others, it is a huge challenge to maintain roads which are laid over peatland in neighbouring north Offaly.  While I have to be careful in referring to County Offaly, I am sure Deputy Corcoran-Kennedy who is not here and Deputy Cowen would agree with me.  If people do not believe me, they should drive from Edenderry to Portarlington via Cushina to see what I am talking about.  The county council is barely able to keep the tar on roads with the budget it has available.  Any area engineer in any of the municipal districts in our counties will say it is like Blue Band margarine - it must be spread so thinly to keep the roads covered and repaired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019032700002#PP01100","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553695200,"counter":474,"content":"<p>The Deputy's point has been well made.

Primarily, it shows that there is a major divide in relation to urban and rural areas in who will carry the burden in meeting our climate action and climate change ambitions.  In one fell swoop, rural areas are taking the wind farms and whatever other energy infrastructure and transmission lines are required.  For the most part, it is rural people who are being asked to do so.  In some quarters, they are talking about hammering farmers.  There is that narrative, not only among extreme elements but also in the mainstream media.  Now we are being told that we will not have roads.  In my county 71% of people are deemed to live in rural areas.  On average, in the west, taking out Galway, 66% of people are deemed to be living in rural areas.  Not only will we not be talking about new roads, we will not be able to maintain the roads we have.  Unrealistic and out-of-touch amendments like this make one despair, except in so far as we might, I hope, be able to have a more logical discussion about it.<\/p> <p>  During the period in which the Celtic tiger was roaring roads were not built everywhere.  I am talking about strategic roads such as major inter-urban routes.  As such, we are only playing catch-up in the west and the north west.  The first piece of that infrastructure was the Tuam bypass, but no major road was built into the west during that time.  We do not have a major inter-urban route.  We would love to have a high-speed train service, but we do not even have that, although we have a train service.  The roads are for the socio-economic benefit of the people living in the region to permit it to grow, develop and compete in some way with the rest of the country which it is unable to do at present.  It makes a joke of conversations on a just transition and how this and that will impact when people in some areas are coming from so far behind in terms of investment in infrastructure.  It is holding them back.  Farmers in these areas need to work with multinational companies because their small farms are on marginal land, meaning that they cannot derive a living wage from producing food.  There has to be a reality check in what we are about and how we are asking a lot more from some people than others in meeting our climate action ambitions.<\/p> <p>  This proposal is off the radar in the case of regions that have not seen investment.  It is all very well to say we already have the roads we need when we do not have the major roads we need to serve our areas.  The idea is to revise everything, throw it on the scrap heap and say, \"I am sorry guys; you missed out.\"  These are the same areas that are crucified by environmental designations as European sites under special areas of conservation rules and the habitats and birds directives.  We cannot have a road or a bridge built because of the freshwater pearl mussel, alluvial woodland and a list of species we have to protect, while at the same time there is no regard for humans in the equation.  It is only wildlife.  The green agenda is that this will be a wildlife preserve and that human beings can be tagged as wildlife in that picture, which is the only one being painted.  It is absolutely ridiculous and I will not stand for it.  I would not be worth my salt, coming from where I do, knowing and living among the people and seeing their struggles, if I was to listen to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019032700002#QQ00300","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1553695200,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I have referred to the issue we have in some parts of Ireland in meeting maintenance requirements.

We have good stories to tell.  People might not be walking to school, but they are driving part of the way and then joining school trains.  These things are happening in villages and towns all over County Cork.  We must acknowledge the positives, as well as the negatives.  It is unfortunate that a negative twist has been put on it with the suggestion that every single person in a rural area drives a car.  We do not.  We car-pool because that is what one does in rural Ireland.  We work together because we need to do so to survive.  As such, the narrative used in the amendment is unfortunate.

It includes infrastructure on roads which will be used by public transport.  I think it is over-egging the pudding to say that those of us who come from urban areas, particularly Dublin, are somehow attempting to lash out of it the people who live in the west and in the far-flung regions.  It is absolute nonsense.  We are trying to reverse the damage that has been done to the planet and live up to our responsibilities.  As politicians, we have a responsibility to look beyond the business-as-usual negative way of seeing our daily lives by trying to change them for the better.

I am not just talking about rural areas because this point applies to Dublin as well.  When we had a bad winter, all the roads in Dublin crumbled because of the cheaper materials which had been brought in.  I spent years on the council trying to get those roads repaired after they had completely crumbled.  Buses would not go up and down different areas.  This is not just a rural issue.  I accept that rural areas seem to be taking the heavy hitting on this.  When I was on the Dublin Bus forum, I learned that Dublin Bus drivers will not go down certain roads in this city because of health problems like back pain caused by jumping up and down on potholes.

We are encountering challenges as we seek to develop public bus infrastructure within the town.  I am not talking about getting people into the town; I am talking about public transport within the town itself.  When people try to get from one side of the town to the other, they find it is nearly impossible for them to do so.  In my opinion, the ring-a-link service that links certain towns could be developed further.  We have to accept the reality that roads in rural Ireland need to be maintained to an acceptable standard.  We are not looking for more roads.  Others have made this point already but it has to be emphasised again.  Many people inside and outside this room have complained time and again over the years about the standard of the roads infrastructure in rural Ireland, and indeed in urban Ireland as Senator Devine has mentioned.

I would like to give reassurance, if I can.  Obviously, safety comes first.  The first priority in the roads budget must be maintenance.  We must make sure our existing roads are safe.  I believe that can be done while at the same time allocating two thirds of the budget to public transport - to rail and bus services.  That is in line with the national planning framework, which was very good and very clear.  It made it clear that we needed to bring life back into the centres of our towns and villages, to decarbonise and to pursue a completely different planning and development model, which would come with providing public transport.  Unfortunately, the national development plan abandoned that and maintained the existing system of roads-based development.  The best example I can think of is in the Chairman's constituency.  I am aghast when I look at the development plans for Galway because they are out of date, old-fashioned and not properly sustainable.  Galway is going to develop out to the motorway that has been planned.  I would prefer to spend &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million on the western rail corridor than on such a motorway.  This would ensure the 30,000 people who drive into Galway from distant locations every day are not stuck in roundabouts outside industrial estates.  I think that would make for a city that works.  If we keep going with the sprawling road-based development model, it will cripple our economy.  It affects people's quality of life to have to spend so much of their time in cars rather than with their families and friends.<\/p> <p>  I want to reiterate that this is not anti-rural.  I will cite my own example in support of that.  My main job for 15 years of my working life involved getting people to Mayo and Kerry from Shannon and Dublin airports.  Every time a tourist from Germany or elsewhere rang me to say he would be arriving in Shannon Airport at midday and wanted to know how he could get to Mayo or Kerry that day, I was mortified to have to say it could not be done in the same day.  That was my lived experience.  It was the same experience all over the country.  We do not have a proper rural public transport system.  I agree with Senator Lombard that we need to think about this creatively.  The switch we need to make in transport does not just involve a move from petrol cars to electric cars - it also involves all sorts of clever and sophisticated car-sharing models which, first and foremost, should benefit rural Ireland.  We should be looking at the other services that school buses can provide in local communities after the school run has finished for the day.  We should make sure every post van that delivers to a rural community has seats in it so that it can turn into a bus.  We can be creative and innovative in this area.  The first priority should be rural Ireland because people in rural Ireland are suffering worst from the deficiencies in our public transport system.  We will not be able to do that unless we spend money on public transport.  If we keep going with a roads-based system, as the existing national development plan does, we will not deliver on the objective of the national planning framework to deliver public transport.  All our people in rural and urban areas are being crippled by being stuck in our cars all the time.  If we make a switch, we will have a better quality of life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019032700002#RR01300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1553695200,"counter":492,"content":"<p>We are on recommendation No. 43.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019032700002#RR01400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1553695200,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I want us to be clear about what we are talking about.

We received a note from the petitioner who said it should be noted that the Office of the President is subject to public scrutiny via the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and the President&rsquo;s office was very topical last October.  People questioned whether we should be delving into that particular area.  We published our fifth periodic report two weeks ago and it included a chapter on this issue.  I note what the petitioner said, namely, that as a citizen of Ireland who pays his tax, he feels concerned that the spending of the President is not made public in detail.<\/p> <p>  The Office of the President has a spend of X that is public and it comes before the Committee of Public Accounts.  There is an audit committee which we probed as well in terms of how it met our requirements.  That was laid bare prior to the election and indeed since as well.  While there is a spend of X on the Office of the President, what is not taken into account is the whole plethora of associated expenditure for the President, let us call it Y, which does not come under the auspices of the Office of the President but comes under the remit of several other Departments. The petitioner&rsquo;s point in terms of the President being answerable to the Comptroller and Auditor General is correct and there is an audit committee up and running as well.<\/p> <p>  We brought the relevant Accounting Officer before the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach is answerable on the Office of the President but he does not answer for all the other additional expenditure.  I refer, for example, to the Garda, which is the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Equality, and the OPW, which comes under the remit of the Department of Finance.  It is just like local government, which is not answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts, which has a plethora of different funds flowing into it, a myriad of things as the Comptroller and Auditor General has said.  The Office of the President is nearly on a par, although nothing could top the local government situation, as other Departments are involved.  What we said at the Committee of Public Accounts is that committees in previous D&aacute;ileanna were perhaps lax in not having that Vote examined.  It is part of a number of Votes that come before the Committee of Public Accounts, as it should, and in that respect there is a more stringent examination of what is being spent there.  That should be noted as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019032700002#D01900","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1553693400,"counter":569,"content":"<p>What we propose is that we correspond with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ask for an update on the issue, when available, with a view to reviewing this within a six-month timeframe.

The Minister of State, Deputy Breen, hopes to make some brief remarks about the Department's regulation programme and his specific areas of responsibility.  I understand my officials have provided a briefing for members of the committee on the details of the Department's 2019 Estimate which I hope has been of assistance.  <\/p> <p>  As regards the financials, the 2019 Revised Estimates published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform provided my Department with a gross allocation of &euro;950.2 million for use in 2019.  This represents an increase of more than &euro;79.2 million or 9.1% on the 2018 Estimate of &euro;870.96 million.  In addition, approval was secured to carry over &euro;27.6 million in unspent capital moneys from 2018 to 2019.  In essence, the total gross funding available for use by my Department and its statutory agencies and offices in 2019 is &euro;977.8 million.<\/p> <p>  As regards capital funding, the 2019 allocation of &euro;620 million is the highest capital allocation ever received by my Department and represents an increase of &euro;65 million, or almost 12%, on the 2018 capital allocation which was also a record allocation.  On current funding, the &euro;330.2 million being provided by my Department in 2019 represents an increase of more than &euro;14.27 million on last year's allocation.  <\/p> <p>  Before dealing with the specifics of some of the 2019 allocations, I will say a word about what my Department achieved with the moneys it received in 2018.  Last year was another very successful year in job creation by the clients of the Department's enterprise agencies.  In 2018 these clients delivered 26,815 net new jobs.  Of this total, 9,119 net new jobs were created by clients of Enterprise Ireland, 14,040 by clients of IDA Ireland and 3,656 by clients of the local enterprise offices.  Our agencies now directly support more than 480,000 jobs, which represents more than 21% of all jobs in the economy.  These jobs are in all sectors of the economy and all regions of the country.  Regional development continued to be a particular focus of our enterprise agencies in 2018, with the result that over 58% of jobs supported by IDA Ireland and 64% of Enterprise Ireland-supported jobs are located outside Dublin.  <\/p> <p>  A very significant amount of resources and effort was devoted by my Department and its agencies and offices in 2018 to the challenge of Brexit and preparing businesses for that challenge.  Some of the specific initiative supports my Department and its enterprise agencies have undertaken to help businesses to compete include the Brexit loan scheme, the Enterprise Ireland Brexit SME scorecard, Enterprise Ireland's \"Be Prepared\" grant, the Enterprise Ireland Act On programme and the roll-out of the regional enterprise development fund.  Enterprise Ireland's Brexit advisory clinics have provided assistance and advice on matters such as financial and currency management.  The local enterprise offices technical assistance for microenterprises grant has been designed to support qualifying businesses to diversify into new markets.  The local enterprise offices' \"Lean for Micro\" programme is available nationwide to help small businesses to become more efficient and competitive.<\/p> <p>  Turning to 2019, Brexit will undoubtedly continue to be the primary focus of my Department and its agencies and offices.  The additional funding being provided for the Department's Vote in the 2019 Revised Estimates will enable us to step up our response to Brexit and introduce a further suite of measures to enable businesses to prepare for the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union.  The measures build on the specific initiatives undertaken in budget 2017 and budget 2018 and have been designed to support the pillars of my Department's strategic response to Brexit.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of specifics, 2019 will see the roll-out of the initial phase of the new future growth loan scheme.  The scheme which I had the pleasure of launching this morning will provide up to &euro;300 million to support eligible businesses to invest strategically in a post-Brexit environment.  It will bring much needed long-term lending to the marketplace by offering loan terms of eight to ten years.  It will be competitively priced with better terms and conditions than those available in the marketplace.  The scheme will be delivered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland through participating finance providers.  <\/p> <p>  The year 2019 will also see the roll-out of Enterprise Ireland's revised seed and venture scheme.  The revised scheme with funding of &euro;175 million is being oriented towards seed and early stage investments where an evaluation has shown that there is a clear market failure.  It will actively direct investment to key sectors that have been identified for development as part of overall enterprise strategy and will be closely aligned with other key enterprise support programmes.  <\/p> <p>  The 2019 Revised Estimates also provide an additional &euro;8 million in funding to enable the Department, its regulatory bodies and enterprise agencies to increase their staffing resources and fund additional promotional and regulatory activities to assist in the response to Brexit and in preparing business for this challenge.  Of the additional funding, &euro;3 million is being provided for Enterprise Ireland and &euro;2 million for IDA Ireland.  This builds on the increased Brexit-related resources given to the Department's enterprise agencies in 2017 and 2018.  An additional &euro;1 million in funding is being provided for InterTradeIreland this year in recognition of the unique role it plays in promoting cross-Border trade and the significantly increased demand for its services arising from Brexit.  <\/p> <p>  The importance of attracting greater foreign direct investment into regional locations has also been given greater impetus by Brexit.  To this end, an extra &euro;10 million in capital moneys has been provided for IDA Ireland in 2019 to enable it to augment its regional property programme by providing additional property solutions in a further number of regional locations, including Sligo, Dundalk, Athlone, Waterford, Monaghan, Longford, Galway, Limerick and Maynooth, thereby enhancing the offering of these regions to companies interested in foreign direct investment.  It is important to point out that all properties completed under the regional property programme to date are now occupied and creating jobs in regional locations.  <\/p> <p>  Another major regional funding initiative in 2019 is the additional &euro;5 million in capital funding being provided for local enterprise offices.  The increase of more than 22% in funding will allow the local enterprise offices to build on their specific strengths in furthering enterprise development and job creating in their local areas.  The Minister of State, Deputy Breen, will provide further details of the LEOs' plans for 2019 in his presentation.<\/p> <p>  With regard to helping enterprises to innovate in the face of the challenge of Brexit, the 2019 Estimates increased the funding for my Department's innovation programme by more than &euro;42 million, an increase of almost 12% on the 2018 allocation.  The additional funding will allow us to roll out the first phase of the disruptive technologies innovation fund, DTIF.  The fund is one of four headline funds announced in Project 2040.  The &euro;500 million DTIF is a challenge-based fund and represents a significant investment in developing Ireland's innovation ecosystem and responsiveness.  It will be implemented through the Department and its agencies, working with other research funding bodies.  In December I was delighted to announce that 27 projects had been approved in principle for funding in the first call of the DTIF.  The projects will receive more than &euro;70 million in Government funding between now and 2021.  The additional funding being provided for the innovation programme in 2019 will also ensure Science Foundation Ireland can continue to invest in research centres and other established programmes.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will appreciate, Brexit is an unprecedented challenge which involves all Departments and many of the agencies.<\/p><p>The Government published its contingency action plan in December 2018, setting out the comprehensive cross-Government preparations that have been in place since even before the Brexit vote.  The Government has already taken actions to get Ireland Brexit ready, with dedicated measures announced in budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019.  Budget 2019 included an allocation of more than &euro;110 million for Brexit measures across a number of Departments.  Nevertheless, the uncertainty and difficulties with negotiations on the UK's departure from the European Union have required that preparations be made for all eventualities.  Contingency planning has moved to taking actions to mitigate the risks of a no-deal Brexit.  The Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019, which has passed through the Houses, is designed to protect our citizens and support the economy and jobs, particularly in key economic sectors that are most exposed, to mitigate the worst effects of a no-deal Brexit.<\/p><p> Aside from Brexit, there are a number of other challenges facing us which I would like to mention briefly.  A particular challenge is to prepare our citizens and enterprises for the economy of tomorrow.  To that end, I recently launched Future Jobs Ireland 2019, a new whole-of-Government initiative organised around five pillars.  These are innovation and technological change; improving productivity, particularly in Irish small and medium sized enterprises; enhancing skills and developing and attracting talent; increasing participation in the labour force; and transitioning to a low carbon economy.  Future Jobs Ireland 2019 has set targets for each pillar and measurable performance indicators.  Through the Department of the Taoiseach and my Department, we will ensure every Government Department and agency steps up to the plate in delivering this ambitious new plan for our country.<\/p><p> The additional capital provision being provided to my Department in 2019 will enable us to progress further some of my Department's priority investment projects identified in Project Ireland 2040.  Among the specific projects that we will progress further in 2019 are the disruptive technologies fund, IDA Ireland's regional property fund, the future growth loan scheme, the new seed and venture programme, further supports to local enterprise offices and a refresh of Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, research centres.  I will be happy to take any questions members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019032700002#B00500","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553706000,"counter":588,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019032700002#C00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1553706000,"counter":589,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and thank her for presentation on the Estimates.  We have to acknowledge that the Government's focus in recent times has been on Brexit.  We have Westminster debating various options <i>ad nauseam<\/i>but we are still unsure as to what our relationship with the UK will be hours, days or weeks from now.  There is grave uncertainty and uncertainty is the enemy of investment because it undermines confidence, particularly in business.  Our role is to challenge the Government on its ability to react to that.  From that perspective, we need to accept that significant resources have been allocated to dealing with Brexit.  Fianna F&aacute;il will always argue that the Government should do more to assist companies, business advocacy groups, trade unions and other organisations that have a stake in ensuring the State is able to withstand the potential damage Brexit could cause.  Whether we see an abrupt exit or a phased winding down of the UK's involvement in the European Union, either way we need to make sure we are Brexit ready.  From that perspective, I urge companies to engage on an ongoing basis with the Department and the programmes it has established.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il criticises and compliments the Government in equal measure when it is warranted.  From the perspective of IDA Ireland and regional development, I have consistently tabled parliamentary questions on this issue and I always get very prompt replies from the Minister.  One of the great difficulties facing the State is that a huge swathe of the economy is located inside the M50.  No other country in the European Union or western world has such a dependency on economic growth from its capital city.  That is evident if one looks at figures on GDP, employment, economic activity and industrial output.  Dublin has been powering ahead of the regions for some time, which is bad on a number of fronts.  It is bad because of the pressure this places on the capital city as it seeks to meet challenges in transport, infrastructural development, housing and other issues.  In that context, IDA Ireland has a critical role to play in ensuring the policies it is enhancing and advancing attract and encourage companies out of Dublin and into the regions.<\/p><p>Deputies will obviously highlight the reasons they want companies to move to their areas.  The Border region has had very little growth in investment from multinational companies.  The midlands and south east are two other regions in a similar position.  Cork and Galway are doing reasonably well, whereas other areas are not.  Why are we consistently failing to encourage and develop policies that will attract multinationals out of the capital and into the regions?  The pay rates companies are required to offer in Dublin place them at a competitive disadvantage <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>rents and the cost of living in general versus living in one of the regions.  We should further explore this area in seeking to encourage more companies to consider the option of relocating to a region.  It would be easier for them in terms of pay pressures and international competitiveness if their employees were residing in areas outside of Dublin.  That would be good for Dublin and the regions.  The figures do not lie.  There is a difficulty in this regard and IDA Ireland has to be more proactive in underpinning Government policy on regional development.<\/p><p>Regional development is not just a matter for IDA Ireland.  We must also ensure investment is made in infrastructure, broadband, educational facilities and other areas that are required to attract multinational companies.  While I welcome the increase in expenditure for capital investment by IDA Ireland, much more work needs to be done in that area.<\/p><p>Science Foundation Ireland is a dynamic organisation but it seems to have fallen off the radar in recent times.  I wonder why that is the case.  Is it overlapping with or becoming intertwined with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland?  The agency no longer seems to have its own identity.  Why is that the case?  Is it the result of its close co-operation with Enterprise Ireland or is it because it is not being proactive in promoting itself?  Either way, I would like the Minister to comment on why Science Foundation Ireland does not feature as much in public discussion as it should in light of its critical importance.<\/p><p>The Estimates do not necessarily reflect the need for regional balance and investment.  The local enterprise offices, LEOs, take a bottom up approach.  We still have a difficulty with credit and access to credit.  I know this is not an issue for the Estimates but it is critically important for the development of the economy and the SME sector.  We have a large cost built into our credit facilities.  Interest rates here are more than twice the EU average.  That is a serious inhibitor to competitiveness in the economy.  The problem is not only the cost of credit but also access to credit.<\/p><p>In assessing the competitiveness of Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the UK and the rest of the European Union, there is still much work to be done.  When we look at the role of the local enterprise offices in trying to establish and support companies to expand to the point where they achieve critical mass and make the leap from the LEO to Enterprise Ireland and internationalising, the issue of credit is bound to be a great challenge.  It is not just access to markets and assessing the types of markets that are out there but how such expansion would be funded.  I ask the Minister to comment.<\/p><p>From the point of view of capital expenditure, I welcome the Estimates.  I am not being critical but we need to do an audit of IDA Ireland's lands.<\/p><p>I know that it does this continually.  We have IDA Ireland centres that effectively do nothing, including, for instance, the one in Kilbarry in my constituency of Cork North-Central.  Barley has been sown at the centre for 25 years.  There are no factories there.  If IDA Ireland is not going to use it, surely it should be used for something other than the growing of barley, with a yield of about three tonnes to the acre.  That is not really what IDA Ireland is about.  We are beginning to lose focus at of some centres that have not been prioritised in the past 20 years.  They seem to have fallen off the cliff completely.  Perhaps it is time to carry out a full strategic audit of what is required for IDA Ireland in the years ahead to see what its needs will be.  If the land is not deemed to be suitable for industrial development, it should be disposed of for housing or to some other entity in accordance with local development plans.  The Minister might comment on that issue also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019032700002#C00300","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553706000,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I will try to address all of them.  <\/p> <p>  On regional development, 58% of IDA Ireland supported jobs are now outside Dublin.  IDA Ireland has been very proactive in working in the different regions to identify opportunities.  I have launched nine regional enterprise plans across the country and can assure the Deputy that one of my priorities is to put the focus on the regions.  The nine regional enterprise plans have been very successful in encouraging collaboration and a ground-up approach.  We have enterprise and use all of the agencies, including IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the local enterprise offices and the local authorities which, as we all know, play an important role in the economic development of their counties.  They are all coming together with the education providers and the future skills fora in the nine regional enterprise plans.  Together they are looking at the strengths of the regions and how to capitalise on them.  They are examining clustering, where possible; identifying suitable initiatives or plans and what they need to do to build on the strengths of a region, as well as identifying weaknesses and addressing them.  We have launched nine plans, each of which has its own strategic objectives tailor-made for the region.  The regional Action Plan for Jobs has been very successful, but we need to refocus it.  That is what the regional enterprise plans are about.  They are about highlighting the benefits of investing in the regions and putting forward the different strengths of each region.  It is about taking a bottom-up approach and seeing how we can create more jobs in the regions.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the Border region and the midlands.  That is why I have specifically focused in on the regions in the regional property programme.  A new IDA Ireland factory will go up in Athlone and there is one identified for Sligo.  The Deputy mentioned the south east.  There is also one identified for Waterford.  As the two already in Waterford are now full, IDA Ireland is building a third.  There is certainly a focus on the areas where we need to increase employment, particularly in the Border region, where we need property.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned a particular site in Cork.  I think he is right that there are some sites at which perhaps IDA Ireland needs to look to see what their future is.  However, he should try to sell a local IDA Ireland site.  For example, there was one in Monaghan where nothing had happened for 30 years.  Now it is recognised and there are plans to build an advance facility.  We do need to review the matter, but at the same time, when I was a representative on the local authority, we certainly did not want to see any IDA Ireland lands being disposed of.  We always saw them as presenting an opportunity and exerted pressure on IDA Ireland to attract a facility.  However, I take the Deputy's point.  IDA Ireland does actively manage its property programme.  It is more difficult in some areas, but it is important that it have sites available for potential investors.  It has no interest in holding on to sites where there is no prospect of attracting foreign direct investment.  As the Deputy said, it also needs sites to which to bring people because, more and more, its existing facilities are being filled.  It needs a supply of new sites it can show investors.<\/p> <p>  The pipeline of new investments into the country continues to be very strong.  I am just back from a trade mission to Australia and Singapore where there is great interest.  We all know that IDA Ireland does a wonderful job internationally.  Other countries ask us how we manage to attract so many top quality global companies to Ireland and the great job IDA Ireland does in that regard is recognised globally.  There is certainly strong interest among companies that are looking to locate their European headquarters in Ireland.  Of course, it is ultimately their decision where they go, but certainly the offer of locating in the regions was very much put to them, for example, that they have an office in Dublin and a second site in one of the regions.  The advantages of locating in the regions were put to them.  The Deputy knows that when we go on trade missions, we realise the wonderful job IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland do on our behalf in promoting Irish businesses abroad and attracting investment into Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, is certainly playing a key role in implementing the strategy Innovation 2020.  It was given an additional &euro;16 million in budget 2019, bringing its total budget up to &euro;172 million.  There has been a lot of investment in research centres.  For example, another &euro;10 million will go towards a new SFI centre for research training to address the need for skilled PhD and research master's holders.  The programme will address a key action in Innovation 2020 to increase the enrolment and output of postgraduate researchers.  A sum of &euro;5 million will go towards the renewal of six world-class research centres.  SFI research centres have generated over 600 research contracts between academic researchers, NMCs and SMEs, with committed industry co-funding of over &euro;150 million and competitively won EU Horizon 2020 funding of over &euro;170 million.  Some &euro;1 million will go towards SFI's strategic industry partnerships which fund compelling research opportunities on a flexible basis that are not otherwise served by other national funding programmes.  SFI is doing a really good job in that space.  We have also just allocated the first round of funding from the disruptive technologies fund, in which SFI has a huge interest and on which it is working very closely with industry.  There was an SME involved in every single project funded under the programme, under which there is &euro;500 million available.  Just one third of successful projects have consortium partners located in Dublin alone; 18 of the successful projects involve enterprise partners based outside the capital.  They are located countrywide in Limerick, Cork, Galway, Kildare, Monaghan, Waterford, Louth and Tipperary.  The largest consortium involves 13 partners stretching from Dublin to Cork to Wicklow.  We are learning from call one.<\/p><p>We are going to have a second call and we expect to make some changes.  For example, these could be to the application form and the process.  We can say with some certainty that projects will still need to focus on the themes identified in the research priority areas.  We anticipate the second call will happen before the summer.<\/p><p> I take the Deputy's point on business access to funding.  My Department supports ongoing key small and medium enterprise, SME, access to finance initiatives, including the credit guarantee scheme, the Brexit loan scheme, the future growth loan scheme I launched, and the micro-enterprise loan fund scheme.  These are a range of schemes developed to provide finance to SMEs at low cost levels and at better terms and conditions than what was available on the market.  A number of new initiatives have been progressed recently, as I noted.  The future growth loan scheme launched today will make a fund of up to &euro;300 million available for loans of between eight and ten years, and that is something for which the market is not currently catering, particularly for companies that want to invest in capital expenditure.  This may be long-term funding for specific or bespoke plant and it can sometimes be difficult to access finance for that.  I am satisfied the new scheme we launched today should cater for it.<\/p><p> There is also the Enterprise Ireland seed and venture capital scheme that will operate from 2019 to 2024, and there are new economic indicators included in this scheme.  We conducted a review of microfinance in Ireland and we continue to support the work of Microfinance Ireland in helping Irish micro-enterprises to access the funds they need.  We are working with our colleagues across the Government to secure alternative means of finance for SMEs, including in the areas of crowdfunding.  As I mentioned, we have launched the future growth loan scheme and we are also finalising the development of a business finance advisory hub for SMEs in the second half of 2019.  There are a number of different schemes where businesses can access funding, and if they do not get funding from banks or there is a reluctance to offer funding, those businesses can go to the Credit Review Office.<\/p><p> I met the heads of the pillar banks a number of weeks ago and I will meet them again next week.  I raise with them continually the need to support businesses, especially in the face of Brexit.  There may be working capital facilities or cashflow problems, and I have impressed upon those banks the need to be willing to take that walk with businesses as they may face into more challenging times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019032700002#D00200","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553706000,"counter":593,"content":"<p>If the Minister spoke to people running businesses, they would say the banks do not walk with them that often.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019032700002#E00200","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1553706000,"counter":594,"content":"<p>They need to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019032700002#E00300","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1553706000,"counter":595,"content":"<p>They let them down more often than not.

The first relates to Brexit business supports and the Minister would not be surprised at that as I have raised this with her a number of times.  I am still concerned about the low uptake of Brexit business supports.  I have said a number of times that the figure I have now is 81 loans with a value of &euro;17.3 million being given from the &euro;300 million Brexit support loan scheme, amounting to 6% of the total pot.  There have been 241 market discovery grants approved and just 156 Be Prepared grants sanctioned.  Does the Minister believe these initiatives have not been successful?  If they have not been successful, what do we need to do to ensure better uptake of them?<\/p> <p>  I understand there is uncertainty around Brexit and the crazy position in which we find ourselves.  People are transfixed by their televisions and watching what is going on in Westminster.  It is difficult and Deputy Kelleher indicated that uncertainty is causing much stress in companies.  What more can we do to ensure the loans that are supposedly available are more easily accessible?  There is clearly a problem when only 6% of the pot has been given out.<\/p> <p>  The next question relates to Enterprise Ireland and specifically equity stakes.  We spoke about this before.  The most recent information I have is that of the 709 companies in which Enterprise Ireland holds shares, only two are investments over 30% and the vast majority of holdings are less than 10%.  What is the Government policy on this and has the Government a preferred policy regarding the percentage of holdings in companies supported by Enterprise Ireland?<\/p> <p>  The third question relates to the concern of many business groups I have met about diversifying markets.  Will the Minister outline the actions she is taking specifically to diversify our markets?  Figures from IDA Ireland-supported companies indicate a huge 54% of 753 such companies are from the United States.  That level of concentration would leave our economy vulnerable to external political or economic changes in any country of origin.  It is a particular concern.  Additionally, Enterprise Ireland's exports performance in the global market for 2017 indicated that just 1% of our exports went to Latin America, with just 9% of exports going to southern Europe, the Middle East and all of Africa and India.  Meanwhile, 34% still went to Britain.  We very much need to diversify our markets further.  Will the Minister update us on Enterprise Ireland's plans to increase its presence in those areas?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019032700002#E01200","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1553706000,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I went through some of the elements of Brexit related business supports, and there are a wide range of supports, whether through InterTradeIreland, Enterprise Ireland, local enterprise offices or the Brexit working capital loan facility and future growth loan scheme, which is a long-term Brexit loan scheme.  There are many supports and there has been a major national awareness campaign for these supports, taking in events, clinics and seminars throughout the country.  I have been getting very positive feedback on the various schemes that are available, including the start to plan vouchers from InterTradeIreland, the lean programmes from Enterprise Ireland, the local enterprise office mentoring programmes, the market diversification fund etc.  Companies are using supports like these to make their businesses leaner and more efficient, which is very positive for businesses, irrespective of the final Brexit outcome.  Of course I want to see as many businesses as possible availing of these supports and I have had no feedback from companies telling me that schemes are cumbersome or hard to access.  Likewise, I have not had representations from Deputies telling me the programmes are hard to use and nobody has told me a company has indicated the supports cannot be used because they are hard to get at.<\/p><p>If committee members have specific examples of companies that have not been able to access supports, I want to hear about them.

There are many supports and a recent article in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>had the headline that Brexit was bringing out the best in Ireland's SMEs.<\/p><p>It outlines some of the supports available and how they have used them to the benefit of their companies.  They have made them leaner and more competitive.<\/p><p> On the global footprint and what we are doing to look for other markets, Enterprise Ireland will target the &euro;3 million in additional resources I allocated to it in the budget towards its global footprint plans.  It will get more boots on the ground and have more people working on behalf of Irish companies to identify new markets.  It will also use some of the funding to provide for promotional training activities such as the Irish advantage and online customs training.  As part of the global footprint initiative, it has identified a targeted expansion of its overseas offices representing our global ambitions to grow international markets, both emerging and established.  There will be new offices in Manchester, Germany, Le&oacute;n, Seattle and Melbourne.  The new office in Melbourne, to which I did not get, was opened a week ago.  There will also be new offices in Copenhagen and Vietnam.  The offices in Milan, Budapest, S&atilde;o Paulo, Boston in the United States, Auckland, Shenzhen and Glasgow are expanding.  There is a lot of work ongoing to increase numbers of boots on the ground.<\/p><p> IDA Ireland is working to diversify inward investment, both in the countries from which investment comes and the sectors involved.  It is also working hard to avail of new opportunities in non-traditional markets.  They include countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and South Africa.  I am very encouraged by our progress in China, South Korea and India last year.  I travelled to China last November and was in Singapore last week.  There are significant opportunities for us in the Asian market.  I know that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are working extremely hard to maximise opportunities, increase our presence and get more Irish companies into that area to sell product.  I had the pleasure of launching a new restaurant in Singapore called Duckland.  It sources as many of its products as it can from Irish companies.  It uses Guinness, Irish pork, whiskey and duck.  There is one company in my constituency with which I am very familiar, right on the Border, Silver Hill Farm, which exports 20,000 ducks a week to Singapore.  It is about increasing these markets.<\/p><p> Of course, the United Kingdom will still be one of our closest trading partner.  We will continue to increase our business there wherever we can, but our reliance on the United Kingdom for our overall exports is reducing and we are increasing our market share in other countries.  Much work is ongoing in that space and we are supporting companies to diversify and it is working.  <\/p><p> The Deputy talked about Enterprise Ireland's equity stakes.  We have the seed and venture programme with funding of &euro;175 million which was launched last year.  Enterprise Ireland is one of the biggest seed capital investors in the country, if not globally.  We have increased its powers in the Brexit omnibus Bill in order that it will be able to lend to Irish companies that will be impacted on by Brexit, not just take equity shares in them.  Its equity stakes will be sufficient to fulfil its development role, no more and no less.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019032700002#E01300","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553706000,"counter":606,"content":"<p>Let us go back to the Brexit business supports.

I agree the take-up of the loan schemes is quite low.  Something that has come to my attention, particularly in recent months, is the chilling effect Brexit is having on business in terms of both drawing down loan moneys available and in making decisions to hire new staff, invest in the business, expand or sign new contracts.  Is the Department carrying out analysis of these impacts of Brexit?  Even if a deal is done, Brexit has already had a damaging impact on business.<\/p> <p>  Another complaint I hear is that contracts for businesses looking to sign deals with companies in the UK contain Brexit clauses that are quite onerous on Irish businesses.

I engage a lot with businesses through IBEC and the retail consultation forum.  I meet them and hear what they have to say.  If there are any issues I encourage them to come forward and we will deal with them.<\/p> <p>  The Copenhagen economic study sets out the economic impacts of Brexit on Ireland.  This points to lower levels of employment growth and GDP growth but not to job losses.  It speaks about depressed growth.  It will not be as good as we thought it would be but there will certainly be growth in the economy.  I know there are challenges for businesses, which is why we have this wide range of supports to help them.  For those companies that have not engaged I encourage them to do so.  Generally, the first port of call is the local enterprise office, LEO, which will give good advice.  If the LEOs cannot help they will point companies to the right place to go to get the supports they need.  Other studies that inform us have been carried out.  An ESRI study commissioned  by the Department was published last week.  The findings of all of these studies are generally the same.

The ESRI report was published just two days ago.  It is more up to date and takes into account more recent research on the impacts of Brexit.  That is more of a macroeconomic look at the impact on the economy and jobs but my question was more specifically on the chilling impact on business, particularly the SME sector, that Brexit is already having.  The supports are tailored towards buffering companies that may be exporting to the UK and may have to make changes to their supply chains.  There has not been analysis done on companies and businesses, particularly in the SME sector, dealing with a loss of consumer confidence and people holding back by not making purchases or signing new contracts.  The two reports referred to by the Minister have not touched on this.  It is not really their focus.  Perhaps it is something for the Department to take a look at when Brexit stabilises.  Brexit will be with us for quite some time and when it stabilises we should look at the chill factor it has had.

Its view is it will never recoup those losses or make up that lost business.  It hopes for some certainly when Brexit stabilises and that it will be able to get back on track.  It has been able to take the hit because it is successful and has built up sufficient buffers.  I imagine there are many other small and medium sized enterprises in a similar boat.  This particular company was very positive about the supports it had been given in terms of training for customs and revenue but felt there was not any support to deal with the loss of consumer confidence, the lack of purchasing and the normal trajectory for sales in recent months.

Subhead A8 on local enterprise development has an increase of &euro;5 million, or 15%, to allow LEOs meet increasing demand for their services.

In 2019, the LEOs have targeted the approval of 1,360 projects for grant support with protected associated job commitments.  They have created more than 8,000 jobs in the past year through their work with local businesses.  A total of 200 are participating in the newly expanded Lean for Micro programme being rolled out through the local enterprise offices.

The Minister was very welcome when she came to Waterford on Friday last for the launch of the ninth Future Jobs Ireland programme.  It was a very positive launch with a lot of energy in the room.<\/p> <p>  First, on an issue I raise with the Minister continuously and as she herself said on Friday, at 7.7% the south east remains stubbornly above the average unemployment level in the rest of the country, although I know there are issues in other regions.  I ask the Minister to expand on what specific areas she might target so we might come into line with the rest.<\/p> <p>  My second question concerns retail.  I was recently asked to meet the British head of a retail consortium.  Again, my question focuses on Brexit, from which, unfortunately, we cannot get away.  There are many jobs in retail in Ireland and I refer specifically to chain stores like Next, H&amp;M, Marks and Spencer and Debenhams, which are England-based English companies but have a lot of stores and workers in Ireland.  Has the Department had any interaction with these companies?  The word \"uncertainty\" is raised every day in regard to Brexit.  We do not know exactly what is going to happen and, as Deputy Lisa Chambers said, it changes on a hourly basis, never mind a daily basis.  Has there been interaction in regard to taking away the chilling effect and safeguarding these chain stores that have become such a part of retail in Ireland?  Although there is not a lot we can do about it, one of my concerns is that by the year 2020, apparently, 80% of all clothing will be purchased online, so retailers are facing huge challenges in any case.  The Minister might expand on that.<\/p> <p>  Moving completely away from that issue, my third question relates to subhead A15, which deals with the humanitarian relief scheme.  There was no allocation under this heading and the Minister might explain the reason for this.  Is there a carryover from last year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019032700002#H00800","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1553706000,"counter":628,"content":"<p>I will answer the last question first.

I liaise with them through the retail forum and I meet them on a regular basis.  I have met the retailers and the food importers four times, in particular the big supermarkets, because they obviously have particular challenges in terms of Brexit.  Those four meetings have proved very useful because the companies have been able to bring to my attention issues of concern to them.  I have had the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine come in to talk about the sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, checks that will become necessary due to Brexit and I have had Revenue in with me as well.  We have had round-table meetings with Revenue, with Dublin Port and with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We have met them, along with the haulage sector and the logistics companies.  They have all been in and I have met them four times.  They have been very good meetings and the companies have had an opportunity to raise issues with me in terms of what we need to do to make sure those supply chains remain open and there is not a bottleneck due to a crash-out Brexit.  The retail stores are represented on the retail forum.  If there are particular issues regarding the retail stores, I am happy to hear them.  We will work with them in whatever way we can to make sure there is not huge disruption to their business.  I accept it is a difficult time for them.<\/p> <p>  It was a very good event in Waterford on Friday and I thank the Chairman for attending.  A good deal is happening in Waterford.  When I was there, I opened the new 3D manufacturing facility that is funded by my Department's regional enterprise development fund.  I launched the new project led by the STEAM research facility, which received &euro;2 million in funding under the disruptive technologies fund.  I visited Nutrition Research Centre Ireland, which is supported by the Government through Science Foundation Ireland, and is doing groundbreaking research work in that nutrition space.<\/p> <p>  There is a lot going on in Waterford.  I believe the launch of the regional enterprise plan will help to consolidate and build on the strengths that are there.  While I accept the figure for Waterford is higher than we would like, we will work hard to ensure it is reduced.  There are some areas which are just not as good as others.  However, there has been a lot of work on the ground.  I compliment the local committee.  This is why it was so important that I went around the country to attend the nine events, eight of which were outside Dublin, to recognise the work that is being done at a local level.  Whether it is done through the local enterprise office, the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, the education sector or the providers, they are all crucial in this regard.  It is about training the right people for the right jobs and, as the Chairman knows, about showing we have a pool of talented people and about clustering skills.  I am confident this plan will refocus on the strengths in that whole region.  I have no doubt it will bring benefits.<\/p> <p>  In the south east there are 76 IDA-supported companies employing 15,580 people, which is up 7% on 2017.<\/p><p>Recent IDA Ireland announcements include DMS Corporate Services' announcement of 50 jobs in Tipperary, INDOS Financial's announcement of 15 jobs in Wexford, Bausch + Lomb's announcement of 100 jobs in Waterford, and MSD's announcement of 170 jobs in Carlow.  That gives an idea of the figures.  We will certainly work with the committee to improve on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019032700002#H01100","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553706000,"counter":632,"content":"<p>Deputy Quinlivan wishes to comment on programme B.

Discussions between my Department and CERN have been ongoing at both official and ministerial level throughout 2016, 2017 and 2018.  Associate membership of CERN is available from 10% of the full membership cost, with benefits calculated <i>pro rata<\/i>.  The minimum cost for Ireland based on 2018 figures is &euro;1.3 million per annum.  That allows for associate membership.  Full membership of CERN at current prices would cost approximately &euro;13.6 million per annum.  In addition to the annual cost of full membership a special contribution would be due.  Based on a membership cost of &euro;13.6 million, this contribution would amount to &euro;17 million, due on the day the State becomes a full member.  This would mean a total cost of &euro;30.7 million for full membership.  This is a considerable amount of money.  In view of the demands on the capital programme and tight fiscal constraints, it is not possible to progress membership of CERN in 2019.  Nevertheless, membership remains on the policy agenda and my Department will keep the issue under active review.  My objective is to ensure that we obtain the best overall return on our investment in research and innovation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019032700002#J00700","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1553706000,"counter":638,"content":"<p>Is that cost the same for every country that applies?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019032700002#J00800","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1553706000,"counter":639,"content":"<p>It is linked to gross domestic product, GDP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019032700002#J00900","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1553706000,"counter":640,"content":"<p>It is very expensive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019032700002#J01000","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1553706000,"counter":641,"content":"<p>It is.

As the Minister has said, Brexit is an all-encompassing challenge for Departments and their agencies, including the agencies and regulatory bodies of our Department.  The Brexit challenge heightens the importance of ensuring that our business regulation environment facilitates business investment and development, competition in the marketplace, high standards of consumer protection and corporate governance.  It must also provide Ireland with a competitive advantage in the global market.<\/p> <p>  The 2019 Revised Estimates have increased the funding of the Department's regulation programme to &euro;85.8 million, which represents an increase of 5% on the 2018 allocation.  Much of the increase is to assist our regulatory bodies and agencies in meeting the challenges posed by Brexit.  For example, in the area of my direct responsibility, funding provided to the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, in the 2019 Revised Estimates has been increased by &euro;500,000 to enable it to respond to the increased demand for services arising from Brexit.  This follows the additional &euro;400,000 provided to the HSA in 2018.  This has been allocated to augment the HSA's staffing resources, especially in its chemicals, market surveillance and accreditation business units, which are the business areas most likely to be impacted by Brexit.  In 2018, the HSA increased its staffing complement by almost 6%.  These numbers will increase again as a result of the additional funding provided in 2019.<\/p> <p>  The other area of responsibility in my Department's regulation programme which I would like to mention is the workplace relations programme.  As the committee will be aware, legislation is before the Oireachtas to expand the remit of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to include the Garda and Civil Service.  To this end, the funding provided to the WRC in 2019 is being increased by &euro;1 million to enable it to respond to the additional demand for its services arising from its expanded remit.  The increase in funding will increase the WRC's conciliation, facilitation and mediation services and will maintain its overall service provision, including to new Garda and Civil Service clients.  It will also enable the WRC's adjudication services to continue to advance the progress made in processing and scheduling times over the course of 2019 with a view to achieving the ultimate strategic goal of processing most cases within six months by 2022.<\/p> <p>  With the Chair's indulgence I would like to say a few words about the local enterprise offices, LEOs, for which I have direct responsibility.  Having worked closely with and visited many of the local enterprise offices throughout the country, I pay tribute to their achievements and that of their clients in creating 3,656 net new jobs in 2018.  That employment in LEO client enterprises is now in excess of 36,000 is a tribute to the efforts of all local enterprise offices in supporting local indigenous businesses to start up, grow and thrive in every region in the country.  Indeed during the recent local enterprise week held earlier this month, our 31 LEOs jointly ran more than 300 events, clearly illustrating the panoply of supports they can provide to startups, aspiring entrepreneurs and small businesses in their respective areas.  I recently had the pleasure of attending the Clare county enterprise awards and witnessing the success of enterprises that have been created as a direct result of the support of the local enterprise offices in my county.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted therefore that additional capital funding of &euro;5 million has been provided to local enterprise offices in 2019.  This significant increase of 22% in the LEO funding will enable them to meet the growing demand for their services, particularly in light of Brexit.  The additional funding provided to the LEOs will be targeted to ensure that they can continue to roll out the Brexit customs training workshops and EU workshops, facilitate clients' access to the Enterprise Ireland Brexit SME scorecard, assist clients through the technical assistance for micro-exporters grant process, respond to the increased demand for the Lean for Micro programme, roll out the second iteration of the LEO innovation investment fund programme, provide tailored mentoring, targeting and training on specific Brexit challenges, promote the very important trading online voucher scheme, assist clients in accessing credit through Microfinance Ireland, MFI, facilitate clients in accessing the &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme, and of course facilitate clients in accessing the Enterprise Ireland agile innovation fund.  While Brexit presents a challenge for all businesses, the challenge will undoubtedly be greater for indigenous small businesses.  I therefore welcome the fact that each local enterprise office has appointed a dedicated Brexit adviser to assist companies in preparing for Brexit in their respective areas.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to say a few words about the challenge of digitalisation and the digital Single Market.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, referred to the importance of preparing for tomorrow's economy and the targets identified under the recently published future jobs initiative to shift our enterprise and jobs focus to create quality jobs that will be resilient in the future.  There is no doubt that the enterprise and jobs of tomorrow will be significantly shaped by the increasing impact of digitalisation.  Digitalisation and digital transformation will have far-reaching impacts for our economy and society.  It is imperative that Ireland is well positioned to maximise the economic and social benefits from digitalisation and ensure that we are in a position to enjoy these benefits.<\/p><p> It is my privilege as Minister of State with responsibility for the EU digital Single Market, DSM, to chair the interdepartmental committee on DSM.  The committee was established to ensure a whole-of-Government approach and cross-Government co-ordination of the DSM agenda at national and EU level.  The committee is a co-ordinated team of representatives of relevant Departments who collectively implement the comprehensive DSM agenda.  From a national perspective, a new national digital strategy is being prepared.  It is co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach and other Departments, including my own, are feeding into the process, which will include extensive stakeholder consultation that was completed last year.  The mission of the strategy is to deliver a number of important recommendations around connectivity and security, Government services, addressing the digital divide for citizens and businesses and innovation and skills in order to advance Ireland's digital process.  Work on the development of a national strategy on artificial intelligence is to begin very shortly and will be completed by September 2019.  The strategy will be aligned with and contribute to the broader EU strategy and will present a cross-Government framework as well as setting out how Ireland will engage with the dynamic and challenging developments in areas such as artificial intelligence technologies with a focus on nationally significant areas of opportunity.<\/p><p> I welcome the establishment of the small and medium enterprise and entrepreneurship, SMEE, consultation group which held its inaugural meeting today at the Royal College of Physicians.  The group was established arising from the OECD review commissioned by the Department of our SME and entrepreneurship policies.  The meeting, which I chaired, was attended by almost 50 people.  The role of the consultation group is to provide a platform for structured engagement between Government, agencies, representative bodies and small businesses.  Its establishment is a concrete demonstration of the Government's recognition of the importance of ensuring that appropriate structures are being put in place to enable the voice of small business to be heard in policymaking and reflects the reality that there are 219,818 micro-enterprises operating in all regions, accounting for 92% of active enterprises in the State.<\/p><p> I hope that the foregoing flavour of my areas of responsibility within the Department and the funding being provided by the 2019 Revised Estimates in those areas will be of assistance to the committee.  I am happy to take questions from the one committee member who is present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019032700002#J02300","speaker":"1272","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553706000,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive report.

Under subhead C8, an extra &euro;350,000 has been allocated to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC.  For what specific purpose is that allocation?  My understanding - I could be wrong - is that an EU directive to tackle unfair trading practices has been agreed and a competent authority in Ireland will be needed to enforce it.  Is it the plan of the Government to make the CCPC the competent authority for that directive?   Does the Minister of State accept that that would severely constrain the CCPC in its current work as it would burden it with substantially more responsibility and possibly create a conflict of interest between consumers and farmers?  What is the current situation in that regard?  Has it been discussed with the CCPC?  What is its position on the matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019032700002#K00300","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1553706000,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  Consumer protection is of significant importance, given what is happening in today's environment.  As the Deputy is aware, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission was established in 2014 as a result of the merger of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.  It is important to point out that it is a statutory body with responsibility for enforcing consumer protection and competition law in Ireland.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, it has been allocated an additional &euro;350,000 in the Revised Estimates.  As I stated, a new directive establishes a minimum list of prohibited unfair trading practices between buyers and suppliers in the agricultural and food supply chain and lays down minimum rules concerning enforcement and arrangements for co-ordination between enforcement authorities.  The measure seeks to protect suppliers who sell agricultural and food products to buyers with a turnover of &euro;350 million, with differentiated levels of protection provided below that threshold.  The text identifies nine unfair trading practices which are completely prohibited between suppliers and buyers and a further six practices which are prohibited unless they have been previously agreed in clear and unambiguous terms in the supply agreement.  As the Deputy is aware, the Commission issued a draft report in April 2018 dealing with unfair practices in the food supply chain.  Agreement on a compromise text was reached by the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament and the Commission in December 2018 following six sets of negotiating trilogues led by the Austrian Presidency.  As the scope of the directive aims to contribute to a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine held lead responsibility for the file during EU negotiations.  The measures will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union as soon as the Council of Agriculture Ministers formally approves the text proposed in December 2018.<\/p> <p>  The additional funding of &euro;350,000 for 2019 is to help the CCPC inform consumers on the impact of Brexit.  It is another part of the Government's response to Brexit and aims to ensure that consumers are aware of the potential impacts.  The money is allocated to the CCPC for that reason.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019032700002#K00400","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1553706000,"counter":658,"content":"<p>As the Minister knows, the committee is carrying out pre-legislative scrutiny of the companies (corporate enforcement authority) Bill.

We have been able to ensure that we can continue to resource the WRC and give it additional resources particularly for the personnel necessary for these inspections.  The Chairman mentioned chefs and those in other sectors.  The fisheries sector is important.  The WRC has had a great deal of success in the past number of years particularly in the context of inspections relating to fisheries, an issue that has been raised on many previous occasions.  There were a number of security operations in 2018 about which the Chairman might know because Waterford has a big fishing industry and operation.  Operation Neptune took place in March 2018 and there was another operation in June.  Operation Egg Shell took place in 2016.  Those have had many effects and surveillance is also important.<\/p> <p>  To the end of 2018, the WRC can report that there were 227 contraventions of employment rights and employment permit legislation detected by the WRC across 169 vessels.  Many of those were to do with failure to keep records, failure to comply with inspection requirements etc., payslips, failure to comply with the conditions of the atypical scheme and failure to give pay entitlements.  The additional resources we have given these bodies are important but we must continue to do so because we are up against many challenges at the moment.<\/p> <p>  There is a good news story from the HSA about work-related deaths in 2018.  This is a matter on which the HSA has been focusing in recent of years.  There were 37 people killed in 2018, which is 37 too many and 37 families which lost loved ones, but that represents a fall of 23% from the 2017 figures.  Our policies are going in the right direction and that is to do with extra inspections that we are putting in place.<\/p> <p>  There is also good news from the farming sector which affects many people and is constantly seen as one of the most dangerous sectors in which to work.  There were 15 deaths related to farming last year compared to 25 in 2017 which is a fall of 40% and the work being done by the HSA and ourselves should be acknowledged.  I have worked with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, in this area.

I pay tribute to everybody working in that area within the HSA.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman knows, we are also working with the WRC in other areas and that is why we have given them additional funding for inspections.

We were seeking clarification on certain matters and further information on other matters.  The response which we got back was to have the meeting brought forward to 3 April.  The committee has agreed to schedule a meeting on that date with Sport Ireland because Sport Ireland is the body responsible for governance, oversight and scrutiny of sporting bodies.  The committee has agreed that our scheduled meeting with the FAI will proceed on 10 April, as planned.  The committee, through our clerk, on 22 March requested three issues from the FAI.  We sought confirmation as a matter of urgency on the date in early April when they FAI governance review would be completed and confirmation that the outcomes of that review would be brought to the attention of this joint committee well in advance of our meeting scheduled for 10 April.<\/p> <p>  It was also noted from public statements that the FAI is willing to meet the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and Sport Ireland to give more detail on a bridging loan from the chief executive to the association in 2017.  We requested that full and comprehensive detail of this matter would be forwarded to the joint committee well in advance of the meeting which is scheduled for 10 April.  We have not received any reply to that correspondence.  We will now ask that the FAI would supply the information urgently and at the earliest possible opportunity to the committee, and well in advance of our proposed meeting on 10 April.  That is the decision of the committee.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to other correspondence.  The next is No. 2019\/419.  It is noted in this correspondence that Mr. Ford said CI&Eacute; is not covered by freedom of information, FOI.  This is a letter from a member of the public.  It is proposed that he would contact the Information Commissioner as regards the body in question.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019032700002#BB00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1553680800,"counter":676,"content":"<p>Would it be a good idea for the committee to write to CI&Eacute; or the Department asking it to investigate the details of the letter and to respond accordingly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019032700002#BB00300","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1553680800,"counter":677,"content":"<p>Of course.

To assist me in dealing with members&rsquo; subsequent questions, I am joined by Hugh Creegan, deputy CEO of the authority.<\/p><p>MetroLink, BusConnects and DART expansion are three major transport infrastructure projects included in Project Ireland 2040.  Together, they will enable the development of reliable, sustainable, affordable and integrated public transport that will support the economy, help Ireland to meet its climate change targets and make Dublin a better place in which to live, work and shop and to visit.<\/p><p> The public consultation process on the emerging preferred route was held between March and May in 2018.  Both TII and the NTA have reflected on the views expressed and responded in the design of the preferred route which was published yesterday.  We believe the preferred route proposed addresses many of the concerns expressed and will deliver a better project.  Among the most significant changes is the proposal that the construction of MetroLink in the St. Mobhi Road area will no longer require the acquisition of the playing fields of the Na Fianna GAA Club.  In consultation with Home Farm Football Club, we now propose to construct a more compact station under its pitch.  The pitch will be unavailable during the estimated three-year construction process but will be fully restored afterwards.<\/p><p>There will be an improvement for domestic and international travel connections provided by access to and from Dublin Airport and through the national rail and road network.  There will be decreased road traffic congestion on journeys to and from the airport and crossing the city from north to south.  MetroLink will include a park and ride for more than 3,000 vehicles at Estuary Swords.  There will be faster journey times with high frequency and high reliability by MetroLink between Swords, the airport and the city centre.  There will be more integrated and improved quality of interchanges with Luas, DART, rail and bus transport hubs across the city, with more direct journey opportunities.<\/p><p> MetroLink can enhance social inclusion by providing new links from urban areas of Dublin to jobs and services in the city and across the suburbs.  The project will support both the regeneration of existing areas and the development of new areas.  It will generate employment during construction and operation and will support economic growth once operational.  The metro system will support the environment by promoting a modal shift from car to public transport.  That will help reduce emissions and energy consumption in addition to improving air quality and reducing road congestion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019032700002#DD00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553680800,"counter":695,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Graham very much.

I was pleased to be at the launch of the revised MetroLink proposals yesterday.  Speaking on my behalf and of the other Deputies in my constituency, we all share a sense of satisfaction with the revision of the plans.  I view it as public consultation at its best.  The NTA took the views of the community on board, listened to those views, considered them and provided a revised document.  From my perspective, that revised document is very welcome.  I thank the witnesses from the NTA very much for their work on it to date.<\/p> <p>  There is reference in the publication in terms of site No. 31 to the fact that the Northwood station will share with residential and business facilities.  I understand that Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, the NTA and Dublin City Council are in discussion with the local club, Ballymun Kickhams, with regard to this site.  Will the witnesses elaborate a little more about those deliberations?<\/p> <p>  In terms of the ventilation shaft in Albert College Park, what sort of disruption is envisaged there?  The documentation is not entirely clear about the timescale and scope.  I assume it is slightly less disruptive than the construction of a station.  I would like a bit more detail on that, in particular whether any clubs or playing facilities will be affected.<\/p> <p>  The biggest change in the revised proposal is that the southside element of it has been dropped.  Would both witnesses say they are disappointed to lose that aspect of it?  Do they agree that, unfortunately, it was a necessity given the lack of viable alternatives on the table?<\/p> <p>  The previous position was set out by Mr. Creegan to the committee, which is that when design works conclude on the MetroLink project, the design team would be assigned to the Finglas Luas project.  Is that still the case?<\/p> <p>  Is it strictly necessary to have a bus corridor on St. Mobhi Road given the revised MetroLink plans announced yesterday?  Quite a lot of change and disruption will take place along that stretch of road.  Is it strictly necessary to restrict vehicular traffic in one direction to facilitate a bus corridor, given that it will have, in effect, the best transport link in the country running underneath the road?<\/p> <p>  Corridors 1, 4 and 6 appear to have a lower impact, given that there is no one way required or relatively little by way of garden acquisition.  Is there a case for proceeding with those first or does the NTA have a sequential order in mind with regard to rolling out the corridors?<\/p> <p>  How is the redesign going with regard to the routes?  When will the NTA reveal the second iteration of the draft with regard to the routes?  Do the witnesses agree that it was unhelpful to assert that changing 10% of the routes would undo the project?  Do they agree that branding both the core bus corridor aspect of BusConnects and the route redesign aspect of BusConnects proved to be somewhat confusing given they are both under the brand umbrella of BusConnects?  For regular members of the public the constant sequential cascade of consultations, dates and deadlines is proving confusing.<\/p><p>That is the case for some elected representatives, let alone members of the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019032700002#FF00300","speaker":"1304","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553680800,"counter":698,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Graham very much for her opening statement.  I will follow the same sequence as Deputy Rock and start with MetroLink, another version of which was announced yesterday.  We have seen many versions of it.  If one adds the timelines set out in the opening statement, it would take in or around ten years to deliver the project.  It is a long way down the road before it becomes operational and that has an impact on the questions I will pose in relation to BusConnects.  The MetroLink proposal, as published yesterday, has shrunk by about 7 km, so instead of the original 26 km, it is 19 km.  Previously, the indicative cost of the longer MetroLink was &euro;3 billion.  What are the costings for the revised plan the NTA presented yesterday?  What is the basis on which passenger traffic was calculated?  What number of passengers was the original 26 km version of the MetroLink expected to carry and what number is expected to be carried on the shorter one?  I am not opposed to MetroLink but it is a substantial change.  The overall metro has been reduced by approximately 30%.  The project that is currently proposed is now different.  Was that accompanied by a cost-benefit analysis?<\/p> <p>  To be parochial, Ms Graham referred to discussion of metro north and metro south more than two decades ago.

Metro west was also part of the jigsaw because it was to link to metro north.  The western part of Dublin is where the population growth is.  We have two strategic development zones, SDZs, under physical construction as we speak, brand new towns with approximately 10,000 new housing units.  The witnesses are sick and tired of hearing me say that the section of the M50 between the N4 and N7 is probably the busiest section of road anywhere in the country.  Metro west was to have been an orbital route.  At the time, local authorities were making reserves of some lands.  While it is not included in the 2016 to 2035 plan, that does not mean that the original concept is not as valid today.  In light of the fact that the MetroLink is being shortened by 7 km, should the NTA not consider an extension to the western part of the city, especially linking the orbital route connecting Tallaght, Clondalkin, Lucan and Blanchardstown?  The area accommodates two hospitals, two third level colleges and two major shopping centres.  There is major activity on that orbital route.  I would welcome a comment in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge that the next stage of the public consultation on the BusConnects network will not take place until after the summer.  Thanks be to God for that, because people do want to engage with it and the summer time is not appropriate.  It might delay it a month or two but it is better that we have full and meaningful engagement.  The whole idea of the network change was to shorten journey time and to provide more efficiencies.  As I stated to the NTA witnesses previously, the problem I have is that the network changes are going to happen before the corridor changes are put in place.  I am concerned that the journey times and efficiencies the NTA hopes to achieve will not be achieved.<\/p> <p>  I have looked at the corridors and one of them stands out as not having very many houses affected, possibly no more than 15 houses, which is the Lucan corridor, mainly along an existing motorway.  Should consideration be given to trying to fast-track that to demonstrate that the corridor and network solutions being proposed are effective and that they would be additionally accommodated with park-and-ride facilities?  I have real concerns that the NTA will change the network in advance of the corridors and that it will not achieve the travel time.  As Ms Graham correctly pointed out in her opening statement, the increased population and traffic in and out of the city continues to grow but the proposed solutions are significantly down the road.  Until corridors and efficiencies are put in place, is there a programme to increase substantially the fleet of buses operating in the Dublin area in parallel with the BusConnects project?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019032700002#GG00400","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1553680800,"counter":701,"content":"<p>I will start off with BusConnects.  From the initial publication of the plan, there have been 30,000 submissions.  The public engagement and the opportunity for people to raise their concerns in such volumes are very welcome.  However, sometimes would it not be better to engage with the public and the communities first on what they feel they need regarding work, travel and everything involved in their community, including hospitals and so on, before putting forward any plan to them?  Given the volume of submissions that were made, engaging with the public on their needs before drawing up a plan might be something to look at in the future.  If one listens to people living in Dublin and its outskirts, the frequency of services and the need for increased bus numbers are the daily priorities.  Route changes appear to be way down their list.  One hears people say they stand at the bus stop every morning and three buses pass them before they can actually get onto a bus.  How will BusConnects solve this issue?<\/p> <p>  People have also been wondering why the NTA wrote to property owners whose properties or gardens will be directly affected while there appears to have been no contact with other property owners living in areas where, say, trees are to be completely cut down, alterations to footpaths made and so on.  Has the NTA any plans in this regard?<\/p> <p>  Regarding MetroLink, another Deputy raised the issue of the metro west.  The NTA&rsquo;s report here talks about assisting people who face losing their homes.  Could Ms Graham provide more details on the plans the NTA has to assist these people?  The authority says owner-occupiers and tenants are to be given a year&rsquo;s compensation.  In Ms Graham&rsquo;s statement she said \"up to one year\".  Is it a year or not?

Some of the changes to MetroLink have shown that the organisation has listened to some of the concerns, and it is very welcome that there has been a response to those concerns.  I refer in particular to the solutions for the north side of the city.  However, in looking at what the transport needs are, the census of population for the past three or four censuses, perhaps, would be a pretty useful way of predicting what will happen into the future.  The city centre and D&uacute;n Laoghaire, for example, both grew by 13% over those 20 years, South Dublin by 22%, Fingal by well over 40%, Meath and Kildare by over 40% each and Wicklow by just under 30%.  We can therefore see where the population shifts are happening.  One would only have to take a flight over Dublin to see where the space is and where it will continue to grow, irrespective of the amount of land zoned.  As well as looking at what is in a plan, what is not in it is a key component.   In the west side of the city, we must look at where the traffic is generated, which is not just in the neighbouring counties, but also in counties adjacent to them in turn.  That is really where the commutes are happening and where this needs to impact.<\/p><p>Ms Graham might address how this will be dealt with from the point of view of rail.  At the moment there are capacity constraints in respect of heavy rail.  Ms Graham will be well aware of those constraints and the length of time it takes to get new rolling stock, so she might address that issue.  I will not even go into the issue of DART underground.  I will give this meeting a skip on that because it is totally the missing piece in all this.<br\/><br\/>Ms Graham said in her opening statement:<\/p><blockquote>The plan we published yesterday is to develop the section from Swords to Charlemont with an interchange from Metro to Luas at Charlemont.  The required tunnel boring works to allow the future connection to the existing Luas line will be completed as part of this current phase.<\/blockquote><p>This means that it is a predetermined route once the bore is completed.  Is there the prospect of any flexibility on this route if this plan is to be proceeded with?<br\/><br\/>What kind of timeline would be involved with the people in College Gate and the Markievicz sports centre who have to move?  I refer to being able to put alternatives in place.  How does the NTA go about that?<br\/><br\/>Predicting where lines will go is one thing.  What kind of advance purchase is required for the trams?  Regarding the capacity constraints that exist at the moment, is there any issue as to which comes first?  I assume the plan is not likely to push out the purchase of much-needed heavy rail, for example, to make sure that the orders go in for the new metro trains.<br\/><br\/>There is public consultation on this phase of BusConnects.

I feel, however, that this is being done more to make it easier for people to get to and from the airport rather than for the people who live in Fingal.  That is fine and that is important, but if we want to take cars off the road daily, we have to plan transport for the suburbs.<\/p> <p>  The southside element has been dropped, but perhaps the NTA will consider thinking of west Dublin.  There was a plan for metro west when I was on Fingal County Council.  I will mention this briefly.  The councillors agreed to rezone Kellystown, Barnhill and huge tracts of land for development on the basis of metro west.  Hansfield strategic development zone, SDZ, has been mentioned.  It has been thrown up apace.  We absolutely want housing, but there is no point in planning to build in the outer parts of Dublin - we are talking about areas that are basically on the border with Meath - without providing transport.  I was talking to Mr. Creegan at the BusConnects meeting in Blanchardstown and I made this point, that we need a Luas to Blanchardstown.  This is not rocket science.  If one lives more than eight miles out from the city, one cannot be purely reliant on buses.  Light rail is needed to get people to and from places very quickly.<\/p><p>Mr. Creegan has argued that we have a rail line, but it does not go to where the population has increased.  People living in Mulhuddart, Tyrellstown and parts of Ongar cannot gain access to the rail line.  In any case, the rail service is not frequent enough.  I accept that the rail line will be electrified at some point, which I welcome, but the service will still not cater for the existing need.  We designed a proposal to extend the Luas to Dublin 15 from Broombridge.  It is a low-density route and would be relatively cheap to do.  One would travel from Broombridge to Connolly Hospital, IT Blanchardstown and the Blanchardstown Centre.  Based on other light rail designs, the cost of such a phase 1 development would be approximately &euro;45 million a kilometre or &euro;315 million.<\/p><p> An additional factor in increasing traffic levels in Blanchardstown which is a problem if one lives there is the fact that there are large industrial parks.  We all welcome the fact that there are more jobs and multinational companies setting up, but the 20,000 to 30,000 people working in Ballycoolin and other industrial parks have no other way to get there other than by driving.  There is complete gridlock following the recovery in the economy.  It does not seem that there is any onus on the companies setting up to make an additional contribution.  For example, could there be a rates increase for the major companies based there to pay for a light rail system?  If a rail system was extended from the shopping centre to Ballycoolin, for example, it would provide significant relief for thousands of people.  One could then look at a third phase to Littlepace and Ongar.  It might sound like a lot of money, but a significant amount is paid in rates and taxes in the area.  That is what we need if we want to get people out of their cars to mitigate the effects of climate change.  Reference is made in the submission to the fact that 67% of public transport journeys are made by bus.  We need more light rail services to increase capacity.<\/p><p> We have spoken a lot about BusConnects.  One of the major problems with it is that it is cutting some local bus services and making some people make two journeys rather than one.  I do not have a problem with the town centre being turned into a hub for a rail link because a lot of people would get off a little bus onto a light rail service to travel directly into town, but the problem with BusConnects is that people would get off one bus and then fight to get on another one because it is not clear whether there would be sufficient capacity to take up the slack.<\/p><p> I urge the NTA to strongly consider this serious proposal.  We need a Luas system for the 110,000 people who live in the greater Blanchardstown area.  The same applies to other areas in west Dublin that were developed in the past 20 years.  It is very sad for people to see what is proposed for Ranelagh just outside the city centre.  Why would one need a metro to Ranelagh?  There is no urgent need for it in the way there is for people who are living eight or ten miles out of the city where tens of thousands of people live.  This is necessary and we must campaign for it and make it a big issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019032700002#JJ00200","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553680800,"counter":707,"content":"<p>I have a few words of wisdom.

TII has had a number of discussions with Dublin City Council about Northwood Station and Ballymun Kickhams.  We are pretty certain we have a solution that will prove satisfactory to Ballymun Kickhams.  I do not know how directly it has been involved in the discussions, but we are pretty confident its concerns will be adequately addressed and do not envisage a problem in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The intervention shaft in Albert College Park is a considerable construction but much smaller than a station.  I cannot say whether we will interfere with any pitch on a temporary basis.  If we do, I am pretty confident we can sort the matter out with Dublin City Council to find a temporary replacement for a short period.  It is much smaller than a full station.<\/p> <p>  On whether we are disappointed to lose the southern section of the green line, we have taken the right approach.  The green line will need to be upgraded in the future.  That matter came up in a later question from another member.  We are not upgrading the green line just to Ranelagh.  It is to extemd to places south of Ranelagh.  Cherrywood is a town.  Sandyford is growing and there is an extension to Bray.  The line will have to be upgraded to metro standard to cater for future transport demand, but it does not need to be done now and we can definitely eke more out of the green line in the meantime.  We think it is the appropriate solution at this stage as it will allow us to proceed with the project.<\/p> <p>  Between the NTA and TII, we have limited resources.  Therefore, as soon as we are able to free some of the resources in working on the other projects to which we have committed, we will assign the design team to the Finglas Luas project and start the design work.  That is part of the strategy.  It will take some time to do it, but work will start later this year.<\/p> <p>  On whether it is necessary for St. Mobhi Road to be used as a bus corridor, given MetroLink, it is still a busy bus corridor.  MetroLink serves a lot of key destinations, but as members know from looking at the maps, there is a quite a distance between stations and there are many side roads and other locations that need to be served.  The bus system will still be really important in the area.  For that reason, we believe we need to proceed with the BusConnects project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019032700002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Creegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1553680800,"counter":710,"content":"<p>Does it still need to be a continuous core bus corridor?

I accept Deputy Curran's point that the Lucan bus corridor has a lower number of properties and would be much simpler in many respects.  When we come to work through a sequence, that will be a significant consideration.  What we do know, as we have said here before, is that we cannot do all of the bus corridors at the one time.  They do have to be sequenced and we need to get a little further on in the design process before working out the sequence.<\/p> <p>  On how the network redesign is progressing, we are still going through the 30,000 submissions received.  In parallel, we are working to pick up on the issues from the submissions and looking at what the intervention might be.  We will have it done in a number of months.<\/p><p>As we stated earlier, we will kick off a second round of consultation at the start of September.<\/p><p> While we understand that it causes confusion when we speak about BusConnects and when we speak about bus lanes one day and bus services the other day, it will be confusing no matter what we call it.  If we call it something completely different, there will still be a level of confusion.  We have tried to simplify our language by referring to bus services and bus lanes when we speak to people, but we accept that there is so much going on that it will inevitably cause confusion.<\/p><p> MetroLink is the scheme that will extend from Swords to south of Charlemont, although the overall metro scheme will eventually reach Sandyford, as per the original intention.  On the costing of the plan, as we stated yesterday at the launch and in our brochure, to obtain an accurate and fully developed cost estimate one needs to have settled on the design and have the design further developed.  We are still in the process of consultation and the level of change can be seen from the first phase to now.  It is our intention that when the design is moved on further, we will start preparing a business case, and later this year we will develop a robust cost estimate.  We have brought on board an international person, Professor Bent Flyvbjerg, who is involved in mega-projects around the world and deals with cost and estimation issues.  He was brought in six months ago to provide assistance and advice on how to put the project together.  Later this year, we will have developed our position much further and will prepare a full business case, which will be made publicly available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019032700002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Creegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553680800,"counter":713,"content":"<p>The NTA has made a substantial change from the larger metro project to MetroLink.

When we move on with the design work, we will finish the analysis but we are fully confident it will provide value for money.  The metro is being sized for the same size and, therefore, it will handle up to 20,000 passengers per hour in one direction and we remain confident about all the work we have done.  The project will provide value for money but we are conscious we will need to provide a robust cost estimate in the future.<\/p> <p>  On metro west, the question of how we are serving the west of the city has been raised several times.  We have a transport strategy in place which sets the framework for the overall development of transport throughout Dublin.  Much work went into preparing that, there is ministerial approval behind it, and it is a statutory plan.  Within that plan, the west of the city has not been ignored and two important lines are proposed to be built in the first ten years, with a third to follow.  The first is the DART to Maynooth, as the national development plan, NDP, provides for DART services as far as Maynooth on the Maynooth train line, while the second is the DART on the Kildare train line as far as Celbridge at least.  We are proceeding to progress that project, and in the next month, we hope to kick off a tender process to acquire a fleet to put in place those DART services in the coming years.  The NDP provides for those two DART lines to be developed before 2027.<\/p> <p>  The NDP and our transport strategy also provide for a Luas line to Lucan in the future.  While it is not included within the first ten years of the NDP, it is included in our transport strategy.  As well as the existing red line, there will be DART services on the Maynooth line and the Kildare line and there will be a Luas to Lucan.  It is important to remember there is also a bus system, which we sometimes overlook, and there is much being invested to provide an improved bus system for the west of the city, through the Greenhills corridor to Tallaght, the Clondalkin to Drimnagh corridor, the Liffey Valley corridor and the Lucan corridor.  Much is being invested, therefore, in the west of Dublin to put in place good transport links in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019032700002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Creegan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1553680800,"counter":715,"content":"<p>We recognise the importance of orbital movements in particular.

This also applies to Bus &Eacute;ireann in the services it operates from the regions around Dublin and in the regional cities.

That is what the MetroLink scheme is lined up to achieve.  Consideration of the flexibility to divert it to another location was the essence of the Deputy's question but the issue is what then happens to the green line.  The green line will be over capacity at a point in the future so we need to upgrade it.  The issue is what we would do if we were not going elsewhere.

The orders will probably be placed about halfway through the construction period.

It would not affect the placement of orders for the heavy rail fleet.  As I said, the tender process to procure DART fleet that will go onto the northern line, the Kildare line and the Maynooth line will kick off next month, so the metro trams will not interfere with that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019032700002#N01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Creegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553680800,"counter":738,"content":"<p>On that point, there is obviously a current capacity constraint, particularly at peak times.

I will start with the metro.  I very much appreciated the briefing we got yesterday following the NTA's announcement of its latest preferred route alignment.  I want to focus on the southside, as a southside Deputy.<\/p> <p>  I am aware that the preferred alignment from the NTA in regard to bringing the metro onto the green line goes back quite some time - 20 years - to the original decision to build the bigger bridge to cater for it and to widen the tracks.  The difficulty we ran into on the section from Dundrum to Ranelagh - it is not just a Ranelagh issue - is that I understand the NTA wants to use a driverless segregated system which would affect the accessibility of the line.  This is a real issue.  Some people depict people in certain areas as being just NIMBYs but there is a fundamental transport principle around trying to promote pedestrian and cycling accessibility as best we can, as I am sure the NTA would agree.  This presented real difficulties.  From the NTA's own research, it is clear there is a difficulty in that the potential closure of the line for two years would have huge knock-on consequences for the rest of the network.<\/p> <p>  I was very glad the Taoiseach, in response to D&aacute;il questions yesterday, indicated the Government's position that, given that circumstances, rather than just delaying 20 years before we carry out the possible works to connect the metro to the green line, we should and could consider alternative route alignments.<\/p><p>I have advocated from the outset that we look to the south west, while other Deputies have acknowledged that areas such as Blanchardstown are a nightmare.  The south-west quadrant is a nightmare too, in transport terms, and there is potential for keeping the tunnelling machine going to the south west to serve it.<br\/><br\/>The Taoiseach favoured running to the south east instead, to UCD, and I hope we will come back with some ideas on this during the consultation period.  It has the advantage that UCD and other areas such as Stillorgan, where a big development is planned, could connect to Sandyford.  This would solve the long-term capacity concerns on the green line because we would be able to divert traffic coming from Cherrywood on to the direct metro route.  It would be a good engineering solution because the entire line would be designed with a driverless segregated system in mind.  It would pick up on very busy transport destination points where significant growth is projected.<br\/><br\/>I have seen the plans for UCD and they include massive development with an increase in student population.  The president of UCD was quoted in newspapers this morning as stating that it also brings the prize of connecting the north side and south side and connecting three of our universities, namely, DCU, Trinity College and UCD, with an immense strategic benefit to the city.  The president was right to refer to the precedent of Boston where they connected Harvard, MIT and the city centre and it took off as an innovation hub as a result.  We should think of creating an enterprising, connected city and this would do that.<br\/><br\/>I wish to encourage the NTA in this regard.  We are in a consultation phase and it is fully appropriate in such a consultation to consider alternatives.  We cannot hold a public consultation on a <i>fait accompli<\/i>or to consider small technical changes.  We should be able to look at a realignment, which is a significant change but would deal with the technical problems we have run up against and would bring huge benefits for connectivity within the city.  We will have a tunnelling machine coming south of the Liffey in six, seven or eight years' time and we have to work out what we are going to do with it.  Alternative alignments make sense in this context.  I would like to get the witnesses' response.  I acknowledge there will be all sorts of legal and planning difficulties.  The transport plan is to upgrade the green line but we can change plans and our system has to be flexible enough to adapt, rather than waiting five years for another plan and starting again.  We cannot stop and wait 20 years either, because there would still be difficult engineering problems that would require us to restrict pedestrian access in a way we do not want or close a line for a period.<br\/><br\/>I support the approach which has been referred to, which might be difficult because it comes from a political system, while the witnesses have to adhere to legislation etc. and ensure the authority is not caught up in the courts over planning challenges.  I want to flag the point that the political system may have to give very clear direction in the coming year or six months.  That was a lengthy cry for consideration of that alternative.<br\/><br\/>As for BusConnects, I have been to many public consultation events and have seen Mr. Creegan at a large number of them.  I appreciate the calm, reasoned and open approach which I have seen from the NTA.  The consultation process has been a good exercise and it has not been not easy as there is a lot of anger and concern out there, which is valid.  I am very supportive of the BusConnects project as we have a critical transport crisis in our city, which is not being helped by widening every approach road to Dublin.  That does not make any sense to me.  Every motorway is being widened and to exaggerate a little, thought was given to chopping down every tree and cutting down all front gardens.  We must stop widening the approach roads to Dublin and stop the traffic coming in.  What are we doing?<br\/><br\/>In respect of the bus network, the public consultation meetings have been very detailed and useful in terms of a couple of corridors in my constituency, namely, those in Rathfarnham and Kimmage.  We have a problem with the continuation of the four-carriageway design, which is a six-carriageway design if one includes cycle lanes.  Real difficulties are being presented on the Kimmage Road Lower, from Sundrive Road to the KCR, and on Terenure Road East, Rathgar Road and Rathfarnham Road.  A very extensive removal of front gardens and trees is proposed, as is the creation of a streetscape that I fear means it will not remain a street at all, but become a major distributor road.  Living on a distributor road in urban villages and residential communities is a totally different experience from living on a street.<br\/><br\/>At the same time, we need to protect the bus fleets and improve bus times and services and I am 100% committed to that.  There may be a technical solution.  I welcome the plans to reduce the amount of through traffic on the two corridors to which I referred, without blocking access.  We need to take an approach along the lines of the proposal for the main street in Rathmines, which will be a one-way system for cars, the plan to restrict traffic from Bride Street onto Heytesbury Street and the plans for a bus gate in Harold's Cross, though there are local difficulties around this last plan.  These proposals recognise that we are at peak car and cannot cope.  We have to restrict traffic while trying to maintain access.  Instead of a four-lane approach on the roads I mentioned, we could look at a staggered three-lane approach.  We could make sure a bus gets through the light every time and make other reductions in traffic.  It should be possible to run the bus at the correct speed and to the correct timetable without having to provide a bus lane for the first 500 m of the road.  The buses would always be ahead of the traffic and it would be a general shared lane.  With a staggered approach, we may be able to reduce the amount of curtilage that must be taken, as well as diminishing the road's character as a major distributor route, thereby retaining some of the urban and residential character of the areas in question.  Do the witnesses see this as an option?  It would also have an effect on Nutley Lane and loads of other areas where there are similar difficulties but the effects would be particularly significant in the corridors to which I refer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019032700002#O02500","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553680800,"counter":763,"content":"<p>I will follow up on Mr. Creegan's answers on College Gate.  I still hope College Gate is under consideration for a slight realignment relating to property around there.  I know one of the sites creates a difficulty with the main sewer line but if that can be resolved, can the station be moved while maintaining integrated transport?  I suggest that a proper costing be carried out on the sewer line during the further public consultation, with a view to opening up alternative options.  The normal compulsory purchase order, CPO, mechanism will not work for College Gate.  It is a community that has been in the city for several years and there is a mixture of tenants and owner occupiers.  In the case of the latter, the current CPO system will not allow them to stay within their own community if it is carried out.  I ask for that to be examined.<\/p><p>College Gate is very different from anywhere else because of its location.  People who purchased their two-bedroom home in College Gate during the recession got it at a what people would call a good price nice now.  If they want to stay within their community, there will be a huge gap between what is a compulsory purchase price and a compensation price than what they can purchase in the immediate area.  That reality must be taken into consideration.  These people cannot be banished from their communities in which they have lived for decades.  Similarly for tenants, I do not believe the proposed one-year system will work.  <\/p><p> In terms of bus corridors, Deputy Eamon Ryan has outlined that we do not want the streetscape change.  To be fair, Mr. Creegan has worked with me when I made proposals and suggestions in an effort to resolve some of these issues, and I accept that not all of the issues can be resolved.  Let me outline one of my concerns.  In an effort to make constructive suggestions about how this matter can be resolved, as the witnesses are probably aware, the real-time data for buses are open data, so they are freely and easily accessible.  There seems to be a difference of up to 40% between the times stated in the consultation documents and the open real-time data sources that we have accessed.  I ask the witnesses to check their data sources.  We have 28 or 29 days of data.  There are large differences in the times that have been put forward and what is actually shown in the real-time data.  We now need local consultation, thus allowing people to bring forward constructive solutions and I am a big supporter of public transport.<\/p><p> As far back as when the metro system was proposed, I always said that no decision would be a worse decision for local communities.  We have hit a worse solution for the Charlemont Street line.  By building a bus park under Ranelagh, the NTA has sent a clear indication that it will extend the Luas green line.  I would like a better technical term than \"perhaps\" 20 years.  I am sure we have real modelling that will tell us within what timeframe it is proposed to extend.  I have not encountered the technical terms of \"perhaps\" before.  Anybody living along the line now who wishes to rightsize or downsize will experience a financial depreciation on their properties and probably will not be able to move to suitable accommodation because it will be an automatic discount.  This scenario has happened numerous times in terms of plans and certainly within Dublin city.   I refer, for example, to the Merrion Gates flyover that was proposed by the NTA.  One will see from a property search in the area that it is next to impossible to sell a property there if one wants to move one because potential buyers will see that there is a road reservation in the front garden yet there is no negotiation on a future compulsory purchase.  Similar things have happened in other locations, such as the sterilisation of a tract of land in terms of the eastern bypass.  Therefore, the NTA must give a little bit more certainty rather than the word \"perhaps\" so people can understand the future plans and proper timescales.  I certainly believe that there are two options, which have been clearly outlined by Deputy Eamon Ryan.  One option is to connect UCD or take the line further westward and connect Harold's Cross, Kimmage and up as far as the Rathfarnham bus corridor, which takes over 70,000 passengers and shows there is a demand.  I also believe that we should start to plan public transport for this city on a 100-year basis and not on a very short-term basis.<\/p><p> I respect what has happened in Swords.  I mean a decision has already been taken about height and density on the expectation that the metro system will go to Swords.  As for furnishing data on the viability of taking the MetroLink westward, one could consider, while working with local authorities, that changing the density and height at the locations along the metro line could make the line much more financially sustainable.  I believe public transport must be subsidised because cities and communities make other positive gains.<\/p><p> Lastly, the NTA must take on board the fact that this city is made up of villages and, therefore, we must ensure they are not destroyed by the proposals.  I urge the NTA that the streetscape is not changed so much that the villages are no longer viable.  I lived through the development of the Luas line on Harcourt Street so I know that many of the businesses on Harcourt Street never re-opened after they closed during the construction period.  Therefore, the construction proposals must be accompanied by supports for small businesses to ensure that they can exist during construction.  We must work imaginatively with the local authorities and take into consideration the loss of business during the construction of BusConnects.  At present small businesses and small shops are only hanging in there so one cannot say this project is going to be great, more people will go to the village thus generating more business if one cannot stay open during the construction period.  If a small business or shop closes then, more than likely, it will never re-open. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019032700002#P00200","speaker":"1417","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1553680800,"counter":765,"content":"<p>I will respond first to the point made by Deputy Eamon Ryan about the strategy and changing the metro line to UCD and connecting it with Sandyford.

We do and we are required, and of course our strategy has to be adaptable to changing circumstances, but there is an allowance in our legislation to review our transport strategy every six years.  We will be proposing to do that and to start that work towards the end of next year.  We believe it is at that time that any changes or potential changes to alignment would be considered.  It is then that one would consider the proposal to go to UCD instead of upgrading the green line to metro level service.  If we make changes to our plans now, it means that our transport strategy would have to change.  There is a two to three-year period involved in developing a transport strategy, getting it statutorily approved and then delaying the process for the whole MetroLink.  We do not think that is something we should bring forward at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019032700002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1553680800,"counter":766,"content":"<p>There is absolute agreement that there can be no delay in the broader project.  Clearly, we must do things within legislative and other mechanisms but we have a real transport crisis in our city.  We face a congestion charge of &euro;2 billion a year because Dublin is such a car dominated city.  I recall from our separate work at the Joint Committee on Climate Action that Ms Graham replied to a question that I asked about the estimate.  Even with the metro and BusConnects, we are looking at a 30% increase in transport emissions in Dublin by 2030 when we need a 30% reduction at least.  So, we have an absolute crisis.  I know from the work done by the Joint Committee on Climate Action and other committees that a whole range of measures will have to be taken in other sectors of society, and that we will have to be quick and resolute in our approach.  We will not resolve the matter here today, and I hear what the witnesses have said on that aspect.  I think the political system is going to come back to the NTA to ask it to come up with ways to speed up the process.<\/p><p>Even if, for some reason, it is ruled out or not agreed, a general approach of delaying transport infrastructure is the last one that we should be adopting.  As we have that tunnelling machine coming south of the Liffey, it would be a tragedy to fail to use it in a productive way.  Other parts of the city are going to have a similar dramatic increase in the scale of public transport investment we are going to make.  That strategy will probably be challenged and changed in other ways.  For example, we will have to ramp things up because the climate agreement we will have to conclude with the European Union will say our plans are not sufficient.  The national development plan included no climate assessment and there is a legal challenge against that, rightly.  We are facing the European Union which is not going to give us an out on our climate emissions targets.  We will have to so much more on transport that any plan cannot be regarded as fixed.  In particular, where we have a project where this is a variation, any court or planning system will see that, during the consultation process, people came forward with alternative suggestions.  If we do not have a public consultation that allows for such variation, that process would say it was not a proper public consultation.  While I think it is a proper public consultation, we should not get caught in the weeds of timelines for statutory plans that see us missing an opportunity.  That is the one point I would make.  If that requires political action by way of legislative or other measures, it will be possible for us to do it.  However, we must work fast now to do the modelling quickly and to assess as best we can the alternatives.  The political system will be coming looking for that because we have this challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019032700002#Q00300","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1553680800,"counter":768,"content":"<p>It is a matter for the political system if it wants to bring that forward.

If the queuing extends back beyond the bus lane area into the combined lane, which the Deputy proposes we avoid, we will end up with problems.  There may be places where it is the appropriate solution so we will look at it.  There is also another way to get to a three-lane arrangement and reduce the land take in one or two places.  A one-way piece of street may be appropriate there.  We have already had discussions with one or two groups about whether that is appropriate in their particular localities.

The bike capacity will reduce the number of cars on the road.  We must think long-term.  It is not that we will continue to provide the existing car system.

We did a great deal of work on College Gate to see if we could avoid having to proceed with the proposal with which we went forward.  The honest position is that the proposal with which we went forward previously is still the right one.  None of the alternatives is satisfactory.  They all have issues.  We will put on the MetroLink website within a number of days a comprehensive report setting out all the options that were looked at and the issues with each.  People will have the opportunity to review that.  They will see that a lot of effort was made to determine how to avoid having to remove those apartments.  Unfortunately, we have not been able to do that in this case.  On the compulsory purchase order, CPO, system, it was stated that the normal process will not work correctly.  We are sort of acknowledging that in what we have put forward.  The idea of compensating tenants with up to one year's rent in another location is outside the CPO process and beyond what it normally requires.  Rental tenants by their nature only have a fixed tenancy usually.  We are going to go above and beyond that.  For owner-occupiers, we will try to help them find alternative accommodation in a suitable location.  As the Senator said, they are part of a community at this stage and, it is presumed, will be looking to be accommodated somewhere else in that community.  We will do all we can to assist them.  I agree completely that the normal compensation rules are not enough and we are going above and beyond that.<\/p> <p>  I will pick up some of the other things, including the streetscape issues.  We are very conscious of that and have consulted people.  Taking gardens is a significant issue which encompasses what a road will look like afterwards.  We are appointing design teams for the project over the next month or so and all of them will include urban realm architects.  We will make it a key focus of the project that we end up not only with the transport but a project that respects the character of the areas through which it runs.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about bus data and open source access.  That is understood.  When one looks at the open source data, the issue is the variability in the buses.  We have not put out a single number and said that every bus journey takes a certain number of minutes.  We have had to put out a notice to say journeys take up to a certain amount of time and we have not even gone to the extremes in that regard.  The data we have used in our documentation come from the automatic vehicle location data from the buses themselves and we have access to all of that.  The calculations that were done came from that system.  It demonstrates, if nothing else, the vast variability in bus times.  One day a journey takes a certain amount of time and the next day it takes a different amount of time.  People find it hard to plan their journeys with confidence on that basis.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about the sterilisation of properties along the green line and the timescale for its upgrade.  The proposals to upgrade the green line to metro will largely mirror the proposals we published last year.  People will have seen what the impacts and changes will be.  It might vary slightly, but that is the broad outline.  As to timescale, we said in our documentation yesterday that we believe we can get the green line to function for up to 20 years, approximately.  Close to that time period it will have to change, but we do not have any more detailed information on that yet.  I was asked about the metro deviating in another direction towards the Rathfarnham area.  Ms Graham has covered the impact on the strategy of making changes at this stage.  As the Senator acknowledged, it would require significant development changes to make it slightly higher density.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019032700002#R00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Creegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1553680800,"counter":776,"content":"<p>May I have a point of clarity?

The development of the strategy showed that if both were put in place, the bus system would be able to cater for the demand along the Stillorgan corridor.
