An aidhm at&aacute; againn anois n&aacute; an gn&iacute;omh a thosaigh muid a chur i gcr&iacute;ch.<\/p>  <p>  A Cheann Comhairle, foremost in our minds are those who have lost loved ones because of Covid-19 and all who are suffering from its impact physically, emotionally or financially.  As of last night, 143 people have died since we last met in this format last week.<\/p> <p>I offer my condolences and those of the House to their families and friends.<\/p> <p> Due to the decisions, choices and sacrifices of the Irish people, the curve has been flattened.  It has plateaued, but our grief has not.  We now have a road map for how we will bring our country to a new normal.  The stakes are too high to rush things now; otherwise, we risk everything we have achieved.  As we start to ease the restrictions, we must continue our commitment to the basic actions such as cleaning hands and physical distancing.  We must try to find, isolate, test and care for every case and trace every contact.  As we ease the restrictions personal discipline around physical distancing, handwashing and respiratory hygiene will become more important than ever.<\/p> <p> As of yesterday, just under 215,000 tests have been carried out in Ireland.  Over the past week, close to 62,000 tests were carried out and, of these, 2,280 were positive.  That gives us a positivity rate of 3.7%, a rate which, thankfully, is continuing to trend downwards.  Some 65,000 tests have been carried out in long-term care residential centres, including nursing homes, and 540 nursing homes, or 93% of the total, have been tested so far.  This testing continues.<\/p> <p> During the course of this Covid-19 emergency, nearly 3,000 people have been hospitalised, and 78% of those have made a full recovery.  Some significant developments have taken place since this day last week.  The HSE is increasing its testing capacity, which now stands at 12,000 tests every day.  By mid-May, we aim to have capacity for 15,000 tests per day.  The total number of tests now done, as I mentioned earlier, is 215,000.  That is 43,000 tests per million population.  Depending on how this is measured, we rank between third and seventh in the European Union of 27 and are now well ahead of countries that led the way in testing previously, such as Germany, South Korea and Singapore.  We need, however, to focus also on turnaround times and rapid and aggressive tracing.<\/p> <p> One of our focuses from the very start was to build surge capacity in our hospitals.  We needed to ensure we had the maximum possible number of critical care and regular hospital beds so we could cope with the predicted number of Covid-19 cases requiring hospitalisation.  We need to remember that the 3,000 people who have been hospitalised so far have come from all settings: some from their own homes, some from nursing homes and some from other forms of care home.  They are young, middle-aged and older.  The whole point of increasing critical care capacity and hospital capacity was that that is where the sickest will end up.  To date, 3,000 people have been hospitalised with Covid-19.  It is good that we have not run into issues with the availability of critical care beds or ventilators.  It could have been very different.  The willingness of people in every village, town and city to follow the public health advice has changed the future.  It has meant that our hospitals have been able to cope and our healthcare staff have not been overwhelmed.  This success, however, has brought a different challenge, and we need now to work out how we can manage separately Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 care for a prolonged period.  This will not be easy.  It means we need to provide care and services in new ways, such as increased used of telemedicine, online clinics and hospital in the home while ensuring that patients are confident about the quality of their treatment and reassured about the safety of the care they receive.<\/p> <p> For those feeling isolated, I know how easy it is to become anxious and lonely when they have to spend a considerable amount of time on their own, especially if they are sociable people by nature, but I ask them to remember that help is always available.  I ask them to reach out to a friend or family member and contact Community Call.  It is waiting to hear from them.<\/p> <p> Last Friday we published our reopening plan.  Since then, indicators are that the positivity rate is going in the right direction.  ICU occupancy is now below 100 - in fact, falling towards 80 today - and we are increasingly confident, though it is not yet certain, that we can proceed with phase 1 on Monday, 18 May.  Cabinet will make a final decision on that on Friday, 15 May, following advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.  I know we have faced some criticism that our plan to reopen the country is at a slower pace than those of other countries.  It is true that it is slower - slower than those of countries much less affected than us, such as Australia and New Zealand, and slower than those of countries much worse affected than us, such as Spain and Belgium.<\/p> <p>This is a decision the Government made on foot of advice from NPHET and it is one we stand over.  I would rather have a plan that we accelerate if things go well than one that we might have to pause, draw out or go back on if they do not.  We are putting the lives of our people and their health first and we do not want to have to reimpose restrictions like some other countries have had to do.  That would damage public morale and further dent economic confidence.  We want to learn from the success and errors of other European countries reopening before us and it is encouraging to see the data from Germany which indicates that its reopening has not yet led to an increase in cases.  I think ours is a prudent, precautionary and health-led approach.<\/p> <p> The Government is keen to hear from sectors and businesses that think they can open more quickly and see their plans for how they will achieve physical distancing and what precautions they will put in place to mitigate the risk where they cannot.  Our objective is to help the country get through this emergency, rebuild our economy, get people back to work and keep them safe while doing so.  We are currently working with business, unions, the Health and Safety Authority and the HSE on the development of a return to work safety protocol to assist this.  <\/p> <p> According to our most recent figures, 598,000 people are receiving the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment.  This is on top of the 205,000 people on the live register, so a total of 803,000 people are now receiving some form of income protection from the State.  As we know, we came back from the last economic crisis and achieved full employment.  I believe that, with the right policies, we will do so again and the recovery will be quicker this time.<\/p> <p> On Saturday, we announced an economic plan worth up to &euro;6.5 billion to help businesses impacted by Covid-19 and minimise the economic damage done by the pandemic.  Commercial rates will be written off for three months.  A &euro;2 billion credit guarantee scheme will be introduced for small and medium sized enterprises and our sovereign wealth fund, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund or ISIF, has been mandated to invest &euro;2 billion directly into bigger firms.  Maintaining the link between employers and employees will enable a quicker recovery and the wage subsidy scheme will help keep staff on the payroll.<\/p> <p> There is also a &euro;1 billion Covid-19 funding package to help businesses with cashflow and banks will also be able to dip into their rainy day capital reserves to keep lending flowing, freeing up &euro;1 billion in bank capital to provide up to &euro;13 billion in credit.  Meanwhile, a suite of taxation measures will alleviate short-term liquidity difficulties.<\/p> <p> I am keen to see a return to international air travel as soon as is feasible and safe.  There is a lot of work to do but I am more optimistic than others that air travel for business and leisure will resume this year.  Currently, there is important work being done by the European Commission and various aviation safety agencies and I hope to give an update to the D&aacute;il on this matter in the weeks to come.<\/p> <p> We are still learning about this virus.  It is noteworthy that initial reports suggest, from retrospective testing, that the virus was circulating in France as far back as December last year.  That is before the virus even had a name or a test for it.  In some ways, this is not surprising.  France is well connected to China, with dozens of flights every day, and Ireland is well connected to France.  It is very possible that this virus was already in Ireland last year or in January this year, and we should not assume that it came here from Italy in late February just because the first confirmed case did.  Further research and retrospective testing will give us a better idea of that and time will tell.<\/p> <p> The coronavirus is the shared enemy of all humanity and all governments.  I believe the only way we can defeat a global threat is by working together on a multilateral basis.  Working together, we can develop an effective vaccine, treatment and testing systems.  Ireland has contributed &euro;60 million in direct or repurposed grants to the United Nations and has quadrupled its contribution to the World Health Organization.  On Monday, on behalf of the Irish people, I pledged &euro;18 million to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, so that the poorest and least developed countries in the world will have access to the vaccine if and when it is developed.  We are providing about &euro;10 million over three years for immunology research.<\/p> <p> The Department of Health is also supporting the WHO solidarity study which is comparing four treatment options, including remdesivir, which is available to Irish patients under certain circumstances.  By recruiting patients in several countries, and shortly here too, the trial aims to rapidly assess the impact of these treatments in slowing the disease or improving outcomes.<\/p> <p> As always, I look forward to hearing comments and observations from Members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700003#A00300","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588850700,"counter":10,"content":"<p>In just over two months, 1,375 people in our country have lost their lives during this pandemic.  Our first thoughts must continue to be with their families and loved ones, and indeed with those who are today fighting with the virus.  There is no question that our absolute priority must be to continue to limit the spread and fatal impact of Covid-19 and that this work will continue for some time.  During this session, there will be many hard questions asked concerning the Government's actions.  That is exactly as it should be.  Particularly as we join other countries in moving out of the most restrictive phases of the response, there are many issues where there is no simple answer and different approaches are possible.<\/p>  <p>  Last Friday's publication was welcome, but it has raised almost as many questions as it answered.  It is a framework for reaching decisions.  It does not provide a level of clarity which could have been expected.  The five tests by which different elements of the restrictions can be raised are reasonable and they have been on the record for some time.  However, we have absolutely no clarity about the specific triggers for lifting, retaining or reimposing restrictions.  In the absence of a clear assessment of the current status and future requirements, the tests provide no clarity.  For example, the critical issue of increased mortality from non-Covid cases has now been identified as a consideration.  What is the current assessment of the extent of these deaths?  How will it be monitored?  At what level will this factor come into play?  It is a very serious issue in terms of the non-Covid stream in our health services, both primary and acute care, the absence of people coming forward and so forth.<\/p>  <p>  In contrast, other countries have been far clearer in saying exactly what they mean when considering pressure on hospital capacity, the replication of the virus in the community, the availability of testing, and other factors.  As we have been pointing out for many weeks, in key areas Ireland has taken a quite limited approach to the publication of real-time data and the quantification of problems.  Following the publication of the framework last Friday, we need to move on and to take a more open and rapid approach to the publication of all data relevant to the five tests.  Different sectors of our society and economy need to be enabled to come forward with specific proposals for how to lift restrictions while respecting public health advice.<\/p>  <p>  Given the amount of time and effort put into preparing for last week's announcement and the fact it was withheld until a wide range of advertising and other publicity activities were ready, it is surprising how many specific issues are not addressed in the document.  The failure to consult the Northern Executive is inexplicable.  It is to be hoped the Taoiseach will clarify that this was an oversight which will not happen again.  This is not an area where high secrecy is required.  In fact, the absence of enough consultation is clear in parts of the document.<\/p>  <p>  The position regarding the leaving certificate is unacceptable.  Every single government in Europe has been confronted with how to complete school leaving examinations and prepare for a new higher education year.  Nowhere has there been such a lack of clarity and confusion.  The fact that the reopening document published last week failed to address it is remarkable.  We are now beyond the stage where clarity must be provided and the Government must be honest about the ability to complete the leaving certificate in the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  On Easter Monday, our spokesperson sought a briefing on the public health advice in regard to examination classes and sittings.  He has never received this, and it is our understanding that the examinations advisory group has also not received such a briefing or such public health advice.  How is it then that arbitrary dates can be bandied about without providing information about the public health limitations for what can and cannot be done?  Why have members of Government talked about starting dates for examinations without any detail on how that can be accomplished?<\/p>  <p>  There is no way of addressing the concerns and preferences of every student but there are basic principles of equity which must be addressed.  In recent days, I have heard from teachers and principals in many parts of the country about how certain students simply are not able to match others in terms of home-based learning.  One principal in a DEIS school told me that his best student has nothing more than a small smartphone to rely on.  Other students have family members testing positive, with obvious implications for their capacity to study given the need for parents to self-isolate.<\/p>  <p>  Policy cannot be set based on assuming that every student has a laptop, a room where they can learn alone and a school which has the resources to teach online.  I am genuinely surprised that nothing has been published so far by the Government assessing what the teaching and learning environment has been for leaving certificate students in the past two months.<\/p> <p>&Oacute; thaobh na hardteistim&eacute;ireachta de, t&aacute; br&uacute; uaf&aacute;sach ar na mic l&eacute;inn faoi l&aacute;thair.

Measaim go bhfuil s&eacute; dodh&eacute;anta.  Ar aon n&oacute;s, t&aacute; s&eacute; in am cinneadh a dh&eacute;anamh agus plean dearfach a chur i bhfeidhm.<\/p> <p> As well as bringing some finality to what is to be done about completing the leaving certificate, there is a need to urgently give guidance and support to the higher education sector.  The financial crisis caused by underfunding in recent years has now been followed by financial meltdown.  The broad dimensions of this are getting clearer as overseas enrolments for next year have effectively disappeared.  One constructive step which could be taken immediately would be to agree to expand the number of available places in third level for leaving certificate students this autumn.  This would help to reduce the impact of the points race and potential disputes involving grades in the event of an alternative emerging.  In many cases, it would also ensure we do not see a reduction in places in important faculties, because of the decline in overseas enrolments, where there is already an excess of qualified candidates applying for places, such as in medicine, finance, computing and other areas.  The failure to show leadership in regard to what is happening with the leaving certificate and higher education must end.  The consultations that were held yesterday need to be maintained on an intensive basis, with hands-on ministerial engagement, with a view to a concrete proposal emerging and being agreed.<\/p> <p> On Saturday, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, announced a range of economic measures and repeated the fact that we are facing a series of economic, employment and budgetary shocks which are unprecedented.  There are more than 1 million people in the country receiving some form of emergency payment today.  This is the highest level of State support ever recorded and anyone who suggests that policy responses should set a new normal is being both misleading and cynical.  No one has suggested that we begin a fiscal retrenchment in order to restore access to lending, but to claim that there are no budgetary concerns whatsoever is empty politics.<\/p> <p> The critical challenge we face is how to restore as much demand and employment as possible and do so as quickly as possible while respecting public health limits.  As I have said during all our recent sessions, the treatment of Debenhams workers is outrageous and unacceptable.  I hope we will hear more detail today about what is being done to make sure some companies do not exploit the pandemic to deny workers and creditors their rights.  Equally, I hope we will have a greater acknowledgement today of the vast majority of businesses which are desperate to hold on to their staff and get back to work as soon as possible.  My party has heard from business owners throughout the country who are doing everything they can to keep their staff and are developing detailed protocols for how to restart and respect health guidelines.<\/p> <p> Unfortunately, we have still not received any information about the impact of the pandemic on State companies and local authorities.  What is the current scale of the financial hit they have taken and how are they to be protected?  Public transport is critical to our society and economy, yet we have heard nothing about how public transports companies are to be helped and what limits they will face before full reopening.  The evidence from throughout Europe is that masks are a critical part of a widespread return to using public transport, and this needs to be addressed here.  There is more than enough public health evidence regarding the benefit of face coverings and no evidence that the supply of personal protective equipment, PPE, will be undermined by introducing a requirement for face coverings in at least certain public situations.  This has been under consideration for long enough.  It is time for a decision.<\/p> <p> This week we begin to restore important parts of parliamentary accountability and oversight.  The national will to fight and overcome the pandemic is as strong as ever.  What we need now is greater clarity and openness in deciding on future steps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700006#D00100","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588851300,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I will speak for several minutes, after which I would like a response from the Taoiseach before I continue.<\/p> <p>I start by sending sympathies to all of the bereaved, extending solidarity to all of the sick and wishing them a full recovery, thanking every worker on the front line and acknowledging the efforts of our people as they live with extraordinary public health restrictions on their lives.  <\/p> <p> I listened with great concern yesterday to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, as he indicated that a cut would be made to the Covid-19 payment and the wage subsidy scheme in June.  To cut or taper these interventions and supports would be wrong.  Such a decision would represent a serious blow to workers and families who have lost their incomes as a result of this pandemic because, as we know, when a person loses a job, he or she still faces the cost of living, bills still need to be paid, money has to be found for the mortgage or the rent, food must be put on the table and children have to be provided and planned for.  Those of us living in the real world know that &euro;350 per week is the bare minimum needed to keep a show on the road.  We know that it is the bare minimum needed to make it to the end of the week.  To cut this payment would be to pull the rug from under the feet of so many and force those who can least afford it to pay for the economic fall-out from this emergency.<\/p> <p> That such move is even being floated at this stage suggests that Fine Gael remains out of touch with the lives of workers and families and those bearing the brunt of this economic shock.  The comments of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, sent a shiver of apprehension down the spines of those who suffered untold hardship as the result of the vicious cuts meted out by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il over the last decade.  Many families were still struggling with the financial impact of their austerity policies from the last recession just as the pandemic hit.  Those people remember the deluge of mean-spirited cuts of that era.  They remember that in the last economic crisis Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il chose to protect the banks and the wealthy and that they chose to punish ordinary workers and families instead.  They lived with the minimum wage being slashed.  They lived with the numerous cuts to child benefit.  They lived with the profound damage done to our public health service and to our housing system.  All of these were slash and burn policies that aimed to service a debt that did not belong to the people.  At the same time as this suffering was heaped on ordinary people, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il managed to ensure tax breaks for the vested interests and massive pay-outs for bondholders.<\/p> <p> It is not lost on anyone that words like \"unaffordable\" and \"unsustainable\" are rattled off and deployed to describe financial measures that benefit ordinary people, but somehow money and resources are always found to preserve the privilege of those at the top.  On the Fine Gael street banks are systemic but securing the livelihood of workers and families would always prove just too expensive.  The reality is that we will have an unemployment crisis well beyond the summer.  Whole sectors of our economy will need more than a couple of months to recover, to get back on their feet and workers will need to be supported and protected.  Workers and their families need stability and certainty.  At this point in time, they do not need announcements from Government that the &euro;350 per week that they currently rely on is to be cut.  Such an action would contradict the promise made at the outset of this crisis that ordinary workers and families would not be thrown overboard on this occasion.  It would signal that the motto, \"We are all in this together\" was just a slogan in the end used to garner public goodwill.  It would provide a telling glimpse of what is in store for workers and families should a Fine Gael-Fianna F&aacute;il Government transpire.<\/p> <p> There can be no return to austerity.  The Taoiseach should be in no doubt that this is his first test.  Will he give a commitment to the D&aacute;il and, more important to workers and their families, that the payment of &euro;350 will be maintained at its current rate and extended beyond June?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700007#E00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588852200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The temporary wage subsidy scheme and the pandemic unemployment payment of &euro;350 per week have protected those who have lost their jobs in a way that was appropriate and was right to do.  I think we all acknowledge that it cannot last forever.  It was an unprecedented action and it is not affordable for it to last forever, and I think the vast majority of people in the country understand that.  However, it will need to continue at least until people have the opportunity to return to their jobs.  For the vast majority, that will not be possible before mid-June, so, yes, it will need to be extended beyond mid-June, and I am happy to say that here in the House today.<\/p>  <p>  I am sorry, though, that Deputy McDonald chose to become so party political in her contributions because what she said was so two-faced and so fundamentally dishonest.  My party, Fine Gael, never cut the minimum wage.  Working with the Labour Party and then with Independents, we increased it by 25% to one of the highest in the world.  What is the minimum wage in Northern Ireland, where Sinn F&eacute;in is in power?  In this jurisdiction, a Government led by my party introduced a pandemic unemployment payment of &euro;350 a week so the people who lost their jobs had some financial security.  What happened in Northern Ireland, where Sinn F&eacute;in is in office?  It is &pound;100 a week, with nothing for the self-employed until June.  Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers on their Facebook site promote the fact that they hand out food parcels to the poor, reminiscent to me of Donald Trump handing out toilet roll after the hurricane hit the islands in the Caribbean.  Sinn F&eacute;in's leader here in this House, Deputy McDonald, is an Opposition party leader.  That is fair enough, and she can criticise what we do and say it is not enough.  She can do that every day but she cannot hide the fact that she is also leader of an all-Ireland party, a party that is in power in Northern Ireland, where the minimum wage is lower than here, where they do not give people &pound;350 a week but they hand out food parcels and boast about it on Facebook.

The other day when I was listening to the radio, Ryan Tubridy was interviewing somebody who asked how Ireland is at the moment.  One of the things he said in a short response is that it is good because our political system listens to health advice.  That struck me as a very simple truth.  It is important and it is a good thing.  Therefore, it is worrying that while there are a lot of good signs, such as the fact the ICU numbers and transmission rates are down, the number of deaths announced yesterday was a real shock.  They are an ongoing shock for everyone.  I understand that today, Dr. Tony Holohan said that if he were to give advice tomorrow on whether we should ease the restrictions as due on 18 May he would be reluctant to do so.  This is a concern.  He said there is still community transmission, and we can see it in the numbers, and this is also a concern.<\/p><p>We hear different things and today I also heard Alastair Campbell in the UK stating we should follow the scientific advice but we need to know the science and the figures.  I say all of this by way of a long introduction to referencing Deputy Howlin, who introduced the open government partnership, as I recall, in 2011.  Following scientific advice and emphasising the capability to provide open government, particularly on information in a scientific way, is very important at this time.<\/p><p>I connect this to another comment made in recent weeks by President Michael D. Higgins who, in a very important article in <i>The Business Post<\/i>, referred to a report from the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, that gives us a map for some of the ways we can manage the recovery.  If it is not running into difficulty, I will quote the President, who said the report provided by NESC is a map for recovery and he asks that we be wise enough to use it.  The reason I am connecting this is because the report refers to two areas of transformation that will help in the recovery.  One is tackling the huge challenge of a reduction in climate emissions and the other is the issue of digitalisation, and how as a country we ensure we deliver a just transition in this as well as in our approach to climate change.  The two are connected.  As we start to manage the opening up of a recovery the report gives us a guide as to where to go.<\/p><p>The President describes the report as being as important as that written by Whitaker on the country going from a closed to an open economy as it steers us on a map to go from being an unsustainable economy to a sustainable economy.  If I were to simplify some of the recommendations in the report, it very much emphasises the need to work at a local level in devising the transformation.  The report reiterates what the European Commission and others have been promoting in Open Innovation 2.0, which has four strands of co-operation, between the State, which is centrally involved, business, academia and local communities and citizens.  I mention this because it is how our recovery will work.  It will start from the bottom up and it is important that we support small and local businesses in particular.  Working with universities, the State, local people and agencies of the State we can and will turn around the economy in a way that uses the solidarity we have shown in response to this crisis.  This is what we need to do.<\/p><p>This relates first and foremost to the health system.  What we have seen in how we have managed our health system over the past two months is an example of how, with innovation, we can be good at this.  The fact we have turned around our health system very quickly and have been able to build new extra capacity in ways we never thought we could have done in the timelines we have done is an example of such innovation.  We also have the use of digital technology and I recall the Taoiseach stating recently how online clinics are now being done in a way they had not been done previously.<\/p> <p>We should maintain that capability.  The fact that, as we introduce contact tracing apps, we have to have the trust and confidence of our people that this is really good digital innovation is going to be critical for managing the continuing suppression of the virus.  I am sorry if this sounds slightly abstract but the ability to innovate and to involve our local communities, businesses, universities and the State in such a four-stranded approach to innovation is going to be the key to recovery.  That starts more than anything else with collaboration in the political space, and co-operation with our local governments and all our parties so that we are all in that collaborative, innovative approach to the recovery ahead of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700010#H00500","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588853400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I have questions and will leave time for some answers.  I refer to the situation of thousands of people in institutional, communal accommodation called direct provision.  I note this in the context of great national and governmental effort to tackle Covid-19 where there has been a massive communication campaign to inform everyone about what they need to do in terms of social distancing and how to protect their health and that of their communities.  It is also in the context of the Government releasing an unprecedented amount of funding to protect people's incomes, their livelihoods and their lives and taking dramatic steps that have never been taken before.  In these contexts, it is particularly difficult to understand the Government's response to people living in direct provision.  My figures tell me that there are 1,800 people still sharing a bedroom with people they are not related to and do not know.  Will the Taoiseach confirm this?<\/p>  <p>  The HSE came up with a new definition of \"household\" to work around Dr. Tony Holohan's advice that social distancing is not possible for people in communal bedrooms such as these.  It would now appear that a \"household\" can mean a group of people who have never met before, are from different countries, speak different languages, did not choose to live with each other and naturally do not have knowledge of each other's movements and activities during the day.  Frankly, it is scandalous in these wider contexts I have outlined that this is happening and that this fudge is being actively implemented.  I spoke to a man this morning who is in desperation trying to comply with social distancing in a direct provision setting.  It is causing great risk to people's health and active damage to their mental health, which in many cases was already under severe strain.  How would we all feel if we were unable to comply with the social distancing measures that have been asked of us in recent weeks?<\/p>  <p>  I understand, although I do not agree with it, that the communal accommodation set-up has been the way in direct provision, but it is inconsistent with public health needs at the moment.  What is more, the fact that a new centre was set up during the pandemic, which forced people into communal bedroom situations, is mind-boggling when we are supposed to be pulling out all the stops.  I have figures of 5,866 people in direct provision and another 1,585 protection applicants in emergency accommodation.  Will the Taoiseach clarify how many of these people have been tested, how many have tested positive, and how many have now been provided with their own bedroom where they can isolate?  The approach to protecting people's health in direct provision is an active failure.  We now have a legal opinion emerging from the Irish Refugee Council contending that it is also a breach of various human rights commitments.  It is not that the Government did not move fast enough or did not understand the reality.  It is that it knew it was not the best approach and carried on anyway.  We must do better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700011#J00200","speaker":"1563"},{"type":"speech","time":1588853400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I am afraid I cannot confirm those exact numbers.  I do not have them in front of me but they may well be correct.  They certainly sound like they are correct.  The definition of a household or a bubble, as some countries term it, is not unique to Ireland.  Essentially from a public health point of view, someone's household or bubble is the people he or she lives with.  It is virtually impossible to maintain a social distance from people we live with.  There are many who share a house with others they are not related to, and they are considered the one household.  There are many who share a room with somebody they are not related to, and they are considered to be the one household or the one bubble.  Because it is not practical to socially distance or isolate oneself from people one lives with, whether in the same house or the same room, such groups are therefore considered to be a household or bubble.  There is no change of definition there.  It was always the definition and it is just common sense from a public health point of view.  It applies whether someone is in direct provision or not.  It does not matter what language a person speaks, his or her household is the people he or she lives with.  If that person shares a room, that is his or her household or bubble.<\/p> <p> On the issue of people who need to be isolated, Citywest is available and people have been isolated there.  There is capacity at the site and also a possibility of isolating people in hotels if necessary.  I do not have exact figures in front of me.  However, I will correspond with Deputy O'Brien and provide the figures to him.<\/p> <p> I do not believe that any Member of this House is of the view that direct provision is a good system.  I absolutely believe it should be one of the objectives of the next Government to put an end to it.  However, that is easier said than done.  There is a shortage of accommodation in the State and it is difficult to predict the number of people in any given week, month or year who will come in from overseas and may need accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700011#J00300","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588854000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I again pay tribute to all our workers who are doing such an amazing job for us at this time, particularly those on the front line.  I offer my condolences and those of my party to all the families who have lost loved ones over the past week.<\/p><p>I will raise four issues with the Taoiseach: I will again refer to the issue of transparency; I will concentrate to a significant degree on secondary non-Covid morbidity, which is a real issue; I will also mention the disability sector, which has been forgotten about; and I will refer to childcare.<\/p><p>Before I begin, I put it to the Taoiseach that the handling of the leaving certificate has been an unmitigated disaster and I ask that he would please intervene.  The stress these students have been put under is intolerable.  This matter needs to be brought to a conclusion.  We need a plan B and it needs to be put out there this week.  That plan needs to be agreed.  The situation cannot be allowed to run beyond this week.  It is unfair and completely wrong.  The way it has been handled by the Department of Education and Skills is evidence of a dysfunctionality that has not been seen in some time.<\/p><p>It is two weeks since I wrote to the Taoiseach asking a number of questions on decision-making relating to NPHET.  He did not really answer my questions so I wrote to him again last week, and he has not replied.  NPHET has not published any minutes for its six most recent meetings.  This practice was meant to stop but it has not.  On the famous testing target, it is interesting that in his letter to me on 29 April the Taoiseach stated that the target of 100,000 tests was set at the NPHET meeting of 14 April.  The minutes of that meeting, however, make no mention of the target.  How could it have been set at that meeting?  The Taoiseach corresponded with me and indicated that is where it happened, but the minutes do not reflect that.  What is going on?  This is deeply concerning.<\/p><p>I have also asked the Taoiseach to publish the letters written by the chief executive and chairman of the HSE to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and his Department.  They have still not been published and I am asking, quite publicly, for the third week in a row &quot;Why not?&quot;  What is the Government afraid of in these letters?<\/p><p>I am becoming worried about the reputation of this Government for transparency when it comes to answering questions, freedom of information, the use of general data protection regulations and the number of times answers are not being given or where people, whether in political our journalistic circles, are being fobbed off.  It is happening too often.<\/p><p>The publication of the road map last Friday was very welcome but the Government was very quick to rule out any divergence in views between it and NPHET.  The Chief Medical Officer and the Minister for Health, at the press conference on Friday evening last, stated that the Government completely followed the plan.  The T&aacute;naiste recently said the same.  Philip Ryan of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>has shown twice this week that this is simply and factually not the case.  This is an undeniable fact now.  I have been trying to get a real insight into the Government's relationship with NPHET, hence all the questions that have not been answered.  I want to know exactly why the Government chose to deviate from the Chief Medical Officer's advice on the wearing of face masks and cocooning.  Others may not have noticed but there were also changes regarding social visits, retail services and, specifically, travel measures across the grid.  I am very concerned about why the Government is afraid to explain all of these.  Why is it afraid to admit that it disagreed with the Chief Medical Officer and with NPHET and did not implement their plan 100%?  NPHET advises and the Government makes decisions.  I do not understand why the Government cannot just admit that and we can all move on.  For me, it is not actually a big deal.  It is, possibly, a good thing.  I am of the view that the Government will have to deviate and take into consideration secondary morbidity and other socioeconomic issues into the future.<\/p> <p>I am concerned and worried about why the Government is not willing to be very open about this.  It has been consistently denied.<\/p> <p> On the issue of face masks, I say pointedly that we need a plan.  The Government needs to give guidance on this.  Its messaging on it has been all over the place.  With secondary morbidity, we face a catastrophic situation unless decisions are made quickly.  As Covid-19, thankfully, becomes more controlled - well done to everybody for all their work - and because of the way society has been socialised around Covid-19, we know that people are dying from deaths that would be preventable in normal circumstances.  A total of 30% of clinical healthcare appointments are not being fulfilled, while there has been a 30% drop in inpatient activity and a 50% decrease in GP referrals to rapid-access clinics.  The UK has made an assessment that an additional 18,000 people will die from cancer.  We have no screening programmes and there are scaled-back diagnostics, trimmed-down community work and a drop-off in mental health and disability services.  I know of one woman who has been told she will have to wait 24 weeks for her colposcopy results.  We have been here before.  We cannot go back there.  That is not acceptable.<\/p> <p> We need a public awareness campaign to ensure people re-engage with the health service.  Patients need to be assured that if they need to go to a GP or hospital appointment, they can do so and it will be safe.  The campaign needs to be backed up by a plan to get our health service moving.  I believe that the roadmap the Government published has a huge gap in it.  It needs a correlation with a plan for how we will get our health service moving in tandem.<\/p> <p> My critical question for the Taoiseach is: who will draw up the plan?  Will it be NPHET or the HSE?  It cannot be NPHET; it must be the HSE.

The latter has a certain mandate and a certain competency but it is the HSE's role to deliver health services in this country, otherwise, the board and governance of the HSE may as well not be there.<\/p>  <p>  A piece missing from the puzzle is the issue of normality.  I fear that in order to get people back to going to their appointments and re-engaging with the health service, the Government will have to look again at the three-week intervals in the roadmap.  I predict that the Taoiseach and the Government will reach a pendulum point in the next few weeks, where non-Covid-19, preventable deaths could outweigh Covid-19 deaths.  This is a matter the Government will have to consider carefully.  How healthcare is performed, how attendances at clinics will be configured, where people will wait and the use of PPE all need to be prepared for and changed.  We also know there is a danger coming down the road in the form of the winter flu.  I ask the Taoiseach, please, to take on our request in the Labour Party to give the flu vaccine for free to everybody next winter.  We cannot countenance dealing with Covid-19 and the flu at the same time.  Please do that.  I think everybody in the House believes that it is a good idea.<\/p>  <p>  There have been an awful lot of good innovations that we need to keep, such as collaboration with GPs, ehealth, and video and telephone consultations.  We also need to ensure we do what Mr. Paul Reid said at the beginning, namely, that we have Sl&aacute;intecare on speed.  The nationalisation of some of our private hospitals for the three-month period has not been optimal, and while that needs to change, it is a good thing that needs to continue.  We need increased bed capacity.  Sl&aacute;intecare identified that and this is the quickest way of doing it.  I have to say I cringed when I saw on \"Prime Time\" a certain consultant who said he did not care really - he was agnostic - about which door patients came through, whether public or private, for treatment at his clinic.  That same consultant has not signed up to work under the current Covid-19 arrangements.  I dare say that consultant would care if a patient could not pay.  That needs to change.<\/p>  <p>  On disability services, we have taken our eye off the ball, collectively.<\/p> <p>I am hearing that many people with intellectual disabilities are suffering greatly.  The lack of assurance on when day services and specialised services will come back into place needs to be addressed immediately.  Many of these people have underlying illnesses.<\/p> <p> The Government has not yet got its head around childcare provision.  Eight weeks ago, I saw the Minister for Health's plan for this area.  In fairness to the Minister, he showed me the plan.  It is not acceptable that it has taken this length of time.  It is also unacceptable that the detail of the plan has not been worked out by now.  The plan for childcare facilities to open in intervals is not acceptable.  It will not work because we need to mobilise and get people into a normal system again.  The way childcare is being phased in will have to be brought forward.<\/p> <p> The Government needs to consider extending maternity leave for women who have had children and are currently availing of this leave.  We are not in a normal situation whereby children have been with their parents for a considerable period.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider extending maternity leave in some way in order that these parents can look at how childcare provision can be brought about and can embrace this period with their children.  There will be an issue with some childcare providers taking on young babies in the current circumstances.

That is the way to control the virus.  The Taoiseach can quote figures from other countries but other countries are using different strategies.  We should look at the other island countries that have been using very successful strategies, such as New Zealand and Iceland which clamped down completely on traffic in and out of the country.  We did the opposite and we made serious mistakes in allowing travel from particularly dangerous areas to continue unabated.  To a large extent, we are still allowing that to happen, with movement of people back and forth.  We saw in a news bulletin yesterday a report about an Aer Lingus flight where social distancing was not respected.<\/p>  <p>Is this continuing?  How many people are coming into this country in those circumstances?  Where are they coming from?  Weak arrangements have been put in place at our airports in terms of handing out a leaflet and asking people to give details and their telephone number, but people are simply not co-operating with that.<\/p> <p> Our strategy, for better or worse, is a test, trace and isolate strategy.  I do not know why the Taoiseach is playing that down so much, why he has not been upfront in telling us what the situation is with the numbers and the reasons we have not met the target numbers we were supposed to reach weeks ago and why he will not explain to us and the general public what the issues are with that.  I noticed last week, when public attention was focusing on this, that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health went out of their way to clarify that they were not talking about 15,000 tests per day but a capacity to do 15,000 tests per day.  Why is the Taoiseach making that distinction?  All the medical advice is that we need to be testing at least 15,000 per day and we need to be able to trace quickly and isolate where necessary.  Why is the Taoiseach going against medical advice in that regard?  Why is he not explaining what the position is with that strategy?<\/p> <p> The Chief Medical Officer, CMO, has made it clear that there is an adequate level of testing taking place in hospitals and in respect of healthcare staff and, belatedly, staff and residents in nursing homes.  The difficulty is, as the CMO has pointed out, that we do not understand the behaviour of the virus at community level, and we will not be able to understand it until there is an adequate level of testing and tracing.  We are very far from getting on top of this virus.  The CMO has said we must be doing that number of tests and getting the results very quickly.  The difficulty with proceeding with the roadmap is that the three week spacing the Taoiseach is proposing between the different phases will not allow time under the current arrangements for cases to be detected, tested, traced and isolated.  We will not have that data back in order to determine whether it is safe to continue to the next stage.<\/p> <p> A number of prominent medics and scientists in this country have said that it is likely there are hundreds of thousands of cases in the community here.  We have no handle on those numbers at present.  All we know is the narrow number of people who have been tested.  We know something about their cases, but we know nothing about community cases.  I believe the Taoiseach is jumping the gun in this regard.  Everybody likes to have good news and to talk about returning to normal, but we do not have the right strategy to allow us to do that safely.  The big fear is that there will be a second wave of the virus, which would be a disaster for everybody.  It would be a disaster for our health, our jobs and our business.  Just try telling people three or six weeks into the roadmap that we have to go back to stage 1, which is what we will have to do unless we get the strategy right.<\/p> <p> We talk about this and then we look at what is happening in the real world.  The Government put in place a very expensive infrastructure for testing and tracing.  It recruited hundreds of thousands of people to engage in that important work.  However, in recent weeks many of the test centres have been closed down.  In fact, the big ones such as Croke Park and Tallaght Stadium were closed all weekend and for a half day on Tuesday.  Can the Taoiseach explain why this is happening?  This is the most urgent thing we must do, yet we are standing down staff who are ready and able to do that important work.<\/p> <p>Places are closed.  As far as I understand it, most of the test centres are working at a capacity of about 50% to 60%.  Why is that?  At a time when we desperately need to do more testing, why is that not being done?  Will the Taoiseach please explain that today?  It is fundamental to everything else that is being done.  What is happening puzzles me greatly.  I do not know whether anybody can explain why, when we need to test and trace, these are not happening.<\/p> <p> On the roadmap, I am really concerned that there is no accountability and transparency regarding those criteria that will be used for moving on to the next stage.  I will leave the Taoiseach the next two minutes to explain why it seems he is not prepared to pursue this strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700014#M01800","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588855800,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.

I do not believe New Zealand is comparable.  It is in the southern hemisphere.  We are in western Europe, which is the epicentre of the virus.  New Zealand is a 3.5-hour flight from Australia, which is even less affected than it.  It has even fewer cases per head of population  We share a land border and a common travel area with the United Kingdom, and we are part of the European Union.  The flight the Deputy mentioned is a perfect example of how we are different.  It was a flight between London and Belfast, a flight within the United Kingdom, and a flight we had no control over.  The only way we could have stopped people on that flight travelling to just this jurisdiction would be to seal the land border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.

We also call in our petition for the payment to be extended to groups that have been unfairly excluded, most notably those over 66, those under 18 and those in the gig economy and precarious work.  Furthermore, we call for a review because we believe the figure of &euro;350, to which the Government was forced to increase the payment, was an admission that it really is impossible for people to live any kind of dignified existence on a payment below that amount.  As Social Justice Ireland have pointed out, a great number of pensioners, jobseekers and people on disability are effectively living on poverty payments.<\/p>  <p>  I am looking for that commitment, particularly in response to the clear hints that have been coming from the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Ms Regina Doherty, about cuts or a tapering of the Covid payment.  Would it not be completely unjust to cut further the income of workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own before this pandemic and the full economic impact of job losses are overcome?

That is how we came up with the figure of 70%.  What we originally wanted to do was to give people 70% of what they earned before but it was not possible to administer that.  People would have waited weeks for any payment at all, so we decided on a round figure.  That has created an anomaly.  There are a lot of people, possibly 25% of people, in receipt of the payment who are actually getting paid more now in their pandemic employment payment than they were when they were working.  They are mainly part-time workers.  It is not a bad thing.  I am not embarrassed about that.

One is Knockeen nursing home run by Mary and Nicola Doran who are renowned for providing the highest standard of care to their residents.  Unfortunately, Nicola Doran found she had to speak out in the <i>Wexford People<\/i>this week.  The headline of the newspaper stated that testing at nursing homes was a &quot;farce&quot;.  Testing took place at Knockeen nursing home on 24 April and it waited 13 days on the test results.  In a bizarre twist, on 29 March, a member of staff in the HSE told Nicola Doran that the HSE had the results but staff were not at liberty to give them out.  Within 24 hours of publication of the report in the <i>Wexford People<\/i>, the results were made available and, thankfully, they were clear.  The situation caused extreme and needless stress for the owners who were concerned to know that they did not have Covid-19 in the nursing home, the staff, many of whom are living with people who are compromised, and the families of the residents who were beside themselves with worry wondering whether their parents were in a home with Covid-19 and whether they could possibly be infected.<\/p> <p>Daily in the national media, Government spokespersons tell us that nursing home testing is being turned around in 48 hours.  Neither I nor anyone I have spoken to within the medical fraternity or politics has experience of any nursing home being in receipt of results within such a timeframe.  Can the Taoiseach confirm to the House that all testing for nursing homes will be completed and turned around within 24 hours?  After all, the national public health emergency team and the HSE have had eight weeks to get it right.  The nursing homes that have borne the brunt of the questionable decisions of the State deserve at least the courtesy of knowing what the test results are in a timely fashion.<\/p> <p> Many physicians and doctors that I have been in touch with are completely frustrated with the testing process.  They tell me that most of the testing to date has been an absolute waste.  This follows from what Deputy Shortall and possibly Deputy Kelly had in mind.  The test results have been so old that it has been impossible to trace all the contacts of those who tested positive.  As far as we are aware, the idea behind the model of \"test, trace and isolate\" is that this will be done in an immediate fashion.  The Taoiseach has said that we now have the capacity to test 12,000 people.  However, the real question is the capacity to have 12,000 results turned around in 24 hours.  Can the Taoiseach confirm the numbers of tests we have?  I gather the Taoiseach has already referred to a figure of 12,000 today.  What is the turnaround time of delivering the results in 48 hours?  What numbers are traced as a result of the positive tests already confirmed?  Can the Taoiseach tell us how many people who tested positive recovered before they got their results?  We will require these figures to be published to instil confidence and transparency.<\/p> <p> I was pleased to see the roadmap.  When it was produced it gave hope to people on an eventual easing of the restrictions.  However, I believe the roadmap has not addressed the calamity of testing.  I believe it was a missed opportunity.  Again, no defined targets have been laid down for the HSE in respect of testing.  A roadmap is like a house, and we cannot build a house without foundations.  What we need is a testing roadmap with defined targets and deadlines for a testing regime, to underpin the opening of the Government roadmap.  People want a clear vision of where they need to be.  People want to see a trigger for each phased move forwards or backwards.  Equally, there is no mention of a containment strategy.  All of these things are fundamental to the success of the Government roadmap.  I accept that we both know there have been issues in respect of reagents, personal protective equipment and the capacity at laboratories.  However, the Taoiseach must also know that without a roadmap for testing that sets down defined targets to address and ensure results are turned around within 24 or 48 hours, the roadmap leads to a cul-de-sac.  We have had eight weeks of lockdown.  The public have played their part and they need clarity on testing.

After all, I think we are all well aware that politicians make the decisions based on the medical advice.  That is all I am saying.

Cash flow is the biggest problem for any business.  When a small to medium-sized business comes out on 18 May, it will start back into work.  Companies are paying fixed costs, insurance, leasing costs and rates.  The Taoiseach said rates will be written off for three months, but still these companies are coming back into a time when they will have to pay rates again.  Some of the companies I am talking about are paying &euro;8,000 and &euro;9,000 a month between all their charges.<\/p> <p>Similar to what happened during the most recent economic crash, credit insurers have insisted that no credit be extended to any supplier.  To restart any business, a business owner will need to have eight weeks worth of wages, eight weeks of fixed costs and four weeks of materials.  The banks replied on this issue and stated that they are inundated and short of staff.  Applicants who applied up to six weeks ago have been told that the staff are working from home with little or no Internet coverage and no link to departments.  The banks also stated that they are owned by the State and that the stringent policies are too tight, and hinder and prolong decision-making.  We need a plan to restart companies and put proper mechanisms in place for them.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Finance said two weeks ago in the House that there are five major banks.  He forgot to mention the credit unions.  The five major banks froze payments on loans for three months but customers will still have to make them in their entirety within the term of the loan.  Credit unions were the only financial institutions that extended terms of loans by three months and gave a full break to the people and businesses of Ireland.  Credit unions are being over-regulated while the banks are getting extra.<\/p> <p> Dentists have been treated badly during this crisis.  Hospitals and the HSE closed their clinics on 16 March and dentists were told to keep working.  They were offered no PPE and, if they had to source it, were unable to.

The national broadband plan estimates that there are 540,000 rural premises with little or no Internet service.  In Limerick alone, 21,024 houses and businesses have no Internet access.  It might be fine for people in Dublin, or other large cities, where Internet coverage is available but, for some people in rural areas, especially Limerick, there is no Internet so those people have no businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700020#S00700","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588858800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>The Deputy is absolutely right in his initial comments that businesses need money to restart.

Some 80% of businesses in Ireland pay less than &euro;10,000 a year in rates so this is particularly advantageous for those small shops and businesses that we all want to see up and running really quickly because they are the ones that employ considerable numbers of people around the country, particularly in rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the temporary wage subsidy scheme, which will continue, and the credit guarantee scheme, which will give loans at favourable rates to viable businesses that will be able to pay them back.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance is in contact with the banks all the time and I hope to meet them myself in the next couple of weeks, if not the next couple of days.

I have a couple of questions that I will try to fit into the next five minutes.  I will focus my questions on the main pillars of our country, namely, the farming, fishing and tourism sectors.  The constituency I represent of Cork South-West is totally dependent on those sectors to survive but, for that to happen, the Government will have to dramatically step up its efforts.  Farmers have been in crisis for a lengthy period but the current crisis could well result in hundreds of farmers being wiped out of business.  The fast solution for farmers lies inside meat factory gates.<\/p> <p>I ask the Taoiseach to intervene and stand up to the superpowers inside that factory gate to ensure the survival of those farmers.<\/p> <p> In terms of my first question, the fishing industry is floating closely to the edge.  Trawlers as well as inshore fishing boats are parked up to the pier, some of the vessels costing millions of euro.  Many Irish fishermen and fisherwomen face ruin unless aid is given.  Those people cannot survive on the &euro;350 Covid-19 payment.  What plan has the Taoiseach in place for those Irish trawler owners and inshore fishermen and fisherwomen?  Also, are the current discussions between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael giving serious consideration to having a stand-alone senior Minister for fisheries in the new Government being set up?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700021#T00300","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588859100,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

They are desperately needed for many businesses in my constituency of Cork South-West, as they are for others throughout the country, but from what I can gather they are dependent on a new Government being put in place.  Our country is hugely dependent on tourism.  Brilliant initiatives such as the Wild Atlantic Way lie in tatters, and the job losses in this sector are running at more than 200,000.  We see today that a large percentage of people flying into Ireland are not filling in the form asking them how they intend to socially isolate for two weeks.  We need to allay any fears in tourism communities, and that can be done if the completion of these forms was mandatory in airports and ports.  We need to open the tourist communities and that can be done if rules can be met.  Small retail businesses in smaller towns and villages are suffering as the big multinational supermarkets are wiping them out.  Garden centres cannot open but large supermarkets can sell garden centre products every day.  Small retail clothes shops in towns must remain closed while the large multinational shop can sell clothing every day, which will make it even more difficult for the small retail shops to reopen, no matter what we do.<\/p>  <p>  My questions are on tourism.  I welcome any moves that VAT on tourism could be reduced to 0%.  I totally opposed the Government's proposal in the last budget, which was supported by Fianna F&aacute;il, to raise the VAT rate on tourism from 9% to 13.5%.  That was prior to the Covid-19 outbreak.  That led to numerous restaurants and caf&eacute;s closing their doors in west Cork.  Yesterday, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Griffin, sought support for a 0% tourism VAT rate.  Is the Taoiseach seriously considering that?  Will he consider having a stand-alone Minister for tourism in the future Government?  Also, has there been any discussion on the creation of a new tourism task force on which there would be voices from areas of west Cork and other strong tourism communities?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700022#U00300","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1588859100,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  As is often the case, the Deputy suggested two new stand-alone Ministries but did not enlighten us as to which two stand-alone Ministries he would wish to abolish to make that possible.

I would be interested to know whether it is rural affairs, agriculture, children and youth affairs or which Ministries Deputy Collins would wish to abolish.  He may wish to tell us.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the airport forms, they are not yet mandatory.  They may well need to become mandatory.  That is something we are considering at the moment, but I disagree with the Deputy.  Making it mandatory for people to fill in forms to self-isolate for 14 days when they come to the country is not good for tourism.  People will not come to Ireland if they have to isolate for 14 days.  We need to get to the point where we can have air travel start again.  I want air travel to start again for business and leisure but that will have to be done safely.  That is being worked on at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  Reducing VAT on the tourism and hospitality sector to 0% would be contrary to the EU VAT directive, so that is not possible for as long as we are a member of the European Union.

The question relates to children with autism and special needs of all sorts.  I understand the Taoiseach is in receipt of a letter from a man who describes himself as a professional but is not writing in that capacity but in a personal capacity in regard to his child, aged 13, with autism.  He is speaking not for himself and he recognises that, in a sense, he is in a privileged position in that he and his family are relatively well off.  He is highlighting the fact that no provision at all has been made for children with disabilities.  He says in his letter, which I am sure the Taoiseach has read:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe have been holding onto the hope that there must surely be some recognition of the need for some relief for this group in the first stage of lifting social restrictions.  They are amongst the most vulnerable people in our society.  It is a grim indictment of us as a nation that their education and welfare appears to be have been cast aside for six months without a documented rationale or justification for an intended good. <\/blockquote>  <p>I draw attention to the writer's reference to &quot;without a documented rationale or justification&quot;.  There have been many such letters.  Another correspondent said of their child with severe learning disability and epilepsy, who is non-verbal and doubly incontinent, that the child &quot;needs and breathes routine, structure and certainty&quot;.  What impact analysis has been done on the decision to ignore this part of our society?  What voice is on the expert committee to speak for these people?<\/p><p>In regard to testing, I absolutely agree with Deputy Shortall's comments.  We talk about misinformation, but the best way to deal with misinformation is with accountability, openness and facts.  We had four testing centres in Galway but now there are only three.  We were told by the World Health Organization to test, test, test.  That has not happened, not for clinical reasons but because we simply did not rise to it in terms of structure and money.<\/p><p>This situation did not come upon us from nowhere.  We prepared in 2007 for a flu pandemic.  I understand there was an exchange last December between Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and the Taoiseach regarding an emergency co-ordination centre and an emergency plan.  The Taoiseach said at the time that such a plan was imminent.  What happened to that plan?

The science and the evidence is clear.  There are issues around how we wear them, but not whether or not we wear them.  There are concerns around supply and cost, but homemade masks require a needle, thread, a piece of material and, for some of us, a little tuition from YouTube.  A group of volunteers from Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon and Donegal, known as North West Sews Masks and Gowns, has supplied 500 scrubs and 4,000 masks nationwide with the help of the Garda.  They have fund-raised and they and other groups would be willing to upscale.  This work could provide a small income stream for some people.  How soon can we expect guidance on masks?<\/p>  <p>  My second question relates to the public health passenger locator form, on which the Taoiseach earlier responded to a question.  It is important to emphasise that Irish citizens are not allowed to travel more than 5 km from their own homes.  If it is not proposed to enact legislation to require incoming passengers to sign this form, how is it proposed to close that gaping hole in the containment strategy for Covid-19?<\/p>  <p>  My third question relates to our local authorities, many of which are on their knees in terms of resources.  This is due not only to the collapse in rates payments for three months, which it will take until year end to sort out, but the collapse in other revenues such as parking charges, planning application charges and so on.  All of this income has disappeared.  There are also increased costs around Covid-19.  I take this opportunity to thank our local authorities for the sterling work they have done in this instance.

Some scientists speak about it with great certainty, but within the expert advisory group, the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, the World Health Organization, WHO, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, one hears different advice because there is not a scientific consensus on this matter.  The research that has been done has largely been done in healthcare settings, not in the community, and it has been done more generally and not specific to SARS-CoV-2 and therein lies the difficulty.  The advice currently from NPHET is that healthcare workers should wear a face mask and that those with symptoms should do likewise.  NPHET is currently considering whether to extend that advice more widely.  There are different types of masks, including surgical masks, respirator masks, face coverings and we do have to bear in mind the risk of a lack of supply.  We do not currently have a problem with the supply of face masks but if we ask people to wear two, three or four of them a day, having 16 million per day available will be difficult.  It is not the slam-dunk that the Deputy may suggest it is, but it is something that is very much under consideration by the National Public Health Emergency Team.<\/p>  <p>  On the passenger arrival form, we are considering regulations to make that mandatory.  Primary legislation is not required.  It is possible for the Minister for Health to make regulations under existing legislation and that is under consideration.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy made a very good point about local authorities being under some difficulty with their funding arrangements.  The three months' rates waiver will help them because they will get that money from central government.  They will actually get more than they would have taken in because there is never 100% payment of rates.  We will be giving them 100% so that will be a bit of a cash boost to them.  I fully appreciate that they are going to have other lost revenues in other areas and we will work with them on that.<\/p>  <p>  I need to be frank with people, be that individuals, businesses, public bodies, local authorities or State agencies, it may not be possible for the taxpayer to compensate everyone for everything that is lost.

The withdrawal agreement provides the basis for the immediate way ahead.  It has put in place the transition period that runs to the end of this year.  This means that the UK, though no longer an EU member, is treated as a member of the Single Market and customs union.  It protects EU and UK citizens and businesses and provides continuity while negotiations are under way to agree the basis for a new relationship.<\/p>  <p>  Through the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, it upholds measures to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and to protect the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland's place in it.  This is why it is important that, over this period, we see the full implementation of the withdrawal agreement and the protocol.  As Michel Barnier has said, the faithful and effective implementation of the withdrawal agreement is \"absolutely central\" to the progress of the negotiations.  This is key to protecting citizens and to ensuring peace and stability in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  For the EU, Brexit represents a substantive change in our relationship with our closest neighbour.  This is especially true for Ireland.  It will fundamentally affect how we co-operate and do business together across many areas.  To meet this challenge, over the coming months we have three broad interrelated streams of work, which I would like to address: first, future partnership negotiations; second, implementation of the existing withdrawal agreement; and, third, readiness work for the end of transition, whatever that may bring.<\/p>  <p>  EU-UK negotiations have now begun on the future relationship, with two rounds having taken place so far.  The most recent was from 18 to 22 April.  As with so many areas, Covid-19 has created serious challenges.  The second round of negotiations was delayed and meetings were eventually held by video conference.  Further rounds are scheduled for next Monday, 11 May, and 1 June.  These negotiations are between the Commission task force, led by Michel Barnier on behalf of the 27 member states, and the UK, led by chief negotiator, David Frost.  They address a broad range of issues across 11 \"tables\", from trade in goods and services to transport and energy, from law enforcement to mobility, and many other issues.  They also include important cross-cutting elements on level playing field and governance which are necessary to protect fair and open competition in any future EU-UK relationship.  This is especially important given the proximity and depth of the trading relationship.  The deal the EU is offering the UK is unique.<\/p> <p>It is an unprecedented and broad economic partnership with zero tariffs and zero quotas on goods entering the Single Market, which is home to 450 million people.<\/p> <p> The EU negotiating mandate was agreed at the General Affairs Council on 25 February.  It reflects the breadth and ambition on the part of the EU for a close and deep partnership with the UK, providing a generous and fair foundation on which a new EU-UK relationship can be built.  Of particular importance for Ireland is that the mandate maintains a focus on protecting the Good Friday Agreement and ensuring that issues arising from Ireland's unique geographic situation are addressed, as well as the common travel area.  Protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process in all circumstances continue to be key priorities for Ireland.  These priorities are shared by our EU partners and are also well understood by them.  However, the limited level of ambition for the future partnership on the UK side will influence what it is possible to achieve.<\/p> <p> Ireland is working as part of the EU 27 to ensure that our collective approach to these negotiations reflects our values and interests.  Ireland inputted into these discussions to ensure that our priorities were reflected in terms of a free trade agreement with strong level playing field provisions, fisheries, transport arrangements and police and judicial co-operation.  The atmosphere of the talks has been relatively constructive.  However, following the second round of negotiations, Michel Barnier has been clear that significant gaps remain between the two sides on a number of fundamental issues.  These include a level playing field, criminal justice and law enforcement co-operation, overall governance in relation to the implementation and maintenance of any agreement and, of course, fisheries.  He said that while serious difficulties lie ahead, with political will, realism and mutual respect they can be surmounted.<\/p> <p> More progress is needed for June, when the EU and UK will jointly take stock of the negotiations, as well as the implementation of the withdrawal agreement, ahead of a high-level conference with the UK at the end of June.  Michel Barnier has emphasised that clear evidence is needed that the UK is advancing work on the agreed procedures and controls needed to operationalise the protocol.  I spoke with Michel Barnier on Monday in advance of further future partnership negotiations next week.  The Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and I remain in contact with our colleagues in other EU member states as well as with the UK.<\/p> <p> Time is tight, even more so given the challenges Covid-19 imposes.  There have been calls for an extension to the transition period, including from significant sectors in the UK.  Under the withdrawal agreement, such a decision, which is one to be made jointly between the EU and the UK, must be taken by 30 June.  At this stage, it is not helpful to speculate.  However, the UK Government has repeatedly stated that the transition period will end on 31 December and that it will not seek an extension.  As a consequence, we continue to work to be ready for that date.<\/p> <p> Work towards the implementation of the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland, has now begun.  Whatever the outcome of the current negotiations, the protocol will apply from the end of transition and it is important to say this.  No deal on a trade agreement at the end of transition will not be the same as no deal if it happened before a withdrawal agreement was signed up to but it would still be hugely disruptive from a trade perspective.  This ensures that we will avoid a hard border on this island come what may, protect the gains of the Good Friday Agreement and safeguard the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland's place in it.<\/p> <p> This work will be carried forward through the joint committee, which held its first meeting on 30 March, and the specialised committee, which specifically focuses on the implementation of the Irish and Northern Irish protocol and which met on 30 April.  Ireland participated in both meetings as part of the EU delegation.  Discussions took place in a constructive atmosphere.  The specialised committee took stock of work needed regarding implementation.  Both sides agreed on establishing the joint consultative working group, which will provide a forum for discussion and information exchange in the application of the protocol.<\/p> <p>Ireland welcomes these important steps.<\/p> <p> Full implementation of what was agreed by the EU and the UK in the withdrawal agreement and the protocol is fundamental for all EU member states.  A new partnership can only be built on the full and effective implementation of the withdrawal agreement and the protocol.  The Commission last week published a paper which considers some of the practical steps that will be needed in the period ahead to implement the protocol.  The protocol must be operational at the end of the transition period.  That is important.  It is critical, therefore, that work moves forward to put practical operational arrangements in place to implement the protocol.  These must be communicated to economic operators in good time so they can also prepare.  Clarity on this work is particularly important to give reassurance and certainty, particularly given all of the uncertainty that is linked with Covid-19 at the same time.<\/p> <p> As already stated, some details will be finalised in the period ahead, including through the work of the joint and specialised committees.  However, the broad outline of what is necessary is already clear.  In many ways, these committees are about implementation, not any form of re-negotiation.  That is for sure.  This must include action to back up the important commitments in the protocol on continuity of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity, as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  I welcome the fact that the UK has stated that it will respect all its legal undertakings under the withdrawal agreement.  It reiterated this at the meetings of the joint and specialised committees.  It is important to state that because it is a very significant confirmation of the intent of the British Government.<\/p> <p> Implementation of the protocol will mean some changes, however.  Northern Ireland will remain in the UK customs territory but will continue to apply the rules of the European Union customs code and relevant EU legislation.  The Commission has been clear that there will be a need for checks, some of which already exist, on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.  At the same time, it is important that the implementation of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland works for Northern Ireland, and for the all-island economy as a whole, in as smooth a manner as possible.  Deputies will have seen commentary on the question of an EU office in Belfast.  Article 12 of the protocol provides for EU representatives to be present for activities relating to the application and implementation of the protocol.  I hope, and am confident, that agreement can be reached through the specialised and joint committees on how the EU involvement envisaged in the protocol can operate in an appropriate and sensible way.  The framework is there to reach agreement once the practical implementation approach of the UK is clearer, and that is the step we need to focus on now.  On other specialised committees, over the coming weeks the work of the other specialised committees will also be taken forward.  This includes work relating to citizens' rights, financial commitments under the withdrawal agreement, Gibraltar and the sovereign air bases in Cyprus.  Ireland will be paying close attention to this work, as it impacts on our interests also.<\/p> <p> In terms of readiness, Brexit comes at a time when businesses are already struggling in the face of the challenges brought about by Covid-19.  With less than seven months to the end of transition period, we remain committed to doing everything in our power to ensure that citizens and businesses are as ready as they can be for the end of transition.  The Government moved swiftly and decisively in terms of Covid-19-related supports to businesses.  Brexit preparation will necessarily be part of a wider business recovery agenda and we will look at how best business supports can be deployed in the context of Brexit challenges also.  However, the UK has left the EU.  At the end of the transition period, the UK will leave the customs union and Single Market.  Even the best possible free trade agreement between the EU and UK will impact supply chains and trade flows and result in checks and controls in both directions on EU-UK trade and across the Irish Sea.  Earlier today, I hosted a meeting of the Brexit stakeholders forum which provided an opportunity to hear from business representatives on how we can assist their members in the coming months.  Supporting supply chains and trade flows remains a priority.  Significant investment in infrastructure and systems in our ports and airports continues.<\/p> <p>I have discussed the UK landbridge with Michel Barnier and he understands the importance of safeguarding this important route to market, which is into the rest of the EU.  The Government's preparedness work will be closely aligned with progress on the negotiations and will evolve as elements of a deal become clearer.  As the talks progress, we will roll out communications programmes covering specific areas.  As before, Departments and agencies will continue to meet with key stakeholders.<\/p> <p> Until the conclusion of the transition period at the end of 2020, there will not be immediate changes for business and citizens but, make no mistake, that change is coming and we need to be ready for it.  Ireland faces these changes with the mutual solidarity and support of our EU partners and with all of the strength that EU membership brings.  As we progress the negotiations on EU-UK future relations, and the implementation of the protocol, managing Brexit will remain a priority for the foreseeable future.  We are determined to rebuild, strengthen and re-energise relationships North-South and east-west, for the benefit of all our businesses, and all our people.<\/p> <p> The Government will ensure that Ireland's interests are advanced during the period ahead and that intensive work continues to prepare Ireland for our post-transition relationship with the UK.<\/p> <p> The challenges we face in the context of Covid-19 make Brexit even more complicated in some ways.  It also raises the stakes even higher, if they were not high enough already.  The idea that we would knowingly allow a second significant negative impact on our economy and our trading opportunities with our closest neighbour after the impact of Covid-19, which has been and will continue to be significant, by not managing to agree a sensible trading arrangement between the EU and the UK is something that will focus minds in the months ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700025#BB00400","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588861500,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Bogaimid ar aghaidh go dt&iacute; Fianna F&aacute;il.

As the T&aacute;naiste said, Brexit has not gone away and it is far from done.  The impending deadline of 1 July, the date by which the UK must decide if it wants to extend the transition period by either one or two years, has brought the issue back into sharp focus.  The revised withdrawal agreement, agreed in October 2019, was in many respects only the end of the beginning.  Even that is not fully resolved.  Disagreements have emerged around the need for an EU office in Belfast.  Fianna F&aacute;il is concerned about the lack of progress by the UK Government in implementing the protocol on Northern Ireland and providing a detailed timetable on same.  There can be no backsliding on the protocol and commitments given to avoid a hard border on this island.  All the while, a deal on the future relationship needs to be agreed.  The future relationship is more than just an agreement on trade in goods.  Several other issues must also be considered, including fisheries, level playing field provisions, transport, energy co-operation and law enforcement.  The deadline set for all of this to be agreed is the end of December 2020.  However, to allow for ratification the trade agreement should be ready well ahead of the end of the transition period.  This was always an ambitious if somewhat unrealistic deadline.  I believe that the very most we can hope for is a bare bones agreement in that timeframe.  There would be no winners if that is the case.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes an extension to the transition period is required, even more so now because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the subsequent delay to the negotiations and the fundamentally altered economic landscape.<\/p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of the second round of negotiations Michel Barnier questioned the ability to achieve \"an intelligent agreement that limits the shock that the UK's departure from the Single Market and Customs Union will entail.\"<\/p> <p>He also noted that the United Kingdom refused to engage seriously on a number of fundamental issues and there were four areas in which progress was disappointing, namely, level playing field provisions, overall governance on the future relationship, police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters, and fisheries.<\/p> <p> In this context, it is imprudent and short-sighted of the UK Government not to request an extension to the transition period.  We are where we are, however, and while in the weeks ahead every effort must be made to reach a consensus between the EU and the UK on this issue, contingency planning must continue apace for all Brexit scenarios.  Businesses in the agrifood, tourism and hospitality sectors, among others, have received a hammer blow in recent weeks because of the pandemic, and the prospect of a hard or even no-deal Brexit coming down the tracks in the months ahead is frightening.  In its first quarterly bulletin of 2020, published before the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Central Bank found that even a basic free trade agreement would still imply significantly higher trade frictions than exist today and estimated that a transition to an EU-UK free trade agreement after 2020 would lower Irish output by approximately 3.5% in the long run.  The Covid-19 pandemic could very well make these predictions much worse, as more than 1 million people are now relying on State support for some or all of their income.  The Department of Finance expects that gross domestic product will fall by 10.5% this year and that the unemployment rate could hit 22%.  A hard Brexit would be nothing short of Armageddon for the thousands of businesses already on life support.<\/p> <p> Therefore, Ireland must continue with contingency planning and seek EU support for vulnerable sectors.  We must ensure that level playing field provisions remain a central tenet of the negotiations, push for a comprehensive free trade agreement that protects the all-island economy, and ensure that the protocol on Northern Ireland is implemented in full.  There is much at stake and there is no time to lose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700028#EE00300","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588861800,"counter":115,"content":"<p>T&aacute;im bu&iacute;och as an deis labhairt ar cheist an Bhreatimeachta.  An tseachtain seo, d&uacute;irt aire de chuid Rialtas na Breataine, Michael Gove, nach mbeidh s&iacute;neadh ar bith leis an d&aacute;ta 31 Nollaig i mbliana.  Cuireann s&eacute; sin imn&iacute; orainn i Sinn F&eacute;in mar t&aacute; a fhios againn nach bhfuil dul chun cinn maith &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh sna cainteanna.<\/p>  <p>  This week the British Minister for the Cabinet Office, Michael Gove, ruled out an extension to the transition period that will end on 31 December later this year, again setting Britain on a collision course with the EU and Ireland towards a no-deal Brexit.  As we deal with the public health threat and the economic damage caused by the Covid-19 outbreak, the threat that a hard Brexit poses to Ireland, its people and their livelihoods has not disappeared and is very real.  The timelines to negotiate a future trade deal with the British Government are becoming shorter by the day, with Michel Barnier stating at a press conference last month that never in the history of such important negotiations with any third country have we been under such time pressure, with no progress made since then.  Mr. Barnier also noted the intransigence displayed by the British Government on issues such as justice, fisheries, rules and standards, undermining commitments given by both sides in the political declaration.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste earlier admitted that progress has not been good in the most recent round of negotiations, warning we could reach another crisis point in the negotiations.  Given that we are under the terms of the withdrawal agreement, an extension of the transition period must be agreed before 1 July of this year.  I am sure that earlier today the T&aacute;naiste heard the EU Commissioner, Phil Hogan, say on national radio that there is no real sign the British are approaching the negotiations with a plan to succeed, and he is somebody involved in the negotiations along with Michel Barnier.<\/p> <p>We need to acknowledge that we have reached a real crisis point, a fact that has been obscured by the separate crisis we face from Covid-19.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will address and has addressed the progress that has been made in specific areas of negotiation but can we all agree that given the unprecedented challenges we are facing from the pandemic, the intransigence of the British Government in recent negotiations and the grave threat it poses to jobs and livelihood across the island, we need to impress on our colleagues in the British Parliament and the British Prime Minister the need to seek an extension to the transition arrangements and that such an extension needs to be sought without delay?  With the deadline for an extension less than two months away, this must be a priority for this Government and for our European partners.  Without such an extension in place, we potentially face another cliff edge which would devastate our economy and which threatens supply chains.  That would not be good at any time but given the situation we find ourselves in, it would be devastating to workers, employers and industry across the island of Ireland.<\/p> <p> The crisis manufactured by the British Government around the establishment of an EU office in Belfast, in order to monitor and facilitate the implementation of the Irish protocol, is another example of Britain negotiating in bad faith.  There was no issue with this office in the North.  This dispute was generated by the British Government itself.  The British Government was determined to stoke tensions where none existed, even though it supported the continuing presence of an EU office in Belfast as recently as February 2019.  In a letter sent from the permanent secretary to Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office to the EU 14 months ago, the British Government outlined its wish for the EU to keep its office in Belfast open.  The British Government's outright rejection of this office as we enter the critical window of negotiations represents a warning sign that it has no interest in facilitating the Irish protocol, which is committed to in the withdrawal agreement that was ratified by both sides.  The backstop was put in place to protect the all-Ireland economy and our peace process and the actions of the British Government signal bad faith in its commitment to implementing this.  We need to ensure that is not the case.  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste's reference to the commitment he has from the British Government on implementing this in full but we need to be wise to what is also happening on the sidelines, particularly in its stance on the Belfast office.  As one university professor of EU and international law put it: \"The Achilles' heel of the Northern Ireland protocol is that it relies on the UK to implement it.\"  Given the bad faith displayed by the British Government and the real threat a no-deal Brexit poses to Ireland, the best course of action at this point in time is to extend the transition arrangements.<\/p> <p> I will put questions to the T&aacute;naiste later on about the fishing industry, an industry that is important in my constituency in Killybegs.  One third of the catch is caught in what would become British waters.  This will have a huge impact on jobs and the economy.  We will talk about that later on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700029#FF00200","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588862100,"counter":117,"content":"<p>It is understandable that during this crisis, we seem to have somewhat lost track of other threats and challenges that are coming down the line, which will also have an impact on our quality of life and on the prosperity of our country.  Though it has perhaps not received the attention it should have, it is clear that the negotiations to agree an orderly departure for the United Kingdom from the European Union have somewhat run aground in recent weeks.  Covid-19 has made co-operation on the protocol and future relationships even more important.<\/p>  <p>  It would appear that it would be more than a little trite for me to implore the actors in these negotiations to engage in talks with renewed vigour and good faith considering the inability of parties in this Chamber to include every party in their political discussions for a new Government.  The current pandemic has thrown into sharp relief how seismic changes can be visited upon us quickly and in a way we could not truly prepare for.  However, Brexit is not an unknown threat and we have been grappling with it for almost four years.  Similarly, the impacts that will be felt due to climate change in the next decade are also anticipated, even if they are not fully clear.  Those two escalating hazards are not mutually exclusive.  The UK's departure should not and cannot be employed as a free pass on agreements made through the international climate accord, the Paris Agreement.  The UK exports more than &euro;300 billion worth of goods and services to the EU and accounts for over 30% of goods and services imported into Ireland.<\/p> <p>The manufacture of goods, the use of raw materials, the ethical employment of labour and the cradle to cradle life of these exports must be considered part of those Paris commitments and must be a building block of any economic pact between both parties.  The international obligations undertaken by the United Kingdom in 2016 under the Paris Agreement should be factored into an emissions reduction pact as an essential element that underpins any trade agreement.<\/p> <p> This week we witnessed a further worrying deterioration in relations as the EU's request to create a working office in Belfast was resisted by senior British officials.  The reality is that achieving a viable and efficient framework for the movement of goods and services in an all-island manner will require an integrated and bipartisan approach.  It is also worth pointing out, and I say this as somebody who worked for five years in Belfast, sometimes living there and sometimes commuting, that there is a huge cohort of people and businesses from the EU who deserve representation in the place where they choose to make their home.  Both Irish citizens and those from our wider European family could, and should, rightly expect to be able to access some supports while living in a country so closely aligned with those around it.  Until last January there was a European Commission office in Belfast, so to object now to the establishment of the Belfast office of the EU delegation to the UK is remarkable.<\/p> <p> Although the deadline for departure looms we appear to be still at a relatively early stage in the arrangements for cross-border co-operation after the UK has left the European Union.  It may be that some of this difficulty could simply be due to an ongoing vagueness around what exactly is proposed for these border supports.  It is vital that this vagueness is addressed in both the envisaged arrangements for border controls and the integration of climate targets under any agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700030#GG00200","speaker":"1559","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588862700,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I too am glad to be back to debating Brexit.  I will deal with a technical point first.  I found the stakeholders forum on Brexit a very helpful and informative forum both for me and all politicians, but it is not a great idea to have both on the same day.   Having statements in the House means that Members who are not Dublin based, like me, could not participate in it.  I say that for future reference.<\/p>  <p>  If Ireland, like the rest of the world, had not been overtaken and overwhelmed by the Covid-19 crisis it is quite clear that Brexit would still be dominating the debate and discourse here.  The problem is that since the onset of the Covid-19 crisis matters have not only not progressed but we are now in an incredible and dangerous position of dealing with a UK Government in denial as time slips by.  The UK committed itself to a protocol, to have a transition arrangement and to have negotiations for future relationships sorted by the end of the transition period.  We have less than two months to achieve a settlement.  Most people who are directly involved in the negotiations believe it is not going to happen and that it is impossible given the current mindset of the British Government for it to happen.  We must be alert to that and talk openly about it.  The T&aacute;naiste in his utterances always uses the measured phraseology of Iveagh House, which is right and proper, but there is a fundamental reality now when one hears the commentary of people such as the Minister for the Cabinet Office, Mr. Gove, which is basically moving backwards, not forwards, in respect of matters that are of fundamental importance to us.<\/p>  <p>  If we do not have an agreement within the next two months, and there is a fixation in the current position of the British Government to have no extension of the transition arrangements beyond the end of this year, all the brinkmanship, negotiations and the late hours - I happened to be in Brussels on the day the agreement was finally made - would come to naught.  What we have worked assiduously for, and what the T&aacute;naiste's fantastic team has worked so well with the Barnier team to achieve, will all be set at naught.<\/p> <p>Our first objective, therefore, is to press the UK, including our unionist friends in Northern Ireland, for an extension of the transition arrangements.  It ought to be realised that the fixation on achieving the exit of Britain, even from the transition arrangements, at the expense of rational economic planning is just not good politics.  It is not the way rational governments operate.  We need to persuade the UK to go beyond the end of this year.  Perhaps that is in train and maybe there is an associated matter of timing, but we have to have our cards a little more face up in regard to these issues.<\/p> <p> I will ask specific questions on these matters when I get an opportunity later.  If what the British Government wants - to have unfettered access to our markets at no cost to itself, with the right to undermine all our standards and demolish what is euphemistically known as the level playing field - is taken at face value, it cannot be and will not be because the Single Market would not exist on that basis.  What is our plan B if that is to be the fixed position? <\/p> <p> Let me refer to another issue, which will be raised in questions later, and let me put it in a crude way that the T&aacute;naiste probably could not put it.  In terms of our negotiating stance, the ace cards are held by the European Union in all the trade portfolios except one, namely fisheries, in respect of which it is acknowledged that the UK has a stronger hand - to put it in playing card terms.  On that basis, it was always going to be an integrated negotiation; we were never going to segregate out, but now the argument coming from the UK, if I hear it correctly, is that it wants to negotiate sector by sector.  That must not be.  I hope the T&aacute;naiste will make it crystal clear that the latter will not be allowed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700031#HH00200","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588863000,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I am quite surprised that the T&aacute;naiste has welcomed the fact that the UK has stated it will respect all its legal undertakings under the withdrawal agreement.  It is a sign of how serious this has become that we are in the position of welcoming something that should be a given.  It should be an absolute given when entering an agreement that people will respect the legal undertakings.  What is occurring is a sign of the difficult situation in which we find ourselves.  Previous speakers alluded to this matter.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to the future-relationship negotiations, I am very concerned that the UK is resisting the incorporation of guarantees on international climate change commitments into the agreement .  It is also resisting the principles of the European green deal.  It is important that the European Convention on Human Rights be incorporated.  As the previous speaker indicated, we must have a level playing field in order to avoid a race to the bottom in environmental standards and workplace rights.  A level playing field is an important counterweight to the neoliberal vision of a free market based on privatisation and deregulation.  We cannot tolerate a scenario where UK-based firms could undercut EU firms as a result of less stringent competition in respect of state aid rules, lower taxes and more lax social and environmental protections.  The message from the Government should be strong, namely, that we will not stand by and allow dumping, undercutting and the erosion of rights and standards that have been hard fought for and won over several decades.  Verbal assurances from the United Kingdom that it will honour these values cannot be relied upon.  We can be quite certain about that.  A level playing field must be incorporated in binding clauses in the trade agreement; there is no question about that.  It is crucial to our future and the future direction of the European Union.  Any diminution of environmental or workplace standards that is allowed or tolerated will in effect be used over the coming years to reduce and erode standards and rights within the European Union, and we will see a race to the bottom.  Addressing this is very important to the future direction of the European project.<\/p>  <p>  I want to talk a little about the impact on trade.  It is worth noting the comments of the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Mr. Aodh&aacute;n Connolly, who has warned of significant potential costs associated with importing food and other products across the Irish Sea if solutions are not found.  Research by the consortium shows that a single truck entering the North from Britain could be carrying as much as 1,392 different items, 500 of which could be of animal origin.<\/p> <p>There are significant potential costs and delays associated with importing goods that could have a detrimental effect on the Northern Irish economy and also could have knock-on effects on the Republic.<\/p> <p> Businesses will need time to prepare, all the more so as they have been exclusively focused on Covid-19 and dealing with immediate survival.  We must be cognisant of the potential impacts on businesses, including farming and in particular the beef sector, and on the fishing industry.  As a representative of a fishing community, I am keenly aware of the devastating social and human impact of previous European Union agreements that effectively sacrificed the interests of the Irish fishing industry.  We cannot allow that to happen again.  It is essential at this point that the UK Government provide details, including timelines, of the arrangements it will put in place as quickly as possible.  We cannot allow the UK Government to effectively run down the clock on this, which is what appears to be happening.  It does not want to give detail or engage in the full knowledge that the less time, detail and engagement there is, the better chance it has of fulfilling its aim, which is clearly to get rid of a level playing field and to have a free trade agreement on that basis.  We must be strong on that point to protect the integrity of Irish industry and goods and to protect the future direction of the European Union.  That is important for us and for the people of Britain and the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700032#JJ00200","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588863300,"counter":123,"content":"<p>The Trump-like buffoonery and recklessness of Boris Johnson have been fairly evident to most people in this House and country for some time.  If there is something of a silver lining to the grim public health emergency and pandemic that we face, it is that the buffoonery and recklessness on Johnson's part has been further revealed.  For most people, Brexit and everything else are being seen largely through the prism of this unprecedented Covid-19 emergency.  The buffoonery and recklessness on his part have undoubtedly contributed to a worse situation developing, tragically, for many British people through his slowness and reluctance to impose public health measures and his dismissal in the initial stages of the seriousness of the pandemic.  I hope that both in Britain and in the United States the sort of recklessness and buffoonery that Trump and Johnson represent has been exposed in the eyes of more and more people.  I hope and believe that is also true in the North and elsewhere.  Given the sort of recklessness they have displayed, which is continuing with Johnson essentially raising the spectre of a crash-out Brexit with the disastrous consequences that would have, North and South on this island, it seems to me that we must use this opportunity to show ourselves to be so much better than the recklessness and buffoonery that Johnson's politics represent.  If the possibility of a crash-out Brexit emerges because of his attitudes and policies and his plans for a race to the bottom, we must make the case to people in the North in particular for a break and move towards a united Ireland.  The case, for example, for an all-Ireland response to Covid-19 is very apparent to people North and South.  That is something that has been resisted by Johnson and some in the Northern political system.  It is very apparent to large numbers of people North and South, regardless of their community background, that it makes sense to have an all-Ireland response to a public health emergency, but it also makes sense to have an all-Ireland response to the threat of a no-deal Brexit.<\/p> <p>If we are to make that case and talk about the possibility of uniting the North and South of this island, we must show ourselves to be better than Boris Johnson in every single regard.  Notwithstanding differences of opinion and emphasis, there is no doubt that the response by this State to the public health emergency has been better than that of Boris Johnson, but we must continue to be better in everything.  It is blatantly obvious that if we are going to make the case to people in the North that we should unite this island, we must at a minimum have an all-Ireland national health service which is properly resourced, with the necessary capacity, where we treat our health workers properly and well.  People in the North will not be attracted to a united Ireland if it involves a two-tier under-resourced, under-capacity health service.  One thing that we could and should do now is indicate our determination to move immediately to a proper national health service, something that has become apparent in the response to Covid-19.  A united Ireland where the State runs a proper national health service on all parts of this island is something that could win over people in the North who might retain allegiance to the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700033#KK00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588863600,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Now from the Regional Independent Group, I call Deputy Fitzpatrick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700034#LL00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1588863600,"counter":126,"content":"<p>Coming from a Border county, I know the devastating effects that Brexit will have if we do not put in place the necessary measures to deal with it.  There are still so many unanswered questions.  I am deeply concerned that its effects could be disastrous on a Border town like Dundalk.  Last week, I raised the different approaches to deal with Covid-19 on both sides of the Border and the devastating effects of that.  The Border area now has the highest number of recorded cases of Covid-19.  I hope this is not a sign of things to come, where different approaches to situations are taken on both sides of the Border with those living in Border regions suffering most.  That is not acceptable.  I am very worried about the lack of clarity on many issues.  The UK Government has shown an arrogance in its approach to this, such as its recent refusal of an EU office in Belfast.  What does this say about Britain's approach to negotiations?  I am also worried at the lack of information available to businesses.  Border businesses regularly tell me that they do not know what is really happening.  Among the questions they ask me are whether there will be a hard border or a customs check at the Border, and what will be the situation with tariffs.  How will cross-border workers be treated?  How will standards be implemented?  Will cross-Border agencies still exist?  The list is endless.<\/p>  <p>  People on the ground still have no clue what will happen once Brexit happens, particularly in the event of no deal.  We still do not have a roadmap for businesses in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  We are constantly told that there will be no hard border and no issues for cross-Border workers and that there will be no customs checks at the Border.  How can the T&aacute;naiste insist this is the case when there is no real roadmap?  The Government's UK counterparts are not of the same opinion.  Their arrogance is undoubtedly a matter of negotiation tactics but I deal with people and businesses on the ground who cannot afford to play these political games.  The people of Border counties such as Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim and Donegal need to get real answers now so that they can prepare properly for Brexit.  The Government has told businesses that \"when the transition period ends, Brexit is likely to affect how you do business\" and advises businesses to review supply chains, understand the new rules for importing and exporting to Britain, and review all regulation, licensing and certification requirements.  That is just stating the obvious.  Businesses know they have to do this; what they need is facts.  They are still in the dark about how things will operate in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The important thing is that a real roadmap for Brexit is implemented.   <\/p> <p>Brexit, despite our not voting for it, is happening.  We must prepare for the worst-case scenario, that is, a no-deal Brexit.  We must not be used as pawns in the negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  We must give a clear commitment that Ireland is protected in all negotiations between the EU and the UK.  We have seen how the backstop was dropped despite being told that it would protect those of us on the island of Ireland.  We cannot be weak on this.  I urge the T&aacute;naiste to protect Ireland's interests at all times.<\/p> <p> As we all know, the UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020.  The withdrawal agreement allows a transition period until 31 December 2020.  The UK has said it will not extend the transition period beyond this period.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, will there be a hard border on the island of Ireland?  What will the hard border be like?  Will all goods be checked at the Border?  What plans has the Government made in the event of a hard border in respect of customs checks?  These are real questions that those operating businesses along the Border in towns like Dundalk have put to me.  They need clarity on this rather than vague replies.  It is important that they are given real answers.  I call on the T&aacute;naiste to be specific in his answers.  If it is the case that the T&aacute;naiste does not have the answers, then he should state as much.  It is better for businesses to know where they stand so they can then put a plan in place.<\/p> <p> Another concern for those along the Border is the treatment of cross-border workers.  Can the T&aacute;naiste set out what plans are in place for the treatment of cross-border workers in the event of a no-deal Brexit?  How will workers travelling from Dundalk to the North be affected in the event of a no-deal Brexit?  Likewise, how will workers from the North be affected?  Again, I am being asked these questions.  People are concerned that they will be stopped at the Border, that commuting times will be extended and that their daily lives will be interrupted.  Will a driving licence still be valid in both jurisdictions?  Will car insurance still be valid in both jurisdictions?  Clarity on these issues is needed.  Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm what arrangements are being made for students in the event of a no-deal Brexit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700034#LL00300","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588863900,"counter":128,"content":"<p>We will move on to the Rural Independent Group.

Obviously, Brexit is bad news for the island of Ireland.  We will all have to protect strongly the sectors of our society most at risk.  Agriculture is one sector that faces major challenges with markets in the UK in jeopardy with Brexit.  If the survival of Irish farmers is to continue, we need the South American Mercosur trade deal completely off the table for legitimate reasons, for traceability reasons, for environmental reasons and for so many other reasons.  Is this trade deal going to be opposed by the Government?<\/p>  <p>  The British made it clear from the first mention of Brexit that they want Irish trawlers out of British waters.  This will have nightmare consequences for Irish fishermen.  We are also facing a further nightmare situation.  When other European trawlers are removed from UK waters, they will turn into what are already over-fished Irish waters.  The media have been constantly saying in recent times that Irish waters are over-fished.  What they have always failed to realise is that Irish trawlers are not over-fishing Irish waters.  It is the foreign trawlers that are over-fishing Irish waters.  The question I want to raise with the T&aacute;naiste is the fact that Irish fishing vessels will now be asked to move out of English waters.  What protections are in place for those Irish trawlers?  What protections are in place for the Irish Sea?  Will foreign vessels turn into Irish waters?  If they do, we are facing a shocking and difficult situation.  What securities are in place to ensure that does not happen?  These are questions I would like answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700035#MM00500","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1588863900,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his work on Brexit to date.  Unlike most other Deputies, I could observe Brexit from a Brussels perspective.  As an Irish MEP I considered, like others, that we were well-represented.  Of course, things have moved on.  In recent times, Brexit has somewhat disappeared from the radar because of Covid-19.  In a way, it is like the coronavirus in that it is still lurking in the background, but hiding in plain sight, as it were.<\/p>  <p>Now that Boris Johnson is back in Downing Street, we can have some hope that there will be some real progress and not a continuation of the current incessant foot dragging.  In this context we need to continue the pressure for an extension of the negotiating period.  Covid-19 could be seen as a kind of <i>force majeure<\/i>, a good enough reason to seek and agree to an extension.  Right now it seems to me as if the current trajectory will drive us straight into a brick wall.  As the Taoiseach said, there will be another round of talks next week, and it is do or die as June is just around the corner.  I agree with Deputy Howlin.  It is at that point now.<br\/><br\/>Another issue of real concern is that the UK has not made its negotiating position public.  The EU has committed to transparency.  This mismatch creates its own difficulties.  Commissioner Hogan spoke this morning on radio of the slow progress the UK is making in seeking to play Covid-19 for any negative outcome on Brexit.  He spoke of the UK as still trying to divide and conquer and to move over the heads of the European Commission.  He also said, however, that Mr. Barnier, following a meeting with the EU ambassador, said that is not working.  Commissioner Hogan's assessment, therefore, while quite bleak, is probably fairly accurate.<br\/><br\/>The T&aacute;naiste in his speech mentioned not just a level playing field but a strong level playing field, yet all we hear from the negotiations is that the UK is still attempting to cherry-pick.  It is looking at some of the deals already in place - the Canadian trade deal, the Korean trade deal, the Japanese trade deal and others - and trying to pick the bits and pieces that suit it.  This approach, as we all know, is a disaster because it prevents any real progress from being made and brings us to the brink.<br\/><br\/>As other Deputies have said, we have to remain steadfast and resolute.  The T&aacute;naiste knows, I know, we all know how crucial it is that the EU continues to maintain a fully united front, and I expect that will continue.  I was heartened to hear the T&aacute;naiste's absolute commitment to the Irish protocol - I know he helped negotiated it - but because of the reckless position of the UK, it cannot be restated often enough.  He also mentioned he had a conversation with Michel Barnier about the land bridge.  I will come back to that during the questions and answers, but it is a crucial route to the EU market, to which we will have full access, and we must absolutely ensure that it remains open and functions effectively.<br\/><br\/>I wish to mention the huge concerns we all share about agriculture and food production.  As we know, 40% of our food exports go to the UK, and the threat to farming and food production is simply enormous for all regions, but perhaps even more so for the Border region.  Again, I will come back to that during the questions and answers.<br\/><br\/>Like Covid-19, there are no easy answers to Brexit, but we have to negotiate Brexit with our EU partners and minimise any negative outcomes for this island, which is simply an island behind an island off the coast of Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700035#MM00600","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588864500,"counter":134,"content":"<p>That completes the statements.

The T&aacute;naiste said two rounds of negotiations have taken place so far, a third round will take place next week and a final round in June.  The indications are not very positive at this stage and there is no indication that the UK will seek an extension.  The T&aacute;naiste did, however, report some progress on the protocol on Ireland, and that is good to hear, but we know what Michael Gove has said about the proposed EU office in Belfast.<\/p> <p>It has obviously become an issue.  My party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, stated yesterday that he does not detect any objection to such an office in Northern Ireland itself so it is important that the T&aacute;naiste remains strong on that issue.  It is not a major issue in the overall scheme of things, but it is a symbolic one and it would be important to have that EU office in order to monitor the situation in the context of customs arrangements and so on in Larne and Belfast.  I would be interested to hear more information about that.<\/p> <p> The T&aacute;naiste indicated that we need to prepare for all outcomes.  We certainly must prepare for a no-deal scenario.  The latter is a possibility that is coming down the tracks and could have major implications for our agrifood, manufacturing and tourism sectors, and for SMEs generally.  What governmental structures are in place to bring supports to these businesses?  Some structures were in place before the Covid-19 crisis but those sectors and SMEs in general will need a lot of support to survive this economic tsunami.

In the context of both Brexit and Covid-19, we need maximum co-operation on an all-Ireland basis.  I again appeal to the Government, as I did some weeks ago, to amend the recent regulations and enable garda&iacute; to restrict the movements of people where necessary and regardless of whether they are resident outside State.  I am concerned that my own Border county of Cavan continues to have the highest incidence of Covid-19 in the country and that the neighbouring county, Monaghan, which is also part of my constituency, has the third highest incidence.  Some time ago, I appealed to the Minister for Health to have this high incidence in the two counties investigated as a matter of urgency and, if necessary, provide the additional resources to both our public and private healthcare providers to tackle any identified deficiency in local health provision.  I highly commend the inspirational work of our healthcare personnel at local level.<\/p>  <p>  As the T&aacute;naiste knows well, there has been excellent co-operation on an all-Ireland basis over many years in dealing with serious animal disease issues.  We need that level of co-operation and sharing of information to fight Covid-19.

The approaches being taken by the UK and EU sides are totally different and we must take that into account.<\/p> <p>The EU is consistent with what we have been saying for months, and consistent with what was said in the political declaration around the future relationship, which was supposed to set the scene for this negotiation.  It said that we need a comprehensive agreement that involves multiple different areas that are all interconnected from a level playing field to fishing, to market access, to ensuring tariff-free and quota-free trade and a range of other things.  The UK has decided to take a different approach, that is, to break it up into different segments and negotiate them separately, picking the ones that are most important to it for now.  The EU cannot do a deal on that basis.  The negotiating team do not have the mandate to negotiate on that basis, and the UK knows that.  I hope the approach will be somewhat different next week so that we can take a more pragmatic approach towards trying to make progress and, at least by the time we get to the end of June, be able to make an assessment that has a prospect of success in the second half of the year because at the moment that looks very different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700037#OO00500","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588865100,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I am going to have to stop the T&aacute;naiste.

The first is to ask him to join me in calling on the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, to seek an extension to the talks.  It was very challenging to do it within 12 months.  It is far more challenging now that we are in the month of May and that we have the Covid pandemic to deal with as well.  Will he do that, and urge his European colleagues to seek that course of action to give us that flexibility?<\/p>  <p>  Second, the fishing industry was raised earlier by myself and other Deputies.  We know that this industry is crucial.  It will be an unmitigated disaster, in the words of the CEO of the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation, KFO, if we do not reach the end of 2020 without a deal.  We know that one third of the fish caught by our fleet in EU waters will become British waters if no deal comes to pass.  It is estimated that this could wipe out 5,000 jobs in that sector alone.  What reassurances, if any, can the T&aacute;naiste give that sector at this point in time?  What is the Government doing to defend its interest?<\/p> <p> I beg the T&aacute;naiste's indulgence in asking a final, separate question.  This morning, at long last, a very welcome scheme was announced to provide care for the children of healthcare professionals while they are working on the front line.  In just the last few hours, the insurance company that provides cover to the sector has said it will not insure any provider for Covid-related illnesses.  The company says it has engaged with the Government for the last six weeks and the latter is refusing to indemnify those workers.  This is causing huge anxiety for front-line health staff who thought they would have this support by 18 May as well as for the care workers who want to provide the support but have no insurance cover to do so, either from the State or their insurance provider.  Will the T&aacute;naiste deal urgently with this issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700038#PP00900","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588865700,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I will come back to the Deputy on the last point.  It is clearly a serious issue and we want to, and will, ensure childcare provision is made available for healthcare workers.  If we have to intervene, then I am sure it will be looked at as a matter of urgency.  This issue has been discussed for long enough now and it needs to be resolved.<\/p>  <p>  On the fishing industry, I was formerly a Minister with responsibility for fisheries and I understand the industry well.  It is extremely vulnerable to the wrong outcome from Brexit negotiations.  That is why I and others have always insisted that a resolution to the fisheries issues linked to Brexit needs to be done in the context of a trade deal, not siphoned away and dealt with separately but as part of an overall agreement that involves many sectors.  That is the way in which we will get the right deal for Irish fishermen.  I do not believe the EU will move away from that approach.  We spoke directly this morning in a stakeholders group to Sean O'Donoghue, head of the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation, to which the Deputy referred.  I assure the Deputy that we will continue to represent fishing interests as a big priority.  I suspect there will be a lot more focus on the fisheries debate in the next couple of weeks.  At the moment, the approaches from the two sides to the negotiations on fishing are diametrically opposed.  We know the emotion that comes with fishing issues and the sovereignty issues that are linked to the fishing debate.  This means that, in many ways, the issue is much more important and difficult to resolve politically than suggested by the industry's overall share of GDP and so on.  I know only too well how important it is for places like Donegal, west Cork, Connemara, Wexford and others that we have a vibrant fishing industry into the future.<\/p>  <p>  On the question of the UK seeking an extension to Brexit negotiations, I ask the Acting Chairman to give me a little latitude in responding as I know other Members will ask about it.  We need to be clever here.  I believe that we need an extension and we need more time, but there are ways and means of achieving this, if it is possible to do it.  It may not be possible.  We know that the British position is very clear and adamant right now.  David Frost has outlined, as has Michael Gove, that the UK will not be seeking an extension.  The idea that the ask should come from Ireland or the EU, where it would be seen by the UK as a concession to the EU to agree to an extension, is not the way to approach this.  We need to work to convince the UK that more time is needed to get a good deal for everybody, including the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700039#QQ00200","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1588865700,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I am afraid that is the extent of the latitude I can give the T&aacute;naiste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700039#QQ00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1588865700,"counter":153,"content":"<p>What I am saying is fairly self-evident.

Climate change and environmental standards are a key part of the level playing field ask on behalf of the EU.  A level playing field means ensuring that there is fair competition in the UK and in the EU if there is going to be free trade between both, be that in regard to workers' rights, environmental standards, food safety or consumer-based issues.  From an EU perspective the main issues are environmental standards, climate standards and commitments.  In the EU objectives, the EU reaffirms effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and the commitments therein, and calls on the UK to maintain a system of carbon pricing, including, possibly, linking the UK emissions trading system, ETS, to the EU emissions trading system.  It is also calling for the UK to maintain common standards, including targets in place at the end of the transition period and environmental standards across various sectors of the agreement, including in transport, which makes sense for both parties.  It is very much integrated into these negotiations, but if we do not have serious negotiation and engagement from the UK side on level playing field issues and the current approach of refusing to accept that this needs to be part of a deal, then we are running into a roadblock.  I hope that we will see a different approach to what we are calling a level playing field but could be called whatever might be more politically saleable in the UK, but we have to ensure that the standards and the state intervention and supports in the UK and in the EU are comparable and equivalent if there is to be tariff and quota-free trade.  Otherwise, it cannot be done because we would be essentially allowing free access into a market of 450 million and allowing the UK to derive competitive advantage by changing standards to suit itself.  There will never be a trade deal done on that basis.  It cannot happen.

I will try now to respond to some other questions I did not get to earlier.  On the structure and the planning for a no-trade deal Brexit here, it will be a matter for the new Government but I suspect it will be managed predominantly by the Taoiseach's office in partnership with the office of the T&aacute;naiste, as it was in the past in the build up to crisis points in Brexit.  We collectively managed the preparation and communications, working with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and other Departments, but the Taoiseach's office was central to that co-ordination, which is how it should be.  There is a Cabinet sub-committee too.  The key Ministers met to discuss Brexit a couple of days ago and we will probably have a formal Cabinet sub-committee meeting on Brexit in the next few weeks.  We are gearing up on these issues again.  Even though Covid-19 is to the fore in terms of the concerns of people and business in Ireland, the Government has to plan for the challenges over the next six months which the next Government will have to address.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Brendan Smith's questions, whom I note has left the Chamber, the Garda and the PSNI have never been closer than they are right now in terms of co-operation.  The way to deal with movement cross-border is to ensure that the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are engaging with each other and are applying the same types of restrictions in terms of preventing unnecessary movement and travel.  My understanding is that this is happening.  Members will not find me wanting in the context of encouraging more North-South co-operation in virtually every area.<\/p>  <p>  I congratulate Deputy Mythen on his maiden speech.<\/p> <p>I look forward to working with the Deputy.  I take the points he has raised in regard to the potential trade deal that the UK would like to pursue with the US, and the potential consequences of that for some of the issues that were raised in respect of standards that we in the EU would regard as unacceptable, particularly in the areas of food and agriculture.  Of course, if we do not have the full implementation of the protocol in Ireland and Northern Ireland around checks in Larne, Belfast and any other ports of entry in Northern Ireland, then we cannot guarantee, as the protocol will if it is implemented, the integrity of the EU Single Market in full without any form of border infrastructure on this island, North and South, which is guaranteed under that protocol.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700040#RR00400","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588866600,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I also congratulate Deputy Mythen, my constituency colleague, on his maiden speech and look forward to many more such speeches in the years to come.<\/p>  <p>  I will confine myself to three questions initially.  Hopefully, the T&aacute;naiste will be concise in his answers to those and I will have time for two further questions.  I want to further push the point regarding an extension of the negotiation period.  I am certainly of the view that we are not going to have an agreement within that timeframe, although I understand the T&aacute;naiste will not say that.  As a result, we need to know where we stand in terms of real dialogue, particularly with the unionists in Northern Ireland, in respect of achieving the consensus we really need in order to have a working relationship between our islands and between Britain and the EU.  To achieve that, we will need a proper negotiating period and mandate, and an extension.<\/p>  <p>  Related to that, if the impossible position outlined by the UK Minister, Mr. Gove, and others is maintained, and if that is not the negotiating position but the fixed and immutable position of the British Government, we are potentially talking about a Cabinet sub-committee working on a plan B or other alternatives to that.  How are we going to develop the latter?  Are we going to do it in a subterranean way or are we going go have democratic debate about that?  What will happen if that fixed unacceptable position of the United Kingdom is maintained?<\/p>  <p>  My third question is about solidarity.  The Taoiseach referred yesterday to a display of European solidarity during the first round of Brexit.  He is absolutely right, and many were surprised by how well that solidarity held.  However, that solidarity is undermined a little by some of the actions of late, not in terms of Brexit but of Covid-19, and certainly in terms of the solidarity being expressed regarding the mutualisation of debt, for example, and facing up to particular matters.  Is the T&aacute;naiste confident that this solidarity will be maintained?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700041#SS00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1588866600,"counter":161,"content":"<p>On solidarity, the answer is \"Yes\".  I have good reason to believe that, having spoken to Michel Barnier and others across the EU.  As chief negotiator, Michel Barnier has done an extraordinary amount of travelling in order to meet, talk to and persuade people that the approach we have taken on Brexit is the right one and that it is based on unity of purpose and solidarity.  If that solidarity were to crack, our approach would become much more challenging.  That is understood and there is a very strong sense of unity and solidarity on the Brexit issue.  I know Covid-19 is somewhat different.  It took the EU by surprise and it was an emergency response, literally overnight in the case of some countries.  Solidarity is difficult to maintain in the context of that kind of political and social stress.  Brexit is the opposite because there was a gradual build-up to it.  The EU has built up its blocks solidly every step of the way and we have a very solid foundation to try to conclude this deal, if we have a negotiating partner that is willing to get it across the line.<\/p>  <p>  On extension, as I informed Deputy Doherty earlier, the easy thing is just too call for an extension but we do not get an extension unless the UK side wants to pursue that approach.  At the moment, it does not, so we have to figure out, if we believe more time is needed, how we can convince the UK of that and how we can make it as easy as possible for it politically to take that approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700041#SS00300","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1588866600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>It is a question of how we go about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700041#SS00400","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1588866600,"counter":163,"content":"<p>We have spoken to the UK Government and we have spoken to many on the EU side.<\/p> <p>Let me be clear with the House, because it is important to be, that there is no hidden solution that will pop up in a few weeks' time.

Unless and until that changes, and we have not seen any evidence to suggest it is going to, and I want to be honest with everybody about that, at the moment the way I see it is that we are unlikely to see a request for an extension.  Therefore, we will have to plan on the basis of trying to find a way of getting an agreement on these very difficult timelines.

This misunderstands what Brexit is fundamentally about for the people who supported it.  Effectively, it is a strategy to undercut European Union standards and conditions in terms of climate and workers' rights.  It is an attempt to get access to European Union markets as a free ride without the responsibilities that come with it.  This is a fundamental part of the strategy of the people who proposed and pushed Brexit and who are now in senior roles in the British Government.  Given this, what approach will the Government take on this?  This is fundamentally what they are trying to achieve.  This is what they want and what they are about.

We have got the results we have been looking for, by and large, through these Brexit negotiations.  In terms of the Irish protocol, the protections of the Good Friday Agreement, the absolute assurance we have now in law to prevent Border infrastructure re-emerging on the island of Ireland, people predicted that many of those things could not be negotiated or happen.  Sometimes a stand-off on something is not necessarily the best way to find a way forward that both sides can live with.  Of course we think having an EU office in Belfast or somewhere in Northern Ireland makes absolute sense.  We will try to find a way of getting that done.  However, it is one of dozens of issues that need to be negotiated and agreed.  It is important but it is not the most important issue.  I do not want to create an issue and then get a result on that but actually lose on something much more important.  We will work with Michel Barnier and his team strategically to try to get multiple things across the line over the next few weeks on the Irish protocol.<\/p>  <p>  The most important thing in terms of the Irish protocol from my perspective is to see physical infrastructure being put in place in Belfast and Larne, in the ports.  We know here the time it takes and the cost of putting infrastructure in Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort, as both Deputies from Wexford will know only too well.  This is not done quickly.  Recruiting sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, inspectors, vets and customs officials to make sure that we can streamline checks that do not slow down traffic and all the rest of it takes time.<\/p>  <p>  The protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland is a very complex protocol to implement and to ensure it functions in a way that does not disrupt trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, on which of course we do not want to have a negative impact, but it is also there to ensure that the EU is reassured that its Single Market is not seeing an unguarded back door opening through Northern Ireland.  That is why an EU presence is necessary.  Whether it is actually housed in Belfast or somewhere else is up for discussion and negotiation.  This matter seems to have turned into a threat to sovereignty issue, almost, in London, that if there is an EU presence, somehow, the EU is telling us what to do.  That is not what the EU is about here at all.  The protocol is clear.  This is to be implemented by the UK.  It is also clear, however, that the EU is entitled to have a presence to ensure it is being done in a way that reassures everybody.<\/p>  <p>  All I am saying is that there are many issues on which we will need to take a stand and find a way forward.

We also have a British Government that, as late as last week, confirmed that it will implement the protocol and that it understands its legal obligations in full in the context of its implementation.  Let us not create a concern here where it is not merited.  We have an arrangement that prevents border infrastructure being necessary on this island even if there is no trade deal in place.  The British Government said it will implement that protocol linked to the withdrawal agreement to ensure that this is the case.  That involves some limited checks on goods coming into Northern Ireland from GB.  Because of the acceptance that there cannot be any border infrastructure between North and South the checks need to happen on entry into Northern Ireland as if the goods were coming into the EU Single Market.  That is understood and it took the guts of two years to put together.  Let us not equate a no-deal Brexit six months ago with a no-deal Brexit before the end of the year.  A no-trade deal Brexit creates a huge problem and huge uncertainty for Irish business.  We will deal with that if we have to but we will do everything we can to negotiate a better outcome than that.

That is the issue.  We need to ensure, and I believe that the EU will ensure, that this will not be some kind of race to the bottom in an attempt to try to find a deal in a pressurised environment in the context of Covid.<\/p> <p> On the Keelings issue, which has nothing to do with Brexit, my office was contacted by Keelings merely to ask whether the airports would close.  That was the nature of the conversation and we confirmed they would not close.  The advice was given to consult the Department of Health to ensure that the guidelines required in the context of essential workers being brought into the country were fully understood.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700044#VV00400","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588868700,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I come from the Border area, where people are concerned about what is happening in the North and in the South, and the different approaches on both sides, especially given the high rate of the coronavirus in the Border areas.

That is what the withdrawal agreement was all about.  It is what the Irish protocol and the legislation we passed here, and the British Government passed in Westminster, was about too, in respect of protecting the common travel area, and ensuring we protect access for students North and South into each other's universities and cross-Border healthcare co-operation.  We spent many months putting together the pieces to ensure we could provide that kind of reassurance.  We went as far as saying the Government would, if necessary, pay for students in Northern Ireland being able to access Erasmus+ programmes, even after the UK, including Northern Ireland, leaves the EU.  We also got a protocol agreed that will allow the Irish economy to function as an all-island economy, even though there are two jurisdictions. That will allow people to move and to work.  There will be no checks on the Border - I do not know how many times I have to say that - unless the British Government decides to go back on everything it has committed to.<\/p> <p>It has signed up to a protocol and it has said it will implement that protocol.  It is an international agreement with the EU and there is no suggestion, despite the fact there is a difference of approach in these negotiations on the future relationship, that there is any rowing back on a willingness to take on board the legal obligations that go with that protocol.  People who are working on both sides of the Border and moving every day, students who are doing likewise, people who are visiting the doctor and people who are going to shop will be able to continue to do that, even after this transition period.  That is what the protocol is all about.  It is to make sure we do not have the political and social consequences of an attempt to reimpose a physical border between North and South and between South and North.  In many ways, that was what held up a Brexit agreement for months, as Deputy Harkin will know from her time in the European Parliament as well as in this House.  It became an international discussion, not just an Irish and a British discussion.<\/p> <p> I want to try to give Members reassurance on that, but that said, if we do not manage to get agreement on level playing field issues and on facilitating tariff-free and quote-free trade, we will have a much more complex east-west trading relationship between Ireland and Britain.  Let us not forget that in a normal year, when we are not dealing with the consequences of Covid-19, that is worth more than &euro;60 billion in trade both ways.  That is more than &euro;1 billion per week and that trade is responsible for employing about 200,000 people on this side of the Irish Sea.  That is what we are trying to protect here.  Many of the issues North-South and in the Border counties are comprehensively dealt with in that Northern Irish-Irish protocol and we have to focus on full implementation of that protocol, whether there is a deal or there is no deal towards the end of the year, to deal with the all-island questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700045#WW00300","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588869000,"counter":190,"content":"<p>The hardest hit sectors, with Brexit looming, will be the fishing and agriculture industries.

When Brexit negotiations end, will Irish fishing trawlers have to move away from British waters and what is planned for these fishermen if this is to happen?

There is no question about that.  That is why, when we put contingency plans in place for a no-deal Brexit, these sectors were a big focus for us, along with tourism and hospitality.  In many ways, the no-deal Brexit preparations we had put in place were of some assistance in the context of trying to put contingency measures in place to respond to Covid-19 and its impact on these sectors.  Having said that, there is no question but that more support will be needed if we cannot get the kind of Brexit deal we will try to negotiate for.<\/p>  <p>  If we lose our access into British waters, as an Irish fleet and as part of the EU fleet, it is not only the loss of those fishing opportunities in British waters that are a concern in the fishing sector but there is also a concern around the potential to shift effort from British waters into Irish waters in the context of other EU fleets.  I have spoken to Michel Barnier directly about this particular issue because we need to think about it to ensure Ireland is not hit with a double negative.<\/p> <p>For now, however, our focus is to try to negotiate the best deal possible for the EU and Ireland in the context of fishing, quota share, access to UK waters, accepting UK access to EU waters and trying to ensure that we manage stocks in a responsible way.  The idea that one can easily impose hard borders at sea is nonsense, to be honest, because fish grow and mature and travel across those borders, particularly in the case of mackerel off the west coast, north-west coast and the waters west of Scotland.  We must find a way of getting an agreed position and an understanding between the UK and the EU on fishing that protects our industry and our fish stocks.  That will be high on the agenda.<\/p> <p> Regarding the Mercosur deal, the Taoiseach stated in the past that we are going to assess the potential economic impact of that deal before we make a final decision on it.

The first is about the level playing field.  Take the example of the dairy sector and the processing on both sides of the Border, which works very efficiently because of the different timetables of production.  We rely on the highest European standards to maintain our exports of baby milk formula and so forth to many countries.  If there is any slippage there, how does the T&aacute;naiste propose to deal with it?  Is there a crisis plan in place?  Without those high standards, some of our exports will be in trouble.<\/p>  <p>  My second question is on the UK landbridge.  The T&aacute;naiste has spoken about this previously and he has discussed it with Michel Barnier.  It is absolutely vital.  What plans are in place to ensure that this continues to function seamlessly?<\/p>  <p>  My third question relates to a recent study carried out by UCD which shows that incomes will be down by &euro;600 million in 2020 in the agriculture and food production sector.  That is before Brexit occurs.  What special measures is the T&aacute;naiste considering putting in place as a safety net for the industry post Brexit?<\/p>  <p>  My next question is also on agriculture and relates to the sheep trade.  We know we must maintain access to the French and European markets.  How can we guarantee that the UK will not use Ireland as a back door to access the French market?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700047#YY00200","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1588869300,"counter":194,"content":"<p>The level playing field conditions obviously apply in terms of GB and Northern Ireland.  In the context of the protocol where there effectively is no request for any form of border infrastructure or checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland that means food production in Northern Ireland must operate to the same standards as those in the Republic of Ireland.  Otherwise one is creating a skewed market which producers here will be unable to stand over in respect of exports.  Take the example of Lakeland Dairies.  Almost 40% of its milk comes from Northern Ireland so we must maintain those standards and if we are going to sell that product across the EU as an EU product, those standards must be the same.  That is understood.<\/p>  <p>  On the broader level playing field issues in the context of the UK as a whole, that is a challenge for these negotiations.  At present the UK is saying, \"Forget it.  We are not getting into a debate with you on a level playing field across all these sectors and an overarching governance infrastructure to ensure it is maintained\".  It is effectively refusing to engage on that and at the same time asking for facilitation in a trade deal.<\/p> <p>That is why the two rounds of negotiations so far have essentially got nowhere.  Let us wait to see whether that approach changes somewhat next week.  I hope it will because the UK, Ireland and the rest of the EU could do with having some positivity and certainty come out of these negotiations given the pressures so many business are under in the Covid-19 environment.  Whether that will change the politics of brinksmanship, I am not sure, but I hope it will.<\/p> <p> It is important to state the UK has really been quite helpful regarding the land bridge.  EU countries through which we gain access to the rest of the EU Single Market have also been very helpful.  The UK has been willing to sign up to the international transport convention, which essentially allows us to seal a container in Dublin and drive it across the UK and on to France, the Netherlands or elsewhere without having to break the seal.  In theory, at least, that is how it is supposed to work.  The challenges, of course, will be associated with traffic jams or congestion on the Dover&ndash;Calais route, in particular.  Trucks that have come from Ireland will end up getting caught in British haulier traffic if there are many checks required on the crossing, which is incredibly busy.  Many are very concerned about that.  They would be right to be concerned because the infrastructure required is simply not in place to facilitate significant customs, sanitary and phytosanitary checks.  We have worked with the shipping sector to ensure sufficient capacity to switch some of the traffic that would have used the land bridge in the past, giving it direct ferry routes to France, Rotterdam and elsewhere.  The most efficient and fastest way to get product to Ireland is undoubtedly using the UK as a land bridge.  We will seek to continue to use it as best we can.<\/p> <p> Incomes are down in agriculture, and this is linked to demand, confidence and market restrictions as a result of Covid-19.  This is absolutely the case.  Consider the example of fishing.  Our biggest markets for Irish fish are France, the UK, Spain, Italy and China.  When one thinks about how those countries have been impacted by Covid-19, one will begin to realise why there is such a challenge ahead for us in terms of rebuilding those markets.  It is a little different for agriculture but not that different.  Of course, we are considering how we can support these sectors to try to nurse them through this crisis and have them stronger on the other side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700047#YY00300","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588869600,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I thank all the Deputies for their contributions and questions.  Very clearly, Brexit remains a key issue for this Government and House, even as we face the challenges of Covid-19.  In responding to Brexit, the Government has faced this tough task with welcome support from this House on priority issues that have been at the centre of our strategy.  The solidarity and support shown by all sides in the debate here at home, not just today but up to this point, have been important in addressing our Brexit challenges.  Although we may differ occasionally on matters of approach or emphasis, which is only natural, the priorities we have pursued have been supported across both Houses.  For our part, we will continue to work closely with parties and other stakeholders as this work proceeds and as long as we are in a position to do so.  At the same time, Ireland will face these challenges with the mutual solidarity and support of our EU partners and with all the strengths EU membership brings.<\/p>  <p>  To confirm and reiterate what the T&aacute;naiste has outlined, I can state from continuously engaging with my own European colleagues that solidarity remains strong.  We remain fully committed to making sure that Ireland's interests will be protected and advanced in negotiations on the EU&ndash;UK future relationship.<\/p>  <p>  Equally, it is important that, over the transition period, we see the full implementation of the withdrawal agreement and the protocol.  This, as many Deputies have outlined, is not negotiable.  It has already been negotiated and is legally underpinned.  This is key to protecting citizens and to ensuring peace and stability in Northern Ireland.  It also plays a vital role in protecting the Single Market and Ireland's place in it.  The link between implementation and the future partnership negotiation is very clear.  The protocol must be operational at the end of the transition period.  It is critical, therefore, that work move forward to put practical operational arrangements in place to implement the protocol.  Again, we have seen how long it has taken us to put our own measures in place at our ports and airports.<\/p> <p>Clarity on this work is particularly important to give reassurance and certainty, especially to people and businesses in Northern Ireland but also across the entire island.<br\/><br\/>The Government continues to work closely with our EU partners to ensure that our collective approach to these negotiations reflects our values and interests, but we also continue to engage with key figures and interlocutors on Brexit issues within the UK.  Officials from across the Government are continuing their work to make sure that Ireland's voice is at the heart of the future relationship negotiations that work between the EU and the UK to implement the protocol is taken forward and to ensure that, domestically, Ireland is prepared for the end of the transition period.<br\/><br\/>As we know, time is tight.  With less than seven months to the end of the transition period, our work will undoubtedly intensify in the period ahead.  We remain committed to doing everything in our power to ensure the Government, citizens and businesses are as ready as we can be before the end of the transition.  As the T&aacute;naiste alluded to, and as I made reference to this morning in the stakeholder forum, the structures for engagement that were put in place between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of the Taoiseach are still in place and that will continue, irrespective of who is in what Ministry or what Government is in place.<br\/><br\/>On the positive side, we have in place the withdrawal agreement.  The issue of Northern Ireland has been agreed in the protocol.  The Government's preparedness work will be closely aligned with progress on the negotiations and will evolve as elements of the deal become clearer.  As the talks progress, we will roll out communications programmes covering specific areas.  As before, Departments and agencies will continue to engage with key stakeholders, taking into account the significant challenges businesses, individuals and sectors currently face with Covid-19.<br\/><br\/>As the T&aacute;naiste mentioned earlier, whatever the outcome of Brexit negotiations between the EU and the UK, the <i>status quo<\/i>will not remain.

I wish to start by expressing my condolences to the family and friends of those that have been lost to this disease since I was last in this House.  It is an individual loss but there is also a sense of national loss.  We share in your loss.<\/p>  <p>  Today, I will update the House in two ways, by providing the latest information on our ongoing modelling work and by sharing some key messages from my recent discussions today with the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tony Holohan.  Members will recall that the R nought, or reproduction rate, was previously in a range of 0.5 to 0.8.  I am advised that range is now as low as 0.3 to 0.8 in some estimates and the overall rate is considered stable around 0.5.  The other data coming through in the modelling is the number of admissions to hospital and intensive care.  I am pleased to announce that both of these have halved in the last week.  Last week hospital admissions were around 40 a day whereas this week that is around 20 a day and last week ICU admissions were around four to six a day whereas it is around two a day this week.<\/p> <p>In long-term residential care settings, the number of cases is declining.  Based on the preliminary data, it is declining from approximately 100 new cases a day in early April to approximately 50 a day towards the end of last week.  These significant decreases are welcome signs of progress.  They are the tangible result of so much hard work across our health service and, indeed, across the entire country.  I want to convey my genuine thanks to all those working so hard.<\/p> <p> I want to share with Members four key messages from my discussions earlier today with the Chief Medical Officer regarding the point the country is now at.  First, as the public health measures in our society begin to be lifted, our personal behaviour will become more important than ever in order to protect ourselves and each other.  If we continue to wash our hands, practise coughing and sneezing etiquette and maintain social distancing, we can move more safely to our next phase when 18 May arrives.  Second, the levels of the disease in our community continue to decrease.  This gives us an opportunity to go after the disease where it is and focus our attention on places at a higher risk of outbreaks, such as workplaces and other congregated settings.  Third, the World Health Organization has stated that this disease may be with us for a long time.  It will be with us in the form of either lower levels of transmission or waves of higher infection rates.  In order to be prepared for this, we must continue to remain vigilant as individuals and as a society and we must be ready to reintroduce public health measures when necessary.  Fourth, as a country, we have pushed back this disease by working together and protecting ourselves and each other.  As we continue to do this into the future, we continue to be stronger than this disease.<\/p> <p> The sacrifices we have made, the work we have done and the solidarity we have kept have pushed back this disease enough so that we are now able to begin to tentatively plan for the reopening of our society and our economy.  However, let me be clear: this progress is fragile and this plan depends on all of us remaining resolute and relentless in our national effort to suppress this virus.  Our road map has been published and we are working to move forward with it but we do so with all due caution.  The protection of the health and lives of our citizens will continue to be our primary concern.  When we come to consider any further easing of restrictions, we will continue to rely on our expert public health advice and we will have regard to: the latest data on the progression of the disease; the capacity and resilience of our health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy; the capacity of our sampling, testing and contact tracing programme; our ability to protect and care for those who are most at risk from the disease; and, importantly, an assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.  We will make our decisions based on the advice and data, along with our consideration of what is best for our society as a whole.<\/p> <p> We have pushed back this disease collectively but it has certainly not gone away.  It can return with ferocity if we do not remain vigilant and retain our ability to be flexible and agile in our response.  We will not risk losing the ground we have gained against the disease.  The people would not wish us to do so.  All our decisions will continue to respect the hardship and the sacrifice that so many have made to bring us to this point.<\/p> <p> As already mentioned, one critical element is our ability to test and contact-trace so that we can limit the impact of future outbreaks of Covid-19.  Our target testing capacity remains as advised by the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, on 17 April: the ability to perform 100,000 tests per week operating on a seven-days-a-week basis for a minimum of six months.  The HSE has developed a plan for building its capacity towards that target and I am pleased to say it is now delivering real results.  Significant progress on building and increasing testing capacity has been made in what objectively must be seen as a short space of time.  The result is that capacity has expanded to 12,000 a day and turnaround times have significantly improved.  The HSE will be stepping up capacity to 15,000 tests a day in the next two weeks.  Turnaround times will continue to improve and we should see average turnaround time from swab to result of between one to three days by 18 May.<\/p> <p> We are continuing to widen the net of groups being tested to meet this capacity.  This is important and has been welcomed by our general practitioners and health professionals.  Now that we have extra capacity, we are widening the criteria in terms of who can be tested.  This is good as we continue to aggressively go after this virus where it is most likely and where it will do most harm.  We will continue to strategically target testing at vulnerable groups.  Let me be clear: those testing priorities will be decided by public health experts and NPHET.  They will not be political decisions.  We will target testing where it can do most good in terms of going after the virus where we are most likely to find it and in groups in which it is most likely to do harm.<\/p> <p>The behaviour of this disease in our residential facilities continues to be our area of greatest concern, despite what I think people would have to acknowledge is a significant improvement based on the modelling data on the reduction in the number of new cases.  Our 23 response teams across the country, led by senior nursing support, will continue to provide senior clinical expertise, infection prevention and control and public health input to prevent and manage clusters in nursing homes and other residential facilities.  I have no doubt when we get into the questions and answers that we will have an opportunity to outline some of the benefit we are now seeing from the home help agreement in the redeployment of staff from that sector into our nursing homes, which has begun in earnest this week.  As the House will be aware, we have prioritised testing in our long-term residential care settings.  That has yielded a real benefit in getting on top of this virus.  Crucially, our regulator, the voice that we, the Oireachtas, put in place to oversee safety in nursing homes, namely, HIQA, will have ongoing oversight of the response in these facilities through its Covid-19 quality assurance regulatory framework.  Its visits to nursing homes have started.  I had a very good meeting with HIQA on that yesterday.<\/p> <p> Last Tuesday, we were able to increase the distance which people may go to exercise to up to 5 km.  We were also able to provide advice to those who are cocooning on how they can safely take some exercise as long as they take those necessary precautions in the interest of their own health.  I wish to say a special word to people in this \"cocooning\" category.  I know this is an uninvited label and a very much unloved one.  I am not sure where the word came from but I have yet to meet anyone who likes it, myself included.  People in the category are well aware they have an increased vulnerability to this awful virus but they do not associate their ordinary, non-Covid lives with vulnerability.  I refer, for example, to people in their 70s and 80s who are in good health.  Following the advice on how best to stay safe contrasts starkly with a life lived normally, actively and resiliently.  I hope the increased activity suggested by the recent advice helps, and we want to build on that.  We will continue to provide honestly advice on the best way for those most adversely affected by the virus to stay safe.  We do not do so to cause offence in any way but, rather, in order to impart the best possible medical advice.  I hope that as we further suppress this virus together, we can get closer to those normal lives as quickly as possible.  We were able to bring in these changes and begin to plan tentatively for the reopening of our society and some of our economy because our country has acted as one in doing what it takes to suppress this disease.  We can continue to move forward safely and look forward to better days if we stay the course and remain vigilant.<\/p> <p> I will conclude by expressing my gratitude for the continued unity of this House in supporting the public health advice while rightly scrutinising the Government's response.  I very much welcome the establishment of a new Oireachtas committee, which I know has been set up to aid that effort.  On that note, I ask everyone to stress the difference we can all still make between now and 18 May in weakening this virus as much as we possibly can.  We now know how to do it as a country - wash your hands, cough and sneeze properly, keep your distance, stay at home, stay safe, mind one another and protect one another.

On that point, I wish to talk to the Minister about cancer services.  The HSE told us yesterday that GP referrals to the rapid access clinics for patients with suspected cancers have fallen by more than half since Covid-19 arrived.  This means that many people with cancers will have those cancers missed, at least in the short term, and we know that matters greatly.  The HSE has said far fewer people are going to their GPs with their suspected concerns and that some people may not be aware that full GP services are open.  We all know that other people are simply afraid to go out still and are very cautious about catching this awful virus.  A UK study published in recent days, which I am sure the Minister is aware of, shows that the UK has had an even bigger fall in access from GPs to their rapid access clinics.  Worryingly, the study also predicts that England alone could see a 20% increase in cancer deaths just in the next 12 months because of this lower number of referrals.<\/p> <p>If that were to happen here, and please God it will not, we would be looking at approximately 2,000 more deaths from cancer in the next 12 months alone.  In short, if we do not fix this and get referral rates back up, we could end up with a situation where more additional people will have died from cancer than from Covid-19.<\/p> <p> On top of that, the screening services have been suspended, as the Minister knows, for reasons we all understand.  Oncologists are also saying that many of the services they use, including diagnostics and operating theatres, while available, are taking longer to access than they normally would.<\/p> <p> Is it not now time to reopen the screening services and get the diagnostics and identification going again?  Would the Minister agree that it is time for us to launch a major, national public education campaign with the same level of focus and professionalism as has been done for Covid-19 to encourage people to go to their GPs if they have concerns about their health?  What can be done to address the serious blockages that are still in the system for oncologists as they try to get their patients diagnosed and treated as quickly as possible?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700052#GGG00400","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588872000,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising what is a massively important issue.  He is right that it is entirely possible that this country, and indeed many others, will come through the Covid pandemic, albeit with undoubted tragedy, pain and hurt, only for more people to pass away or get very sick from other illnesses through secondary morbidity and secondary mortality.  We need to work collectively against that.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of the considerable efforts of the Irish people, we have, thankfully, not yet seen our hospitals and intensive care units overwhelmed in the way they could have been, although that does not take away from the personal tragedies that have occurred.  We also have some capacity now in private hospitals and that is something about which the Deputy has been engaging with me.  We absolutely need to now have non-Covid care running alongside Covid care.  At the meeting of National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, on Tuesday of this week, the blanket ban on non-Covid related procedures, treating cancer and other diseases, was changed.  Assessments in that regard will now be based on a clinical and operational assessment.  The HSE is now finalising its non-Covid care plans.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically on the Deputy's question about cancer, the first message we must get out is that GP services are open and safe, and that GPs want to see their patients.  GPs have led on the establishment of our community assessment hubs which provide a pathway for care for people with Covid in the community to keep general practice Covid-free.  That is further, welcome reassurance that GPs are providing.<\/p>  <p>  The national cancer control programme has today done exactly what the Deputy has suggested and started a major public awareness campaign.  I would welcome the Deputy's input on how we can make the campaign as good as possible.  The campaign is telling people not to delay, or ignore symptoms, but to pick up the phone and use the available cancer services.<\/p>  <p>  The reopening of screening is going to be a clinical decision taken by the national cancer control programme in consultation with NPHET.  I would like to see it up and running as quickly as possible but I am conscious that it needs to be done in a safe way and at an appropriate time.<\/p>  <p>  I do not want to use up the Deputy's time but there are a number of issues under consideration and being worked through between the Department, the HSE and the national cancer control programme, including medical oncology services, continuing with the relocation of day wards where necessary, and continuing with provisions made for physical distancing in radiation oncology services.  Maintaining urgent surgical oncology services is a priority, with many of those services now relocating to the private hospitals.  Cancer care is absolutely a priority, as is getting non-Covid care running alongside Covid care, and a lot of good work has been undertaken by our healthcare professionals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700053#HHH00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1588872000,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

There are advertisements in every newspaper, on every radio programme and on the television, and we are all out talking about it.  Every door has a big yellow sign on it referring to Covid-19.  That is fantastic and deserves credit.  My point is that, with the best will in the world, the national cancer control programme could never replicate that kind of campaign on its own.

I pay tribute to and thank the fantastic staff in all the nursing and care homes throughout the country for the work they have done over the past two months.  They have gone far beyond the call of duty.<\/p>  <p>  On Tuesday last, I visited St. Carthage's House in Lismore, a care home for 42 residents.  It is a fantastic facility for people with low to moderate dependencies.  I called to deliver hand sanitiser supplied by Irish Distillers and distributed through Irish Rural Link.  Unfortunately, couriers were unable to deliver due to the alcohol content so I took on the delivery for the Waterford area.  Delivering the hand sanitiser outside the premises, observing social distancing, I commented that the staff were in terrific form.  They told me that all 42 residents and staff had been tested, results had come back and every one of them was Covid-19 free.  The concern for residents and staff had been ongoing for weeks, since the pandemic started, and it is the same in all facilities.  There should be regular testing of staff and residents in nursing and care homes, perhaps on a monthly or bimonthly basis.  The pandemic has borne down heaviest on older people, particularly those in nursing homes and residential facilities.  The most recent figures indicate that 740 nursing home residents have passed away having contracting the coronavirus.  That is more than half of all the confirmed deaths.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that testing has been ramped up in nursing homes in recent weeks and I understand that more than 90% of residents and staff have now been tested.  That is welcome, but it is an exercise that should be repeated on a consistent basis.  Does the Minister agree that there should be testing on a consistent basis, perhaps monthly or bimonthly?  Hopefully, it could be done in-house because the faces of those at St. Carthage's who knew they were Covid-19 free were a joy to behold.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700054#JJJ00100","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1588872600,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I will take Deputy Cahill as well and the Minister might combine his answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700054#JJJ00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1588872600,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle.

I have been contacted about the hospital by a local councillor, Kieran Bourke, and some of the staff at the hospital.  St. Brigid's is a facility of the highest reputation and standards within the system.  It acts as a step-down facility from acute care for the south Tipperary and south Kilkenny areas.  In the current crisis, it was appointed as a step-down facility for Covid-19 patients who had left acute care.  We were informed two weeks ago that the demand for such Covid-19 step-down beds at St. Brigid's had decreased, that the hospital had been temporarily suspended and that admissions for step-down Covid-19-related care there would resume when required.  However, it is now believed that beds are physically being removed from St. Brigid's to be used at Our Lady's Hospital in Cashel.

To conclude the conversation with Deputy Donnelly in regard to cancer care and, in fairness, I know he said this also, it need not go the way that it potentially will go in other countries because of the efforts the people here have made and the leadership that our healthcare professionals have shown.  We now have an opportunity to really ramp up our non-Covid-19 care plans alongside our Covid-19 care plans, and I want to assure the Deputy of my Department's and the HSE's real appetite for doing that.  I do not want members of the public to be unnecessarily concerned.  The health service is open.  The health service has spare capacity available, which is not something the Minister for Health is usually able to say.  GPs are urging people to call them.  Community assessment hubs are in place.  The Irish Cancer Society, Cancer Care West and others have come together to ramp up their services and supports.  I want to acknowledge that and thank them for it.  A major advertising campaign will start next week, but I very much hear the Deputy that it needs to be a significant and very visible one.  I give my word to him that we will ensure that is the case and I will revert to him on what that might look like.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Butler for telling me about her visit to St. Carthage's House and for the work she has been doing to help in the context of delivering hand sanitiser.  The experience she has articulated is one that I have seen across the country when I engage with nursing home owners and at my twice-weekly meeting with nursing home owners also.  It is that sense of relief and reassurance that a negative result can provide.<\/p> <p>Thankfully, we saw the positivity rate of testing overall, not just in nursing homes, drop back to approximately 3.7% last week.  The overwhelming majority of people are getting the peace of mind that they do not have Covid.<\/p> <p> The Deputy is right that testing is only a point in time and one needs to keep going back and doing it again and again.  The short answer to the Deputy's question in this regard is \"Yes\".  There will be a recurring programme of testing for long-term residential care facilities.  NPHET is due to consider a paper on how best to do that either at its meeting tomorrow or Tuesday of next week.  It will be finalised within the next week.  We will be also talking to the nursing home sector, HIQA and others about how lessons can be learned in regard to streamlining the process.  Deputy Butler is correct, too, that there is a real appetite from nursing home staff nurses to do the testing themselves, which would greatly assist everybody.  We will take them up on that offer but we need to work out a way to do it most appropriately.<\/p> <p> Deputy Cahill spoke about St. Brigid's Hospital in Carrick-on-Suir.

Oncologists are frustrated.  Everybody understands why the blockages have appeared in the system as they have, but there appears to be a disconnect between the public narrative that cancer care services are operating as normal and what the oncologists and, more importantly, their patients are experiencing.  There are a lot of delays.  It would be fantastic if the Minister could look into that.<\/p>  <p>  On the turnaround time for testing in nursing homes, it is great that NPHET is looking at a paper on retesting.  The turnaround time in hospital settings is 24 hours more or less.  If a patient or member of staff is tested, the result is available within 24 hours.  In the nursing homes at the moment, the waiting time is regularly five or six days and sometimes more than a week.  I raised this directly with the HSE yesterday and was told that its target is to bring down the waiting time to three days by the middle of this month.  The target should be one day.  That is the target in the acute hospitals so that if there is an outbreak, it is identified and people can be isolated, contacts can be traced and there is no big knock-on effect on patients and staff.  The nursing homes have exactly the same need.  One of the reasons the HSE gave for the longer waiting time for nursing homes is that the ambulance crews need to go out, but the homes have trained clinical staff and can take the swabs themselves.  Will the Minister push the HSE on this and put it to NPHET that the target for nursing homes should be not three days but 24 hours as it is for the acute sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700055#KKK00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1588873200,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I will do so.

The national ambulance service has been incredible and its staff have done an amazing job, but if we can take out that piece and do the testing in-house, it will speed up the process.

The first issue I wish to raise concerns nursing homes.  Two weeks ago, I was advised during a teleconference with the HSE that patients were not transferred to nursing homes unless they had received two negative results for Covid.  Some of the information that is coming to me is anecdotal and I also have information from a member of my family.  The very firm belief among people I have spoken to is that at the very start of this crisis, in preparation for the surge, patients were moved without being tested into the nursing home sector.  The belief in the sector among some staff members, which is in accordance with the experience of my family member, is that the virus was brought into the nursing homes from the hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  I have raised this issue previously with the Minister.  Can he confirm that testing is now being done in every single case?  Will he advise whether it is his intention to examine the possibility, as raised by me previously, that the virus may have come into nursing homes by dint of the preparations that were made at the very beginning of the crisis when people were moved out of hospitals?  I am being straight with the Minister in saying I am not convinced the testing happened as is being claimed.  It is what the HSE told me happened when I spoke to officials on a conference call and I accept that it may be practised in some instances now, but I do not believe it was practised at the time, and that is an issue that needs to be examined.<\/p> <p>The next issue I want to raise concerns direct provision.  I thank members of the Fingal Communities Against Racism for the good work it continues to do with our neighbours in Balseskin.  Yesterday, when I asked the HSE how many people in direct provision had tested positive for Covid-19 I was told that number was 150.  At a later briefing, journalists were told the number is 88.  I understand this is an ongoing situation but perhaps the Minister would provide the exact number.  <\/p> <p> I have been contacted by a woman who was moved out of a centre to a hotel to self-isolate.  She was told that this would be helpful because she would be closer to a hospital and she could quarantine for seven days.  This woman has three young children and they are all living in one room.  The woman and one of her children have serious respiratory conditions.  She is worried that other people who are self-isolating because of suspected infection are being housed in the same hotel, which is contrary to HSE advice.  This woman is terrified.  She has requested a transfer, as anyone would.  The woman has been told that transfer requests cannot be processed due to Covid-19.  This transfer is being requested because of Covid-19.  That is what makes it urgent.  This woman is living in one room with three children, who have only noodles and bread to eat because that is all she can get.  She does not want to return to Balseskin where there were 93 confirmed cases of Covid-19, representing an infection rate of approximately 40%.  She wants to protect her children and she needs help.  How many positive cases of Covid-19 are there in direct provision?  Will the Minister, as a matter of urgency, ensure that the additional capacity created in places like Citywest can be utilised by people in direct provision, DP?  Will he ensure that the mixing of people who are cocooning with those who are transferred out of direct provision because they are suspected cases of Covid-19 stops immediately and will he urge the Department of Justice and Equality to facilitate transfer for health and safety reasons?<\/p> <p> I want to raise again with the Minister the issue of geriatricians being part of the teams that go into nursing homes, which I raised with him last week.  If the Minister has responded, I apologise as I have not seen a response.  It would be a really good idea and very beneficial.  <\/p> <p> The final issue I want to raise concerns section 39 agencies and charities, which have been struggling for some time due to loss of income through funding cuts over the past decade.  Will the Minister consider establishing a Covid-19 fund for these charities to help them get over the difficulties that they face?  Will he restore the &euro;20 million funding cut to section 39 agencies and guarantee the HSE funding to the sector?  The Minister will appreciate that their normal channels of fundraising are pretty much closed to them.  They are desperate and they need help to continue to provide vital supports in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700055#KKK00400","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588873800,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Reilly for her questions.  On the section 39 agencies, I will examine the issue and revert to the Deputy on it.  On the point regarding the geriatricians, I have written to the Deputy on it.  The short answer is that we are examining how we can do something not too dissimilar to what the Deputy suggests.<\/p>  <p>  On nursing homes, I have discussed with the Chief Medical Officer the need for the National Public Health Emergency Team to review the issue of long-term residential care in nursing homes, about which the Deputy rightly stated there is a lot of anecdotal information, including, for example, the visitor restrictions.  In fairness, the data and the graphs that have been produced by NPHET and the Chief Medical Officer show that the timelines do not align.  My gut feeling is it is a case of delayed transfers of care and people being discharged into the nursing homes sector.  The short answer is that we are going to examine the matter and revert to the Deputy on it.  It does seem that community transmission is the most likely reason.  Obviously, essential are workers are doing an incredible job but their having to go into healthcare facilities seems to have been a factor.  We will produce a paper in relation to the work, which we will share with the Houses and the committee.  We will publish it as well.<\/p>  <p>  On direct provision, first it is really important, for the benefit of those who sometimes like to talk down the many brilliant people who come to our country from over jurisdictions, that we acknowledge that there are 160 healthcare workers resident in direct provision centres across the country.

A range of measures are in place to address any case of Covid-19 if and when it arises, and this includes the provision for self-isolation facilities in centres.  There was a meeting with the Department of Justice and Equality on this issue yesterday.  There are a number of off-site self-isolation centres throughout the State and Citywest has been used for that purpose, although not solely for that purpose.  The Department of Justice and Equality is working collaboratively with the HSE to implement the public health advice.

These are mothers, fathers, siblings and grandparents.  Unlike other nursing homes that have featured in the media, I have not seen official figures for the number that have died in Dealgan House.

A case in point is the announcement about testing.  We were told we are to get 100,000 per week and we are also told it will be 15,000 per day.  Of course, while this sounds great, in practice, the situation is very different on the ground.  I was contacted recently by a person who had to wait 22 days to get the test results, and that was after chasing up the hospital to get those results.  Others are waiting 12 or 15 days for their results.  As testing figures seem unclear and not very exact, I wonder how many results a day are being communicated to those tested.<\/p>  <p>It seems that it could be different.  It is probably a better way of measuring how effective testing is.<\/p> <p> Another big announcement was that the State had done a deal with private hospitals.  This sounded fantastic but the reality was different.  I have been contacted by staff in private hospitals who have said those hospitals were significantly under utilised over the past eight weeks.  When we consider that almost 50% of those who have died from the Covid virus were resident in nursing homes we must ask why the hospitals have been so under utilised.  The son of a nursing home resident contacted me to ask whether the Government had abandoned the nursing homes.  Unfortunately, the answer seems to be \"yes\".  In this context, will the Minister commit to using all of the resources in the private hospitals to support nursing homes?<\/p> <p> Homecare workers are not required to wear masks, which has been mentioned.  This is a real concern for many people who have vulnerable family members receiving support.  It is also a concern for the homecare workers.  A homecare worker may have to make up to 30 visits a day.

I can speak fast but not that fast.  In response to Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, I extend my sincere sympathy to the families, friends and staff in Dealgan nursing home, which he referenced.  I will have to liaise with the HSE on the specific question on the RCSI's involvement.  I know it has been playing a proactive role.  The Deputy wants an assurance that the role will continue.  I will revert to him directly or through the HSE on this in the coming days.  To anybody who has any concern about any long-term residential care facility, I point out that HIQA is there as a regulator.<\/p>  <p>  To answer Deputy Andrews's question on testing, we are delivering.  I do not have time in 50 seconds to tell him in how many ways.  Last night, a table was published by Our World in Data, which shows Ireland ranks fourth highest out of 25 EU countries and the UK in terms of tests completed as a percentage of the overall population.  Rates can also be displayed as tests completed per 1 million population.  We are ramping up our testing and improving our testing turnaround times.  We could constantly do better and we need to do better.<\/p>  <p>  Private hospitals are being used and in response to another question I am sure I will get a chance to talk about the utilisation figures.  We do not move people from their homes to make a private hospital busier or anywhere else busy.  We take these as clinical decisions and I would not like to overrule those clinical decisions.<\/p>  <p>  On Pieta House, I am looking into that matter.  I am very grateful for the very good work it does.  On A Vision for a Change, I am in the hands of the Oireachtas as generally we do not bring new policy decisions.  Deputy Shortall raised this with me last week and I met the mental health forum today on it.  We usually let a new government bring the A Vision for Change policy.  It is ready to go and I have an open mind on what is the best timing to do it.

I express my condolences to the families and friends of those who have been lost to this awful disease over the past few months.<\/p>  <p>  My mother is 92 and is in a local nursing home.  She happened to be in Sligo University Hospital.  As someone who have benefited from the system, I pay tribute to all of the front-line staff and all of the stakeholders for their work and perseverance in a very difficult time and for their understanding.<\/p> <p>That has to go on the record of the D&aacute;il today.  We are very much indebted and I hope in future times that we will remember the great service of all these nurses, doctors, garda&iacute; and everybody who has played such a great role.  It is also very heartening to see all the organisations that are trying to help out front-line staff in getting funding for meals and so on.  On the way to Dublin today, I was listening to the radio and there was an item that really caught the mood.  I refer to Daniel O'Donnell and his really kind gesture outside Dungloe Community Hospital yesterday, where he had his outdoor concert.  It encapsulated all that is good that has gone on in the last few months.  It was clear from the patients and staff that there was a great feeling.  This is something that we should really appreciate and be thankful for.  I thank Daniel O'Donnell and everybody for the amount of work they are doing.<\/p> <p> There are a few questions that I wish to ask.  Would the Minister agree on the importance of Irish-based US pharmaceutical companies to the Irish economy?  Given the comments of the US President last week, does the Minister believe there is a role which these companies, which have highly-skilled Irish workforces, could play in better assisting Ireland in areas such as testing during the Covid-19 crisis?  How can we get the message out much clearer and quicker that people who are sick or worried about their health condition still need to go to their doctor to be assessed?  There is a worrying drop in the number of cancer referrals, for example.  As we know, all cancer has not gone away.  Is there a new approach to achieve this?  Based on anecdotal evidence from GPs, I think 25% of people are turning up at their practices.  Perhaps at one stage it was far too high, I do not know, but it is worrying that not so many are going because of this Covid crisis.<\/p> <p> In respect of public hospitals, can the Minister outline to the House when private patients will be able to get private procedures by private doctors and consultants?  I understand what needed to be done but people are looking for a timescale of when this will occur.  We all have everybody ringing us up over the last two months about procurement of personal protective equipment, PPE, asking who they should talk to in the HSE.  I understand there is a website or email address that we all can send queries to.  Even today I have heard from people from Canada, China, India and the whole lot.  We want to go through the right channels.  Is there an email that we can send on?  I know the email address but it is no harm that everybody around the country can send it in.  We do not want conflicts of interest when people are asking.  It is great to have an email or web address to send queries on to.  It would be no harm to highlight that again.  There is an issue regarding capital health projects under construction.  When will they commence on-site and will there be any consequences for projects not yet started but identified under the Project Ireland 2040 plan?  Does the Minister have any comments on that?  With the hit to the economy from Covid-19 it could be an issue.  <\/p> <p> One issue that is coming up now and again concerns dental practices.  They have been suspended by the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.  They have maintained emergency dental services and are providing advice over the phone and arranging prescriptions with local pharmacies.  However, the whole practice has collapsed to nearly 5% of normal.  Routine dental care will start from 18 May but there is an issue with practices getting PPE.  The cost has skyrocketed and they seem to be in competition with other agencies and organisations.  Seemingly it is very difficult to source and dental teams are going to need an awful lot of PPE in the post-pandemic world.  What exactly is the HSE doing?  Are there any arrangements with dentists?  It seems to be an issue.  They get no support or subsidies from the State.  Their sole income is private practice on a fee per item basis.<\/p> <p>I had not been fully aware that dentists' situation is quite different to arrangements with medical GPs.  Dentists say that they get no personal protective equipment, PPE, no financial support and very little guidance from the Government.  I am sure there is guidance but perhaps the Minister could talk about that.  We need the HSE to talk to the Irish Dental Association about new contracts for dental care post Covid-19.  According to dentists it is long overdue.  I look forward to the Minister's views on these points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700058#NNN00600","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588875900,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I am scheduled to meet with the Irish Dental Association tomorrow afternoon.  As Deputy Feighan has said, guidance has been provided.  Obviously we must follow public health advice but we want to have a conversation with the association, as we do with other sectors, with regard to how dentists operate in the new normal, at the appropriate time.  I will not pre-empt that meeting but my officials and I will meet with the association representatives tomorrow.<\/p><p>On capital projects, we will be guided on our construction projects by NPHET in the same way as the rest of the construction sector.  I have no plans to alter or pull back capital projects that are under way.  They will recommence at the appropriate time from a public health and safety perspective.<\/p><p>Deputy Feighan's point on PPE is entirely right.  The fact this virus will be with us for far longer than perhaps many people would have expected means we need to continue to seek more PPE.  Ireland is doing relatively well in that regard when compared with others, but one can never have enough PPE.  The website <i>gov.ie\/covidsupplies<\/i>is the best way for people to submit their application and have it assessed.  That is a whole-of-government effort as well.<\/p><p>With regard to private patients in private hospitals, we have offered guidance to the HSE about the obligation to continuity of care.  If a doctor is seeing a patient, there is an obligation to continuity of care and, if it cannot be provided, for that patient to be transferred.  I will send a note to the Deputy on that.<\/p><p>The Deputy is entirely correct on non-Covid care.  I have spoken to Deputies Butler and Stephen Donnelly about this in earlier exchanges.  We are finalising our non-Covid care plan.  We are starting a major public awareness campaign, and Members may have seen some of it today.  It will ramp up next week, especially around cancer care.  The campaign will very much get the message out that GPs want to hear from people if they are sick.  Please do not ignore a symptom and do not delay in contacting GPs.  There is capacity in the Irish health services and a safe way of looking after people who are sick from illnesses that are not Covid, as well as looking after those patients who have Covid-19.<\/p><p>On the issue of pharmaceutical companies, the long and proud relationship this country has, including economic and social ties, with the United States is a two-way street and a two-way relationship.  Many Irish companies create jobs in the United States and there are many excellent United States multinationals creating jobs here.  We are engaging with all industry here, including multinationals, through IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in the roles they might be able to play in providing vital equipment and in making sure Ireland is promoted as a location for research as we continue to work our way through this pandemic.<\/p><p>I will take the opportunity given to me by Deputy Feighan to pay tribute to the staff working in our nursing homes.  Just because there is an outbreak in a nursing home does not mean it is a sign of failure on the part of staff.  There are many incredible people working night and day in our nursing homes, and many nursing homes might have an outbreak of Covid-19 in the same way a family home might.  They are dealing with it really well and working in very difficult circumstances with vulnerable people.  Many of them, public and private, are doing extraordinarily good work.<\/p><p>I am sure that when this pandemic is over, there will be many lessons to learn and this Oireachtas will seek with us to learn them.  Looking objectively at what we are doing in our nursing home sector and compares it with many other countries, I believe that Ireland has been quite proactive.  Providing PPE to private nursing homes is not the norm in many other countries.  Redeploying staff from the public health service to private nursing homes is also not the norm in many other countries, nor is reaching an agreement with home care workers whereby we now have 145 home care workers going in to work in long-term residential care settings.  I thank them for that.  Testing asymptomatic residents and staff across our nursing home sector is not the norm and I am not sure there are many countries doing that at all.  We have also put in place a financial assistance scheme with &euro;4 million ready to pay out to private nursing homes, for which to date we have 277 applications processed.  We have put a lot of supports in place and we will continue to support the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700060#PPP00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1588875900,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I offer my condolences to all who have been bereaved so far by the Covid-19 pandemic.  I share my sympathies, as Members across the House have expressed theirs.<\/p> <p>I would like to revisit my colleague, Deputy Ossian Smyth's, and I am sure the Minister's, favourite topic, namely, the Covid tracker app.  I thank the Minister for the publication of last week's document.  Although it is not a technical specification that an engineer would recognise or use, it provided helpful and confidence-building information.  We were pleased to note that Ireland will, in line with best international practice, use the Apple-Google framework for decentralised exposure notification.  We look forward to seeing the full data protection impact assessment in due course and engaging in the pre-launch discussion in the House which the Minister promised.  We continue to call for a set of technical specifications, ideally including the source code, which the Minister indicated would be published.<\/p> <p> I will focus my questions on how the app relates to Northern Ireland.  By way of background, we have particular concerns about cross-Border traffic and potential infection or exposure.  Although it is too early to identify causes, the abnormally high excess mortality rates in counties Cavan and Monaghan underline the severity of the problem.  As the Minister's report notes, international inter-operability of contact-tracing apps is desirable but complex and is likely to take many months to achieve.  This is too long for us, given our unique border situation.  The UK Government is, almost uniquely in the world, continuing with its plan to build a centralised contact-tracing app, which will not be inter-operable with any other contact-tracing app, including ours.  It is at the discretion of an app developer, which in the case of the Covid-19 tracker app is the HSE, to decide in which app stores its app will appear.  For example, earlier today I successfully downloaded the Indian contact-tracing app, which is known as Aarogya Setu.<\/p> <p> Will the Minister confirm we will offer the Covid-19 tracker app in the UK app store in order that Northern Irish residents can download and use it?  As part of the publicity campaign planned for the launch of the app, will he ensure that Northern Irish residents who may travel to the Republic, or who may interact with people who travel North from the Republic, are aware they can download and use the Covid-19 tracker app?  Whether or not the app is in cross-Border use, are arrangements and protocols in place between the Irish and Northern Irish contact-tracing teams to facilitate tracking of cross-Border infection, exposure and risk?<\/p> <p> My second question relates to therapeutics and vaccines.  My colleague, Deputy Ossian Smyth, asked last week about how we were planning to acquire stocks of remdesivir, the antiviral drug that has shown promising early results in treating patients acutely ill with Covid-19.  On the broader topic of access to therapies and vaccines, and assuming we do not want to get into a PPE-style procurement scramble for drugs, I ask the Minister the following question, for which I am happy to receive answers subsequently in writing.  Do we have, or are we working on, plans to access locally manufactured supplies of therapeutic drugs or vaccines as they become available and are the drug companies here co-operating with the Minister in this regard?  Should we consider keeping the Covid-19 testing centres active beyond the six months envisaged and until a vaccine is available, both so that we can keep testing at a high rate and so that we could use Covid-19 testing centres as vaccination clinics?<\/p> <p> I note that the US President has announced he is willing to wind down the American coronavirus task force around the end of May.  I do not for a moment suggest there is much we can learn from the American experience, but just as we have laid out a roadmap and criteria for reopening our economy and society, does the Minister have a view of how and when we can move from a crisis footing to a more normal operational phase as it relates to health service governance and operations?  Specifically, for how long does he envisage that a NPHET-like structure will be required and how and when could we think about moving to a more long-term arrangement from our current crisis footing?  I think we have all been struggling with the current arrangements as they relate to transparency and D&aacute;il oversight, as I am sure the Minister will agree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700060#PPP00300","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588876500,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his contributions.  I am always in awe of the Green Party knowledge of all things to do with the app.  Every week it is very impressive.  I hope that it augurs well if the party comes into government in respect of the progressing of these matters.<\/p> <p>This app will be a big help.  To make a point the Chief Medical Officer would make if he were here, this app will be complementary to what he would describe as the shoe leather, which is the ongoing work in contact tracing.  Some countries talk about using these apps almost to replace the more traditional route of carrying out contact tracing but that is not our intention.<\/p> <p> I will respond to the Deputy in writing on some of the questions about Northern Ireland.  We want an all-island approach and we are working hard.  I have had a number of engagements with the Northern Ireland Minister of Health, Robin Swann, and the T&aacute;naiste and I have had a number of engagements with the First Minister, Deputy First Minister, Secretary of State and Minister of Health.  The two chief medical officers are engaging as well and the Deputy's proposals in this regard are eminently sensible.  I intend that the app will be available to residents in Northern Ireland through the UK store.  We will revert to the Deputy on some of the technical ways of making that happen.  We are having some conversations with colleagues in the North regarding an all-island approach, of which this is one element.<\/p> <p> I will get the Deputy an updated note on the therapeutics but, as of now, remdesivir has not been licensed or approved anywhere globally and has not yet been demonstrated to be safe or effective for treatment of Covid-19.  In this country, access to remdesivir is facilitated through one of three mechanisms.  The first is compassionate access for pregnant women and their children.  The second is an expanded access programme assigned to two sites only, which were selected on the basis of a review exercise that was undertaken.  The company imposed criteria in this regard, including that the patient needed to be ventilated and the clinical site could not be able to access the drug through a clinical trial.  The third is the WHO solidarity study, in which I am eager that Ireland will participate.  This trial is supported by my Department and is progressing in anticipation of being able to recruit patients in the coming weeks.  Work is being undertaken by a group, with representatives from my Department, the Health Research Board Clinical Research Coordination Ireland, and our regulator, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  The study will be sponsored by University College Cork, UCC, and the national primary investigator will be Professor Joe Eustace.  The phase 1 sites will be University Hospital Limerick; Cork University Hospital; University Hospital Galway; Beaumont Hospital; Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda; the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital; St. James's Hospital; Tallaght University Hospital; and St. Vincent's University Hospital.  It is a largely randomised study, in which remdesivir will be one arm.  I will keep the House informed on this clinical study.<\/p> <p> On NPHET, I do not have a definitive view on when it will no longer be required.  I envisage it will be required for quite a period.  My gut feeling is that it will be required at least for the duration of Ireland's published roadmap because we will require its view at every phase as to whether it is safe to move on to the next phase.  We will also require massive public health surveillance during that time.  I am not suggesting Deputy Leddin was necessarily saying this but I do not buy into some of the conspiracy theories I hear about NPHET.  It is an excellent group of experts, with about 20 doctors on the committee.  It brings together all of the relevant people from the HPRA, which is our medicines' regulator, HIQA, the Department of Health and the HSE.  It also includes a few people such as the president of the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP.  Its minutes are published, as they should be.  Letters to me and to the chief executive of the HSE are also published, as they should be.  We have made clear in our roadmap the governance structure with respect to how decision processes are made, which is a welcome development.  Following the publication of the roadmap, I will go to Cabinet every three weeks with a report with a recommendation on whether we can move on to the next phase.  There is a clear understanding of exactly how the Cabinet will make those decisions as well.  I am conscious that I come to this House two hours per week and will, I presume, participate in the Covid-19 committee as well, along with officials, to try to continue to provide that information.  NPHET is not unique to this crisis.  It has been used in many other crises, including the CPE crisis.  I value, as do the Irish people, the decision to take a public health approach, rather than what has happened in some other jurisdictions where they have played politics with the global pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700061#QQQ00200","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588876800,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I join colleagues in expressing my condolences to the families of all of those who have lost loved ones as a result of Covid-19 since we last met in this House.  In particular, I join my colleague from the constituency of Louth, Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, in extending my sympathies to the families of those who have lost their lives in Dealgan House Nursing Home.  I would appreciate if the Minister shared with his colleagues in the Louth and Meath East D&aacute;il constituencies his views and the views he receives from the HSE when he makes inquiries about this matter.  That would be very useful.  I am happy to work with Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and others to try to resolve some of those issues in the public interest, in the interests of those who have lost loved ones and in the interest of transparency.<\/p> <p> That is the next issue I wish to raise with the Minister.  First, I ask the Minister to publish the letters written to him and his Department by the HSE chairman and chief executive on 19 and 21 April last.  We in the Labour Party and my party leader, Deputy Kelly, understand that these letters point to issues relating to testing, the testing regime and wider governance issues.  The Minister and Members will accept that, at present, this Parliament functions in a very restricted fashion.  It is virtually toothless.  Therefore, never has it been more important for Ministers and public officials to behave transparently and with absolute frankness and candour.  The Minister has to front up and respond to Deputy Kelly's demand that these letters be published openly and made available.  When does he intend to do that?<\/p> <p> When Vicky Phelan speaks we all should listen.  I listened intently to what she said on the \"News at One\" programme today.  She urged anybody with symptoms that might be associated with cancer and other serious conditions to access the health service, make contact with their general practitioner and so forth.  I add my voice to that call.  I am worried, and other Members have expressed their anxieties here this afternoon, that while some health services are running, others are in what might be described as sleep mode.  We have a roadmap to open hair salons and tattoo parlour services, for which I have little need, but no roadmap exists to reopen our health service.  We are in danger of the non-Covid-19 and possibly avoidable deaths surpassing Covid-19 deaths.  That should be a cause of great anxiety for everyone.<\/p> <p> What is the position with the roadmap for reopening our health service?  I want a roadmap to be made publicly available which will point out when full cancer services, critical care services across the sector, community services and others will be open.  That will be very important.  Will it be the Minister with responsibility for our health service who will ultimately make that decision with the HSE or will the decision be subcontracted out to NPHET?  Can the Minister elaborate on his role in this regard?  Is he in charge of making this decision or will it be subcontracted out to Dr. Holohan?  Who makes the final call - the Minister with the HSE or NPHET?<\/p> <p> I am troubled by the fact that we do not appear to have a publicly available roadmap for the reintroduction of full BreastCheck, cervical screening and bowel screening services.  When will they fully return?  Can the Minister let the House know the percentage of patients who were screened before the shutdown who have yet to receive their results from the screening programme?  This is going to be important.  As the Minister knows, every day matters when one is waiting for results from cancer screening.  HPV screening was supposed to commence shortly.  The Minister might tell the House when this critical system will be introduced and made available.<\/p> <p> I wish to follow up on some of the remarks made earlier by Deputy Feighan about dental services.  Like many colleagues in the House, I have been contacted by local dentists who are, by and large, private operators and who are very concerned about their situation at present.  They are also concerned, and they provided me with on-the-ground reports, that the type of emergency services the HSE said would be available are not, in fact, available in all cases.  I have had reports of cases in Drogheda and Dundalk where people have not been able to access those emergency services.  The main concern is that as those dental issues become more problematic, we could have people referred to hospitals instead of being cared for in the community by our professional dentists.  I will be interested to hear about the outcome of the Minister's meeting with the Irish Dental Association tomorrow.<\/p> <p> I wish to raise two further points in concluding.  One relates to face masks.  Why does the Minister appear to be flip-flopping on the idea of face coverings?  In Slovakia, a country of similar size to Ireland but with a very low number of Covid-19 deaths, people have been required to wear face coverings since the end of March.  There might be no causal relationship but I believe we must take the precautionary principle and ensure that people are safe.<\/p> <p>My view, based on evidence I have read that has been communicated in the public media, is that there is a very strong argument for very strong advice to emanate from the Government to encourage people, and potentially make it compulsory, to wear face coverings, particularly on public transport, in shops and so on.<\/p> <p> As raised by Deputy O'Reilly, the position of section 39 organisations is dire.  A perfect storm has emerged.  Bearing in mind the funding cuts by the Minister's Department in the context of the 2020 HSE service plan, will the Minister restore the funding to the organisations and revoke the 1% cut, which is in effect a &euro;20 million cut to the organisations?  As Deputy O'Reilly appealed for, will the Minister set up a Covid-19 fund to ensure the organisations, which are doing critical work in our community, are  properly resourced?<\/p> <p> Deputy Leddin mentioned the app, contact tracing and the interaction between the North and the South.  The Minister's position baffles me.  Why did he decide not to include non-residents in the travel restrictions he introduced a number of weeks ago?  There are major concerns in north Louth and other Border areas regarding this.  We are all working really hard to abide by and comply with the public health restrictions on travel but there is nothing preventing somebody from the North, a non-resident, coming down here and spending as much time as he or she likes here without any intervention whatsoever by the authorities.  I wrote to the Minister about this last Monday week.  It is a serious issue.  I have had reports of families from the North coming down south to north Louth to spend weekends with their families whereas there are grandparents in the Cooley area with grandchildren in Dublin whom they have not seen for weeks.  It is deeply unfair.  Will the Minister revise the position on this?  I would be interested in hearing what he has to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700062#RRR00200","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588877700,"counter":248,"content":"<p>There are many questions.   I have two minutes and seven seconds in which to respond so I will do my best.<\/p>  <p>  On Dealgan nursing home, I will certainly keep all the Deputies from the constituency of Louth informed.  We will work through it on a cross-party basis.  <\/p>  <p>  Yes, I want full transparency.  I have no difficulty with the letters being published.  To be very clear, however, I must state, because I believe it could make life easier for everybody, that NPHET contains the HSE, the Department of Health, HIQA and the HPRA.  It is chaired by the Chief Medical Officer but it is not just an organ of the Department of Health; it includes senior representatives from the HSE.  It brings everybody together and it makes recommendations.  It is right that it does.  What is an appropriate level of testing?  I would far rather NPHET was deciding than me.  In other jurisdictions, it becomes political.  Obviously, the decisions have to be operational.  It is perfectly appropriate for the HSE to ask how something can be made happen and what the timeframe is.  There is now an agreed plan and trajectory, and we are beginning to see the benefits of that.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy raised a very important issue concerning the roadmap for non-Covid-19 care and regular health services.  I share his view on it.  Let me very clear, however, about what the national roadmap states for the period from 18 May, phase 1, regarding the resumption of these services.  Who makes the decision?  Ultimately, the operation of the health service is for the HSE but it will require the input of NPHET.  As long as the virus is here, we cannot go back to the old way of providing the health service.  Trolleys are lethal.  We cannot have packed departments of outpatients waiting for appointments.  The use of personal protective equipment must also be borne in mind.  The input of NPHET will be required in determining how to offer a service safely.  The same applies to the turning on of the screening programme.  I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern about that but the decision on when it will be safe to proceed with the national cancer control programme will be made with the input of NPHET.<\/p>  <p>  On the question on screening results, I truthfully do not have the figures so I will come back to the Deputy.  I take the point made on dental services.  I am meeting those concerned tomorrow and will revert to the Deputy afterwards.<\/p>  <p>  On face covering, there is no flip-flopping.  It absolutely will be a part.  NPHET will work out how best to proceed, the appropriate scenarios and the guidance.  Inappropriate use could actually be dangerous.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to section 39 organisations, we have to be honest that the revocation of the 1% cut will not be achievable.  I take it that we are in a very different world now.  I will engage with the sector on that.  I will come back to the Deputy on the regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700064#TTT00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1588877700,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I want to start off with the subject of testing, on which we have never had a satisfactory answer.  We have been told we will get to a point, on 18 May, when it is hoped we will be able to test 15,000 people per day and carry out the associated tracing.  Last week, the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach were at pains to point out that this is about capacity to test rather than actually doing the tests.  Many people would be of the view that 15,000 is the minimum number of tests we should be carrying out per day in order to get on top of the virus in the community.  The likelihood is that there are thousands of cases in the community that have not been identified because the case definition has been so narrow.<\/p> <p>Why does the Minister make that distinction?  It makes me worried that he is not determined to get us to the point that we have been promised we would be at for a very long time.  I would appreciate clarification on that.<\/p> <p> Many issues arise about facts and figures.  It is disconcerting that the Government is not upfront about providing all of the necessary figures.  Three weeks ago, I made the point to the Minister that while the reports are on different age cohorts, for some reason all of the data for older people are for those 65 years plus, up to over 100.  I asked the Minister if he would arrange to have it broken down into ten-year phases but I did not hear back from him.  It took me a very long time to get answers on this and I finally got an answer by going through a circuitous route.  We know that 93% of deaths are in the 65 years plus category.  What I found out is that within that very large category, 14% of deaths were among those aged 65 to 74 years, 33%, a third, were among the 75 to 84 years age group and nearly half, 46%, of all deaths in this country are in the 85 years plus age group.  They are very revealing figures.  It would have been helpful if we had access to them all along because they point to what the strategy should be in terms of identifying people in those at-risk groups.<\/p> <p> Last night we also got the figures for the different disease categories in terms of underlying conditions among people who have died.  Again, that is very helpful.  Those figures should be available and they should be the basis on which the targeted response is designed.  We need more information on the daily testing rates and the daily tracing rates.  The Minister should provide those to people and they will have more confidence that there is a clear plan that is being worked to.<\/p> <p> Equally, in terms of the roadmap, we need to know what the criteria are for going from one phase to the next.  Instead of generalised criteria being suggested, we should know what the figures are and what level we need to get down to in terms of hospitalisation, ICU and deaths that would allow us to move on?  That brings me back to the point about timely testing and tracing.  We need to ensure that in the three week time lags between each phase, as set out, we allow sufficient time or that testing is done sufficiently quickly, and there is sufficient turnaround to have meaningful figures to determine whether it is safe or not to move on to the next phase.  It is critical that that happens.<\/p> <p> I also want to speak about direct provision, which others have mentioned.  Again, we need figures in that regard.  Last night the CMO said 88 people in direct provision had developed the virus.  Yesterday at the briefing, a figure of 150 was provided. Today, the Minister provided yet another figure, that is, 164.  It seems that the official figures being reported are strictly for direct provision centres.  However, there is a reception centre in Balseskin, the biggest such centre in the country.  Recent reports indicate that about 90 people there have been diagnosed and had to be moved out because such centres are highly unsuitable to start with, but they are particularly dangerous in the case of a virus.  Could we have clarity and data about direct provision plus the reception centre figures being provided?<\/p> <p> I reiterate a point made by other Members about the need to resume the screening programmes.  The Minister said he will be guided by the expert advice.  That is fine, but as part of that, the priority must be to provide follow-up screening for cancer patients who have already been diagnosed and treated.  Follow-up screening is absolutely essential for those patients and I ask the Minister to give priority to the issue.<\/p> <p> I welcome the fact that the Minister is going to meet dentists.<\/p> <p>There are serious problems for patients who have delayed their treatment, building up more serious problems, as well as problems for dentists who, unlike GPs, do not receive capitation fees.  The viability of whole dental practices is being called into question.<\/p> <p> I wish to add my voice to the question of disability groups.  About a third of disability services are provided by not-for-profit organisations.  A number of Members attended a briefing they held yesterday.  They depend hugely on fundraising, often charity shops and various events.  Their capacity to fundraise has been decimated.  Many will run deficits of about one third of their funding.  The sector will be severely hamstrung in its ability to provide decent services for the very many thousands of people who depend on them, including people with disabilities, adults and children, vulnerable people, people with intellectual disabilities and mental health issues, and all of that.  A Covid-19 fund must be established for that sector.  They will not have an opportunity to make up that huge gap in funding that has been created by that loss of fundraising.  Will the Minister consider meeting them?  This is going to be a huge problem and it needs to be addressed at an early stage.  The Disability Action Coalition is the umbrella group for those organisations.  I appeal to the Minister to do that.<\/p> <p> Will the Minister give the go-ahead for the flu vaccination to be made available free of charge?  Every year 4,000 people are hospitalised with flu, which is more than have been hospitalised with Covid.  We simply cannot afford to have another round of flu this winter when we are still trying to deal with the Covid issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700064#TTT00300","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588878600,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I agree that we need to avoid a bad flu season at the same time as Covid.  The Deputy will have seen my comments that I am engaging with Departments for a much more expansive immunisation programme around flu, removing barriers and so on.  It has also been though the HSE board.  I will return to her with an update shortly.<\/p>  <p>  I met Mental Health Reform today at the Deputy's request and invitation and I am more than happy to meet the Disability Action Coalition before we meet again next week.  I have started initial discussions with a number of organisations.  I know, for example, that Enable Ireland, which has been really good in helping to redeploy its staff, has a network of shops, all of which have been shut.  We are not blind to this difficulty - we can see it - but I am working my way through it with colleagues.<\/p>  <p>  I will return to the Deputy on the matter of dentists.  I will take on board her point on screening and the importance of the follow-up screening and will feed it into considerations.  I will make available to the Deputy and the House the figures I have on direct provision.<\/p>  <p>  On the roadmap, I have also asked whether it is possible to put out the necessary figures for ICU admissions, hospitalisation and cases before we can move from one phase to the next.  The Chief Medical Officer's general view so far is that there is no such simple formula, that it is about a trend over a sustained period.  The ICU figures have been falling nicely, but it is about the trend not the numbers alone.  I take the Deputy's point and we will continue to provide as much information as we can.<\/p>  <p>  I took the Deputy's request about the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC.  I note that the Secretary General wrote back to her on the breakdowns.  I agree that a category of 65 years plus is not enough.  There is a very big difference between someone aged 65 years and someone who is aged 103 years.  The Deputy's point is well made.<\/p>  <p>  On testing, the only reason I make the difference is because the people who do the testing tell me it is the difference, as do the GPs.  The capacity and the case definition will have to align.  When we get to 15,000, we will be testing more than many countries, and we already are.  I want to see the capacity used but I am not making a political commitment that I will not be able to deliver, that it will be 12,000 or 15,000 every day, because it will vary.

My thought immediately was that I do not think it is the norm also to have 80% of nursing homes in private hands.  That statement is a bit glib, to be quite honest, as is the whole plan and roadmap to come out of the lockdown as it relates to our senior citizens.<\/p> <p>Some 740 senior citizens have died.  That is a startling figure.  The figures given to us this morning show that 118 of them were hospitalised.  That is less than 16% but it is an increase on the previous figure we had.  Has new guidance been given to nursing homes on bringing patients to a hospital care centre?  I note the percentage of those dying with Covid-19 who are in residential care has increased from 58% to 62%.  That is a worrying figure and I would like the Minister to comment on it.  I am not reassured that the level of care in nursing homes and the guidance being given to them are adequate in every centre or case.<\/p> <p> My next question is on workplace clusters.  When I asked last week about Liffey Meats in Ballyjamesduff I was told that the Health Protection Surveillance Centre was to investigate.  There have been six workplace clusters in meat factories.  Yesterday, when I asked what was being done about this, the answer I was given at the HSE briefing was that the sector is important to society.  I want to highlight that so too are the workers in this sector.  What is being done to ensure these clusters do not develop into the type of disaster we are seeing unfold in the United States?<\/p> <p> I want to ask about the clusters in direct provision, specifically the cluster in Cahersiveen which has been well publicised on RT&Eacute;.  Cahersiveen residents are now in lockdown and have no contact with the outside world.  There are 26 cases in the centre, five of which are among staff.  What are we doing to intervene in that centre?<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister to comment on the issue of masking.  The National Bus and Rail Union has written to the Minister and all Members asking that we ensure that masking becomes the social norm when we open up public transport.  The idea of \"I protect you and you protect me\" has to be enforced in society.  However, we have to supply the masks which cost anything up to &euro;2.50 in pharmacies.  We cannot expect citizens to fork out that money when everyone is broke.  We need to supply millions of masks at public transport hubs.  What is the Minister's comment on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700066#VVV00500","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588879200,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I assure Deputy Smith that I am never glib when it comes to this pandemic.  I was making a particular point because there has been a great deal of commentary - sometimes it is made in this House and sometimes it is made elsewhere - on whether the nursing home sector was left behind.  I hear it and I want to respond to it because that is what we can do in here.  I am not sure whether the Deputy could point to many other countries where there has been a widespread testing programme of asymptomatic residents and staff, a temporary financial scheme using taxpayers' money for private businesses, redeployment of staff, a home care worker scheme and personal protective equipment being provided.  I am simply making that point.  I am proud that we have taken a policy decision to make these interventions in the interests of keeping residents safe.  That was the point I was making.<\/p>  <p>  I am not aware of any new guidance being issued but I will check that.  If I am wrong in that regard, I will write to the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asked for my view on nursing home cases.  My view is that this has been at the absolute frontline of our Covid-19 battle in recent weeks and months and it remains a major focus and priority for me.  As I said, we are now beginning to see the number of new cases in nursing homes decline.  There are now approximately 50 new cases so far each day whereas there were 100 new cases a day previously.  I believe that is as a result of the testing that has been done.  We can see the benefit of that testing.  We obviously need that to be recurring.  We need to go back and we need to have a regular programme of testing.  That is NPHET's plan.<\/p>  <p>  On meat plants, as the Deputy is aware, the Government decided to categorise the manufacture, production and processing of food and beverages as essential services under the regulations.  Food production systems in Ireland have continued to operate.  No food shortages have arisen.  Where essential work cannot be carried out other than in a workplace setting, such as in meat plants and food production and processing facilities, employers are required to have protocols in place for the protection of their employees in the context of the current public health crisis.  These protocols have been put in place.  Examples of action taken to protect employee safety vary from plant to plant but may include the reduction of throughput rates of plants; the extension of operating hours and other safeguards; checking of temperatures of people entering the plants; the provision of additional of personal protective equipment; the use of Perspex screens; and other additional facilities to support physical distancing measures.  I will send the Deputy my note on the issue so as not to take up Deputy Paul Murphy's time.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Smith asked about the issue of direct provision and Cahersiveen.  I had a meeting yesterday with the Minister for Justice and Equality, his Department officials, Department of Health officials and the HSE on direct provision.  A great deal of work is being undertaken to ensure that where someone has been identified as Covid-positive, that person is self-isolated.<\/p> <p>I am satisfied that is happening.  There is clear HPSC guidance on vulnerable group settings, including direct provision accommodation.  That must be followed.<br\/><br\/>Face covering will definitely play a role - of that there is no doubt - but what is a safe and appropriate role is to be determined by NPHET.

The details of the arrangement are contained in the heads of terms, which I laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 16 April.  Under the agreement, payment to the private hospitals will be on a cost-only, open-book model, whereby the hospitals will be reimbursed only for the operating costs properly incurred during the period.  The costs that will be covered will be limited to the normal costs of operating the hospital, which are set out in the heads of terms.  Therefore, where fees, rent or interest payments relate to the ongoing functioning of the hospital, they will be included in the cost.  However, in direct answer to the Deputy's question, any intra-company interest payments are excluded.  The rent and interest payments apply to pre-existing arrangements.  The amount will be validated, assessed and paid to the extent that it is a proper operating expense for the hospital in line with the heads of terms.  This applies regardless of who is the beneficiary.  Final costs will be verified by independent firms of accountants appointed by the HSE and the private hospitals.  There is an arbitration mechanism in place in the event of any disagreement.  Staff continue to be employees of the private hospital.

We have a Legislature which cannot legislate and a D&aacute;il that has little ability to scrutinise the decisions of the Government.  That struck me last week when the Taoiseach made his decision around the complex elements of the extended lockdown.  The Cabinet made the decision, the Taoiseach drove it past the D&aacute;il and presented his document on RT&Eacute; television.  We, in this Chamber, should have the ability to engage on all aspects of these important issues and we did not have that opportunity last week.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the new Covid-19 committee.

There is a mismatch between the capacity being used in this country and the size of the crisis.  I learned yesterday that 2% of the 2,000 people who have been trained to contact trace were doing so last Tuesday.  A total of 40 people, out of 2,000 who have been trained, were contact tracing last Tuesday.  That was not an outlier because only 70 people were contact tracing yesterday.  We have very low numbers conducting contact tracing compared to our capacity.<\/p>  <p>  Last week I learned that out of the 72,000 people who applied to answer Ireland's call to work on the front line of this crisis, only 51 people were in the employment of the HSE and doing that work.  Ireland's call was launched as an opportunity to harness the solidarity and good will of healthcare workers around the world to get to the front line and fight this.  It turned out, to be honest, to be a hollow PR husk.  Only 51 out of 72,000 applicants were working as of last week.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 1,400 empty hospital beds.  That is an incredible figure.  There has been widespread cancellation of procedures and appointments.  Serious hospital avoidance has been going on for the past number of weeks.  It is frustrating to see the mismatch between the available capacity and the actual capacity involved in fighting this crisis.  Nearly 2,000 people in the North and South of Ireland have lost their lives.  I urge the Minister to ensure that we equalise that mismatch.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the problem with testing.  We are 40,000 tests below the objective set by the Minister nearly two months ago.  The Minister and the HSE talk about capacity to test all the time and yet we are testing below capacity.  There is unused capacity and that is no help whatsoever to anybody in this State.  We should be sweating all the capacity we have to fight this crisis.  Why, given the massive cost to the State of the continuing lockdown, are we not sweating the capacity available in the system?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister and the Taoiseach have always stated that the decisions they make are on the basis of the best medical and scientific research and evidence.  I asked the HSE yesterday what research it has done into the outcome of the massive hospital avoidance and appointment and procedure cancellations.  I asked what is the modelling and forecasting for people's health with regard to what is happening.  The HSE has stated to me that there is no modelling or forecasting happening in the HSE at the moment as regards the future impact to health, morbidity and mortality in this country.  The Minister is making decisions on one important aspect of public health, namely, the development of this virus and the effect it is having on society, while not doing research on other aspects of public health.  I have heard other Deputies say that it is likely that the number of deaths from other illnesses could exceed the deaths from Covid-19.  That means the Minister is not making decisions on all of the facts and is neglecting the opportunity cost to the healthcare system.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister commit to proper scientific modelling on the human cost of the mass cancellations and hospital avoidances happening in the State?  Will he then develop a plan to allow us muster our resources, both human and financial, to be able to deal with the potential tidal wave of healthcare cases that will come down the road very shortly?<\/p> <p> In terms of my final question for the Minister, 819 people have lost their lives as a result of Covid-19 in nursing homes throughout this State since the start of the Covid crisis.  There is a long and tragic list of serious mistakes that have been made by the State in regard to those nursing homes, from the three-week delay to closing down the nursing homes to visitors, to the lack of the necessary staff and PPE, to the residents of the nursing homes and the workers within those nursing homes, to the massive delay in testing.  More than two months ago we were told we would have blanket testing of nursing homes.  That is just coming to completion as we speak.  I refer to the delay in promised funds for nursing homes.  More than two months ago we heard that millions of euro would be invested in nursing homes but only in the past ten days has that started to trickle into those nursing homes.  I refer also to the absence of the critical engagement of Nursing Homes Ireland, who are the people who know what is going on in nursing homes.  There has been a string of fatal mistakes which have had tragic effects in Ireland.  Will the Minister commit to a proper public investigation of that mismanagement simply for the purpose of making sure that this never happens again in our country?  Obviously, a public investigation cannot be held at this time because all resources have to be pointed towards the particular crisis we are in but when this crisis has subsided, please God, will the Minister commit to making sure that we have such a public investigation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700069#YYY00100","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588880700,"counter":272,"content":"<p>Certainly, when this pandemic ends there will need to be a review so that lessons can be learned right across Ireland's response because we would be stupid not to do that.  We need to make sure that we know what we did well and what we could have done better.  When one is operating in the middle of a pandemic, one is making decisions in real time and often decisions have to be made on the spot very quickly.  It is important that we learn in that regard.  I also believe an objective review would perhaps debunk some of the assertions Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n has made in regard to visitor restrictions and the impact that has had because NPHET has already done and produced charts in respect of the visitor restriction time and the time the virus became prevalent in nursing homes.  There does not seem to be a correlation between visitors and the prevalence of the virus but, yes, there should be a review.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to who speaks for nursing homes, Nursing Homes Ireland speaks for nursing home owners and does that very well.  It is a very good organisation.  In terms of who speaks to me in respect of nursing homes in the sector, it is the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, the regulator, set up by this House.  It has sat on the national public health emergency team since the very first meeting and is who I engage with very regularly.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy makes a fair point regarding secondary morbidity and secondary mortality.  He will see in the Government roadmap published that that is one of the criteria which we will report against in Cabinet every three weeks before deciding to move from one phase, or indeed not being able to move forward.  It is a very difficult challenge but, thank God, we are now in that position where we can ask how we can make sure that we keep non-Covid care going alongside dealing with this virus.  Had we not suppressed the virus we would not have the opportunity that we are now having to talk about turning back on other health services.<\/p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that, in regard to testing, this country compares very favourably with many countries.  It is not my data but the Our World in Data website ranks this country fourth highest out of 25 EU and UK countries in terms of testing completed as a percentage of the overall population, ahead of Estonia, Portugal, Italy, Latvia, Belgium, Austria, Germany, Spain, Slovenia, Finland, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, France, Romania, Poland-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700070#ZZZ00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1588880700,"counter":273,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1588880700,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I can use my time as I wish - Croatia, Hungary, Greece and Bulgaria.

No PPE was offered to them, yet they had to provide emergency cover.  All GPs are getting &euro;30 per Covid telephone consultation and a capitation fee for medical card holders.  The Minister said he is meeting with dentist representatives tomorrow and I will take it as read that these matters will be resolved.<\/p>  <p>  I fully agree with what has been said about masks and the importance of masking up.  I take the opportunity to thank a company called Irema in Limerick, whose details I have given to the Government and party leaders.  Today, this company is putting in eight new machines, which amounts to a quadrupling of its production capacity.  It is nice to see that the masks are being made in this country and we are not getting inferior PPE as we have had from other countries.  I thank the management and staff of Irema for investing in the country's health and keeping us to the forefront.  Well done to Irema.<\/p>  <p>  On a disappointing note, I contacted the Minister's office to inform him about a company in Limerick with a mobile testing unit which has offered its services.  I sent the same information to the HSE.  This mobile unit is self-contained and has fridges, power, computers and all the facilities that are needed for testing.  The company also supplies marquees so that testing personnel do not have to go into any premises.  The testing can be set up outside in a courtyard and people can come out to be tested, which means a building is not required to do the tests.  This was done last week in St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville, where the whole system was set up in the courtyard, and it was an absolute success.  As I said, the people doing the tests do not have to go into premises.  They can even cover buildings if they have to with the facilities they have.  The company has offered a 24-hour service with a three-hour turnaround and the unit can be brought to anywhere in the country.  The staff are willing to work through the night and this would help the testing situation.  Why are we not using these facilities that are being offered?

He said we need to look at the policy of helping older people to live at home for longer.  However, last year, the only new home help hours given were recycled hours which became available when a person died.  No new home help hours were provided.  This resulted in many people who were medically fit for discharge and were written up for a home care package remaining in acute hospitals for long periods or entering nursing homes prematurely.  Does the Minister now agree that this Government policy which denied home help to many qualified persons was wrong and forced many people into nursing homes and put them at risk?  Will this be looked at going forward?<\/p><p>The Irish Dental Association has pleaded for urgent assistance for patients who are unable to access either routine or emergency dental care.  Dentists across the country are dealing with a catastrophic collapse in their practices and may not be able to reopen their surgeries even after this crisis has passed.  They are, therefore, seeking the support of the Government to allow some temporary respite at this time of huge financial insecurity for the profession.  Is any action planned to safeguard the future of the dental profession?<\/p><p>My final question is one I raised on 13 March and which has reared its ugly head again and is very worrying for people.  I spoke on the last occasion about trawlers coming into Irish ports, specifically Castletownbere in west Cork, at that time.  I expect the Minister knows there was confirmation of an outbreak of coronavirus among the crew of a trawler just days after it landed its catch in Castletownbere.  The French flag-bearing and Spanish-owned fishing vessel which landed in Castletownbere 15 days ago has been quarantined in a Spanish port since Friday after more than half its 15-strong crew tested positive for coronavirus.  The 32 m <i>Notre Dame Cedeira<\/i>is tied up in its home port in the north west of Spain after eight of its crew were confirmed as having the deadly virus.  The vessel left its home port on 10 April to fish in Irish waters.  It was among a fleet of some 40 Spanish vessels that spent several days in mid-April fishing in an area of the ocean approximately 40 nautical miles south west of Mizen Head.  The vessel headed to Castletownbere to land its catch of mostly hake and monkfish and arrived on 21 April.  It spent three hours tied up before setting out to sea again.<\/p> <p>During that time the crew would have interacted with local agents, fork-lift drivers, truck drivers and fuel delivery workers.  People in the fishing towns are concerned that after all their efforts to suppress the virus they could now be at risk arising out of the contacts from this vessel and the many other vessels that tie-up in Castletownbere.  My question today is the same question I posed on 13 March.  What, if any, checks or procedures are in place, similar to those which I am sure are in place in respect of Irish boats entering other jurisdictions, to ease the minds and fears of those who reside in the towns and villages of these ports, including the residents of Castletownbere, Dingle, Killybegs and the many other ports around Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700071#AAAA00200","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588881900,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies O'Donoghue and Michael Collins for their questions.  As rightly stated by the Deputies, I will meet the Irish Dental Association tomorrow.  As the Deputies will know, the roadmap announced by the Government on Friday, 1 May, referred at a high level to wanting to increase the delivery of non-Covid care and services alongside Covid-19 care to meet demand.  There are a range of practicalities that now need to be addressed, some of which we have been discussing today in this House.  In light of the advice and opinions emanating from a number of stakeholders in regard to dental care and Covid-19, the expert advisory group to NPHET has been asked by my Department to consider whether advice can now be given which would assist in bringing clarity to these matters.  I think that would be welcome and helpful at this stage.  Dental services are currently confined under legislation to the delivery of emergency dental services.  This legislative provision is among the issues to be reviewed in light of the decisions recently announced by the Government.  We will get the expert advice through NPHET and I will meet the Irish Dental Association, following which I will report back to this House next week.<\/p><p>On the issue of face masks, I am pleased to hear of Irish companies making them.  Given that we are going to need PPE for the foreseeable future, it poses an opportunity and a question for us as to how Irish industry and businesses can be assisted in producing them.  I do not want to deviate too much from the role of my Department but I think we are seeking examples of this emerging across the country.  <\/p><p>On the mobile testing unit, I will ask my Department to look into the matter again.  I do know that all of these offers of assistance would be co-ordinated at a central point.  The website <i>gov.ie\/covidsupplies <\/i>takes these applications.  I will correspond directly with the Deputy in an effort to assist in the matter.<\/p><p>I thank Deputy Michael Collins for raising the issue of home care and home help which, in fairness to him, he consistently raises in this House.  He has done so in this D&aacute;il and in the last D&aacute;il and I know he feels very strongly on the issue.  I must point out that in the last budget we allocated 1 million additional home help hours but I accept there is need for a discussion on the model of care for older people in our country post this pandemic and also in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.  However, this is not just an issue of the number of hours of home help provided, although I accept that is an issue.  It is also about having a statutory home care scheme.  Every politician in this House has probably said since entering elected office, if not before, that they want people to be able to grow old with dignity in their own homes.  The only scheme we have ever legislated for in this Oireachtas is a scheme to support people going into a nursing home.  We do need a statutory home help scheme.  When we have a new Government, we should advance that as quickly as we can.<\/p><p>On the issue of dentists, I have already addressed that issue to Deputy O'Donoghue.  <\/p><p>On the issue of trawlers, I will discuss the matter with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, following which he or I will revert to the Deputy on the matter.  I do not know the specifics of the issue but I do know that for Covid-19 to be transmitted it requires people to be in close contact for a period of time.

I looked at all of the committee's minutes that have been made public.  I pay tribute to the committee for its work.  It met late at night and early in the morning.  Notwithstanding all of that work, there was a neglect of the residential centres, nursing homes, direct provision, special centres for people with disabilities and mental health services.  My question in regard to dentists has been answered.  However, I want to put on the record that almost two months after the declaration of a pandemic we have not made any provision in regard to dentists and the service they provide.  One sentence reads: \"I cannot overstate the sense of despair and panic in the dental profession or the anger at what is seen as complete neglect of the reasonable concerns of our profession by the Government.\"<\/p> <p>That is repeated <i>ad nauseam<\/i>.

Residential centres and clusters in nursing homes were mentioned but there was no sense of priority or of dealing with them.

It is a relatively small and neutral open trading country that relies on transit and its openness to the world.  Austria is now opening up in a way we can only dream of.  At the same time, Austria has a very extensive testing procedure in place at its airports.  People cannot pass the frontier unless they have a test that is less than four days old to say they do not have Covid-19 or they can undergo a test at the airport.  We have none of this.  Austria has an open border and workers regularly cross the border with Bavaria in Germany, and have done for decades, just as we have a border we want to keep open with Northern Ireland.  Austria has a sensible policy of maintaining exemptions for people who have to cross the border to work or see family members and for truckers carrying goods, as we could have.

I recognise that many people might want to focus on the issue of housing in particular because it is so important but I would like to speak, if I have the time, to issues that have happened around the planning area, local government, Irish Water, our fire and emergency services and Met &Eacute;ireann as well.  By way of background in respect of what has been happening in housing and homeless services, I had my first engagement with members of the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, DRHE, on 25 February, when they raised the issue of Covid-19 and what was then feared, that a crisis might come to the country, and the work they had been doing in preparation for such a potential crisis.  I refer to the work they had been doing themselves with the local authorities but also with the NGOs.  I had a further meeting in Grangegorman with the Taoiseach and with staff from the Department of Health, Safetynet and others.  We learned that as early as January, people in the health sector were working around what potential challenges we might face, should we experience the kind of crisis we have now experienced.  Because of their great efforts and foresight early on, a significant amount of work has been done to protect some of our most vulnerable citizens, those who are homeless, in emergency or sleeping rough, to keep them safe in the crisis we have been experiencing.  I really want to thank them for those efforts.  On 4 March, the HSE published its guidance on homeless and vulnerable people.  We provided that to local authorities and it was updated again on 14 March and on 16 April.  On 6 March, we communicated to the local authorities and NGOs the checklist of actions that had been drawn up by the National Public Health Emergency Team, actions that service providers needed to take to keep people safe in this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Through this work, we have seen some fantastic things being done by people working on the front lines.  To reflect on that briefly, I refer to two of the main actions that have been so important.  One is the dedicated health response that has been put in place for people who are in emergency accommodation.  Not every person who is in emergency accommodation is just having a crisis in terms of a home for themselves, a roof over their heads.  Some issues are more complicated but the health supports that have been put in place have been absolutely phenomenal.  That is just one action that really stands out and that must continue into the future.  The second action was moving very quickly to secure additional accommodation that became available when it did.  As a result of that, more than 1,000 new spaces were secured in Dublin, more than 400 outside of Dublin and there is more capacity above and beyond that.  For every person who needs to self-isolate on their own, we can provide that through the service providers.  We can also allow for social distancing.  We were able to decongregate our five largest family hubs because of these new apartments, in many instances, that we were able to secure.  We were able to decongregate the five largest adult individual hostels as well because of the additional accommodation that was secured.  The NGOs have been working together, as they always do, in a co-operative fashion.  One NGO in particular has taken the lead in terms of looking after people who may have the virus or have been confirmed with it.  As a result of that pooling together of resources, other community settings have been allowed to remain safe in this crisis.  They have even trained up their own health staff to be able to take tests, while there is now a dedicated and targeted programme under way for people in emergency accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  My latest round of engagement with the main NGOs and the DRHE was yesterday, just to get an update on what further actions may be required over the coming weeks.  As we move through the phasing plan that we have, in the region of an additional &euro;20 million has been spent in this crisis period for the different supports that have been put in place.  On Travellers and members of the Travelling community, the Minister of State, Deputy English, has led in this regard.  On 18 March, communication was made with all local authorities detailing actions that had to be taken and the funding that would be available for people who are in the Travelling community.  An additional &euro;1.2 million in funding was approved for 16 programmes across 15 local authority areas.  This has allowed for an improvement in services, opening up new bays and providing new homes for people to self-isolate or socially distance where that is necessary.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, continues to have regular engagement with the local authorities and will engage again with the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee, if not later this week, then next week.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, more than 2,700 new homes have been secured through the housing assistance payment since 2 March.  More than 400 of those homes went to families who were homeless, which is an incredible amount of work despite the crisis that we have.<\/p> <p>The number of people in emergency accommodation is slightly down, which is to be welcomed.  Although we did not want it to happen, following health advice construction had to stop and sites closed.  However, working with the Housing Agency, we identified 39 sites, on which roughly 1,000 homes for social housing were being built, that were able to reopen because the developments were almost complete.  These will be new homes for people who are either in emergency accommodation or coming off the housing list.  This very important work is being done and I am glad it has been able to progress, despite most sites having to close.<\/p> <p> On housing generally, today's figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, are very welcome.  Almost 5,000 new homes were built in the first quarter of this year, although that was before we had to close down construction sites.  We have been engaging for some time with the Irish Home Builders Association, IHBA.  I had a conference call meeting with the IHBA some time ago.  It was preparing work on how we could open up housebuilding sites in a responsible way and safely for the people working on them.  That became part of a larger piece of work on construction more generally.  Using that framework and guidance, we hope that, from 18 May, we will be able to open up construction sites in a safe way because it is crucial that we begin to build new homes.<\/p> <p> In the rental sector we had to move quickly to freeze rents for three months and to freeze notices to quit.  This decision came in to force on 27 March following legislation we passed in this House.  These two freezes expire on 27 June but they can be extended by ministerial order if necessary.  Rents, like house prices, were falling before this crisis began.  It is not yet clear what will happen when we come out of the emergency period.  We will keep a very close eye on that in the coming weeks to make sure the right decision is made ahead of 27 June.<\/p> <p> The Residential Tenancies Board continues to handle disputes.  It has introduced new ways of doing this and we had very good engagement with the board on how it would do that.<\/p> <p> Rent supplement is in place alongside the Covid-19 pandemic payment to help people who face difficulties paying rent.  There are huge numbers of people who have difficulties paying rent.  I have asked the ESRI to do a report on rent arrears to try to figure out over this period what kind of situation is building up for individuals who might be falling into rent arrears and how it might impact on them and on their landlords.  That work by the ESRI will guide further decisions that may need to be made in this area.<\/p> <p> We hope that estate agents will be able to open up their operations from 9 June and work is being done on that area.<\/p> <p> On mortgages, the banks have made their decisions and the Government made its decision on the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, which I communicated in March.  The latter applied for a three-month period which can be extended if necessary.  It is important to note that Rebuilding Ireland home loan borrowers are not being charged interest over that period and there is no additional cost to those borrowers.  Applications are still being processed for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan and a significant amount of money is still available.  I believe more than &euro;500 million is still available for low-cost mortgages for people who need them.  We encourage people to continue to apply for those mortgages.<\/p> <p> It is essential to keep the planning process open.  Having planning applications processed and approved and having people getting on site for building, not just for housing but across the board, will be an integral part of the recovery.  To protect the integrity of decision making I had to make a decision to extend by six weeks the public participation process in planning.  I will take a third order to the Cabinet tomorrow to extend that process again until 23 May.  From that point on, the system will be back to as it was, but with some improvements as we are trying to expedite the roll-out of e-planning to make things much easier for people engaged in the planning process.  Building projects with planning permission for 40,000 homes have not yet gone on site.  Hopefully they can get on site when the phasing begins on 18 May.  The planning authorities received 2,000 planning applications in April.  People are, therefore, still active in this area and it is important that activity continues given the role it will play in the recovery.<\/p> <p> The local authorities have often been the front line in the community response to crises, especially in the type of crisis we face now.  We have seen this in the many severe weather events we had previously and we see it again now in the community call and community fora that have been established.  Huge work is being done in this regard.  Between 31 March and 4 May, the 31 local authority community fora received more than 29,000 calls.  The national helpline set up by ALONE has received more than 17,000 calls since the beginning of March.  These community bodies are very important in protecting and looking after people in their communities during this crisis.  Their response has been fantastic and I thank them.<\/p> <p> I will address funding in the few seconds I have left. <\/p> <p>We have parked rates for businesses, a decision we made in March.  That is very important because small businesses up and down every road, village and city had to close.  We have since made the decision, announced last Saturday, that for a three-month period from 29 March, rates for businesses that had to close will be waived.  Some &euro;260 million has been secured for local authorities to fund that gap, so they will not be without that rates money for that period.  Pubs, which closed a little earlier, and some childcare facilities will not be pursued for rates, and we now also have the restart fund being led by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, which will act as either a rates waiver or a rates rebate into the future.  If, for example, a business decided to go for the waiver option, that is 15 months of no rates bills that it will face.  I know that rates for some businesses are only a small part of the costs of doing business but it is an important way we can help them get back on their feet and adapt to the new reality.<\/p> <p> Some &euro;500 million in funding has so far been secured for local authorities to help them fill that gap for businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700075#JJJJ00300","speaker":"1554","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588884900,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with my colleagues, Deputies James Browne, Niall Collins and &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for his update.  I welcome the move with regard to commercial rates.  It is crucial, and while we may have to do more in that regard, it gives a degree of certainty.  They are not insignificant sums.<\/p>  <p>  On mortgages, the Minister mentioned what the Department has done with regard to the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.  It is right and welcome that we are not charging interest for the mortgage holiday period of three months, although it is likely we may have to extend that to six months.  I say to the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues, particularly the Minister for Finance, that there remain a few large issues with our own banks and the mortgage holiday or mortgage break that already exists.  One issue is the charging of interest, which is quite substantial for that period, while the non-bank lenders have not been dealt with as they should.  Pepper and others will only give notification of acceptance of a mortgage break over the phone; nothing is given in writing.  Some of the lenders, therefore, are not playing ball.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Minister in respect of one issue relating to homelessness, that is, some of the interagency work that has been done between the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the HSE, as well as section 39 organisations and people who have been reassigned from drugs task forces and other task forces across the country.  I know that in Fingal incredible work has been done.  When the crisis started, the homeless community was one of the groups of people most at risk from the potential spread of Covid-19.  The response has been a success because of the unbelievable work done at some of the cocooning facilities that are now in place.  I refer to the work done by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, Dublin City Council and other local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  We should never return to dormitory-style emergency accommodation.  The issue was debated in the general election, which was a long time ago now, but the wraparound services that our homeless community is receiving now because the HSE, section 39 organisations and the Department are working together means that the type of recovery, particularly for people with chaotic lifestyles and addiction, has been incredible, despite the country being in one of the worst crises we have ever witnessed.  There have, ironically, been some health benefits for many such people because of the way in which they are being looked after, and we need to take that from this crisis.  Is there any further planning to bed in these types of arrangements into the future?  Obviously, what we want is the 9,700-odd people who are homeless to secure permanent accommodation but in the short term, at least they have emergency accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned that 2,700 homes have been secured through HAP.  Were many homes purchased for homeless families by local authorities in that period?  That is another discussion which we will get to.<\/p>  <p>  On own-room accommodation for the homeless, what additional funding has been given since the start of the crisis towards homelessness services?<\/p>  <p>  On the recovery that will come down the track, the Minister mentioned that 5,000 homes were completed in the first quarter.  According to some of the projections I have seen, and as I have heard from talking to stakeholders, we could be looking at as few as 18,000 homes having been built by the end of this year, depending on how the pandemic develops.  We will still, therefore, have a major supply issue for both public and private housing.  Has there been any contact at EU level to revise and change fiscal rules to ensure that each state will have the capacity to invest directly in housing as part of a stimulus package?<\/p> <p>The EU needs to look at this because the State's recovery, particularly in housing, where this sector was already under pressure, is being exacerbated by the Covid-19 crisis.

They came down very quickly in the crisis and that is why the work has been so successful.  It is a model that must continue into the future.  I know the Deputy is planning on visiting the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  I welcome that and the Deputy will have a good engagement there.  The big message coming back from the NGOs on not returning to dormitory-style accommodation is that the outcomes for people in these new types of accommodation are so much better.  It is more stable, people are coming into programmes and they are happier and healthier.  It is the way forward so a piece of work is being done around that at the moment and in relation to cost.  We still have additional accommodation if we need it in case there is a surge or a second wave in society more generally or in case we find a cluster in one of our areas of accommodation so that we can then reaccommodate people.  That will be possible.<\/p>  <p>  On the funding, I am informed that &euro;20 million of additional crisis funding was made available to do all of the things we have had to do.<\/p>  <p>  On money to be borrowed, an agreement was reached between the Housing Finance Agency and the European Investment Bank for an additional &euro;200 million in December.

I will try to keep my contribution to two questions.  We had a housing crisis before Covid-19 came along.  That housing crisis is still there and it will be there after the Covid-19 crisis.  What steps will the Minister be taking to ensure that housing is prioritised when the lockdown is being wound down and, more importantly, how will social, affordable and private housing be prioritised in the recovery phase?<\/p>  <p>  In any unwinding of the lockdown that involves the housing sector, what steps will be put in place to ensure that as construction workers are going back to work, they are protected and that the proper safety measures will be put in place?  Who will be in charge of ensuring those safety measures are put in place?  Will it be the Health and Safety Authority?  Will it be the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI?<\/p>  <p>  A number of supermarkets and petrol stations are effectively turning themselves into garden centres and hardware stores.  I am not knocking their ingenuity in that respect, but it is somewhat galling for some garden centres and hardware stores to understand how it is okay to purchase large amounts of garden centre goods inside of a supermarket but garden centres that are wide open and perhaps safe to go into are not allowed to reopen.  Gardening is very good for people's mental health.  Any reopening has to be in accordance with health and safety measures, but there is an issue there and I wonder if the Minister could address that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700078#MMMM00600","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1588885500,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I want to pass four remarks to the Minister that he might respond to either now or in time.  I echo what previous speakers have said about small builders, contractors and subcontractors in particular throughout the country and the people who require their services.  It is imperative that they get back to work.  We know they are not working.  Some of them are doing essential work with the HSE in the local authorities but many of them in Limerick have been on to me and they are so anxious to get back to work.  It is really important that they get back to work as soon as possible or indeed earlier than has been stated on the roadmap.<\/p>  <p>  Has the Minister considered reviewing the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2013?  These provide regulations for stairwells, common areas, halls, lift areas and communal rooms in high-density, high-rise buildings.<\/p>  <p>Given the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic and the possibility of future pandemics, do we need to consider providing for more of these common areas in the high density residential building standards?<\/p> <p> It is a massive challenge for everybody, including the local authorities, to try to build more housing more speedily and to deliver units to the thousands of people on the waiting lists.  In that regard, has the Minister seriously considered a standardised design for housing from the Department and across the local authorities, or a suite of standardised designs based on the site size and the potential number of units?  Part of the problem, as was pointed out to me and we see it when we are trying to help projects get over the line, is that the architectural work has to be outsourced and there is a tendering requirement.  It slows down the process and adds greatly to its cost.  When there was huge housing demand in this country previously, when the Lemass and other Governments had to build housing, there was a model of standardised design and it helped deliver housing more quickly.  We should consider that.<\/p> <p> I wish to make the Minister aware of a new departure or innovation in Limerick City and County Council.  Great credit is due to the housing development officer for introducing a new process for streamlining the return of void and vacant properties into use.  The key is that she has done so in full compliance with both procurement and standard guidelines and regulations, so much so that in a period of 12 weeks 60 voids have been returned to use and are ready to receive tenants.  That is probably a world record in terms of how local authorities have been operating over the years in this country.  The poor return of voids and vacant properties is a sad indictment of local authorities.  The new model in Limerick should be examined.  Great credit is due to the staff for this innovation.  It should be considered by the Department and other local authorities in the country for getting the voids back into use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700078#MMMM00700","speaker":"1493","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588886100,"counter":311,"content":"<p>Do the Deputies have further brief supplementary questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700079#NNNN00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1588886100,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I might need the time to reply to the questions from the Deputies.  As we come out of the lockdown period we can look through the five phases and the important dates where housing is concerned.  The first is 18 May when we hope to see the construction sites opening again.  The Deputy is correct that it must happen in a safe way.  The new standard for the operation of house building sites has been a work in progress for a number of weeks.  It is being led from the Department of the Taoiseach since it became part of the larger construction process.  Initially it was going to just be house building sites but there is a bigger thing planned.  I am sure the Health and Safety Authority has been involved in that, as have others, because it is very important that workers feel safe going back to work to do the type of work we need them to do.<\/p>  <p>  We hope that in the phasing period from 9 June we can look at estate agents and letting agents being back to work more fully.  In terms of social housing, we were able to get back on site under the emergency measures.  I made the argument that this was emergency work.  These are houses that were almost complete.  It is approximately 1,000 homes that with a few weeks work would be able to take people out of overcrowded homes, off the housing list and out of emergency accommodation.  Those houses are being completed as we speak.<\/p>  <p>  The rent freeze and the notice to quit freeze will end on 27 June.  A decision has to be made in advance of that on whether they are to be extended.  The Deputy referred to garden centres.  We want allotments to be back open as well on 18 May.  Important work is happening in that regard so people can go outdoors to look after the vegetable patch and everything else they do in their allotments.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Niall Collins spoke about local authority building and standard designs.

The idea is to have it off the shelf.  A new housing delivery office is being established in the County and City Management Association, CCMA, which will manage that for local authorities.

With regard to rural one-off houses, will the Department reverse its view on social housing - local authority houses - on sites that people have available for family members and in respect of which the Department has been disapproving for so long, particularly in view of the fact that it is quite recognisable that people are less vulnerable to disease in more dispersed communities?<\/p>  <p>  Second, how are we going to make up lost time in progressing planning and so on for the rest of the local authority houses that are needed urgently?  In other words, what is the Minister&rsquo;s expectation for the output of promised social housing for 2020 by comparison with his expectation at the beginning of the year?<\/p>  <p>  Third, has the Minister had any discussions with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection on reinstituting the mortgage interest scheme that used to be run by the Department whereby, if a person could not pay mortgage interest because of unemployment, it was paid for him or her for the period of unemployment.  To be quite honest, I am fed up with relying on banks' goodwill.  I do not believe in it.  In 2014, the Government abolished mortgage interest supplement.

I will then take a further minute, and then my colleague Deputy Guirke will take his four minutes.  I will proceed straight to the questions.<\/p>  <p>  Many renters and landlords were hoping the Minister would have announced the extension of the ban on evictions, notices to quit and rent increases.  I appreciate these are important decisions, but given the 100-day exit plan the Government has announced and the fact that many affected people in the private rental sector will not be able to return to work until the end of the period, will the Minister at least tell us when he is going to make the decision so people will know when to expect the news?<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister commissioned ESRI research on the rent arrears debt burden.  He should be under no doubt that it is going to be significant.  Will he commit to publishing the report and engaging with sectors and Opposition Deputies, if he is still in office, on possible solutions to deal with that?  Many of us have constructive suggestions.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to construction, we are all very concerned about the impact on the social housing output targets for 2020 in terms of both the break in construction and the slow rate of construction, obviously because of the important public health and safety measures.  Will the Minister tell us whether he is considering ways to try to meet the targets other than through construction?  For example, will he reconsider the limitation on the acquisition of new properties by local authorities to try to fill what will inevitably be a gap in the output?  Will he also consider whether some private sector sites that may no longer become viable because of the loss of future sales might be acquired as turnkeys at existing use value by the Department and the local authority to meet the shortfall?<\/p>  <p>  On homelessness, I acknowledge the very substantial work of the Minister&rsquo;s departmental officials, Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, the local authorities and the homelessness services on the ground, but there are people falling between the cracks.  There is a particular problem in local authorities where new presentations are either not being taken or are being delayed.  Small numbers of people are being forced to sleep rough, in some cases for a week or two.  That is a real problem.  I have raised it with the DRHE and the Minister's own staff, but it still has not been fully resolved.  It needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  I am also concerned about the additional pressure on some of Dublin&rsquo;s day services that have remained open because of the closure of others.  A small amount of additional funding needs to be provided to those day services that are still open to ensure they are meeting the needs of those availing of them.  Some of the facilities at some of the new private sector accommodation centres do not meet the standards the Minister outlined today.  I would like him to review that.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to local government, I welcome the &euro;260 million.  That is very important.  Will the Minister commit to providing further funding if needed?  Will he speak to the very significant drop in funding from non-rates-related revenue sources, such as car parking rents and other charges, because it represents a very big loss of income to many local authorities and they are already talking to their members about cutting services if that gap is not filled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700080#OOOO00500","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1588887300,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for those questions.  I will work back through them.  Regarding rates and the waiver of same, further funding will be required because some businesses will not be able to reopen after the three-month period because of the plans we have put in place, so they will continue to be able to avail of the waiver.  In advance of that, an additional amount of money will have to be secured for local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that revenue streams from other sources are down, but by committing to 100% of their rates payments local authorities are getting more than they would have had they gone to collect the rates themselves, because they never collect 100% of their rates.  Some local authorities, unfortunately, are very bad at collecting rates.  We are overcompensating them and that should help fill any gap that might arise.  If a local authority is telling Members who are in the Chamber that they do not have the funding for a service, could they please let me know directly because I want to know what it is and how much it is because that should not arise?  We have done very detailed work in the Department, which has very detailed information as to how much revenue comes in in rates, car parking charges and everything else and how it has been affected in this crisis.  I ask Deputies for their assistance in that regard if they encounter that kind of excuse from a local authority.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the private facilities, if Deputy &Oacute; Broin has the name of those facilities I would like to look into the matter myself.  At the moment we are trying to compile proper intelligence on how many units of accommodation we need and how many homes we need for temporary accommodation rather than for permanent homes, in terms of the new standards or the new norm that has been established in the current pandemic crisis.<\/p>  <p>  If money is needed to address day service pressures, that is not an obstacle.  I made such a commitment to NGOs when I spoke to them during one of our engagements three or four weeks ago.  We talk about the amount of money that is being spent but the outcome we get in terms of keeping people safe and healthy in this crisis is worth the money, which really pales in comparison with some of the bigger ticket items that we have to pay for, and we can make that money available from within my Department.<\/p>  <p>  We are looking at the private sector sites as turnkeys.  In one way it is to make sure that we meet our social housing targets if there is going to be a difficulty there, but also in another way it is to help people get back on site and building and to give some sort of security for the builders.  That is being looked at.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding acquisitions and doing more, very shortly we will publish the 2019 social housing delivery figures.  We will give all of the breakdowns.  We have not yet done the targets for 2020.  The local authorities know their targets for 2020 and 2021, but because of what has been happening with Covid-19 we have not been able to give a detailed breakdown to each local authority.  We will do that, and as we do it we will figure out what we might need in terms of more acquisitions depending on what is happening on social housing sites.  I reiterate that almost 1,000 social housing homes are currently being finished across almost 40 sites around the country.<\/p>  <p>  We have published every previous piece of research the Department has carried out with the ESRI, so I do not foresee that we would not publish this one.  I think Deputy &Oacute; Broin said I might not be in office, so it may not be my call, but I will try to convince whoever is Minister, if I am not, to publish the report because we have published the previous reports.<\/p>  <p>  On extending the ban beyond 27 June, that is still six or seven weeks away.  We want to make sure that we make the right call and we will do it based on what is happening with the emergency and whether we are moving forward through the phases as we hope we will &ndash; it is to be hoped there will be no regression -and what else might be happening in the wider sector.  We will need some evidence before we make that decision.  I did make comments recently to the effect that I foresaw it being extended, but I need to get more information before I can make such a recommendation to the Cabinet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700081#PPPP00100","speaker":"1554"},{"type":"speech","time":1588887300,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his answers to which I will respond.  He missed two questions, one of which is really important.  We have a situation in Dublin where single men in particular are seeking to present as homeless.  They are not able to access assessments in a timely manner and they are not able to access emergency accommodation and, therefore, they are being forced to sleep rough for periods of time.  Some of these people may not have presented to homeless services before.  Some of them may have come from other local authorities but the reality is they are now here in Dublin, and therefore sending them back to a local authority would be in breach of the HSE's own public safety advice.  I urge the Minister to sit down with his officials and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive to resolve the problem.  We are not talking about large numbers but I am concerned at the very fact that people are being denied access to emergency accommodation where there is an extra volume of it.  Staff in the Department and in the Dublin Region Homeless Executive have the names and dates of birth of the individuals concerned because I forwarded the information to them.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to the research by the ESRI, the second part of the question was, if the Minister is still in office, and he may well be, whether he will commit to engaging with the sectors and with Opposition politicians on the way to dealing with this issue?  I have a real fear that we are going to see a very significant rent arrears debt burden.  We can see from the ESRI data already that young people and people in those sectors of the economy that have a tendency to be renters are disproportionately affected by the loss of employment.  Rent supplement is available.<\/p> <p>However, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection is not doing enough to promote that payment.  There have been 3,000 extra claimants in the last four or five weeks.  That surprises me as I thought it would have been larger.  I suspect we will have a real burden and that is not only bad for the individual renters but also the landlords and the rental sector.  We do not want a situation where when the restrictions are lifted on notices to quit and evictions that we have a significant increase in landlords seeking to exit because they have lost money and in tenants being issued with notices to quit.  Some rent arrears debt-burden resolution process will need to be put in place.  Again, some of us have done some work on this.<\/p> <p> The Minister will have about a minute to reply before my colleague comes in for his four minutes.  I am really concerned about local authorities.  Yesterday, Cork managers told their elected members that they already have a &euro;9 million shortfall from non-commercial rates.  I am encouraged by some of what the Minister says but I suspect there will be some difficulties there.  Will the Minister commit, in as far as he can make it, that no local authority will be left with less money this year than they would have had otherwise, so there are no losses to staff or vital frontline services?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700081#PPPP00200","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588887900,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I might also ask the Deputy to give a commitment to me that if I am in opposition and he is in government that he will engage with the Opposition on the ESRI report on rent arrears.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700082#QQQQ00200","speaker":"1554"},{"type":"speech","time":1588887900,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I give him that commitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700082#QQQQ00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1588887900,"counter":325,"content":"<p>The Deputy is very kind.

It is in both sides' interests that we can manage this problem when it arises, we just need to know the scale and see how best it can be done.  Some of those who were laid off first in the crisis will not be able to recover any rent arrears that they will have built up over the period and we do not want to push a problem of a notice to quit, or something else, further down the line, as that will not help them get on their feet.<\/p><p>On new people presenting and not being able to access emergency accommodation, there is an issue around some local authorities trying to use the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive as the solution for services which they have the funding and the people to deliver.

I thank all the staff in the Houses of the Oireachtas who have been so nice and helpful to us since we came in here.<\/p>  <p>  Housing was the biggest issue before and during the general election and it will remain a huge issue after Covid-19.  In Meath West we see the full range of issues relating to housing.  There are thousands of individuals and families on social housing waiting lists and there has been little or no progress.  At the current rate, it would take the council 50 years to clear the list.  Waiting lists for one-bedroom properties are well in excess of ten years.  There is a huge shortage of houses to rent or to buy.  Rental properties are either unavailable or unaffordable.  Rents increased by 15% last year in County Meath and by 10% in Westmeath before the Minister agreed to a rent freeze.  Meath and Westmeath have been chronically underfunded by the Minister's Department and by central Government generally.  Meath is the worst funded county in Ireland by head of population, it is &euro;72 million below the national average annually.  Local councils are suffering greatly as a result of Covid-19, with their incomes, rates and grants severely impacted.  I would like the Minister and the Government to ensure that vital services provided by the local authorities, including road maintenance and repair, environmental services and house building programmes, do not suffer.<\/p>  <p>  Our major urban centres such as Johnstown, Navan, Enfield and Trim, still suffer as a result of bad Celtic tiger planning.  Whole communities, tens of thousands of people, are denied basic facilities, parks, playgrounds and community centres.  These communities should not be left at the bottom of the pile.  Thousands remain homeless even during the Covid-19 pandemic, with 9,907 people in March.  In my first D&aacute;il speech, I send each one of those homeless people my best wishes.  I thank the people who volunteer to help them, such as the people in the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Athboy People who Share Care Group and other charities.<\/p> <p> I want to conclude with two specific questions.  Public housing developments are happening across Meath and Westmeath.  Will the Minister guarantee they will be completed?  There are also Part V properties due from private developments.  What is the Minister doing to ensure these will be still delivered?  Will the Minister outline what instruction he has given councils on Rebuilding Ireland home loans, especially as regards applicants in receipt of Covid-19 unemployment payments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700082#QQQQ00600","speaker":"1506","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588888500,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I congratulate Deputy Guirke on his maiden speech.  Time was when a Deputy might go for a few pints after a maiden speech, but unfortunately it will not happen, not today.  Hopefully in the future the Deputy will get that opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  The social housing waiting lists have been falling.  They have fallen to below 70,000 from above 90,000 over the course of Rebuilding Ireland.  However, we have farther to go.  The rental situation will change after we come out of this emergency.  This is because of the amount of new accommodation that has come onto the market - that will stay - and because of other things that are happening in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about planning.  Planning is the reason it is taking a little longer to build houses these days.  We cannot afford to build houses without building all the other community facilities that have to be put in place as well.  We do not want to strand people in homes without communities.  That is why we have to get the planning right.  That is why it sometimes takes a little longer.  Anyway, my commitment is to social housing.  That is why people are on sites today in Meath.  The sites in Meath are among almost 40 sites that have been sanctioned through the Housing Agency for workers to get back on site to finish those homes.  All our Part V commitments are in place, unless the Deputy has heard otherwise.  That is one stream.  It is an important part of the social housing delivery stream.  It is not everything though.  Obviously, there are housing bodies and local authorities as well.<\/p>  <p>  We have put in place a three-month break for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.  No interest is being charged during that period so it will not cost people any more to avail of the break.

Not all home activity is on site at the moment.  At the end of the year some 6,500 houses were active on sites throughout the country.  We have approximately 1,000 now under construction.  These opened up just a couple of weeks ago and are near completion.  That is only a proportion.  We opted for those sites that, through a little work, could get completed and those we could get tenanted quickly.  We hope from 18 May to be able to get the other sites back up-and-running as long as we can do so in a safe way.<\/p>  <p>  Acquisitions are still proceeding.  That is an important part of the programme.  In many parts of the country the local authority might be able to buy a house for social housing that might not otherwise have been bought.  It might have been derelict or unoccupied.  It is one of the ways in which we try to use every stream available to increase the basic stock of social housing in this time of crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The majority of social housing we have comes from new builds.  Let us consider the breakdown of who is providing new builds.  Local authorities do more than housing bodies, although they do a good deal as well and that is important to note.  They do far more than the housing coming in under Part V.<\/p>  <p>  House prices were falling.  There was double digit growth when I took over as Minister.  Prices were then falling towards the end of last year, dramatically enough in some parts of Dublin where they had been rather high.  It is not yet clear what the impact will be on the housing market.  We are seeing different things at the moment.  One thing that might impact on the market is the extent to which we think we can get sites open.  This may enable us to continue on the positive track we are on in terms of the increased delivery we are seeing every quarter of every year.  There are big jumps in the number of new homes being built from what was a low base only a short number of years ago.

They seem to have a bottom line, which does not take into consideration the Covid-19 crisis, and for the commercial tenants I know, that could have a huge impact.  We have seen the big story of Bewley's having to close its doors this week for that reason.  I am absolutely certain this is happening across the country to smaller businesses.

Commercial leases, as the Deputy will know, come under the remit of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  I have discussed this matter with her and I know she is paying close attention to it.  We are trying to do everything we can on the Government side to help small businesses on our main streets survive through this emergency period and get back open and back up on their feet.  The rates waiver I mentioned and the restart fund, which I know the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, will have an opportunity to address next week, are a part of that.  Rents, however, are also a big part of it, and it is very disappointing to see some businesses we know very well having to close because they have not been able to come to such agreements with their landlords.  This is a time when people are meant to be pulling together.  Obviously, a successful landlord needs good tenants.  It is the same in the residential sector as it is in the commercial sector.  It should be possible to reach agreements.  We are doing everything we can with different funding streams for small businesses.  The rates part falls under my Department's remit.

When I first got involved in the local authority in Roscommon, permission for one-off housing on the bad land in the area was much easier to obtain.  In my constituency, which now includes northern Roscommon, Leitrim, Sligo and southern Donegal, there is an issue with one-off housing.  We have been to Brussels to try to get it resolved.  My colleague on the council, Councillor Se&aacute;n McDermott in north Leitrim, has been to the fore on this matter.  The EPA completed a public consultation and considered submissions.  Is there any update on the code of practice on one-off wastewater treatment systems?  If we want to stabilise the populations of our rural communities, especially given what is happening with Covid-19 now with many people working from home, and if we really want to help these rural communities, we must come up with some sensible solution.  We do not want a solution that undermines the groundwaters, but this has gone on for far too long.  I suspect that the Department or others have been dragging their heels by coming out with all these public consultations.  Now is the time to make a decision.  The solutions are out there.  The cost of many of them is exorbitant, however, and may be up to &euro;50,000.

The broadband plan that we brought forward was very much a part of that, intending to connect every part of the country so that every child could have the same opportunities regardless of where he or she lived.  I think that, during the Covid-19 emergency, people are reflecting on some of the choices that they have made.

Under this Government, 10,000 people are homeless even though we are the fifth wealthiest nation in the world <i>per capita<\/i>.  I truly hope those people are in the Minister's sights in the Covid-19 recovery and that the State ceases to be party to the provision of private developer-led housing on public land, at least until we have secured housing for those who are homeless, those living with their parents, those locked out of the market and others living in cars.<\/p><p>We truly have an opportunity to reboot a broken economic system which is profit-driven to create one which is circular, providing sustainable employment in the construction, energy, agriculture and transport sectors and which is centred on the well-being of people and the environment that sustains them.<\/p><p>I have a series of questions that address student accommodation, rent freezes, evictions and direct provision, among others.  What measures is the Minister taking to address the issues of students not receiving <i>pro rata<\/i>refunds from privately owned purpose built student accommodation?  His Department advised that affected students contact the Residential Tenancies Board, but the only advice given by it is to refer back to the students' fixed-term tenancy agreement.  The majority of privately owned, purpose built student accommodations are refusing to offer refunds to students, with many places refusing to offer a refund unless the individual can find somebody to replace them, this in the midst of a global pandemic.  As a result, students have been left in precarious circumstances due to losing their part-time work to service their commitments.<\/p><p>Will the Minister tell me what is being done by his Department to support the University of Limerick in issuing refunds for on-campus accommodation to its students?  It has been well communicated by the university that it is facing an unsustainable deficit that will prevent it from meeting operating costs and issuing <i>pro rata<\/i>refunds.<\/p><p>Will the Minister commit to extending both the ban on evictions and the rent freeze for a minimum of three months to cushion the economic blow and ensure the security and safety of the people as the State recovers from Covid-19?  Spain has introduced such measures as well as ordering large landlords to cut rents by as much as 50% and to restructure payments over three years to help those impacted by Covid-19.<\/p><p>It would be remiss of me not to highlight the plight of the families living in direct provision housing, if it can be called that.  Will the Minister illustrate what is being done to alleviate the suffering of families in direct provision?<\/p> <p>What measures are being taken to ensure that people living in direct provision will be able to live in accommodation where social distancing, self-isolation and cocooning is possible?<\/p> <p> Thousands of homeowners around the country have been paying huge bills, in some cases for years, because of housing defects, particularly in apartments.  There was no relief for them from the monthly levies and service charges in the Government's emergency legislation, which has caused great worry and hardship.  Can the Minister confirm that the Government will provide some support for those people such as a 90-day freeze from paying levies that renters have been given?<\/p> <p> The 18 May date to open construction sites is important and welcome, considering that a massive building and deep retrofitting programme is required to house and facilitate families.  It is essential to provide sustainable employment and reduce our CO2 emissions at an annual 7% reduction to meet the Paris Agreement requirements.  In the recovery, this State has a huge opportunity to reboot employment through circular economics.<\/p> <p> Post Covid-19, will the Minister commit to ending the housing assistance payment, HAP, system and adopt a State-led solution to the housing crisis that does not compete with the private market?  The HAP system saw some &euro;700 million paid out last year to rent subsidy.  Profit-driven policies see institutional investors constructing build-to-rent schemes and co-living accommodation.  That keeps the current generation out of the housing market and creates a transient workforce.  Those policies do not serve the people of the State; they only increase profits of banks and developers.<\/p> <p> Finally, post Covid-19, will the Minister commit to public land being used exclusively for cost rental and affordable purchase housing developments and not allow any further private development and exploitation of public land?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700085#TTTT00200","speaker":"1574","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588890300,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his contribution and his questions.  We have used every mechanism available to us to try to increase the number of new homes being built.  That is the reason we spent more money last year than had been spent as a State in any of the previous years, and that includes the boom years when we were building far too many houses.  It shows the scale at which delivery is now happening in terms of public housing and the taxpayers' money that is going towards that.<\/p>  <p>  To answer some of the Deputy's specific questions, in regard to student refunds, very early on I raised that issue with the representative of the university sector.  I also raised it with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Joe McHugh.  The Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, is dealing with student-related issues.  I have a figure in front of me that indicates that it has dealt with some 59 cases over the emergency period where students who had an issue were able to go to the RTB and have their cases heard by the RTB.  It is important that they can do that.  Unfortunately, some student agreements are not like the normal agreement that might come under the Residential Tenancies Act.  I refer to the traditional rental agreement one might have over a 12-month period and the different aspects that then come in when one acquires Part 4 rights because of the nature of student accommodation.  It is only for eight or nine months in a year, for example, and it is linked to academic terms and issues like that.  It absolutely has been more of a difficult experience in that position.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the University of Limerick, UL, it is not something I have been able to become involved in.  I am not responsible for university funding.  It does not fall under my Department so I am afraid I cannot speak to that.<\/p>  <p>  As to extending the rent freeze, as I mentioned earlier, it is in place now until essentially the end of June so there is plenty of time between now and then to get our ducks in a row, as necessary, and to make the right decision based on the information available to us.  When we put the freeze in place, one of the important things I wanted to do was to make sure it could be extended by ministerial order.  We could see the risk that was coming with us not being able to form a Seanad if a new Government was not in place and I did not want anyone to find themselves caught out by that fact, so they will not be.  A Minister at the time will be able to extend that order even if a Government has not been formed.  That protection is there for them.  I mentioned to Deputy &Oacute; Broin how I foresaw that as being likely but I do not want to pre-empt the decision that needs to be taken by Cabinet and when we have the necessary information in front of us to make that decision.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding direct provision, even though we are not responsible for direct provision in the Department we have got expertise in securing accommodation and those types of issues in terms of getting the agreements that are necessary in place.  We have worked with the Department of Justice and Equality to help it secure additional accommodation for people in direct provision.<\/p>  <p>  The 18 May date for the return of construction is for retrofitting also.  It is for outdoor building work.  Retrofitting is a very important part of that.  We had very ambitious plans before the crisis for retrofit programmes.  We have allocated money to it.<\/p> <p>We absolutely want to use that money to get people back into work where we can.<\/p> <p> In regard to the housing assistance payment scheme, we have had that debate a number of times in the House.  The situation was that not enough homes, or basically no homes, were being built.  Just over 600 social housing homes were built in 2016.  The HAP scheme had to be introduced or else all of those people would have nowhere to go.  Even though we now have the HAP scheme, we still have just under 10,000 people in emergency accommodation.  There was no other solution at the time which was going to fill that gap until new homes were built.  Since then, we have dramatically increased the number of new homes being built or added to the social housing stock.  As a result, from next year on, we will be accommodating more people in the social housing stock than we will accommodate through new HAP agreements.  That  rebalancing is happening and it is because we are taking a State-led approach.  The Deputy and I have a difference of opinion on that but the numbers will speak for themselves when it comes to Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p> <p> In regard to the use of public land, it is my view that public land should be used towards the public good.  That does not just mean pubic housing but mixed housing developments including cost rental, affordable to buy, social housing and private housing.  That makes sense and is good planning for community and everything else.  That is why we are taking the approach to public land that it is not exclusively for social, affordable and cost rental housing.  We are trying to have a mix of housing.  The real debate is over what that mix should be, whether 50:50 public-private or 70:30.  The Land Development Agency will have powers to make that determination on a site-by-site basis depending on the wider community.  That is good because we do not want politicians interfering as, unfortunately, they sometimes do when they object to a development because it is a particular type or scale of housing.  We have to protect the system as we seek to make improvements to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700086#UUUU00200","speaker":"1554","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588890900,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I look forward to the Minister's responses to the issues I am going to raise.  Nobody needs to be reminded that we are in the middle of a pandemic.  It is a national crisis and the health concerns are foremost in our minds.  However, the ability of people to respond to the crisis is hugely impacted by how and where they live.  One is more likely to survive this crisis if one has a better quality of accommodation.  What the crisis has done is rip off the plaster we have over many of our public services and expose the way we live in Ireland.  Our response in this period of time has to be far-reaching.  It must involve an acceptance of many of the failures of Irish society and a collective pledge that we will not allow these things to re-emerge.  We have been talking forever in this House about a State response to childcare provision, ending the two-tier health system and, God forbid, implementing a rent freeze.  We were told there are complications around these issues and they cannot happen.  Then a crisis comes and we find they can happen.<\/p>  <p>  I remember only too vividly the raised voices in this House the last time we had a major national crisis over the economic collapse.  Those raised voices were about the behaviour of the banks and why we had to fund them, invest in them and bankroll them.  We could not do anything in this country without them and we had to have lending starting again.  They would learn their lesson, they would change and everything would be better.  Of course, it only took the next crisis for many financial institutions to see their opportunity and revert to type.  It is no surprise to me and many other people that the same banking ethic or lack thereof, the amorality within the system, prevails.  These institutions see an opportunity to screw somebody and they are going to screw them.  That is happening today.<\/p>  <p>  Given that the Minister's Department has not an absolute knowledge but certainly a huge amount of knowledge of how housing works and the nature and dynamics of the sector in this country, is it working with the Department of Finance on analysing the issues, including the nature of mortgage distress, and working out how the two Departments can work together to address the issues in the coming months and years in order to keep people in their homes?  Do we have an answer for the people who have lost their jobs and feel they will not necessarily have an opportunity to return to employment in the short term?<\/p> <p>If the banks are sending people letters, telephoning them or increasing interest rates, as they do because that is what they do, do we have a response for that as a people?  Do we have a response to that as a Parliament?  I know this is a clich&eacute;, and it feels almost like a political point-scoring exercise, but when the banks needed us the State stepped in and did not let them fail.  Now that the people need us and the banks are not their friends, if the Minister and his Department are not already having conversations with the Department of Finance, will they start having those conversations and not wait for the time when this comes tumbling down the road as a major issue in households across the country?   <\/p> <p> On homeless services, I understand that the PPE required by those on the front line dealing with very vulnerable people in our homeless services, many of whom are living in conditions that many of us in this House would not live in - the pandemic again exposing the nature of the limitations of their living circumstances - has not been made available to them.  Is the Minister having conversations with the HSE and the Department of Health about that?<\/p> <p> I am interested in the Minister's comment about council funding.  He mentioned that if any of us were being told by our local council that it could not fund a particular project because it did not have the resources, he would like to know.  I appreciate those comments.  I am sure the Minister will be getting a lot of correspondence in that regard.  The Minister also referred to the issue regarding UL, which is fair enough.  He also responded to the issue about direct provision.  That is fair enough as well.<\/p> <p> My final question concerns strategic housing developments and the Minister's view of it.  I have noted his comment about objections, etc.  One of the issues that people have with the strategic housing development legislation is that it totally overrode the democratically constituted development plan of the local authority voted in by councillors and that it went straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which does not have to adhere to that development plan and, therefore, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, through this legislation, has afforded developers the rule book.  They own it and they can do what they like with it.  In my part of the world I am dealing with a fire service which I am told does not have the capacity to deal with any fire above the sixth floor of an apartment block, yet An Bord Plean&aacute;la is handing out planning permissions for major scale developments across the northside of Dublin and the State.  What we all want, as I am sure the Minister will agree, are communities.  We want housing as a public good that helps communities and people to grow together.  Where the show is being run by somebody with a profit motive, it will have a major influence on the direction of policy.  <\/p> <p> I would appreciate the Minister's comments on those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700087#VVVV00200","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588891500,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  On the quality of emergency accommodation, we brought in a new quality standards framework last summer, which was put together with the NGOs and local authorities and rolled out across Dublin.  It is now to become the national standard.  What we have seen in this crisis, because we have decongregated heavily congregated settings, is outcomes for individuals in those new settings that are far superior to what was there before.  The feedback I got yesterday in my latest engagement with the NGOs is that people are more settled and they are healthier and happier.  They are engaging with treatment and different resources with better outcomes.  We are trying to do a piece of work on what it is going to cost to continue in that vein and from where we source the accommodation because not all of it is from the short-term letting sector; some of it is from hotels as well.  Hotels in Dublin will, we hope, come back into use at some point in the future.  We need to make sure we have plans in place now to prepare for that.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about a rent freeze.  A rent freeze was possible because of the emergency we are in.  There are real constitutional constraints to implementing a rent freeze.  There are also policy considerations that are worth taking into account, for which I have made the arguments many times before.<\/p> <p>Thankfully, in this emergency, we were able to put in place a rent freeze.  As I said, it can be extended by ministerial order, if necessary.<\/p> <p> In regard to banking, I spoke with the Minister for Finance about this issue very early on, when it arose, and I also engaged with the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland representative group.  I did not engage with the banks individually because the line Minister is Deputy Donohoe, but I did speak with him.  I made sure that for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, if we were going to be putting a holiday in place, it would not be at an extra cost to people and that interest would not be charged over that period.  Therefore, people can engage with a mortgage holiday through their local authority lender and not be penalised for it, which is very important.  I sat on the banking inquiry through 2014 and 2015, when they told us about the changed culture in the banks, but that was at the same time the tracker scandal was happening.  I will leave my comments on the banks there.<\/p> <p> There is sufficient PPE at the moment for NGOs and homeless services.  One thing that has raised its head is that, in the next few days, we are going to get guidance on whether face masks are mandatory or advisable, which could change the quantity of PPE that we will need into the future.  I have already asked the Dublin Region Homeless Executive to examine that to see what it will mean, and it is doing so.  PPE gets provided through the local health point of contact.<\/p> <p> With regard to strategic housing developments, SHDs, the most I will say in this interaction is that we do not start a fight.  They have been extended out to the end of 2021 and no further.  The next step was to tie \"use it or lose it\" planning permissions to SHDs and, in fact, I wanted to tie that to all planning permissions.  It is something that has to be achieved by the next Government, in my opinion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700088#WWWW00200","speaker":"1554","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588891800,"counter":347,"content":"<p>In the current circumstances, when we look at all the pressures on housing, including the issue of homeless people being at a higher risk and the problems with mortgage arrears and the private rented sector, I do not think we could have more clarity that we need to develop strongly alternative models to housing provision beyond the private and for-profit sector.  That is why it is critical that we use State land and publicly-owned land only for public housing, be it affordable purchase, cost rental or social housing, given the massive deficits we have in housing provision in those areas.  I do not think that could be clearer at this current point.<\/p>  <p>  I want to commend everyone working on the front line in homeless organisations, who have been doing fantastic work in the last few months in supporting some of our most vulnerable.  There have been some very good results as a consequence of that work. <\/p>  <p>  I want to put five questions and I will first ask two of them, get a response and then ask the remainder.  The first concerns people who are homeless.  What is the plan of the Government for homeless people in the coming weeks and months?  As restrictions are lifted, what approaches will be taken and what measures will be put in place to protect homeless people living on the streets, who will be particularly vulnerable as they will come in contact with more people?  Given the large number of people in the private rented sector who have lost their jobs and are at risk of homelessness in the future, what action is the Government taking to address this?<\/p>  <p>  Second, in regard to overcrowding, it is abundantly clear that people living in overcrowded accommodation are at a higher risk of contracting Covid-19.  Dr. Lucy Michael has reported that nearly 100 people living in one direct provision centre have tested positive for the virus and there is substantial evidence from Dr. Jack Lambert of clusters of infection among people living in overcrowded accommodation, including in Dublin's north inner city.  In the private rented sector, where a number of people are living in a house, for example, a healthcare worker could test positive and be taken out of the accommodation and put into quarantine, which is all good.  However, the other housemates, who may be working in other sectors, are left there and are not tested because they are not working in the healthcare system, leaving them exposed to risk, along with the people they are coming into contact with.  It is clear there needs to be systematic testing for high-risk groups, including people living in overcrowded accommodation.  What action has the Minister taken to ensure there will be testing available for people living in overcrowded accommodation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700089#XXXX00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1588891800,"counter":348,"content":"<p>With regard to public land being only for public housing, some of the sites we have as public land are huge.  For example, the Central Mental Hospital site in Dundrum is massive.<\/p> <p>I do not think it is fair that the people who would not be able to avail of a particular scheme would not be able to buy a new home that might be built there.  As many as 2,500 new homes could be on that great site when it is finally developed and mix is important.  These are two reasons I believe the policy we have currently on the approach to public land is important.  We can debate the percentage of private versus public.  I just think there should be some access to housing in those areas for people who will not be able to avail of the schemes for the different reasons we have set out in the regulations to date.<\/p> <p> The important thing that we do as we lift the restrictions on the movement of people and we go through the phases is that we do not give up the additional accommodation that we have to date, so we can continue to have people being able to socially distance and to self-isolate should they be afraid they are sick or should they actually be sick and recovering.  The accommodation needs to stay in place for a longer period than the initial emergency period.<\/p> <p> The next thing that has to happen is that the health supports must remain in place.  This is incredibly important.  Yes, we have some NGOs that have trained up their own health staff but we have additional health supports on top of this and they will have to continue beyond the immediate emergency period.<\/p> <p> We have continued to put in place Housing First and getting people off the streets and into their homes.  At least 25 new such tenancies were created since the beginning of the crisis, with more we can do.  Currently, rough sleeping is very low because of the extra work that outreach teams are doing to get people into care and keep them in care and because the experience some people are now having in emergency accommodation is better than what they might have had before the crisis because of the changes that have been made.  This is why it is important that we identify these changes that we need to maintain.<\/p> <p> With regard to testing people in emergency accommodation, what happened was the NGOs came together and agreed that one NGO would run a facility to take any suspected or confirmed case.  It trained up its staff to work and be able to test and do everything necessary.  It is running fantastically well.  Thankfully, as a result of these efforts, we have not seen a cluster.  What we have now moved to is targeted testing of people in emergency accommodation.  The Deputy spoke about what happens in a private home that is overcrowded because of the number of people renting it and we have a similar measure.  Where a fear might arise because one person is suspected of being sick or actually has the virus, we can do targeted testing of everyone else who might have been in that particular centre.  This will be very beneficial.  What we think we will find is a number of asymptomatic cases, where people never displayed a symptom of being sick for whatever reason.  This is what is happening in testing in emergency accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700089#XXXX00300","speaker":"1554","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588892400,"counter":350,"content":"<p>With regard to overcrowded accommodation in the private rental sector, it is a particular area that will need more focus.  With regard to homeless people, I am not just talking about rough sleepers but also about people who, despite supports and services being put in place currently, are spending a lot of their time, for whatever reason, on the streets and people who are being advised to cocoon but are not always doing so.  Currently, they are at less of a risk because there are fewer people to come into contact with but as restrictions are lifted there will be many more people with whom they may come into contact.  They will need particular attention.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to public land, I am very familiar with the Central Mental Hospital as I used to live just up from it in Rosemount Estate, a fine example of public housing.  What I argue for is not that there should not be an opportunity for people to purchase homes, of course there should be affordable housing, but it should be publicly built housing rather than handing it over to a private developer.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the housing assistance payment, has a new instruction been issued to local authorities to advise them not to issue arrears in respect of applications?  If so, what arrangements have been made to speed up the processing of applications?  What arrangements have been made to advise applicants of any change that has been made.  It is welcome that the Minister recently noted there needs to be stronger regulation for short-term lets.  What measures precisely does he propose?

On the overcrowding point, I am aware additional accommodation has been secured for those working in the health sector who not only need to self-isolate but need to separate from the people they are living with because of the work they do.  If the Deputy is aware of any case of someone who has not been able to secure this type of accommodation please let me know and I will make sure they get to the Minister for Health.<\/p> <p>We will have a proper, fuller debate on housing in so many different areas when things get back to normal.  Currently, to be able to get through one of the affordable schemes that we have, a couple has to be earning less than &euro;75,000.  If they are living in Dublin and are even in starter jobs, they are not going to be able to go through those schemes.  That is why there should be an allowance for private housing, for someone to just buy without having to come through a local authority scheme on those big sites because there is room for it.  That is the point I was making.  On the housing assistance payment, there was a circular to local authorities on HAP and the different measures that had to be introduced in the crisis.  I can have that provided to the Deputy after the debate if he has not seen it already.  On short-term letting, we need to be very clear.  As we had the debates around introducing the planning law changes to short-term letting, it was acknowledged by everyone that we also had to regulate the platforms.  I was clear at the time that this was not a responsibility for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government because these are tourism platforms operating online.  We had to change the planning laws first anyway so that we had something to regulate.  As I envisage it, one would be able to regulate the platforms in terms of what they are publishing on their sites, because they are responsible for what is being published on their sites if someone was publishing a letting that was in breach of the laws.  If we move to that kind of arrangement, we might actually be able to loosen the stricter, broader planning changes that we made, so that we could have a more nuanced approach in situations where we have no short-term lettings, like in our city centres, but in the same local authority area could perhaps allow some short-term letting, if it is a very large local authority area.  At the moment, the operation of the new restrictions on short-term letting is tied to rent pressure zones.  It is a bit of a blunt instrument, if I am being honest, but it was necessary.  If we could somehow improve that and have a more nuanced approach through regulation of the platforms as well, I think we would be able to keep those homes for our citizens who are living and working here but also make sure that some parts of the country that benefit from the tourism that comes from short-term letting will be able to continue to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700090#YYYY00300","speaker":"1554","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588893000,"counter":353,"content":"<p>There have been some positive measures taken in the face of the health emergency, such as freezing rent increases and stopping evictions, something the Minister previously said could not be done, and some decongregation of emergency hubs and allocations.

I have a letter from the RTB that says due to the Corona virus all cases will be handled as paper-based adjudication and there will be no physical hearing.  There is no proposal for a virtual Zoom or Skype hearing or anything else.  The RTB says very clearly that it will be a paper-based hearing, which will be the RTB adjudicator looking at the evidence as presented on paper by the landlord and by the tenant.  There is no capacity to question or for a tenant to come in, a tenant who may not be very comfortable or confident when writing their case down but who could make a good case in person.  There is no capacity for the adjudicator to investigate things by asking the landlord if something is accurate.  These are things that, in my experience, have been absolutely essential in adjudicators making findings in favour of tenants.  This is in direct contradiction to the RTB handbook that says the adjudicator will give both sides an opportunity to present their case and may ask questions.  This creates extra stress and pressure on people who are already struggling to get by.  Effectively, it may mean a fast-tracking of evictions when the coronavirus crisis is over and the moratorium on evictions has been lifted by cutting tenants' rights to a fair hearing.  Does the Minister agree with this decision?  If not, will the Minister ensure that it is reversed, that tenants can access their right to have a hearing and that we can put an end to this supposed paper-based adjudication process?

Because of what is happening during this emergency period there has been a big decrease in the number of cases the RTB has had to handle.  Essentially, we have been able to protect people in their homes due to a decision this Oireachtas made around freezing of notices to quit and a freeze on rents.  The RTB can still continue to do its work but it must do so in a way it believes is safe for its staff.  When we communicated the new laws to the RTB, and when I spoke to them, it was very much on the understanding that they had to take into account that we are in an emergency period, that we are all trying to deal with a pandemic and to act accordingly.<\/p> <p>I am not aware of any increase in the number of notices to quit being served over this period.  The freeze is in place until the end of June and may be extended.  At a certain point, the RTB will be able to go back to the previous, normal way of working, as we hope would most offices or other places where there has to be some sort of a public hearing or engagement with the public.  I do not think we should suppose that as the rest of life gets back to some degree of normality or whatever the new norm is, the RTB will not too.

It will not hold physical hearings, but what is contained in that is that it will not hold hearings at all and will instead do paper-based adjudication.  These adjudications will have the same weight as a proper hearing that would have happened before the moratorium kicked in and, therefore, people will have decisions made in advance.

I thank the Minister for his update and strong hints that the rent freeze may be extended next month.  If that were to be the case, be it by ministerial order or Cabinet decision, I assure the Minister of my full support in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  I have three questions to ask on behalf of myself and my good colleagues in the Regional Group.  I will ask two of them first, give the Minister an opportunity to respond, and then follow up with my third question.  The focus of the questions is to find solutions rather than merely identify problems.  The first relates to empty housing, and it is a particular genre of empty houses.  The retail banks in this country have declared to the Central Bank of Ireland that they have more than 1,000 houses on their balance sheets.  Has consideration been given to the State purchasing these houses directly from the banks, transferring their ownership to the local authorities or the approved housing bodies, and taking a vast number of people off the homelessness and housing lists?  There would be considerable advantages.  We would increase the number of public houses owned by the State and, most importantly, save a fortune on the emergency accommodation bill.<\/p>  <p>  I would be grateful to hear the Minister's views on that.  He quite rightly pointed out that this is a wonderful opportunity to do such a thing.  House prices are probably at their peak and will probably come down, and I believe that the banks are keen to offload the properties.  The time is right.  We should go in, negotiate hard and fast, and lock in and secure discounts on the properties.  It would be a good, quick fix that would have a very positive effect on the housing situation in this country.<\/p>  <p>  My second question doubles up on what Deputies Darragh O'Brien and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in said in respect of the mortgage deferrals, holidays or breaks, or whatever one wants to call them.  Some 70,000 people have applied for them, and it is incredible that the banks will profit or even profiteer on people's hardships.  To be charging interest on top of interest is completely unacceptable.  I wonder where the Central Bank is in all this.  It has a statutory function, a consumer protection function, and a leadership role in this regard.  I am sure the Minister is familiar with the Irish Banking Culture Board from his time on the banking inquiry.  I was on the board's website before I came to the Chamber and noticed that its home page states that the board's \"overriding mission [is] to make banking in Ireland trustworthy again\".<\/p> <p>It goes on to say that it plans to \"promote ethical behaviour and advocate for humanity, decency and respect in the banking sector.\"  That statement is on the IBCB home page.  Members should feel free to check it on their way home.<\/p> <p> I fully understand that the finance portfolio is not the Minister's brief but failures in the finance portfolio have a habit of ending up on the desk of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I would be grateful for the Minister's views on whether we can refer this interest and mortgage deferment issue to the Irish Banking Culture Board for its considered opinion in this regard.  I will allow the Minister time to respond and I will return with my third question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700093#BBBBB00500","speaker":"1587","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588894800,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I do not like to comment on matters unless I have had a proper chance to think them through so I might not respond as directly as I would like to on the matters the Deputy raised about the banks.  I made a comment to Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in about my experience with the banks in the banking inquiry where they told us their culture had changed and what subsequently emerged had been happening in the banks.  The Deputy's suggestion of referring what is happening to the Irish Banking Culture Board is an interesting one and I would be interested to see the board's reply.<\/p>  <p>  One of the things I was determined to do when we were looking at the Rebuilding Ireland home loan was to make sure that mortgage break would not come at a cost to the borrower.  On the basis that we have been able to make that arrangement through the local authority lending system, it will not come at a cost, even if we have a six-month extension.  That is good news for people who have come through the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme.  There is a lot more money available and people should continue to apply for the loan because it is a real help in getting people affordable mortgages and into affordable homes.<\/p>  <p>  On empty houses, the previous D&aacute;il established a rolling fund for the Housing Agency.  I may have referred to the Housing Agency as the Housing Alliance earlier, which is a different body, but I meant to refer to the Housing Agency.  Off the top of my head, I believe the rolling fund amounted to &euro;70 million.  I have spoken to the CEO, John O'Connor, on many occasions and he has been doing a deep dive into the books of the banks to see what vacant properties on their books - they are vacant because they are in the banks and they have not been sold, dealt with or unencumbered - could be taken.  A number of properties have been taken.  I do not have an up-to-date figure on how many have been taken to date but there was a lot more potential to use the rolling fund to get those vacant properties back into use.<\/p>  <p>  Another related matter we have been looking into is strengthening the compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers of local authorities so that they can compulsorily purchase a vacant property, not necessarily for social housing but to sell on at an affordable price to someone who may be looking to buy a home but may not be able to avail of social housing.  Any mechanism to release vacant housing, whether it be for social, affordable or private housing, should be used.  That option is under consideration and it is something we would have liked to have done previously but we did not get around to it in the lifetime of the last Government.  Bank-led vacancy, as we used to refer to it, is very important.  I will get an update from the Housing Agency on the figures, how much of the rolling fund it has spent, how many houses it has secured and how much it thinks is left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700094#CCCCC00200","speaker":"1554"},{"type":"speech","time":1588894800,"counter":367,"content":"<p>My last question is on an issue that is close to my heart and the Ceann Comhairle's heart from his work in the Kildare South constituency.  It is the matter of military housing and military accommodation.  Many of the Deputies in the Chamber may not be aware that over half of the military installations in this country have been shut down and closed by the Department of Defence in the past 20 years.  Unsurprisingly, this has left us with a serious lack of military accommodation and housing for troops and their families.  The international norm is that military personnel stay on base.  There is an operational reason for that, namely, that if an emergency breaks out, troops can go straight to the army and draw weapons, sailors can jump on a naval ship and put to sea for a search and rescue operation or an air crew can scramble an aircraft and fly a five-year old child to London for an organ transplant at short notice.  There is an operational imperative for military housing on base.  There is also a humanitarian need for it because we know that the Defence Forces pay is so appallingly bad that it is difficult to compete in the private rental sector in garrison towns all over the country.  It is likely the next Government will allocate more funding to the housing portfolio.  What are the Minister's thoughts on having a portion of that funding allocated to the Defence Forces budget and ring-fenced exclusively for military accommodation and housing?<\/p> <p>There is very little accommodation and housing on base even though there are vast tracts of land in the Curragh Camp and in Baldonnel air base, for example, which could be used exclusively for military accommodation.  Any accommodation we have is completely inadequate in quality and quantity and much of it is in appalling condition.  I would be grateful to hear the Minister's thoughts.

In such a scenario it would make perfect sense that some of the housing would be allocated to people working on that site or working with the military.  That is due to be managed by the new Land Development Agency, LDA.  When the legislation on the Land Development Agency is passed, and I expect it to be a priority of the new Government when it is formed, some &euro;1.2 billion will be available in capital supports to invest in housing for our citizens.  There may be a way, if the LDA is able to work with the Department of Defence, that it could meet both needs - the need for better housing and housing on site for people in the Defence Forces as well as public housing, which is its overriding remit.

It was good news for the applicants.  I expect the Minister will not be able to answer my question now, but two new social housing developments, one in Dunmanway and the other in Bandon, received a large number of applications when they came up on choice based letting, CBL.

The rules for once-off housing in rural areas will have to be relaxed now to allow people who wish to live in rural areas to do so.  Will the Minister support this?  It is a straight question.  In addition, I have long been an advocate of a rural resettlement scheme where the focus would be on taking people from overcrowded hotels in our cities and resettling them in rural communities.  Small towns and villages in west Cork such as Allihies, Goleen, Kaelkill, Leap, Ballinacarriga, Ballinadee and Union Hall could benefit greatly from such a scheme.

I will have to refer back to the Deputy on the Bandon and Dunmanway sites.  I do not want to give him the wrong information and I do not have it to hand now.<\/p>  <p>  An important thing we have been able to do, notwithstanding the emergency and the closure of construction sites generally, is with regard to between 35 to 40 sites now open where social housing homes are being built.  It is approximately 1,000.  There were 6,500 homes under construction on site at the end of last year and about 1,000 of them are back under construction because they were almost at completion.  Working with the Housing Agency we gave sanction to local authorities to open certain sites.

It is important work.  It will be faced by the next Government.<\/p> <p> A major part of the national planning framework is making sure 75% of future growth will happen outside Dublin.  We have identified different regions, regional drivers and balances of growth between regions that we want to achieve.

This is because it is implementing the 2040 plan, which has not yet been enforced.  If the 2040 plan is implemented fully, there will be no more one-off houses in rural Ireland, because of the way it is structured.<\/p>  <p>  A bigger problem we have in planning is conservation.  We have iconic buildings throughout the country that we need to protect and refurbish but there are also towns and villages that are falling down that are subject to conservation orders.  They cannot be done up because the finance does not exist.  I know of a couple who bought a house and added a big extension to the back but whose insurance company would not insure the front part because it had a timber ceiling.  The conservation officer would not allow them to take down the timber ceiling.  Where there are houses in poor condition that could be done up, we keep the front fa&ccedil;ade, roof and chimneys.  Keeping the front fa&ccedil;ades respects the original streetscape.  If we have to knock the rest and build new structures behind, we are saving the front fa&ccedil;ades of all the villages and towns and getting people back into the buildings at a low expense.<\/p>  <p>  When the matter of the rent freeze arises in June, I will be fully in favour of it.

He stated he allowed certain estates to open up to get houses finished.  We made many representations to the office and asked for work to continue on one-off houses that were within one month of being finished.  The people affected are renting, and some of them are working in front-line services.  Although building their own houses, they have had to pay rent for an extra two months.  They now probably have to join a queue because there are people waiting for their houses to be done and the construction industry does not have the manpower to finish them at present.  There are people building one-off houses who are both renting and paying a mortgage.  What is the Minister going to do for them?<\/p>  <p>  We have been talking about social housing.

Further iterations of the regional spatial and economic strategies have been agreed.  It is a matter of how they will be implemented in development plans.  Every local authority must be in line with them.  What we will see in this regard are the opportunities the national planning framework is providing for housing.<\/p> <p>Deputy O'Donoghue is absolutely right about the balance in terms of conservation.  We are only getting in our own way if we are not allowing ourselves to buy, restore or rebuild homes because it might then have too much of a negative impact.  If the choice is between letting it fall apart or getting someone back into it with some alterations, we should get them back in.  That is so important for our streetscapes and for the older parts of towns, villages and cities.<\/p> <p> In terms of houses being built now, we were able to find a measure in the emergency Acts where we could get some social housing sites open because they were going to provide accommodation directly for people coming off the housing list, out of overcrowded housing or out of emergency accommodation.  My choice was basically no housing sites open or some, and so I went for some.  I would have liked it to have been all, but that was not possible.  That is what 18 May is about, including for people who are doing self-builds.  I am sorry that is the case because the points the Deputy makes are absolutely correct.  If one is doing a self-build one would think one would be able to manage the site in a socially responsible way in terms of the health measures.  We will have guidance for every site and sites that do open must open in accordance with the guidance that is in place if they are to be able to operate safely.  I think that is very important.

He said that it was through their foresight that he was able to foresee what was happening and was able to deal with it.  There could be lessons for other Departments in that regard.  Right through the crisis, very often it has been the case that the voluntary agencies and bodies working on the ground dealing with these issues are far better able to deal with them than Departments.

The Department in the crisis is far better than the one we had before it and I would like to see it continue.<\/p>  <p>  Could the Minister indicate how many homeless people are staying in hotels at the moment and the impact of that?  A quick and easy solution would be if he were to stop the use of Airbnb accommodation, as that would ensure accommodation is available for people who need it.  I would welcome a comment in that regard.  In the future, what could prevent the Minister taking such a step to deal with the crisis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700097#FFFFF00600","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1588896600,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  No doubt there will be lessons that Departments can share with others.  We have experts working in health, in homelessness, in care provision, in different types of treatments, and in the provision of food, all of these things.  It is one of the benefits we have in the public sector, in that there is real expertise there and they really have led the way.  I think back to the end of January and February and a lot of people were sceptical about what Covid-19 might mean in reality and if it could ever come here.  Thankfully, the experts working in homelessness, in the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and in the NGOs, whether they were sceptical or not, put plans in place.  It is absolutely the case that those plans have saved lives and, in addition, they have vastly improved the experience of a lot of people who are in emergency accommodation or sleeping rough.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy rightly points out, we need now to understand how we can keep that new reality, make it the new norm and not go back to how things were being done before.  Sometimes in a crisis one gets the opportunity to move much more quickly than one might otherwise do.  Bureaucratic walls fall away.  The Taoiseach talked about this when we had the engagement in Grangegorman.<\/p> <p>When one goes to design policy, one often wants to design the perfect policy but it gets in the way of something good that might help people more quickly.  I am thinking of the interagency group which we set up has been doing great work since 2017; some of the things that we wanted to achieve happened almost overnight because of this crisis.  It should never have taken a crisis for that to happen, but it did and we should take advantage of that and see what we can make permanent.<\/p> <p> On things we might keep in place, earlier I mentioned a dedicated health support for Dublin which was not there.  It has been absolutely fantastic.  People were sharing videos which were helping to instruct staff how to deal with people who they suspected might have Covid in a congregated setting, and so on.  We have to maintain dedicated health supports and it is clear that there must be a funding line for them from the Department of Health.  We could be clear about that.  We could look at the housing support and say the funding in the housing budget will get X amount of accommodation at X price and that health support funding will get X number of care workers to come in and do this work; to really have that aligned.  We have to break down some of those bureaucratic walls that have existed for too long.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700097#FFFFF00700","speaker":"1554","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588897200,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

One issue I campaigned on was dereliction in rural towns and villages.  There are many derelict houses across Clare as there are in most of Ireland.  Deputy O'Donohoe alluded to the problem.  Shelley McNamara, one of Ireland's leading architects, who recently won the Pritzker prize for architecture, has spoken of the need for a pilot project and to look in particular at regulations to bring old buildings in our market towns up to current standards.  It is almost impossible.  It is far more expensive than what Deputy O'Donohoe proposes which would be to leave the front facade, knocking the rest down and rebuild them.  There could be a big long architectural discussion of whether it is the same building after one does that, but would the Minister consider a pilot project, preferably in a town in Clare and unfortunately there are many in Clare with much dereliction but it could be any town in Ireland, and see if leading architects can be brought together to end dereliction?  We need to get people living in those houses to end homelessness but it also has an effect on the morale of a town when its main market square or main street is full of derelict buildings.  I see Deputy Feighan in the Chamber.  He is from Boyle, a town in which there has been much renewal.  I dare say there is not a single town outside County Dublin or north Kildare where there is not dereliction in the main street.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities are effectively on their knees.  Around 1,000 people are employed by Clare County Council, all of them carrying out essential services to their community.  A rates holiday has been announced.  Local authorities need money.  They have three sources of funding, the central grant, rates and the local property tax.  People simply cannot afford to have their local property tax increased.  How will local authorities fund themselves in the future?  The three months rates break announced is very welcomed by all businesses, but it may have to be much longer for pubs and restaurants in particular as well as others in the hospitality industry to make it worthwhile reopening.  If they face a hefty rates bill even in six months, it will not be worth their while to reopen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700098#GGGGG00400","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1588897200,"counter":387,"content":"<p>Deputy McNamara is very welcome back to the D&aacute;il.  I have not had an opportunity to speak to him either.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the point on the difficulty in bringing derelict homes up to the right standard for living in.  We can make changes here, of course we can.  We need to be careful that in making those changes we are then not criticised for lowering standards, but it makes absolutely no sense if the only choice - it is not really a choice - people feel they have is that they must leave a home vacant, derelict or going derelict because they cannot afford or are not allowed to renovate it in some way.  I love to watch all those architecture programmes on TV, such as \"Grand Designs\".  They do amazing things but it always costs a hell of a lot of money to do them. We want to be able to try to protect the fabric of our communities, villages and towns.<\/p> <p>This is one way in which we can do it.<\/p> <p> We have tried several different schemes but some have not been as successful.  One example was the change to the need for planning permission if a shop owner wanted to convert above the shop.  We got rid of that.  If a property owner owns a protected building, that is not going to make much of a difference.  There are other standards that might not be put in place.  Work is being done in terms of town and village renewal on what might be achieved there.<\/p> <p> Local authority funding of &euro;500 million has been secured now for the three-month waiver and for the new restart fund.  The three-month waiver is there for everyone, even if they open up early.  It is there until the end of June.  If a business owner was to be able to open in two weeks' time, he or she would still have that waiver until the end of June.  If he or she cannot open until August, he or she will get an extra waiver.  Some &euro;500 million is going to be added because additional money will be required for people in the hospitality sector who will be unable to open before August.  That is the position at the moment according to the plan, but hopefully that can be brought forward.  With the restart refund, a business owner can apply for up to &euro;10,000 in a rebate or waiver of rates.  Some 80% of businesses pay less than &euro;10,000 per year in rates.  Basically 80% of businesses can have their rates waived for a further 12 months if that is what they want.  Alternatively, if they want, they can get the money upfront to re-purpose their businesses or to do some of the social distancing things they might need to do.  It can be used to reinvent their businesses if that is necessary.  They will be able to get that cash based on the money they paid in rates in 2019.  That money is available and it will be added to as necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050700098#GGGGG00500","speaker":"1554","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588897800,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Thank you, Minister.
