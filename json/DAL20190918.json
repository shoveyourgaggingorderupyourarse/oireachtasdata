Initial regulations in regard to schemes of priorities were made subsequently and further regulations will be put in place over the coming months regarding eligibility and other matters.<\/p> <p> In order to support the delivery of discounted homes to buy or rent, this Government has committed &euro;310 million under the serviced sites fund from 2019 to 2021 to provide infrastructure to support the delivery of some 6,200 homes.  To date, funding of &euro;127 million in support of 35 projects in 13 local authority areas has been allocated for infrastructure works on sites that will support the delivery of almost 3,200 homes.<\/p> <p> The overall cost and the timing of delivery for these projects are contingent upon the completion of design, planning and procurement in the first instance and local authorities are working to achieve delivery as quickly as possible.  The price of homes that will be offered for purchase under the scheme will vary by development but Dublin City Council, for example, has indicated that it expects to have two-bedroom homes available in Ballymun in the &euro;148,000 to &euro;168,000 price range.<\/p> <p> The first cost rental project at Enniskerry Road in Stepaside has gone on site and will deliver over 150 homes, 50 of which will be cost rental.  My Department has been in contact with the local authority concerned in regard to the commencement of drawdown of funding.  The remaining projects are currently at the stage of design and planning and, accordingly, local authorities are not yet drawing down allocated funds.  I anticipate that the bulk of expenditure will arise as projects reach the construction phase.<\/p> <p> The Enniskerry Road project, which I formally launched last week, is one of two pathfinder pilot projects for cost rental.  The homes involved are due to be completed in 2021 and tenants will pay &euro;1,200 per month to live in the two-bedroom apartments.  This rent is based on the cost of delivering and maintaining the homes and is a significant reduction when compared with market rents in the area.<\/p> <p> Regarding the St. Michael's Estate site at Emmett Road, Dublin City Council is continuing to make progress on the preliminary work on this project.  It is estimated that this site can accommodate approximately 470 homes in a high-quality mixed tenure development, including approximately 330 cost rental homes, and the development framework plan for the site has recently been completed.<\/p> <p> Dublin City Council is engaging with my Department according to the best practice guidelines set out in the capital works management framework and is procuring an architect led integrated design team which will be responsible for designing the scheme and taking it as far as the planning stage.  I am determined that work will continue to progress at pace on this project over the coming months and that lessons learned from the modelling at this location are applied to the ongoing development work for a national cost rental model.<\/p> <p> In terms of that work to progress the cost rental agenda more generally, I have convened a working group led by my Department, also involving the Land Development Agency, the Housing Agency and other bodies, to develop the cost rental policy framework to provide for a sustainable financing structure and to allow us to commence the delivery of homes at scale.  In order to assist with this work, in May 2019 my Department signed an agreement with the European Investment Bank to officially engage it to undertake a research project into cost rental on our behalf.  Detailed operational and eligibility criteria for cost rental will be informed by this evidence building and policy work.  This work will be concluded well in advance of the completion of construction work on the first homes at Enniskerry Road.<\/p> <p> These new schemes are set in the context of significant moderation in the growth in house prices and complement other key Government affordability initiatives.  Included among these are the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, under which more than 1,000 loans had been drawn down the end of June this year, and the help to buy scheme, under which some 14,000 applications have been approved.  In addition, the Land Development Agency's initial portfolio of sites will have the potential to deliver to deliver 3,000 affordable homes and the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, will support more than 2,300 affordable homes on mainly publicly owned lands, while 5,600 further homes will benefit from a LIHAF related cost reduction, some of which have already come on stream.<\/p> <p> In overall terms, programmes are in place under which some 18,000 affordable homes or homes with a LIHAF related reduction will be delivered, with 15,000 households already supported under the Rebuilding Ireland home loan or the help to buy scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800003#A00900","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568799300,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Before we start-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800004#B00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1568799300,"counter":18,"content":"<p>The questions have been grouped.

The Minister had eight minutes to outline a number of answers to three questions.  It is now up to me to decide what I have to pick by way of a supplementary question.  <\/p>  <p>  I refer to home ownership and affordable purchase.  Home ownership levels in Ireland are now below the EU average, at 67%.  In 1991, the home ownership rate was 82%.  In 1991, private renters comprised 9% of the market and the figure is now 21%.  The average age at which a person buys one's own home has risen from 26 years to 35 years.  This is a major issue.  Where are the criteria for the national scheme?  I wrote to the Minister in March to raise issues I had with the salary levels, in particular those for couples.  The matter should be devolved to local authorities and should not involve simply a discount on market price.  That is a mistake.  We should consider a shared ownership type arrangement.  That relates to affordable purchase.<\/p>  <p>  I want to talk about affordable rent but my issue is that when I ask supplementary questions it is as if I am asking only about affordable purchase.

The grouping of questions is not helpful.  My specific question concerned the cost rental model in St. Michael's Estate.  On 20 February this year, Deputy John Curran put down a question about the off balance sheet costs of cost rental accommodation.  The Minister replied that the urban design development framework plan for St. Michael's would be completed later in quarter 1 of 2019.  Where is the framework plan?  There was a forum meeting on Monday and I have not been able to get much information on St. Michael's Estate.  This is an important pilot scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I note the Minister's point that rents of &euro;1,200 per month will  be charged under a cost rental model in Enniskerry.  I would have to consider that as the figure seems quite high.  I would expect rents in St. Michael's Estate to be lower than that.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister went all over the houses on some other points.  I want to discuss what is happening in O'Devaney Gardens where land was handed over to a developer and we will only get about 176 public housing units out of a total of 798 or 800 houses.

The average age has moved from 26 to 35 or 36.  Home ownership has been declining since 1991.  I think it fell as quickly during the boom years as it is falling now so, again, that is linked to different things.  The NDFA has modelled cost reductions for affordable homes schemes that are not just related to a discount on the market price but to the net income of a person.  With regard to a clerical officer or a teacher on the mid point of the salary scale, we are looking at those types of salary scales because we must make sure the homes being provided are affordable for people living and working in areas and cities where price pressures are highest.  This is why we have the ambition for at least 20,000 affordable homes under the different schemes and that is why we set up the Land Development Agency and locked in a minimum of 30% for the provision of affordable homes on the land being brought forward by the agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800004#B01900","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568799900,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Time is-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800005#C00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1568799900,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I have not had a chance to respond to Deputy-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800005#C00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1568799900,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I am sorry but I laid it out at the start.

The Minister should not strangle the local authorities with upper income limits, particularly for couples.  Given that &euro;2,024 is the average monthly rent in Dublin city and county, a couple consisting of a nurse or a garda earning &euro;75,000 between them will be excluded from the draft scheme, which is not what we want.  That is not the scheme that Fianna F&aacute;il developed.  The previous Act would allow for discretion at local authority level.  This must happen.

Most of the affordable homes in O'Devaney Gardens will be priced at less than &euro;310,000.  I spoke to Dublin City Council yesterday and was informed that no homes will be sold for more than &euro;400,000 under the schemes relating to the land there.

When we talked about this during a previous engagement, I spoke about &euro;50,000 for an individual and &euro;75,000 for a couple but they are guides.  The actual determination is 35% of net income so we are working on the regulations for that aspect with local authorities and they will be in place before the houses come on stream.  It is important to note that the regulations for the scheme of priorities have already gone through most local authorities, 21 local authorities have approved and ten are still going through their scheme of priorities, namely, who comes through based on his or her connection to the area, working in the area and children in school.  We discussed that during a previous session.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding St. Michael's Estate, the NDFA has completed its financial modelling.

It is a very important issue and more cases are being brought forward.  It is an issue in which the Minister, Deputy Murphy, the Department and I are very interested.  I recognise the work of the Deputy and the committee on the issue.  It is something of which we are certainly well aware.<\/p>  <p>  The Safe as Houses report has been considered by the Department, and while I can subscribe to many of the principles in it, I believe the building control reform agenda that is already well under way provides a comprehensive road map for embedding a culture of compliance and accountability in the construction industry and for strengthening the building control framework in this country.  I am conscious that many of the issues raised date from prior to the new building control measures coming into place.<\/p>  <p>  The reform agenda includes amendments made to the building control regulations, the national building control management project and the ongoing development of new legislation through the building control (construction industry register Ireland) Bill.  I am conscious the report mentions this and it is something we hope to publish later this year.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, the Fire Services Acts, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts.  Fire services may inspect buildings in cases of defects or complaints in respect of fire safety.  They work with building owners to ensure immediate risks are addressed and a plan is put in place, where required, for works to bring buildings into compliance.  This framework, which followed the 2015 report, is enabling and is a model that can be used to try to address some of the issues affecting some of these apartments.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to legacy issues generally, I acknowledge the very stressful circumstances that owners and residents face when defects occur in their homes.  However, in general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, that is the homeowner, the builder, the developer and-or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme.  The State has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.  It is not possible for the State to take on responsibility or liability for all legacy issues nor would this send the right message to the industry regarding its responsibility for compliance now and in future.<\/p>  <p>  My focus will remain firmly on ensuring the full roll-out of the building control reform agenda, to ensure all those engaged in the construction sector take their responsibilities seriously and are appropriately held to account.  As part of the reform agenda, consumer protection will continue to be my core concern and any proposal in this regard will, of course, be considered.  We have see some new products in the insurance market on foot of the building control measures in place.  Naturally, if they had been in place in the past we would not be in this situation.  There is a lot of reform going on.

Here is the problem: the State has already accepted liability for some, including Priory Hall, pyrite and mica block in Donegal, but has left other home owners to their own devices.  What we are calling for is very straightforward.  We want a redress scheme that provides a one-stop shop to assist homeowners to deal with latent defects when they find them.  We also call for a mediation and dispute resolution service, not unlike the Residential Tenancies Board, to make the developer pay in the first instance.

Under our proposals, the &euro;40 million the State will lose on Priory Hall would have been &euro;20 million because the industry would have been forced to pay its fair share.

It has recommended a one-stop-shop where a householder who has discovered latent defects can get independent advice free of charge, which is eminently reasonable and doable.  It also recommended a mediation and dispute resolution service, not unlike the Residential Tenancies Board, whereby a public body would have the legal authority to ensure in the first instance the developer is responsible for the bill for mediation, which is an eminently sensible response that would have a limited cost to the State.

Due to the quasi-judicial and independent role of the RTB, it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, to intervene in specific disputes.<\/p><p>A number of measures have been introduced in recent years with the objective of improving security of tenure for tenants under the Residential Tenancies Acts.  Section 34 of the 2004 Act provides that a landlord must state a reason for the termination in any notice served, in accordance with the allowable grounds for terminations.  Through an amendment introduced in 2016, where a landlord proposes to sell ten or more units within a single development at the same time, that sale is subject to the existing tenants remaining <i>in situ<\/i>, other than in exceptional circumstances.  In addition, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 provides that where a landlord terminates a tenancy because he or she intends to sell the property, he or she must enter into a contract for sale within nine months of the termination date and, if not, must offer to relet to a former tenant who provides his or her contact details.  The 2019 Act also provides that where a landlord terminates a tenancy because he or she needs vacant possession to substantially refurbish or renovate the property, that property must be offered back to the former tenant, who provides his or her contact details, upon completion of the works.  Also, such a termination notice must contain or be accompanied by a written certificate of a registered professional under the Building Control Act 2007, such as an architect or surveyor, stating that the proposed substantial refurbishment or renovation works would pose a health and safety risk necessitating vacation by the tenants and that such a risk would be likely to exist for at least three weeks.  The 2019 Act provides additional powers for the RTB to investigate and sanction landlords who engage in improper conduct, including non-compliance with the tenancy termination provisions.  My Department will continue to keep the effectiveness and enforcement of the security of tenure provisions in these Acts under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800007#E00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1568801100,"counter":64,"content":"<p>All three of these cases demonstrate that the Minister's legislation is riddled with loopholes for unscrupulous vulture funds, which lack any compassion or humanity.

They just see the property as an asset they can sweat and the best way to sweat it is to evict people, exploiting loopholes, particularly the loophole around substantial refurbishment, the loopholes around sale or, in the case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire where there are 11 tenants, they will move to evict eight and will try to evict the other three a little bit further down the line because of the Tyrrelstown amendment.

We have strengthened those protections and we have talked about banning sales and vacant possession before and how that would not be a solution because it would still allow the person who is buying the property to then serve a notice to quit.  All that is being done is to displace the problem from one landlord to a new buyer, to someone else without solving it.

It is worth noting so I will repeat that in the first six months of this year, for every two families that presented to homeless services, one family was found a home immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800007#E01000","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1568801100,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Question No. 36 answered with Question No. 32.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna Eile - Other Questions","time":1568801100,"counter":73,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800007#E01075"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Land Development Agency","time":1568801100,"counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800007#E01100"},{"type":"question","time":1568801100,"counter":75,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[37699\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800007#E01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the amount and location of lands transferred to the Land Development Agency to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","time":1568801100,"counter":76,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[37686\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800007#E01300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the amount and location of lands that have been transferred to the Land Development Agency to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1568801100,"counter":77,"content":"<p>At the outset I wish to correct the record of the House.

On establishment, the LDA had access to an initial tranche of eight sites that have near-term delivery potential for 3,000 new homes.  The sites concerned are: the Central Mental Hospital site, Dundrum; Hampton, Balbriggan; Hacketstown, Skerries; Devoy Barracks, Naas; the former Meath Hospital, Dublin city centre; St. Kevin's Hospital, Cork; Columb Barracks, Mullingar; and Dyke Road, Galway.<\/p>  <p>  The ownership of seven of the sites will not be formally transferred to the LDA until the Land Development Agency Bill is enacted, while the site in Galway is owned by Galway City Council and will be developed on a partnership basis.  It is intended the Bill will be published and brought before the Oireachtas later this year.  The Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, of which the Deputy is a member, will conduct pre-legislative scrutiny on the Bill soon.  The LDA is also working with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on a delivery plan for a site at Shanganagh. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that the legislation has not yet been finalised, the LDA is already working on the initial sites made available to it.  While passing the LDA legislation is a priority, it does not prevent the agency from progressing these sites.  In addition, because the sites are public lands rather than lands in private ownership, the issue of ownership and transfer is not an obstacle to early progress.  The LDA is entering into pre-sale agreements with the landowners, as appropriate, to ensure that it has full access to the sites to carry out necessary pre-construction activities.  Significant preparatory work is under way, with feasibility and planning work initiated and the first planning applications due to be submitted later this year.  Construction activity is envisaged to commence on some sites by the middle of next year, subject to the granting of planning permissions, with the first homes due to be completed by the end of next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800008#F00100","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1568801700,"counter":82,"content":"<p>The Minister's response is a fantasy.

For example, at Castlelands in Balbriggan, the local authority is rushing through a master plan in advance of a potential transfer of the land to the LDA.  The master plan was produced over and above the heads of the residents, with over-intensification of the site and inappropriate housing.  It is being rushed because the local authority wants to get it done before the land is transferred to the LDA.

An interim board and chairperson have been appointed, we have just finished the competition for a CEO and we are hiring staff.  As I noted earlier, given that public land is involved, is the transfer of land to the legal entity necessary?  The agency is already examining sites and will soon submit planning applications.  It has not needed to own the sites to do that.  The Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, for example, is in the process of being decanted but we will not wait for the site to be fully decanted before we examine what we want to do.  We are already there looking at it.  Once the site has been decanted by the Department of Health, we can move straight into construction.  That is how the LDA is approaching the matter.  This does not mean that the legislation is not a priority; of course it is.  We want to get the full capitalisation into the LDA, provide as many of the powers in respect of compulsory purchase orders and so on, and address issues with lobbying, transparency and accountability to the Oireachtas.

It is better in the long term if these extensive works are completed while the property is vacant.  This means that when the property is relet, a new family moves into a high-quality, energy-efficient home.<\/p>  <p>  Unquestionably, local authorities need to complete these upgrades and relet the properties as swiftly as possible.  It is important also that this is done to the necessary standard, but without excessive cost.  Local authorities need to have a common approach to this work, based on established best practice, which is why I welcome the work that the City and County Management Association, CCMA, is undertaking to identify and implement best practice in respect of housing stock maintenance and repairs across all local authorities.

There is a discrepancy between the figures of the local authority, in my case Dublin City Council, and those of the National Oversight and Audit Commission.  The reality is that the turnaround is slow.  I accept what the Minister of State says about certain works that have to be done, but properties undergo maintenance for an inordinate length of time before they are reallocated.  Are enough resources devoted to maintenance to ensure a speedy turnaround?  Dublin City Council has one of the highest numbers of persons on its local authority housing list.  I see a lack of urgency.  I contrast that with the speed and ease with which student accommodation is going up in Dublin 1 and 7.  We have discussed this before and I still cannot understand why this is seen as a solution.  Students are only there for eight or nine months.  That student accommodation, which consists of lovely buildings, is going up so quickly but it takes months before renovation of houses and flats begins to allow them to be given to people on the housing list. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800009#G02000","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568802900,"counter":114,"content":"<p>The issue of student accommodation is separate from this conversation.  It is a very different issue.  I am happy to discuss it with Deputy O'Sullivan because a lot of progress has been made on student accommodation.  Some 6,000 new units have been built, 6,000 are currently being built and 7,000 are planned.  Great progress has been made.  It is probably unfair to students to generalise by saying this is not positive for a neighbourhood.  A lot of work has been done with neighbourhoods and communities to ensure the new accommodation fits in.  There are quite good reports on that.  I accept that there were fears before the accommodation was built but those fears have been addressed.  Again, student accommodation and the voids programme are separate issues.  In essence, student accommodation is a form of accommodation which was needed and can be built quite quickly.  That is why we have adapted the planing process to allow it to go through planning quickly.  They are new builds on new sites, more often greenfield than brownfield sites.<\/p>  <p>  The voids programme, planned maintenance and the timelines involved are different issues.  Naturally, as a Department, we would like to have a standard timeline throughout the country and we want to achieve standards regarding the works completed on empty houses.  Local authorities take different approaches.  We have been working with the local authorities association to implement a standardised approach.  There has been considerable engagement with the Department on this over recent months and much progress has been made.  Timelines will be outlined, as will guidelines on the level of work to be carried out on houses.<\/p>  <p>  We also want to move towards planned maintenance.  At the moment, maintenance takes place in an unplanned and responsive way in most cases.  When a house becomes vacant a local authority can go in and do all the work.  Very often, this is an expensive job and it takes time.  We want to address that.  We need a planned maintenance regime and we signalled that in 2018.  That is what we are working towards.  That will help us with a faster turnaround.  More than 1,700 voids were brought back into the system last year.

I know they have to be refurbished to a certain standard.  However I have been in state-of-the-art flats and houses whose tenants have left for various reasons where everything is ripped out again.  Some common sense is needed.<\/p>  <p>  There are increasing difficulties for housing assistance payment, HAP, tenants trying to stay in the properties they are renting.  It goes back to what Deputy Boyd Barrett was talking about, namely, that vulture funds come in and take over these buildings and there is absolutely no doubt that they want to get rid of HAP tenants. <\/p>  <p>  I return to the issue of student accommodation.  I know it is not part of this question.  According to one statistic I saw recently, 79% of the student accommodation is for international students.  I would not deny these students a place to stay, but this is not helping the housing situation.  I note the ease, quickness and urgency with which student accommodation was built.

The majority of these tenancies work well and the tenants are happy.  They want something permanent in the long run and that is fine.  Some do and some do not.  HAP tenancies are often portrayed here as a major problem.  There are some cases of HAP tenancies that are not satisfactory.  We all accept that.  However the majority of cases are positive.

I do not know where or what they are but she can always bring details of cases to me and we will be happy to look at them.  We regularly engage with local authorities on this issue.  We want properties to be turned around much more quickly, in line with turnaround times in the private sector.  Many local authorities achieve that and have very good timelines, while others perform poorly.  We have worked with the local authorities on that.  Again, we want a planned maintenance approach.  Local authorities are meant to fund this from their own resources and rents.  Some will say they do not get enough from their rental schemes.  That matter is also being examined.  In the past couple of years, our voids programme has brought nearly 10,000 properties which had been left empty by previous administrations back into the system.  They are now back in use.

Overflows are designed to ensure that sewers do not back up and flood streets, businesses and homes which would be a much more serious threat to public health.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  There are other multifaceted sources of pollution that impact on bathing waters in Dublin Bay, many of which are outside Irish Water's remit, including sewer misconnections to surface water drains and streams, wildlife and dog fouling.\u00a0 In these cases, the Dublin local authorities are working together to diagnose the root causes and put programmes in place to solve these issues.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As these events happened, I was in contact with Irish Water through my officials.  My Department maintains close contact with both Irish Water and Dublin City Council on the issue.\u00a0 A meeting is being convened in the coming weeks with Irish Water, the EPA, the HSE and the Dublin local authorities to discuss bathing water in Dublin Bay.  I have signalled the need for clear communication and better early warning systems.\u00a0 The EPA has agreed to work with my Department and the other partners on examining ways of further enhancing the communication to bathers regarding potential water quality issues, including early warning systems in the event of weather alerts.  The EPA recently reported an overall improvement in the quality of our bathing waters nationally.\u00a0 Some 94% of our bathing waters meet the required standard and almost 86% are classified as either \"good\" or \"excellent\".<\/p>  <p>  It is well established that our wastewater networks and treatment plants require investment to bring them up to the required standards.  Ringsend wastewater treatment plant was originally designed to treat wastewater equivalent to a population of 1.64 million and is now overloaded.  Irish Water is undertaking a major upgrade of the plant at a cost of more than &euro;400 million to ensure the wastewater is treated to the required standard and to improve the water quality in the lower Liffey estuary.\u00a0 This staged upgrade will increase the capacity of the plant to the equivalent\u00a0 of a population of 2 million to deliver compliance with EU law by the end of 2022. \u00a0Planning permission was granted for the project in April of this year.<\/p>  <p>  Following a judgment in March 2019 by the Court of Justice of the European Union on Ireland's non-compliance with the urban wastewater treatment directive, my Department, accompanied by Irish Water, met Commission officials and proposed a programme of measures to ensure this case is resolved.\u00a0 My Department will maintain close contact with the Commission while the case remains open.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin Bay is a unique amenity for Dublin city residents and visitors.  The investment in wastewater infrastructure which this Government is providing will help protect the bay and its biosphere designation for future generations.\u00a0 Under the national development plan a total of &euro;8.8 billion will be invested in public water services over the ten-year period to 2027.  Investment in wastewater infrastructure has been prioritised in the Irish Water strategic funding plan for 2019-2014, with an estimated investment of &euro;1.9 billion planned in wastewater projects over the period, including investment in the Ringsend plant.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Dublin Bay UNESCO designated biosphere reserve comprises Dublin Bay, north Bull Island and adjacent land, including parts of Dublin city.  It is managed in partnership by communities, non-governmental organisations and\u00a0relevant public bodies at local and national level.\u00a0 Dublin Bay is the only biosphere reserve worldwide which includes a national capital city within its area.  This adds to its value and importance.<\/p>  <p>  The Dublin Bay biosphere partnership's\u00a0biodiversity conservation and research strategy 2016-2020 recognises the need for a research project to assess environmental pressures on the bay, including the contamination of rivers and bathing waters and\u00a0the impact of climate change driven effects on water pollution.\u00a0 This project is now under way in the form of the INTERREG-funded Acclimatize research project at University College Dublin.  My Department will consider the outputs from that study once it is completed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800010#H00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1568802900,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The story showed where the Government, through its agencies, has clearly failed these children and parents, and many more parents, due to the shortage of school places and the inadequacy of timely and regular access to therapies such as occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and physiotherapy.  I ask the Taoiseach to look at that ten-minute segment at the end of \"Prime Time\".  Gillian summed up the feelings of many parents of children with special needs.  She asked a question which is asked of many of us.  Why are these children not prioritised when it comes to getting into school?  Every other kid goes back to school in September.  Why is there always a problem for quite a number of children with special needs to get school places in September?  They said they had to fight every day, tooth and nail, to secure services for their children.  The father, Darren, who works with Bus &Eacute;ireann, had to cut down his week as the children with their health needs had to come out of school.  Because they came out of school, they could not get home tuition.  They had to fight for 12 months to get back home tuition.  The father could only work two days a week.  The couple's income went down, their mortgage went into arrears and they are now facing repossession.  Their plight sums up the struggle and fighting that so many parents have to go through to get services for children with special needs.  Many parents annually face these challenges in securing school places.<\/p>  <p>  Before the recess, I met the special education council to discuss about six or seven cases, not within my own constituency.  One child was 12 months outside secondary school and the mother of that child said exactly what Gillian Bolger said last night.  She also told me her other son had no difficulty in getting a placement in his second level school while her child with special needs had to be out of school for 12 months.  That is a fundamental failure on the part of Government and the Minister for Education and Skills to provide for children with special needs as they should be provided for.  It is a denial of their constitutional right.  In my view, there is a terrible inertia within Government towards this issue, which has been ongoing for some time.  Last year, the Opposition forced through an amendment to the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 to give the power to the Minister to instruct schools to provide for children with special needs, to have specific autism classes.  That is what was done in the 1990s in terms of primary education, when education was transformed in terms of access for children with special needs.  There is no plan for second level.  There is terrible inertia and a terrible lack of getting in there and getting it sorted.  I ask the Taoiseach the question Gillian Bolger asked last night.  Why are the children with special needs not prioritised above and beyond everybody else?  They are being left behind and the parents are fighting too hard every day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800012#K01000","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1568804100,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  The matter of special needs is very important and I know that, as a former Minister for Education, the Deputy has had a real and genuine interest in that area down the years.  All of us in this House are very aware of the struggles that many parents face in trying to ensure that their children receive the special education they need.  While I do not want to comment on any individual case or family, the Minister for Education and Skills has committed to examining the particular case of Kyle and Ryan to see if there is anything more that can be done more quickly for them and their family.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to special education, there are essentially three options: a place in a special class in a mainstream school; a place in a special school; or home tuition.  Sometimes those options do not work out and different options have to be tried but those three options are available.  As I think people will want to acknowledge in the interests of fairness and accuracy, the truth is that in the round, children with special educational needs are being prioritised.  There has been a huge investment in special education in recent years.  The budget for special education is nearly &euro;2 billion, with &euro;1 in every &euro;5 that we spend on education now spent assisting children with special educational needs.  That is as much as we invest in higher education.  It is a big change from five or ten years ago and shows how much we are prioritising special needs and special education.  There are 10,000 children now in special classes, three times as many as there were in 2011.  There has been a real ramping up and improvement in the provision of special places and special classes.  There are now 15,000 special needs assistants, SNAs, in our schools.  There are as many SNAs in the country as there are garda&iacute;, even though the number of garda&iacute; is going up as well.  That is a dramatic improvement on where we were eight years ago.  There are 13,000 special teachers.  This is an area that is being invested in and prioritised.  We are in a much better place than we were eight years ago.  However, there are plenty of individual cases and plenty of families who are not getting the support they need and deserve.  We will continue to work on those cases as best we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800012#K01100","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1568804100,"counter":156,"content":"<p>We can quote the global figures.  However, the number of children with special needs is growing.  We had an increase in the number of schoolgoing children generally across the board, which does result in increased provision of teachers and SNAs to meet that demographic increase.  Last year, about 850 children were availing of home tuition, which reveals an absence of school places for them.  In Youghal, for example, there is no second level unit for autism in the school catchment area.  I assume other Deputies would have other cases within their own areas.  There is no plan for second level.  In my own constituency over the last six years, about two schools have been providing for second level pupils with autism.  A teacher in Cork brought all the Deputies together and asked us to sponsor an amendment to give power to the Minister to engage with schools to provide for children with special needs.  Too many schools have no unit for children with autism.  There is no proactivity from the Minister or the Department of Education and Skills.  They are standing back, detached.  There is a policy of containment.  There is a fundamental lack of advocacy for the children within the education service.  These children deserve a place in second level without the terrible struggle, daily battles and fighting that was revealed again last night in the \"Prime Time\" piece on Gillian and Darren.  We thank them for having the courage to tell us their struggle because it shines a light on the struggles of many other parents in similar situations.

It tells us of the flawed arguments put forward by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection that in some instances are totally nonsensical.  It also gives us a very clear insight into the Department's attitude to the Data Protection Commissioner, one that can only be described as embarrassing and childish.  I am embarrassed when I think of the 470 scanned pages, without numbers, and sent illogically by the Department to the commissioner as its response to her initial draft report, like a child throwing a tantrum.  That is unprofessional and unbefitting a Department of the State.  We see a total lack of regard for taxpayers' money, which we have seen time and again from the Government.  The Department threatened the Data Protection Commissioner in October 2018 when it did not get its way when seeking more time to respond to the draft report, even though the commissioner had already extended the deadline for reply.  The Department's response was totally unwarranted and unreasonable.<\/p>  <p>  The Data Protection Commissioner referred in her report to the Minister's insistence in arguing that there is no evidence of dissatisfaction with the public services card.  Has the Minister forgotten the uproar when an elderly lady lost her pension payment for not having a card, or the delays experienced by people forced to get a public services card in order to allow them to apply for a passport or driver's licence?  Likewise, has she forgotten the people who were adopted who were denied a card unless they had an adoption certificate, or any of the numerous complaints received about the public services card by her Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade?  That hardly screams of satisfaction.<\/p>  <p>  The holding indefinitely of personal documentation belonging to those who apply for the public services card by the Department cannot be explained.  The Department's response is that the process of satisfying the Minister as to identity is not necessarily complete once the card issues, yet the legislation clearly states that a public services card will not be issued unless a Minister is satisfied as to the identity of the person.

I think it has worked extremely well.  More than 3 million people in this country now have a public services card, including me, and when people were asked what they think about the public services card they have, more than 80% of people were satisfied with it and prefer it to what they had before, namely, a number of different books and passes such as pension books, children's allowance books, free travel passes and the social welfare services card.  The public services card has replaced all of those and given people one simple card which enables them to access public services.  That is what the public services card is; it does exactly what it says on the tin.  It is what it was intended to be in 1998 and in 2005 when it was introduced in legislation.  It is there to assist people to access public services and to make public services more efficient to deliver.  It is not primarily about fraud, but it also have benefits in terms of deterrence and reducing fraud.  Its primary purpose is to make it easier for people to access the public services and benefits they are entitled to and it also makes it more efficient for Departments and agencies to provide those public services.<\/p>  <p>  The reason most people support and like the public services card is that instead of having to go through the rigmarole of going to the chemist, getting passport photos, signing them on the back, going to the Garda station, getting forms signed, filling them in, finding a utility bill and having to do that every year or every couple of years when they engage with a new Government service, they only have to do that once.  That is the big advantage with the public services card and that is the reason it has worked very well.<\/p>  <p>  In the pension case Deputy Brady mentioned, it is worth putting on the record of the House that the Data Protection Commissioner found in favour of the Department, but it was dealt with sympathetically in any case by the Minister accepting that there was a conscientious objection.<\/p>  <p>  It is not our practice to publish legal advice either from the Attorney General or from outside counsel.

However, for those who want it, that option will be available - there will be an option available for those who do not want to get a public services card.  Mark my words, people will vote with their feet and their keyboards, and the majority of those parents will use the public services card to apply for that subsidy because it makes sense.

We do not know the scale of what we are facing yet but that is no reason we should take our eyes off domestic issues.  Healthcare and health services is the biggest issue we are facing into as winter is coming.  Already, 6,386 people have been on trolleys and it is just September, with 531 people on trolleys right now in overcrowded hospital corridors.  As the Taoiseach knows, I represent Tipperary and two of the hospitals serving the county, South Tipperary General Hospital and the hospital for the mid-west, University Hospital Limerick, are often - or nearly always - the most overcrowded in the State despite the best efforts of all the staff and management.<\/p><p>The Government seems to be no closer to getting to grips with health spending either.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, who is not present, has also been deliberately avoiding scrutiny in recent months.  He had the de Buitl&eacute;ir report last February but chose to release it over the summer in order, obviously, to bury it.  Likewise, the HSE capital spending plan was buried by releasing it towards the end of the summer, nine months after the plan was in operation.  Maybe the Government thought that these reports would go unnoticed.  I believe it was cowardly behaviour by the Government, the Minister and the Department.<\/p><p>The Government claim that the HSE capital plan is not affected by the cost of the national children's hospital is incredible - it is all just profiling.  The first test of this will be if projects are going to be delivered on time.  I can tell the Taoiseach that, from speaking to numerous HSE officials, they are actually laughing at this plan.  There is no hope of the commitments and the milestones being met.  Second, there are glaring omissions in this plan.  There is little mention of the very good national maternity strategy, which we collectively all support.<\/p><p>To refer back to the most overcrowded hospital, University Hospital Limerick, where is the 96-bed unit that was promised and that is absolutely necessary, as the Minister saw with his own eyes over the summer?  This hospital suffers the worst overcrowding in the whole country.  Figures from the Department of Health show that no other hospital spends as much on agency staff - &euro;9 million in the first seven months.  The staff there are so stressed and the staff in related hospitals in Nenagh, Ennis and St. John's likewise.  There is a serious lack of staff.  They are also clearly very upset across the country at the <i>de facto<\/i>recruitment ban that is in place for front-line staff, as well as other staff.  We always hear from the HSE and the Minister that this is not a recruitment ban but it is, in effect, a recruitment ban.  I can read out lists of people who cannot get jobs in the HSE and others who, despite actually being recruited, cannot commence because of this <i>de facto<\/i>recruitment ban.  What does this say to the staff across the country and to all the patients who need their help?<\/p><p>I ask the Taoiseach the following questions.  When will this <i>de facto<\/i>recruitment ban, that is affecting front-line staff and other critical staff across the HSE, in acute services in particular, be lifted and dealt with?

All three groups face evictions by ruthless vulture funds that have absolutely no concern for their welfare but seek to evict them in order to drive up the value of the property assets they have purchased.  More than 100 individuals and families, some in Inchicore, some in Dublin 6, the Minister's own constituency, and some in my constituency, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, face evictions at the hands of these vulture funds.  All the funds are using loopholes in the residential tenancies legislation in order to justify or execute these attempted evictions, loopholes which we in the Opposition have repeatedly pointed out would be and are being used by vulture funds to evict people.  The loopholes relate to substantial refurbishment of property and sale of property.  The latest case concerns the D&uacute;n Laoghaire residents, who face the fourth separate effort by two different vulture funds to have them evicted in the past two years.  This time they think it will succeed because they have found another loophole to get around the so-called Tyrrelstown amendment, which restricts mass evictions in cases of ten or more tenants.  What do these vulture funds do?  They evict eight of the 11 tenants and then, in nine months' time, they can evict the other three.  There used to be 21 tenants in the properties affected, but slowly the vulture funds have whittled their numbers down through insecurity, fear and anxiety.  The numbers go down as the vulture funds try to get them all out.  Now 50 families on Richmond Street and Grove Park, in Dublin 6, face the same, as do residents of three blocks of apartments, Emmet Manor, Emmet Court and Emmet Lodge, in Inchicore.<\/p>  <p>  I asked the Minister for Housing what he would do to stop these ruthless, inhuman vulture funds - that is what they are.  Let us be clear about what is at stake.  They are trying to do one thing and one thing only: make people homeless to drive up the value of the assets and make profit.  They do not want to be landlords and they do not care about the tenants or the kids.  They just want to drive up the value of the assets.  What will the Government do about this?  We have put before the Government Bills to amend the Constitution to enshrine the right to housing and we have seen the House pass the Solidarity-People Before Profit anti-evictions Bill, which the Government blocks, to prevent evictions in these kinds of cases, but still the Government does nothing.  It is protecting these vultures and giving them tax breaks.  Michael Noonan invited them in in 2013 with a whole series of meetings and they are ruthlessly exploiting the housing crisis and inflicting misery on hundreds of families.  What will the Taoiseach do?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800015#N02100","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1568805900,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I think the Deputy may be conflating evictions with notices to quit.

Eviction rates in Ireland are probably among the lowest in the western world.  Leaving that aside, a crucial part of the Government's housing policy has been to enhance and strengthen the rights of tenants.  We did so by introducing rent controls.  Hundreds of thousands of people renting across the country who might have faced very high rent increases in recent years have had rent increases of between 0% and 4% instead.  That has brought a lot of relief to people who are renting.  There are also longer notice-to-quit periods such that if somebody is asked by the owner to leave a property, he or she is given much more time to find an alternative place to rent, and that has really helped people too.  As for notices to quit linked to refurbishments, it is now a requirement that the landlord offers the refurbished house or apartment to the tenant after the refurbishment takes place, which I think will make a difference too.<\/p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, has confirmed that a number of cases related to the specific matters the Deputy raised have now been referred to its independent dispute resolution process, and that is ongoing.  The RTB replaces the courts in the majority of lanlord-tenant disputes, and it is important that all parties are afforded due process and that their cases are heard in order to ensure that the dispute resolution system is legally robust.  We strongly encourage any tenant to contact the RTB to access a dispute resolution service if an issue arises.  As of 1 July of this year, the RTB has new powers of investigation and can sanction improper conduct by landlords, including any non-compliance with tenancy termination provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800015#N02400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1568805900,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Rent increases of 4% per year on top of already unaffordable rents are not doing much to control rents.  They are completely out of control and beyond the vast majority of workers' ability to pay.  The failure of all the measures the Taoiseach cited to address the threat of vulture funds trying to evict people is very evident in the case of St. Helen's Court, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, as I mentioned.  Two different vulture funds - one flipped the property to the other - have attempted four times to try to evict the people living there.  When they keep doing this it has an attrition effect and it is absolutely clear that the people behind these funds have no interest in having tenants.  They have succeeded.  In that block there are now ten empty units sitting there.  The Government should instruct D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to use compulsory purchase powers to take over those units.  Otherwise, the vulture funds will eventually drive the tenants out, as they have already driven out ten.  More to the point, the Government should close the loopholes in the law that allow these vulture funds to do this continually, but the Government is not doing so.  The vulture funds find new loopholes because the Government still allows sale or refurbishment as grounds for attempted eviction.

I took the opportunity to congratulate her on her election and I noted the excellent bilateral relations between Ireland and Denmark, including our strong co-operation as EU member states.  I updated her on the state of play with regard to Brexit and the Prime Minister confirmed Denmark's ongoing solidarity.  I spoke with President Anastasiades of Cyprus by phone on several occasions to update him on the discussions at the European Council and to seek his views, as he was unable to attend the meeting.  <\/p>  <p>  I spoke with Prime Minister Michel following the meeting and congratulated him on his election as the next President of the European Council.  On 12 July, I spoke with Ursula von der Leyen to congratulate her on her nomination as candidate for President of the European Commission.

I thank the Taoiseach.  The future of the European Union depends in many ways on the quality of the incoming Commission.  For all our sakes, we hope its members do well.  Do the Taoiseach and his party, as members of the EPP, accept Dr. von der Leyen's decision to label the Commissioner in charge of migration issues as the vice-president for protecting our European way of life?  We are all used to dog-whistle politics whereby words are used to set a certain tone.  This has a history in different European countries.  Dr. von der Leyen has nominated a Hungarian politician, Mr. Tr&oacute;cs&aacute;nyi, who has been specifically asked to carry out a number of obligations with regard to \"Neighbourhood and Enlargement\".  In Hungary, this man, while minister for justice in Viktor Orb&aacute;n's Fidesz Government, led attacks against civil society, the independence of the judiciary, and the media.  He also made giving assistance to refugees a crime under what has been called the stop George Soros law.<\/p>  <p>  It is important for us in Ireland to be aware of these developments.  It is understandable that we are deeply concerned about Brexit at the moment but this use of language and these placements of portfolios are extremely strange.  It unfortunately harks back to the language used in the 1930s, and we all know how that ended.  As a member of the EPP, does the Taoiseach feel that the language used to describe the portfolios and the appointment of the Hungarian vice-president who has a history of attacking the judiciary are appropriate?  Was there an opportunity to discuss this at the meeting of the Council?  <\/p>  <p>  Yesterday we discussed a number of questions relating to Oughterard.  In fairness, the Taoiseach has made his own view clear on that matter.  We discussed how part of the problem in Oughterard was caused by a lack of consultation with local people by the Department of Justice and Equality.  I believe we made some progress in that discussion.  What is the Taoiseach's understanding of Dr. von der Leyen's choice of title, vice-president for protecting our European way of life?

Astonishingly, Commissioner Hogan told us that the Mercosur deal would protect food and environmental standards.  Not even the Government believes that.

Regarding President-elect von der Leyen, she was nominated unanimously by the European Council, albeit with one abstention by her own country of Germany.  She has now secured the majority support of the European Parliament, and only did so with very strong support from the EPP, to which my party is affiliated, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, to which the Labour Party is affiliated, and Renew Europe, to which Fianna F&aacute;il is affiliated.  I particularly want to thank the social democrats and the Labour Party and Fianna F&aacute;il and Renew Europe for helping to ensure that President-elect von der Leyen will, indeed, be President von der Leyen.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to individual Commissioners and their portfolios, that is actually not a matter for the European Council of prime ministers and presidents.  It is a decision that the President-elect will make herself.  However, each individual Commissioner will be subject to parliamentary ratification in the European Parliament, and I have no doubt that many MEPs will want to scrutinise their appointments as individuals but also their portfolios, what exactly their roles will be and what the various titles mean.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding Mercosur, political agreement has been reached between the EU and the Mercosur countries after about 20 years of negotiations.  However, it is only a political agreement and it will be at least two years before there is a legal text in front of us.  Once there is a legal text, we are going to have to consider it very carefully to see how ratification will proceed.  The Government has committed to carrying out an independent, comprehensive economic assessment and, indeed, an environmental assessment to assess the overall implications for Ireland.  As I have indicated before, I would not support a free trade agreement that is not in the interests of the Irish economy and Irish jobs as a whole.  We have both defensive and offensive interests, as is the case in all trade negotiations.  We know that the beef sector could be very exposed.  The agreement provides for an additional 99,000 tonnes of tariff-rate quota phased in over five years, which is clearly more than we would have wanted, but it is important to say that this is having no impact on beef prices at the moment, as it does not kick in for many years, if it ever does.  Currently, 270,000 tonnes are already imported into the EU from Mercosur countries, so it would mean a 7.5% tariff on just over one third of that.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of our offensive interests, Ireland currently exports roughly &euro;2 billion in goods and services to the Mercosur region, a region with 260 million people now.  We believe that trade could double over the next decade, with particular sectors benefitting like the dairy sector, the drinks industry, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, industrial goods and Irish small and medium-sized enterprises.  We believe that it is absolutely crucial that we have safeguards in place for labour standards and environmental standards, and it is intended to write into the agreement specifically that Mercosur countries must honour and not depart from the Paris accord.  As President Macron and I have indicated, it is our view that Mercosur is off should they do so.  We will of course work to protect the interests of Irish beef farmers so that they can compete on a level playing field when it comes to product standards, traceability, the environment and climate action.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Calleary was absolutely correct in saying that there was a lot more happening on the European stage than Brexit - issues such as climate action and issues such as trade - but it is a reality that Brexit takes up so much Government time that we do not have the time to focus on those issues as much as we would like.

I was accompanied by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton.  The First Ministers from Scotland and Wales, along with Heads of Administration from the Crown dependencies, also attended the summit.<\/p>  <p>  The discussion at the summit covered important political developments for administrations since the last summit in November.  The discussion focused largely on the implications of Brexit, particularly for relationships across the islands.  The council also discussed the current political situation in Northern Ireland and I again stated my regret that Northern Ireland, without the Executive restored, was not represented at the British-Irish Council anymore.<\/p>  <p>  Building on the shared goal of decarbonising our economies, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, took part in a thematic discussion to explore how we could best facilitate the transition by modernising our energy systems.

The council also received an update on the British-Irish Council marine litter event held in Glasgow in February.<\/p>  <p>  I took the opportunity to have bilateral discussions with Mr. Lidington, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and the new First Minister of Wales, Mr. Mark Drakeford, who was attending his first summit meeting.

We also spoke about the developments in Westminster and Brussels.

I am not sure how the Taoiseach and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, Deputy Bruton, felt about Ireland being indirectly referred to as a dependent territory of the Crown in the communiqu&eacute; issued by the council after the summit.  I am sure the Scottish First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, may also have had something to say about that.

Sadly, the actions of the new British Government have not matched the intent signalled by the Council.<\/p>  <p>  The June summit marked the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the council.  Strengthened relationships at this turbulent time would be welcomed by us all.  However, the reality is very different to the sentiments that were expressed.

The British Prime Minister's madman-theory Brexit tactics are fundamentally undermining the agreement.  We need to be clear that Brexit is incompatible with the agreement and the views of the majority in the North who wish to remain in the EU.  Given that the council is a body established under the Good Friday Agreement, it is disappointing that there was not a deeper discussion at its summit of Brexit and its implications for advancing positive and practical relationships among the people of the islands.

Neither Scotland nor Ireland have an interest in coming into conflict over fishing rights around Rockall, particularly given that Ireland and Scotland are currently so aligned on some bigger-picture questions.  However, it is the case that in the event of no deal, there will be difficulties around fisheries as EU vessels, including Irish vessels, will lose access to UK waters and UK vessels will lose access to our waters, which could be very disruptive.

As all Members are aware, the term &quot;common travel area&quot; is a misnomer because what is involved relates to far more than travel.  We are talking about what is almost a form of common citizenship that exists across the seven jurisdictions.  The British-Irish Council could become the body to take that forward and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference could be deepened to ensure that the Irish sovereign Government and the UK sovereign Government are in contact in a structured way with the secretariat.

The constituency includes four large towns, each with a population approaching or in excess of 20,000, namely, Naas, Celbridge, Leixlip and Maynooth.  A number of other towns in the constituency are growing rapidly as part of the effort to accommodate the need for housing.  With this comes the necessity to augment Garda strength in all of the towns concerned for a great number of reasons.  The first of these is the proposed new policing regime, which is the subject of some discussion and which we should welcome as it proposes deployments of a modern nature.<\/p>  <p>  We must also accept that, as the population grows, petty and more serious crime can increase, as we know from other areas of the country.  Recognising that fact, we have suffered a reduction in Garda strength throughout County Kildare in recent years.  As with every other part of the country, we could do nothing about it and had to accept what was being applied everywhere else.  However, the population in County Kildare is growing much more rapidly than most other parts of the country.  In view of that, it is now important to prioritise the extent to which Garda strength can be augmented.<\/p>  <p>  I should mention that I live in Maynooth, a university town, which has an additional 16,000 to 17,000 people during the academic year.  That is not to suggest for one moment that the students are unruly or need extra policing.  The fact, however, is that they add to the existing population, which creates a greater need for security to protect the increasing population.  I do not wish to labour the subject other than to say that this is an urgent matter and I hope the Minister of State, who I am glad to welcome to the House, can address the issue in the short term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800023#BB00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1568810700,"counter":351,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, who sends his apologies, I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  I remind the House that, by law, the deployment of Garda resources is solely the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner and his management team.  The Minister is assured, however, that the distribution of Garda resources is constantly monitored, taking into account all relevant factors, including population, as the Deputy outlined, and new and emerging crime trends.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister emphasises that working with communities to tackle public disorder and reduce anti-social behaviour remains a key priority for the Garda.  The Garda Commissioner has publicly spoken about the protection of the most vulnerable and has highlighted that his priority is a policing model that will provide the best outcomes for communities.  This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy specifically mentioned County Kildare.  The Minister is informed by the Garda authorities that, as of 31 August 2019, there were 393 garda&iacute; assigned to the Kildare division.  This represents a 9.2% increase on Garda resources allocated to this division since the end of 2017.  There are also 17 Garda reserves and 35 Garda civilian staff attached to the Kildare division as of 31 August.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation.  Since the reopening of the Garda College in 2014, approximately 2,800 new garda&iacute; have attested and been assigned to mainstream policing duties around the country.  Of these, 118 have been assigned to the Kildare division and 200 more garda&iacute; are due to attest before the end of the year.  At the same time, record levels of recruitment of Garda staff is allowing for the redeployment of garda&iacute; to operational policing duties.  As a result, there are now more than 14,200 garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by more than 2,600 staff.  This level of accelerated recruitment ensures that the Government's plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 garda&iacute;, remains on track.  Additional recruitment of Garda staff will allow the Garda Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained garda&iacute; from administrative duties to front-line policing in 2019.  The Minister is of the view that the injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of garda&iacute; to deliver a visible, effective and responsive policing service to communities across all Garda divisions, including the Kildare division.<\/p>  <p>  The ongoing process of Garda reform will also assist through efficiencies in a range of areas, including ongoing civilianisation, examination of non-core duties and reform of Garda structures.  In practical terms, this will mean less duplication and bureaucracy at senior levels, more garda&iacute; on the ground and chief superintendents with greater decision-making power in their divisions.  It will also include a strengthened focus on community engagement.  These positive developments are underpinned by unprecedented Government investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, amounting to a budget of &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, as well as &euro;92 million capital investment this year.  In addition, a total of &euro;10 million has been made available for the purchase and fit-out of Garda vehicles in 2019.  The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that this allocation will be used for purchase and fit-out of more than 300 new vehicles for operational use this year.  As of 30 August, a total of 56 vehicles were allocated to Kildare, the division about which the Deputy inquired specifically.  The Minister hopes that this information is of reassurance to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800023#BB00300","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1568810700,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and his colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, for the positive nature of the reply.  One of the areas that needs to be emphasised is the need for juvenile liaison officers.  Given that we have a large population of young people who are not going anywhere and will remain young for some time, it is necessary to introduce all the aids we can to assist the Garda in interfacing and interacting with young people who may be at risk of falling into crime, even if it is petty crime.<\/p>  <p>  On community policing, there have been some recent additions in this regard in north Kildare, which I welcome.  However, more community policing and a community garda is needed in every town and village.  Continuity is also required.  Special emphasis must be placed on areas where there have been repeated reports of anti-social crime.  People in certain housing estates complain to us from time to time about this type of crime which, while petty in nature is hugely worrying for the people who live in them.  While the crime is not serious, it shows disrespect for other people, many of whom are elderly, and their property.  We need to reassure the general public that the establishment and the Garda are on their side and are ready, willing and able, with sufficient numbers and resources to attend to their queries as they arise.

We have pulled together an advisory group, which is doing some very interesting work and examining different approaches and initiatives in this area.<\/p>  <p>  At the heart of the concerns expressed today is the relationship between communities and their local garda&iacute; and the Garda resources required in each division to provide an effective policing service.  Clearly, Garda visibility is also very important and the Government remains committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.<\/p>  <p>  Last month, the Minister welcomed the Garda Commissioner's announcement of the new operating model for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, long-recommended by independent policing specialists, including the Garda Inspectorate and the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  The new model will bring very significant improvements to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na structures, processes and services.  This will mean less duplication and bureaucracy at senior levels and chief superintendents will be given more decision-making powers in their divisions.  The shifting of the power of decision-making from Garda headquarters to chief superintendents will bring the latter closer to the communities they serve, ensuring a more localised and responsive police service reflecting local needs.  It will increase the number of front-line garda&iacute; and maximise the organisation's operational impact at local level to deliver an improved, more consistent and highly visible policing service in communities.  This delivers on some of the key recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, namely, that garda&iacute; should be visible on the front line and engaged in community policing, as suggested by the Deputy.<\/p><p>The changes come at a time of record investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na: &euro;1.6 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2019 as well as capital investment amounting to &euro;92 million this year.

The substantial investment will allow the accelerated recruitment programme to continue in tandem with the deploying of new and leading edge technology to support our front-line garda&iacute; in carrying out their work to deliver a visible effective and responsive police service to communities across all Garda divisions, including the important Kildare division in 2019 and future years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800023#BB00500","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Company Liquidations","time":1568811300,"counter":355,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800024#CC00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1568811300,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the recent liquidation of Avara Shannon Pharmaceutical Services Limited and, in particular, the plight of the 114 workers.  As the Minister of State well knows, and this should be well known to many, the company is operating at Shannon since 1976 under various guises and different ownerships.  Prior to its takeover in 2016 by Avara, it was owned by the very well known Belgian based UCB, a highly reputable and well-respected company.  However, as of 29 July, the site is in full liquidation.  There are joint liquidators on site, which is somewhat unusual and adding somewhat to the concerns.  It is in liquidation and efforts are being made to try to find a pathway towards the continuation of the company in some form.<\/p>  <p>  The real concern is that the Shannon facility and its workers have contributed hugely to the local economy since 1976 and it is with disbelief that these workers have been informed, as a result of the liquidation, that the terms and conditions that were available under the transfer of undertaking will not apply and, as such, the terms and conditions, particularly the recognition of their service on having to leave the employment - they would have expected six and a half weeks, together with two weeks statutory redundancy &ndash; will not be paid.  After that amount of commitment to the company, they will be left with just the statutory level of redundancy.  That is a major blow to these workers and to the efforts they have made to sustain this company through thick and thin.<\/p>  <p>  The concerns I have are rather varied but, in particular, I am concerned that in 2016, when it disposed of its site to Avara, UCB did not do the appropriate level of due diligence.  I do not know what the transfer was at the time but I believe it was passed for a relatively small amount of money.  While that might have allowed UCB to discharge its responsibility to the site and the environmental management of a very complex site, it takes no regard of the conditions and terms under which the workers are employed.  In this liquidation process they are now left with statutory redundancy, which will have an enormous impact on their livelihoods and have wider implications, as the Minister of State will be well aware, for the wider community.<\/p>  <p>  I am of the view that UCB still retains some responsibility, whether it be through its corporate social responsibility or whatever, and there is some basis for my making that claim.  A similar situation happened in the UK, where AstraZeneca, another large pharmaceutical company, disposed of a manufacturing site there also to Avara and where the liquidation took place with Avara on that site.  AstraZeneca through the efforts of workers was forced to recognise it had not done the appropriate level of due diligence before it passed or transferred the operations to Avara and, in that instance, I understand it kicked in about &euro;12 million to support the workers and give them the full value of their expected terms and conditions, and that is what we want here.  We want UCB to step up to the plate and to recognise it passed on a very considerable undertaking for very little and did not give due consideration to the impact that would have if it did not all work out.  Clearly, for something to collapse in such a short period highlights to me that Avara was poorly structured, poorly capitalised and was not in a position to take on the burden of responsibility that UCB transferred to it.  That is something for which UCB must answer.<\/p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister of State and the Government to use their best efforts and endeavours to get UCB to accept its corporate responsibility.  It is difficult in that it is not located here but there are channels through our partners in Europe and through European legislation that should force UCB to make good on the commitments under which these people worked for such a long period and gave such valued service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800024#CC00300","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1568811300,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue.  Both of us are very familiar with what is happening with Avara in Shannon and I am sure both of us have been in contact with the workers.<\/p>  <p>  First, it is important to point out that our thoughts are with the workers.  It is a very difficult period for the employees experiencing this uncertainty, particularly in the liquidation process.  That must be noted.<\/p>  <p>  I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty.  The Deputy's question in tabling this matter refers to threatened redundancies at Avara pharmaceuticals in Shannon.  The Minister, Deputy Doherty, has informed me that, as yet, she has received no official notification from the company of collective redundancies.  I am sure the Deputy hopes, as I do, that it does not come to that situation.  It is important that every effort be made to save the company, Avara, and these jobs in Shannon.  I can assure the Deputy, and I note Deputy Harty is present, that every effort is being made by the liquidator to ensure we can save the jobs in that company at this time.  I do not want to say any more about that now.  It is important we save those 114 jobs.<\/p>  <p>  I will go through the process with the Deputy in case it comes to that but hopefully it will not.  The Protection of Employment Act 1977 imposes a number of obligations on employers who are proposing collective redundancies, including an obligation under sections 9 and 10 to engage in an information and consultation process with employees' representatives and to provide certain information relating to the proposed redundancies.  Section 11A of the Act provides that, where an employee believes the employer to be in breach of sections 9 or 10, they may pursue a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission.  It is also an offence under section 11 where an employer fails to comply with sections 9 or 10.  There is also an obligation under section 12 which makes it mandatory on employers proposing a collective redundancy to notify the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social  Protection of the proposed collective redundancy.<\/p>  <p>  An employer is prohibited from issuing any notice of redundancy during the mandatory employee information and consultation period, required by the 1977 Act, and until 30 days have elapsed from the date on which the Minister has been notified.  For the avoidance of doubt, the 30-day mandatory information and consultation process and the aforementioned 30-day period from the date of notification to the Minister may run concurrently.  However, since it will not be possible to complete the notification to the Minister until the identity of the employees' representatives for the purpose of the information and consultation process has been established, it is conceivable that both periods may not be entirely concurrent.<\/p>  <p>  In the first instance, it is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy and other wage related entitlements to eligible employees.  However, the Social Insurance Fund provides a safety net for employees in situations where the employer has become insolvent and the company is to be liquidated.  It is the liquidator's responsibility to seek, on behalf of employees, payment from the redundancy payments scheme in respect of statutory redundancy and from the insolvency payments scheme in respect of wage related entitlements.<\/p>  <p>  An eligible employee is entitled to two weeks statutory redundancy payment for every year of service, plus a bonus week.  Compensation is based on the worker's length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.  In order to qualify for a statutory redundancy payment, an employee must have at least two years continuous service, be in employment which is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts and be over the age of 16.<\/p>  <p>  Entitlements covered under the insolvency payments scheme include arrears of wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice and certain pension contributions.

The concern I have is that, as recently as 2016, UCB discharged its very significant responsibility for very little money on that site and sailed into the wind.

I am aware the Minister of State, with his knowledge, has been in contact with the workers as indeed has Deputy Harty.  Deputy Carey has been on the site as well, as I have, and has spoken to many of the workers on an ongoing basis.  We want to see a future for that facility.  We want to see people employed there.  In our absolute desire and our requirement to keep employment there, we cannot allow the terms and conditions to be set aside for the workers who will not have employment in any new operation that might be there.  We must be mindful of those and their families.

The company is potentially viable.  The company is only operating at 30% to 40% of capacity.  From that point of view, I believe there is a future for this company.

Areas, such as Kildare, where there is continued and sustained growth will be in the forefront, as will places such as Meath and Wicklow, Fingal, places around the suburbs of Cork etc.  The intention is to identify those pressures and to provide sites, and ultimately schools, in advance of the need.  Obviously, that requires the recruitment of staff and all that goes with a school.  While it is not possible to have a secondary school located in every town or village, it will, therefore, be necessary for students to travel.<\/p>  <p>  We have a school transport system and while each child in theory is entitled to a school place on a school bus if the family has a medical card, those who do not have such a card are described as concessionary passengers - the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, will know that more than any of us - which means they must pay on the bus.  The problem is not with the payment; it is with the availability of places.<\/p>  <p>  When places are insufficient, what occurs is Bus &Eacute;ireann randomly selects who gets a place and who does not.  It is a lottery and often people hear the position at a very late stage.  I talked to the Minister of State over the summer about this and there has been some progress.  I have talked to several families who had their school transport on a concessionary basis for several years, find themselves now to have that withdrawn for all of their children, paid their fee in April or May, and then get the money returned in late August only days before they have to make arrangements and juggle work etc.  New pupils, for example, who are also on it on a concessionary basis, also need school transport places.  One can see the kind of resentment in communities that is created.  I am sure the Minister of State knows it well.  If there is no new funding, for example, then growing areas will always be the ones that are under most pressure.  If there is a new school development and there are new teachers, it is self-evident that there needs to be additional funding factored in to account for this.<\/p>  <p>  It is not always true that someone in a family with a medical card is automatically entitled to a place.  In my area, it is not unusual to be fighting for school places.  Section 29 appeals are par for the course.  It is pressure all the way in relation to school places.  Essentially, we had 19 youngsters for whom there was no accommodation in one particular area.  For example, one family applied for the secondary school in Clane.  The school was oversubscribed and there were 20 on the waiting list.  Then they applied to Leixlip, Maynooth and Celbridge.  When they got a school place in Maynooth, they withdrew the section 29 appeal but, because the child is not going to the school closest to the family, the child is considered a concessionary place on the school bus despite the fact that this family has a medical card.  The child would not have got into that school because there were no places available.  That seems extremely unfair because they have no choice in the matter.<\/p><p>Children are eligible for transport if they reside not less than 4.8 km from the school they are attending, so long as it is the nearest education centre as determined by the Department of Education and Skills.  That rule in its own right needs to be dealt with.  Of the 19 pupils, ten still do not have school places.  It is impossible for parents to juggle if they are trying to work as well.  This issue has to be resolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800025#DD00700","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568812500,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I have asked the Department to deal with the query concerning her area.  The school transport scheme is a significant operation.  It is managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of my Department.  We are moving 117,500 children twice a day all over the country, including over 13,000 children with special needs.  There are 5,000 vehicles in use per day, for primary and post-primary, covering more than 100 million km.  The cost is now in excess of &euro;200 million.  The school transport scheme was originally put in place for eligible children and the requisite distance was 3.2 km for children travelling to primary school and, as the Deputy rightly says, 4.8 km for children travelling to post-primary schools and children with special needs.  When I took over the system, where there was a space on a bus, for example, if there was a 25-seater bus with 20 eligible children on it, rather than have the bus leave with five empty seats, we put concessionary passengers on it.  When that started, there were 300 concessionary tickets.  There are now almost 25,000 concessionary tickets, even though the scheme was put in place for eligible and special needs children.  There is no eligible child left without transport, as far as I know, with the exception of little hiccups in the system.  My staff and I were in the office during the summer until two or three o'clock some mornings trying to get special needs children on buses.  We sometimes need carers with Garda clearance for special needs children.  It was a horrendous job for the staff to have to do.  All children who are eligible for school transport are getting school transport or the rural grant.  There is no special needs child as far as I know today who is not getting school transport.<\/p>  <p>  Our problem, as the Deputy rightly says, is with the concessionary children or the second year of school.  We have done two reviews of the scheme.  A value for money review was undertaken a number of years ago independently, which showed that the cost was &euro;100 for a primary school child, &euro;220 for post-primary and a maximum of &euro;650 for a family.  That distance in a car would cost well in excess of &euro;1,500 per year.  Since I became Minister of State, we have not increased the cost to families; although the families pay &euro;14 million, the State carries the rest.  The problem we face is that this comes out of the education budget.  There is not a separate budget for school transport.  The budget has dramatically increased every year.  We are facing into next year with a budget of between &euro;210 million and &euro;212 million just to keep the scheme afloat.  This year alone, we have extra concessionary passengers, special needs passengers and eligible children.  We will have the same next year.<\/p>  <p>  We also did a review of concessionary passengers. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform insisted that buses be taken off the route or the price be increased.  I prevented that from happening two years in a row but we are now facing into a crisis.  Every year, we require more money from the education budget.  We put an extra &euro;1 million out of the Department of Education and Skills into the scheme this year.  It requires another &euro;4 million to take all concessionary passengers which, if I had my way, I would do from within the scheme and everybody would be cleared.  However, we would be facing a crisis again next year with more concessionary passengers, more eligible children and more special needs children because of extra schools and extra pupils going to school.<\/p>  <p>  We are doing our utmost in a situation where we are carrying nearly 28,000 concessionary children on a scheme that was originally set up for eligible and special needs children.  We are reviewing it and looking for extra money.  The extra money would cover all the concessionary tickets and also deal with the second year of school.  We are in negotiations on the next budget to see if we can get the extra &euro;4 million needed.  We are dealing with the particular case raised by the Deputy in her constituency and should have an answer for her next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800026#EE00200","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1568812500,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  I know some parents will not thank me for saying this, but I have certainly had parents say they would be willing to pay more.  Some people are in a position to pay more while others are not as they may be only above the limit for the medical card.  If it is a question of having to leave work for people to get their children safely to school, there is no choice in the matter.  I am hearing about parents who are driving behind a bus to bring their children to school and they can see spaces on it.  It may well be that there is not a full uptake on the particular day but it may be worth doing a review of that.  If there is spare capacity, it would be unconscionable.  If we are going to have very large schools in a regional context as opposed to village settings, we have to factor in the need to travel to school.  If two adults in a family have to go out to work to pay the mortgage, the State has an obligation to provide a school transport service.  I can understand an odd person falling through the cracks but when groups of people are affected, it is very difficult for people to take.<\/p>  <p>  I would like the Minister of State to deal with the case of a child who was turned down for a particular school because it was oversubscribed.  I will send him on the details.  I do not know why the child would then be counted as a concessionary passenger if the family has a medical card.  The child should be entitled to a seat on the school bus without it being concessionary.  There were no places in the nearest school, which is typical in my area.  I know the same thing is replicated in other areas but Kildare is under particular development pressure which will create new needs because we are not in a static environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800026#EE00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1568812500,"counter":368,"content":"<p>On the issue of seeing spaces on buses, about 9% or 10% of people who pay for school transport do not take it up.  It is very difficult to deal with that.  If people pay for it, they may feel they will take a chance on driving their kids to school anyway.  We have taken legal views on that and it is not within our remit to return the money to these families and request that they give us back the seat.  That cannot be done.  It is a legally binding agreement so we have some difficulties.  The difficulties we have at present are with concessionary tickets.  The scheme was put in place for eligible and special needs children.  In the three years that I have been dealing with it, I know of no special needs child who did not get school transport.  I know of no eligible child who did not get the rural grant or school transport.  We are reviewing the scheme regarding concessionary tickets but that means providing extra money.  In the case of a 25-seater bus with 20 eligible children and five children with concessionary seats, if an eligible or special needs child makes themselves available from a village, town or city, we are legally obliged to put that child on the bus and remove a child with a concessionary ticket.  I do not like doing that.  Often that is very painful and difficult but we are obliged under legislation to put the eligible or special needs child on the bus.  I have never turned down a meeting with any Deputy, mayor, councillor or family.  I have done my best to facilitate as many people as I can.  The system is coming apart at the seams.

In more recent years, its derelict, vacant units and outward appearance disheartened locals and was an unwelcome sight for visitors to Ballymun and those who drove through it.  Ballymun shopping centre became a stark reminder of the failure of the costly regeneration project which cost more than &euro;1 billion.  The community in Ballymun deserves better.  The derelict site does not reflect the spirit of the closely knit community of the area.  The regeneration project was supposed to be about improving people's lives and their environment as well as providing proper housing.  It was also about enhancing the quality of life of people and their environs.<\/p>  <p>  The redevelopment of the shopping centre was central to the 1997 Ballymun regeneration plan.  Treasury Holdings presented a plan for the shopping centre.  The new complex, which was to be the main shopping facility for the suburb's 18,000 residents, was due to be built in 2005.  In 2009, Treasury Holdings secured planning permission for Springcross, which was the old shopping centre site.  The plans were to deliver an &euro;800 million development.  This development was to include an 11-screen cinema, a bowling alley, a public library, a cr&egrave;che, restaurants and public houses as well as more than 70 shops, offices and apartments.  Construction was to begin in 2010.  However, as a result of the economic crash, the town centre lands became part of NAMA's portfolio of loans before any development began.<\/p>  <p>  Many retailers in the centre closed in 2014 and the shopping centre suffered a major blow when it lost Tesco, its most important tenant.  Dublin City Council, which is now the major stakeholder, has at last begun the process of demolishing the 50-year old shopping centre.  If matters are handled correctly, we will be in a position to revitalise the centre of Ballymun and make it once more the heartbeat of the community.  The new development could once again become a central hub linking the communities of Ballymun.  Sinn F&eacute;in will not support any development on this site that does not have at its core the idea and philosophy that this site is crucial to making this area once again the heart of the community of Ballymun.  Dublin City Council should deliver on the promises and aspirations of the regeneration project.  Central to that is making this site once more the centre of a vibrant and growing community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800027#FF00300","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speech","time":1568813100,"counter":372,"content":"<p>Over the lifetime of Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, some &euro;211 million is being made available under the national regeneration programme to support the delivery of more than 1, 000 new social housing homes.  Together with providing a significant number of new homes, the projects seek to address the causes of disadvantage in these communities through a holistic programme of physical, social and economic regeneration.<\/p>  <p>  The Ballymun regeneration programme, which predates Rebuilding Ireland, spanned many years, with departmental funding first arising in 1999 from the 1997 plan to which the Deputy referred.  This substantial programme, which comprised 24 projects, is now complete.  The overall programme is estimated to have cost approximately &euro;972 million.  Funding of &euro;775.3 million was provided via the then Department of the Environment and Local Government.  Largely completed by the end of 2013, the Ballymun programme represents the largest regeneration initiative undertaken in the State.  The State's investment resulted in almost 2,000 new replacement homes being constructed for the former residents of the original blocks of flats.  An additional 1,350 homes were provided via private sector investment.  In addition, the programme provided state-of-the-art community facilities, such as the Axis Theatre, along with neighbourhood centres to improve services.  In recent years, the regeneration activity has focused on improving the area's environmental performance with various green initiatives, new parks and playing pitches.  Enterprise and employment generation has focused on the main street and retail parks, with many new employment opportunities created for residents of the area.<\/p>  <p>  I fully concur with Deputy's Ellis's point on the central role of the shopping centre in completing the regeneration of Ballymun.  The redevelopment of the shopping centre is considered to be the key remaining element in the regeneration of the Ballymun area.  This significant main street site comprising 3.2 ha is zoned for district centre mixed use in both the city development plan and the Ballymun area plan.  Dublin City Council wishes to obtain sustainable mixed use viable development that will maximise the site, use its full potential and complement the extensive State and local authority investment in Ballymun's regeneration to date.  Following a competitive procurement process earlier this year, a demolition contractor was selected and the contractor commenced work on the site on 9 September 2019.  The site is being secured in advance of commencing the demolition works, which will take approximately six months to complete.  Future use of the site will involve a public consultation process.<\/p>  <p>  A regeneration project moves through a number of phases throughout its life.  The initial master planning stage is followed by demolition works, enabling works, refurbishment and consolidation works in some cases and then construction.  A regeneration project must extend beyond physical redevelopment alone.  In order to be successful and sustainable over the long term, a regeneration project requires the rebuilding of a community and the strengthening of community bonds.  Taken together, the provision of state-of-the-art community facilities, large-scale housing regeneration and new development and support for local enterprise and employment through various social regeneration initiatives ensured the success so far of the Ballymun regeneration programme.  The redevelopment of the shopping centre site will complete the regeneration of this area.  It is expected, following the completion of the demolition works, which are expected to take six months, that the city council will engage in extensive consultation with stakeholders and the wider public to ensure that the objectives the Deputy outlined are met for the community of Ballymun and those areas around Ballymun that will benefit from the regeneration of the shopping centre site.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800027#FF00400","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1568813100,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

They should be able to shop in their own community where they meet their neighbours, have a coffee or drop into the public house to have a drink - all the normal things people expect to do in a place with such a large population.

The motion addresses many of the key difficulties facing the sector.  It was put down before the talks took place last weekend and I know those talks addressed some of the issues that the motion raises.  However, it is not the first time Fianna F&aacute;il has come before the D&aacute;il with Private Members' motions.  Indeed, last March, we had a very similar motion once again drawing attention to the massive crisis in our beef sector.  This is a crisis that has been brewing for many years and one the Government has continued to ignore and not address.  If we had seen more proactive engagement by the Government in regard to many of the issues that are at play, we might not have got to the crisis stage we are currently in, which has led farmers onto the protest line and resulted in the protracted situation which has been continuing since 28 July.<\/p>  <p>  Underlying the current problem is the issue of price and the need for an income for farmers but, alongside that, there is a total lack of transparency in our beef sector which has not been addressed for many years.  Farmers feel the Government has simply not been listening to them.  Various representations have been made, either by ourselves in D&aacute;il motions or by farming organisations and farmers, with regard to, for example, the lack of transparency around the 30-month rule, the four-movement rule or the seven-day residency, or around the need for a review of the QPS grid, but these have continuously fallen on deaf Government ears.  Likewise, when farmers got into trouble during last year's fodder crisis, the Government did not respond or react promptly to assist farmers, as it had failed to respond to the previous grain crisis.  They listened to the Taoiseach, one of whose main contributions to the beef debate was to suggest people should eat less beef in order to improve their carbon footprint.  Just a couple of months ago, to put the icing on the cake, we saw the Government not hold the line at European level in regard to allowing a Mercosur deal to be proposed which would see beef coming into an already oversupplied European market from South America.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, the Minister, Deputy Creed, and all of the farming organisations last weekend in the marathon talks and the effort that was put into that.  I outlined last night in the D&aacute;il how the Government could and should have been much more hands-on at various times during the crisis to get people into talks.  Nonetheless, we now have a situation where the seven farm organisations have signed up and agreed, along with the meat processing sector, to the agreement made at the weekend.  I know everybody is giving time and space to the farm organisations to have the necessary conversations with farmers across the country, and to explain the merits of that agreement and how it can be a starting point and key pillar to build upon in order to bring about transparency in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  Everyone is agreed that the continuation of the current situation is undoubtedly impacting on and hurting the sector as a whole and is now affecting markets internationally.  We see today the comments on the domestic situation affecting supermarket shelves and restaurants.  Coming out of this, the factories have to understand that they must repair their relationship with farmers.  There must be transparency and farmers must get a fair price.  There is currently engagement across the country in regard to factories planning to reopen but they need to offer fair base prices to farmers with a view to restarting the kill.  However, we all acknowledge it is essential that the protests finish and that everyone comes together in order to resolve the situation and avoid further damage over the coming period.<\/p>  <p>  The motion calls for the Minister and the Government to go to Europe to get further funding to help compensate for the losses that have been experienced over the last weeks and months.  We had the BEAM scheme, which was fed to farmers before the local elections as being a panacea in terms of the losses they had experienced but which has since then turned out to be a very different kettle of fish.  The 5% stock reduction requirement has certainly seen a situation where many farmers feel it is not suitable to their needs, is simply making the wrong asks of them and is not dealing with the key issue of addressing the losses they have experienced up to this point.  We have seen no sign from the Minister or the Taoiseach in terms of getting additional funding from Europe to cover the period from May up to now, a period in which farmers have lost more money and prices were poorer then previously.<\/p>  <p>  We also have not seen any initiative from the Minister in regard to trying to improve the situation with regard to live exports.  Only a small number of weanlings are currently going to the live export trade to Libya; more need to go and more initiatives from the Government are needed.  We also saw the Government failure earlier this year in regard to maximising preparations for the live cattle trade through Cherbourg and the lack of facilities in place around that.<\/p>  <p>  The message from Fianna F&aacute;il is that it is time the Government woke up and started listening to farmers and started addressing these issues.  Our motion outlines some key further policies and measures the Government needs to take to assist with the situation.  We are asking that, once and for all, the Government listens and takes this on board and once this motion is passed tonight, actually follows through and implements it to bring about the necessary improvement to the lot of farmers to ensure they get fair play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800028#GG00600","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1568814300,"counter":380,"content":"<p>It is historic that this is the second day in a row that beef farmers' plight has been top of the agenda in the D&aacute;il.  I had a number of calls this morning from farmers who are part of these new producer groups that have been established to try to negotiate with factories.  They tell me that factories are refusing to negotiate with them on price.  If we are to get our industry back on any kind of level playing field, processors need to wake up and realise that they must respect farmers and commit to what they agree to.  If it is the case that these newly-formed producer groups are not being recognised by the processors, we have a serious problem.  As Deputy McConalogue stated, the lack of live exports is a key issue and one that I lay squarely at the doors of the Minister and Bord Bia.  Live exports have always been the safety valve to put competition into the trade.  With the abolition of quotas, we knew that there would be a lot of extra stock.  We had the farce last spring of there not being enough space in Cherbourg for calves leaving this country.  Again, only two entities can be held responsible for that, namely, the Department and Bord Bia.  It will soon be October but I have not yet seen evidence of that shambles being rectified in time for next spring.  That must be done immediately.  We have no older cattle leaving the country alive.  We have had numerous announcements of market after market being opened for Irish stock but, unfortunately, no cattle are leaving.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a great deal of talk about the grid being reformed.  I did not agree with the grid when it was introduced and I still do not agree with it.  It needs to be reformed, and the O= grade needs to be used to set the base price rather than having a grid that allows processors to exploit farmers and pay the lowest possible price.  As Deputy McConalogue indicated, we need a crisis fund.  We need a fund that will be fair to farmers rather than something similar to the one introduced prior to the local elections.  That fund was discriminatory and excluded some finishers from claiming compensation.  We should also recognise that producers of stores and weanlings are also losing significant money.  The crisis fund must address losses borne by all beef farmers and there must be a fair fund in place.  Unfortunately, since 12 May, cattle prices have dropped by 30 cent to 40 cent per kilogram, so losses are probably even greater now than they were when this fund was introduced before the local elections.<\/p>  <p>  One of the greatest sources of regret on foot of last week's talks is the fact that the price differential for cattle over 30 months of age remains the same.  Attempts were made to camouflage this by increasing the bonus for cattle under 30 months of age.  The reality, however, is that when cattle change from being 29 months and 29 days old to 30 months and a day old there is a price differential of 12 cent per kilogram.  Farmers just do not accept that there is any basis for this differential.<\/p>  <p>  It is now a generation since we had BSE in this country.  Using that weapon to pay a lower price to farmers is just not acceptable.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has clearly failed farmers.  Whether it is in rendering or processing, farmers feel that a monopoly exists.  We saw that when Slaney Meats was purchased by Larry Goodman, it was investigated but was said to be okay.  This further eroded competition in the trade.  Farmers need to get a viable price.  If that does not happen very quickly, our industry will disappear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800029#HH00100","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1568814300,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I remind the four remaining speakers in this slot that they have a total of nine minutes between them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800029#HH00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1568814300,"counter":382,"content":"<p>Like my colleagues, I have met the farmers, male and female, across Cavan and Monaghan who have stood on the picket lines in recent weeks.  It was heartbreaking to stand there and have conversations with them.  There were women on the picket lines as well as the male farmers and they were there with their very small children out of love, passion and concern not just for their livelihoods but also for the land and where we are going when it comes to agriculture.  The farmers in Cavan and Monaghan feel very passionately about this because they feel they are not getting a fair slice of the cake.  Who could argue with that when we see some of the statistics that have been put out in recent weeks for the proportion they were getting as opposed to the meat processors and retailers.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, Deputy McConalogue, and with our agriculture team brought forward a motion to the Minister of State last March.  They saw this coming years ago.  I speak on behalf of the farmers in Cavan and Monaghan.  They feel that the Minister has sat on his hands when it comes to the base price they have been offered, the 30-month age restrictions, the four-movement rule, the weight restrictions on cattle and so on.  Above all this is transparency.  Transparency is key, as is the ability to listen.  While the Minister has left it to the very last hour to get people around the table, there is huge work to be done to restore farmers' confidence that there is a future in farming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800029#HH00300","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speech","time":1568814300,"counter":383,"content":"<p>The numbers participating in last night's debate and the numbers seeking to contribute today clearly demonstrate that this is a huge issue in rural Ireland.  Rural Ireland and its farmers feel totally abandoned by the Government.  For months the Government has been put on notice that urgent intervention was needed, yet it failed to intervene until the 11th hour and only did so after farmers had endured thousands of lost man hours at factory gates and thousands of factory workers, who bear no responsibility whatsoever in the setting of beef prices, had been temporarily laid off.   Some of those workers will not even be entitled to any social welfare.<\/p>  <p>  I compliment the farming representative bodies that have come to the talks and achieved concessions, but it must be noted that these concessions are only the start.  What the Beef Plan Movement has achieved in its establishment as a PO must be noted.  There is, however, huge mistrust out there - of the Department, Meat Industry Ireland, MII and Bord Bia.  What MII now needs to do is show its goodwill and confirm that there will be no erosion of the base price.  There are two concrete areas where the Government can show its willingness to help the sector.  The first is offal.  I understand that Ireland is the only EU member state that has a distance limit for offal.  That can be changed by the Minister of State and his colleagues.  By doing so they would open up competition and remove the dominance of one player.  The second area, which has been mentioned already, is export of live cattle.  Much more needs to be done to ensure adequate facilities to keep this competitive option open.<\/p>  <p>  The time for action is now.

Beef and suckler farmers are at their wits' end.  They are experiencing a severe income crisis and struggling to maintain their livelihoods, educate their children and keep their heads above water coming off the back of a tough time last year between the fodder crisis and a drought.  Outside the factory gates the farmers are losing their livelihoods, are entrenched and cannot break even for every animal reared and sold.  Stepping inside the factory gates, 6,000 workers have been temporarily laid off and many of them have no access to social welfare payments as they are employed on permits from outside the EU.  Over the past seven weeks, a large number of them have exhausted any savings or back-up they may have had as a result of the uncertainty of work since the pickets began on a day-to-day basis.  More job losses will follow if the pickets are not lifted.  The situation inside the gates is job losses and despair for workers, who want to work but cannot get the animals through the gates.  Livelihoods are lost outside the factory gates and jobs are lost inside, and it goes on and on every day.  There was hope last weekend, with long hours spent taking and each side giving a little, but if one talks to any farmer, it is on the base price that they want and need movement.<\/p>  <p>  The crisis is damaging our beef industry.

That is true.  Unfortunately, our problem did not start yesterday but a number of years ago.  Farmers in Europe were being paid 40 or 50 cent more than Irish farmers.  I can fully understand the difficulties and the feelings of the farming community at the moment.  It is very easy to look back but we have to look forward.  The time has hopefully come for somebody to negotiate for the people at the gates.  There are people facing financial ruin.  We are 44 days away from Brexit.  If we have a no-deal Brexit, beef going to England, where most of our beef goes, will face a tariff of 50%.  What will that do to cattle prices in this country?  Today we are talking about &euro;3.40.  We could be talking about &euro;2.40 in a month.  That is the sad reality.<\/p>  <p>  At present, we should be killing approximately 35,000 cattle per week.  For the last two or three weeks, that kill has not happened at all.  If we have another two weeks of that, we will have more than 100,000 cattle that have to be slaughtered.  That will depress the market.  If is absolutely imperative, however the Minister does it, that this blockade is stopped straight away.  I believe that farmers should be paid a premium for the cow to help the rural family to stay alive.  I believe that we should have a rural environment protection, REP, scheme.  Get rid of those Mickey Mouse schemes of putting up bird boxes and such, wasting people's time where people have to pay half what they get to get a payment.  Issue a good REP scheme, even if it has to be attached to climate change measures.  The REP scheme was very beneficial to farmers and kept them on the land.  That money went straight into farmers' pockets and not to somebody else.  That is what is needed for the future.<\/p>  <p>  Many statements have been made about the price of beef and who is getting what.  It is very simple.  Going into a meat plant, we know what the animal is costing the factory.  We know what the factory is charging and we know what the supermarkets are charging too.  There should be a full assessment on a carcase to see who exactly is getting what because at the moment nobody knows.  I have experience of this as a butcher.  It can be done.  I spoke to a sheep agent yesterday.  He has more than 1,000 sheep ready to go to a factory.  It is another delay for another two or three weeks.  It will depress the price and there is no question of that.  In the end, the farmers will suffer more.  I believe that the Government should declare this a national crisis because that is what we are facing at the moment and that is what the farming community is facing.  Whatever has to be done should be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800030#JJ00100","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1568814900,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Before I start, I put on the record the Minister's regret that he cannot be here due to a family bereavement.

I share the serious concerns about the ongoing difficulties facing the beef sector and I certainly understand the frustration which has driven some farmers to engage in prolonged picketing.  Last weekend, the Minister, Deputy Creed, facilitated lengthy negotiations involving all the stakeholders to try to find a resolution to the current dispute.  These were just the most recent talks in a series of formal discussions between beef stakeholders which have been facilitated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, both in Backweston and Agriculture House.  These commenced with a meeting on 12 August and continued through last weekend.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, and I have had ongoing bilateral discussions and meetings with organisations, representatives and individual farmers.<\/p><p>The common thread in discussions is that all parties agree that it is critical to find a means of getting the sector fully operational again to protect the livelihoods involved, including both the farmers and factory workers whose jobs are at risk and all players in the sector.  The talks last weekend culminated in an agreement between the meat industry and seven farm organisations and representatives, all of whom undertook to support the agreement on the ground and recommend that those protesting should step back their protests in response to this negotiated agreement.  The agreement is a two-strand approach aimed at providing immediate financial benefits directly to beef farmers as well as addressing longer term structural issues which are in many ways the core of the problem.  A means to implement and measure progress on these measures was also set out and agreed.<\/p><p>In summary, as part of the deal, there is an increase of 66% to the current in-spec bonus for steers and heifers from 12 to 20 cent per kilogram and introduction of a new 8 cent bonus for steers and heifers aged between 30 and 36 months which meet all non-age related existing in-spec criteria which up to now have not received any bonus.  There will be an introduction of a new in-spec bonus of 12 cent per kilogram for steers and heifers under 30 months in the categories of O- and fat score 4+ which currently do not qualify.  The in-spec 70 day residency requirement will be reduced to 60 days on the last farm.  These measures offer an immediate financial benefit to beef farmers.  They both increase the level of bonus being paid and significantly increase the number of animals that are eligible for a bonus.  The cumulative effect is that more than 70% of all steers and heifers slaughtered will now be eligible for a bonus payment on top of the base price.<\/p><p>The establishment of a beef market task force is part of the agreement, to provide leadership to develop a sustainable pathway for the future of the beef sector in economic, environmental and social sustainability.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, will appoint an independent chair to lead the task force.  Its membership will comprise the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, relevant State agencies and nominees from farm organisations and the meat industry.  This task force will provide for a robust implementation structure for commitments entered into in the arena with timelines and stakeholder engagement.  Further, it will offer a suitable platform for strategic engagement with key stakeholders, including retailers and the regulatory authorities.  Other key immediate actions include the development by Bord Bia of a beef market price index model and a scientific review of the quality payment grid by Teagasc.<\/p><p>The second strand of the agreement sets out the strategic measures which seek to address structural imbalances in the sector.  These measures will provide clear information and greater transparency to the sector with a view to ensuring the sustainability of this sector in the future.  A number of actions in the area of market transparency, beef promotion and strengthening the position of the farmer in the food chain were agreed upon.<\/p><p>The agreed measures set a course towards greater clarity for all stakeholders involved in the beef supply chain, primarily farmers, and the agreement includes commitments on an independent review of market and customer requirements, specifically relating to the four in-spec bonus criteria currently in operation in the beef sector.  Another measure is an independent examination of the price composition of the total value of the animal, including the fifth quarter along the supply chain.  The results will inform future actions as necessary.  The beef industry will co-operate in providing the data.  There will be initiatives on improving information on carcase classification.<\/p><p>I know that many of the criteria for the in-spec bonus have been much discussed over the long days and nights of the discussions.  It is imperative that we have the hard facts about third country and consumer requirements to inform discussions.  The independent review will provide clarity about these requirements.  A country exporting the majority of its products is dependent on a range of market requirements.  There are also commitments to more detailed price reporting, more reporting on carcase classifications and the transposition of the EU directive on unfair trading practices.<\/p><p>Full details are available on the website so, conscious of the time, I will not go into them in full.  I am convinced that this contains the best balance between immediate financial benefits for beef farmers and a series of more long-term strategic actions that are absolutely necessary.  Other initiatives, such as BEAM, have been mentioned.  For the benefit of Deputy Cahill, I can clarify that the only finishers excluded are those from factories' dealer herd numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800030#JJ00500","speaker":"1356","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568815500,"counter":391,"content":"<p>That is not correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800031#KK00200","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1568815500,"counter":392,"content":"<p>It is my information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800031#KK00300","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"speech","time":1568815500,"counter":393,"content":"<p>What about dairy farmers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800031#KK00400","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1568815500,"counter":394,"content":"<p>The 5% reduction is similar to the actions and requirements taken in the market supply chain reduction a couple of years ago, when the dairy support scheme was provided.  I am aware that this motion is a couple of weeks old.  I understand that the take-up has been around 80%.  It was slow but I encourage all those who are eligible to apply.  Assistance is being provided at the ploughing championships and in the Department, which informs people how to qualify and how to apply, and this has been well subscribed to.<\/p>  <p>  The announcement earlier this year by the European Commissioner, Phil Hogan, of an exceptional aid measure was very welcome.  We had made the case for some time at Council of Ministers' meetings, and in direct consultation with the Commission, for an exceptional aid package from the European Commission for beef farmers.  The available aid was specifically targeted at the farmers who were most impacted by market disturbances.  It is a substantial package of &euro;100 million, with conditionality as per the requirement of the EU.  It is timebound for a relatively short period but there are more ways than one of meeting the conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Live exports were up by 30% in 2017-18 and this trend has continued to date.

We need producer organisations to work.  We need to step back to enable them to work because they are the one entity around the country that can give farmers a more equal position at the negotiating table as they can negotiate prices.  The dialogue we have had so far has achieved a lot.  I urge people to stand back and assess what has been achieved as things have changed and will never go back to where they were.  Now is the time to make the most of this but the meat industry has to take a step back from legal threats and the protestors have to take a step back from the factory gates.  I speak passionately about this as a beef farmer.  I want to see the industry survive.  It has a crucial role to play in the rural economy in many ways and it is worth preserving.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800031#KK00500","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"speech","time":1568815500,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the commitment and bravery of all the independent beef farmers, and the movement which is currently protesting, as well as those who stand with them to highlight the conditions they are compelled to live under because of the lack of a decent price for their cattle.  I have been on the pickets with these farmers in Rathkeale and Bandon and I am certain that they have been left with no choice.  I am quite certain that they are doing this in desperation, in order to get an adequate, liveable income from their products.  They felt they had no other choice but to protest and that this was their last opportunity to save their livelihoods.  I do not believe that one farmer who is currently picketing the factories wants to be there.<\/p>  <p>  The ground for farmers in rural Ireland is in a particularly bad position, particularly west of the Shannon, and beef farmers can no longer support their families on the income they receive.  Families are facing the prospect of losing their home; they face a fight to pay their mortgage and they have debts and loans from last year's fodder crisis which they cannot pay.  They are unable to pay co-operatives from which they have purchased manure and feed for their cattle.<\/p>  <p>  How has it come to this?  It has not just happened in the last couple of months but has been building on the ground for a number of years.  For decades now, we have allowed the Irish beef sector to be run in a cartel-like manner, with its power being left unchecked for so long.  This cartel-like group can decide, whenever it wishes, to manipulate the price of beef and to use its power for its own selfish reasons.  If we go below the optimal kill of 30,000 per week, this group has at its disposal feedlots to enable it to feed cattle into the market to manipulate the price and ensure it is kept at the minimum required for its selfish needs.  One of them, ABP, made a profit of &euro;170 million in 2018 and has assets worth &euro;3.45 billion.  The bulk of its profits were booked in Luxembourg and were largely untaxed.  That has been allowed to happen and we have to ask ourselves how the cartels have been allowed to come together to get to where they are now.  By the manipulation of the market for their own selfish needs they have managed to eliminate any small or independent operators around the country.  We are left with a small number of factories with great power, which includes political power as we have seen in the past, with access to political organisations for their own benefit.  We cannot say the market decides this on its own; the groups to which I refer determine the market by fixing prices.  I have said time and again in this House that they have access to the database so that they know exactly how many cattle are coming on stream on a weekly and monthly basis and nobody has challenged me on it.  Is it legal if a major cartel has feedlots under its control with people feeding cattle into the factories at the optimal time on its behalf?  Is it legal for these big companies to take cattle from feedlots and put them into the factory process in order to manipulate the price?  I do not think that is legal and it is certainly morally wrong.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting the Fianna F&aacute;il motion tomorrow, which we believe is a fair attempt to outline the threats beef farmers face and to articulate the demands that are necessary to resolve the situation.  We have submitted three amendments to the motion and I hope Fianna F&aacute;il considers accepting them.  The first seeks to establish a beef market observatory which would require processors to publish daily price reports.  This is in operation in the United States of America.  It is not a silver bullet and certainly does not meet all farmers' demands but it will go some way to ending the manipulation of prices by processors.  It would also go some way towards ending the high level of mistrust between farmers and factories, which is the key reason talks continue to stall.  Only once greater transparency has been delivered will we be able to see the huge gap between what the consumer pays and what the farmers gets.  We will then be able to see who is being ripped off.  I hope other parties support this amendment as it will give transparency as well as confidence to farmers and processors.<\/p><p> Our third amendment calls for the study to be carried out and alludes to how the farming family model can be preserved in the face of the increased prevalence of feedlots.  I am sure we all know too well the role feedlots have played in the beef sector.  I hope we can all agree this is the right time to investigate the matter.  We also called for the farmers' charter of rights to be adequately upheld.  All these measures are in the interest of all of us, including the consumer and producer.  I do not see why the processors or big retail units should have any difficulty outlining what the processors get from the retailers and what the retailers pay the processors.  This would result in transparency right across the board.  That would be of great benefit in restoring confidence in the sector.<\/p> <p> I cannot disagree with the independent farmers and their supporters outside the factories.  I fully support them.  I support them because they are carrying out an act of last resort to try to protect their livelihood.  I fully support them because I come from their type of background and live in rural Ireland.  My neighbours are among the protesters.  Protestors feel, with great reason, that they have been badly neglected by large farming organisations, which they believe have never acted in their interest.  The major farming organisations are currently trying to find a resolution because there is a total disconnect between them and their members.  This is because the latter have been betrayed and let down.  That is the reality.  The big farming organisations have looked after the big farmers and have done nothing for the small beef farmers across rural Ireland.  I support the motion of Fianna F&aacute;il and hope it will take our amendments on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800031#KK00600","speaker":"1317","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568816100,"counter":397,"content":"<p>We had statements yesterday evening on this.  Clearly, the anger at the picket lines at the factory gates has not abated.  Many have spoken about the issue, at the core of which is the price.  The base price is what they are talking about.  While I accept the notion that the producer organisations comprise a route to deal with this, it will be difficult for every farmer to have that route.  It is untested and untried.  The producer organisations have been in existence in the country for many years.  During all these years, the entire emphasis has been on cutting input costs, with a view to coming together to buy diesel, fertiliser and grain more cheaply, not to increase the price for their end product.  That has been the experience.  I hope that this experience will change under the new model.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Ferris said, the general view of many of the farmers is that the farm organisations have let them down, that they have not been active enough on this, and that they have allowed this problem to grow for the past 20 years or more.  Many years ago, when there were small abattoirs and factories around the country, farmers were in a much stronger position.  There has been consolidation into the hands of a small few.  It appears, and there is great evidence to suggest, that the small few work together to manipulate the price to their own advantage and to the disadvantage of the primary producer, the farmer.<\/p>  <p>  The motion is dealing with many of these issues.  I commend Deputy McConalogue and Fianna F&aacute;il on bringing forward this motion.  It is really about getting to grips with the problem and highlighting the true need to resolve it.  The resolution will come with the recognition that the system is broken.  The current model does not work.  It only works for the small handful in control of the situation.  They have engaged in manipulation over many years to bring it to this.  If we recognise that the system does not work and is broken, and while this has probably been more recognised than resolved in negotiations, we now have to reach a position in which we can ask what the new system will be like.  What new procedures can be put in place for the Irish farm family?  Many such families around where I live have 15 or 20 suckler cows.  They need to see a future.  They depend on the farmer who will fatten the calves and sell them to the factory in order to get a decent price.  If this does not happen, they will also go out of business.  There is a knock-on effect.  I do not need to tell that to the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle; he is aware of it.<\/p>  <p>  One cannot sort this out unless one accounts for the price and how it is given.  At present, we are told it is based on the open market.  The flaw of the open market is that it is very often manipulated.  A principle of free market economics is that, all things equal and everything fair, the system works very well.  Unfortunately, all things are not equal and things are very seldom fair.  They are certainly not fair in this situation because it is being manipulated.  We are told we are getting the average price like the rest of Europe.  Given the quality of the product Irish farmers produce, they do not deserve that price; they deserve at least 20% above it because they are producing a premium product.  Irish farmers are producing a gold-standard product and getting a bog-standard price.  The price is the key.  Some will of course say we are over-producing beef and that there are too many cattle.  There may be some legitimacy to this argument, and it needs to be examined, but it does nothing for the farmer who has 20 or 30 bullocks to sell and who cannot make a living.  Telling him he is going to make less in the future is not an answer.  If we are to say it is about producing less, the price will have to go up even more.  That is the challenge we have set ourselves.<\/p>  <p>  I accept the Minister was at the talks and worked very hard on the days he was present but at the end of it all he should not be the ringmaster trying to sort this out.  The Minister has to play a role and step in.  The Government has to be seen to be exercising the firm hand of regulation to ensure fair play.  In this case, the Government has to be standing clearly on the side of the farmer.  If one is to stand on the side of the farmer, one has to stand up for finding a way to deliver a proper price.  If this is to happen, the Government needs to find an appropriate mechanism.  Everyone will say it is illegal and that it cannot be done but we have heard that before about many things.  A bit of inventiveness got around it.  If a bit of inventiveness were applied in this case, we could get around the problem also.  A means would be found to get a proper price for the farmer, ensuring that as we move into the future, the small family farm and beef sector can survive.  The processors are needed by the farming community.  We all need each other in this.  This ought to be recognised.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit is coming at us like a steam train.  We do not know what will happen because we export such a large proportion of our beef to Britain.  We do not know what the position will be in two months so it is crucial that this issue be sorted not in the coming weeks but the in coming days.  This is why I suggest that the Government needs to go back in and work out a solution.  Farmers have said that if they can get a base price, of up to &euro;3.80 per kilogramme, they are prepared to come off the picket.  If that happened now, we could see some progress.  We need to see the Government stepping in and working on behalf of the farmer.  The farmer is the one with his back to the wall in this situation.  The big processors are very powerful and have very deep pockets.  They can withstand this; the farmers cannot.<\/p>  <p>  I know many farmers around the country who have cattle ready to go but who cannot get them into the factory.  They are very worried.  They do not want to be seen to be going against those at the factory gate.  They truly stand with them but, at the same time, they have cattle ready to go.  Some of the cattle are over 30 months.  The farmers have to keep feeding them and they are losing money doing so.  Right now, the Government needs to employ a firm hand with the processors and deliver the base price for the farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800032#LL00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1568816100,"counter":398,"content":"<p>The Labour Party will support the Fianna F&aacute;il motion.  I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for introducing it.  We acknowledge the frustration of farmers and workers in meat processing plants.  We are particularly concerned about the 6,000 workers laid off to date.  Many are on employer-specific work permits so they do not have access to social welfare payments.  They have no time to lose in getting the factories back to full operation.<\/p>  <p>  Livestock farmers are facing an unprecedented crisis.  The crisis will not end any time soon.  Global trade is becoming more protectionist.<\/p><p>That means difficulties for Ireland as an island nation.  Brexit, if it happens without a deal, will lead to tariffs and non-EU competition in the British beef market.  We will be significantly exposed because more than 50% of our beef is sold in that lucrative market.  The EU beef market is already highly competitive.  Market prices are low, so Deputies should not try to deceive people by telling them that they will see a massive increase in the market price.  The position is the same for market prices across Europe.  Let us be clear.  I have been studying this in recent months.  Prices could be driven lower if the Mercosur agreement allows extra beef into the Single Market.  If one tries to sell into a market that produces 102% of what it needs, and which is therefore beyond self-sufficiency, one is in trouble.  It is a buyer's market.<\/p> <p> Climate change and health concerns are leading some consumers to change their preferences.  This is a long-term issue for the wider agricultural industry as well as for the meat industry.  Possible changes to the CAP represent another risk for farmers.  The UK's contribution of &euro;12 billion will be lost when it falls out of the EU.  Chancellor Merkel stated yesterday that she wants the 1.1% of VAT receipts that makes up part of countries' contributions - which is subject to their GDP - to be held at 1%.  That will further reduce CAP payments.  Although Ireland has committed to an increased contribution, the Dutch and the Belgians are showing significant reluctance.  There are many things ahead.  We will hopefully get this situation resolved.  RT&Eacute; news reports indicate that some promising initiatives are coming forward.  Things are beginning to happen.  I hope they will continue to happen and that matters will be resolved.<\/p> <p> I agree that we have to get the base price but to allow people to think it will be up &euro;4 by tomorrow evening is misleading.  It is a solution for now, but there are long-term fundamental structural problems in this area.  We will stick a plaster on it; we will mend and fill the old boiler.  We will get that done today, but in a few weeks the boiler will be splattering water all over the place.  There will be several leaks.  That is the equivalent of what will happen in this situation.<\/p> <p> Let us be very clear, policy decisions made over the years led to the current impasse.  Large companies and conglomerates were allowed to gobble up small competitors uninhibited and to remove any semblance of competition, thereby elevating themselves into a dominant market position from which they could unilaterally dictate prices.  They were not just satisfied with owning the pitch, they decided to take over the dressing room by introducing the concept of feedlots, which can be used to manipulate the market to their total advantage.<\/p> <p> To add insult to injury, as a result of total political cowardice, they are getting CAP payments.  I was one of the few to stand in the barn gap, as they say.  Those very corporations are some of the biggest recipients of CAP payments.  This adds insult to injury.  The sooner somebody has the political balls to cap those payments, the better.  CAP payments are going to be very important in the future and they have to be allocated to where they were designed to be allocated, rather than giving a bit to everyone in the audience.  No farm organisation can do the allocation.  It is about time they realised that they cannot represent the multimillionaire farmer and the poor farmer down the west with 25 or 30 acres.  It does not work like that.  One reaps what one sows and this is what we are reaping now.  Let us cap the payments and cut out this nonsense.  It is scandalous.  I recall some people who do not employ one person on the land getting large payments.  When my grandfather was around, some of those same farms were employing three or four people.  Let us be clear about a few things.  Let us be honest with one another in here.  I am inclined to be honest and this is very important.<\/p> <p> I have to mention the BEAM.  I spoke a great deal about those measures last evening.  I am worried about farmers who have established herd numbers in their own right over recent years.  They have been building their stock slowly over time and have not reached their potential stocking rates.  They need this BEAM compensation.  They are only getting their farm businesses up and running.  If they choose to avail of this compensation, however, they have to commit concomitantly to reduce their stock by 5%.  That is a nonsense.  They are only getting off the ground and the Minister is asking them to reduce their stock by 5%.  These people are under 35 and have all kinds of agricultural qualifications.  The Minister should go back to the genius who devised the schemes.  He or she may never have been out on the ground.  The Minister should get him or her to look for a special case or some measure that could be implemented to review the 5% reduction in these cases.  It is based on the reference period from July 2018 to June 2019.  Their farms are already overstocked.  These individuals are only slowly building up so the impact on them is much greater.  Will the Minister listen to me please?  I am trying to get through to people who have no interest in listening.  This has to be examined.<\/p> <p> Last evening I referred to the average cattle-rearing farmer earning approximately &euro;8,301.  Two thirds of beef farmers earned less than &euro;10,000 last year.  The problem with the latter is that the average EU subsidy payment is approximately &euro;13,000.  If they were clever, most beef farmers would be better off collecting their subsidy and then mowing their grass and selling it as hay or silage.  Some 40 years ago, I worked as an adviser or a consultant and that is what I would have told them to do.  They would then make a decent income.  They would at least get something out of it.  At the moment, the subsidy is just going towards paying the bills and the farmers have absolutely nothing left.  They would have more money if they did this, so they would be far better off.  I know one has to have a certain number of grazing stock, but rather than seeking to have greater and greater numbers, farmers would be better off trying to deal with things in this way.  That is the way it is going because farmers are getting a notorious fleecing.  They are producing a product and are not getting compensated for it.  This problem is not unique to Ireland.  Beef farmers across Europe are either losing money or making only tiny margins.<\/p> <p> I again have to exhort people.  There are beef markets out there that were very hard-won.  Deputy Cahill criticised Bord Bia but I take a different view.  That is the essence of democracy; we hold different views.  Ms Tara McCarthy stated earlier today that hard-won markets will be lost if this situation persists and that it will be very hard to win them back.  Let sense prevail.  Beside where I live, where a lot of beef fattening takes place, there are fields full of cattle ready to go.  They have now gone over the 30 months and all that nonsense.  I was here at the time of the BSE problem.  Many of these measures, such as the four-movement rule and the 70-days residency requirement, were brought in at that time, 2001-2002.  It is time to alleviate the situation and to move on from some of those measures.  I know we have to keep up standards but it could be another contribution towards progress in this regard.  I am particularly worried that farmers at home will not be able to move any cattle and that the cattle will build up.  Deputy Scanlon was right that only 10,000 or 11,000 cattle were killed last week.  There may be none at all this week, or very few.  The problem is that there will be a queue of 150,000 or 160,000 animals built up and farmers will get nothing at all for them.  The whole thing will become circular and we will be back to where we started, with no resolution.  That is the big issue.<\/p> <p> The Minister knows how people are feeling.  Government cannot resolve this issue on its own.  If Deputy McConalogue was sitting in the Minister's seat, I would be saying the same thing.  This cannot be solved by the Government alone; everybody has a say.  The European Commission will also have to step in to help with the subsidy fund about which the Minister is talking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800032#LL00300","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568816700,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I will start by paying tribute to the independent beef farmers and the Beef Plan Movement for their magnificent campaign over recent weeks and over the course of the summer.  They have highlighted the absolutely intolerable and unacceptable levels of income which they are expected to endure despite producing a beef product of extremely high quality.  I am shocked by these income levels.  Until I met representatives of the Beef Plan Movement before the summer, I did not know that anybody working to produce such a product could be expected to survive on such a level of income.  It is absolutely shocking.  Average incomes are &euro;12,000 and many are on &euro;10,000 or &euro;8,000 a year.  It is a scandal.<\/p><p> From what I can see having heard from them, their scepticism and mistrust regarding the good faith of the beef barons, processors and retailers and some of the governmental agencies and bodies that are supposed to be trying to address this issue are perfectly understandable.<\/p> <p> I am not saying that any of the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies present is saying it, but there is a narrative floating around to the effect that all this would be sorted if farmers just pulled back from the gate.  From what I understand, they do not want to be there.  They have been forced to the gate, and they are staying there because they do not trust the processors, retailers and various agencies of Government to ensure their interests.<\/p> <p> The key is the base price, which has decreased.  One of the farmers I spoke to just before entering the Chamber told me of losses of between &euro;200 to &euro;250 per animal over the past couple of years.  Contrary to what has been suggested in some of the discourse, retail beef prices have actually increased in some parts of Europe during the period in question.  Farmers are asking a simple question - if what they are getting is going down while retail beef prices are increasing, where is the money going?  They conclude that it is going into the hands of the beef processors, who control the price and the market, and the retailers, all of whom are making large profits.  One does not have to be a rocket scientist to see that.  Goodman's various companies have seen &euro;175 million in profits.  Frankly, I am amazed.  One of the first issues that I ever got involved in was protesting around the issues that led to the beef tribunal - export credit insurance, rotten beef to Iraq and so on.  It is amazing that some of those involved are still around, controlling the beef sector, making massive profits and, as we recently discovered, routing quite an amount of those profits through Luxembourg, a tax haven.  In effect, they are a cartel controlling the industry and the prices while beef farmers are on an abysmal income.  Look at the large retailers in this country.  We do not even know how much profit Tesco makes, as it does not declare its Irish profits, but it is making lots of money.  Aldi, McDonald's and so on are making a great deal of money.  The answer to the question about where the money is going is that it is going to them.<\/p> <p> One of the questions I was requested to ask concerned the exceptional aid scheme.  Will the Minister of State assure us that it is not benefitting these companies?  Is it going to the farmers who are struggling?  They want to know because they are suspicious.  Just like CAP, it is shocking that these companies, which are making that level of profit and funnelling profits through tax havens and so on, are getting CAP payments when the small producer is struggling to survive.  There is a suspicion among beef farmers that this entire situation has been engineered and the companies want to shut down many of the small beef producers and move things elsewhere.  Hence the kerfuffle about the talk of Bord Bia giving quality assurance to plants in the North and, apparently, the rest of the UK for slaughtering Irish cattle, since doing so might work better for the beef processors if there is a no-deal Brexit because tariffs on live cattle exports are much less than on the manufactured product.  If cattle are sent over the Border to be slaughtered in the North, lower tariffs will be applied and Irish products will be sold into Britain, where 50% of our market lies.<\/p> <p> Is this all being engineered by our friends in the cartel to drive the small producer out of business completely?  Historically, the trajectory of farming, rural economies and so on has been one of centralisation, the creation of monopolies and the destruction of the small producer.  We used to call this \"enclosures\".  That is what happens.  Will serious action be taken to protect the small producer?  Will supports, subsidies, exceptional aid schemes and so on be directed so as to ensure incomes, fairness and transparency around prices, where the money is going, who is making the profit and so on?  The meat industry cartel people do not want to own up to that, but the facts seem to speak for themselves.<\/p> <p> As others have alluded to, beef farmers just want to be told by the producer organisations or the processors that there will be a minimum price of &euro;3.80 per kilo.  There would be nothing illegal if the processors said it.  They set the price anyway - let us be honest.  If the processors said that they would give farmers a minimum of &euro;3.80 per kilo, this situation could be resolved.  Look at the profits that Larry Goodman is making.  He can afford it.  In terms of the narrative around this situation, that is where the Government's pressure should be directed.  These farmers do not want to be out on the picket line, but they do not trust the big players, the people who control the market or the agencies.  I understand that there was a kerfuffle at the ploughing championships because people felt that Bord Bia giving quality assurance to plants in the North and so on was part of a stitch-up of producers in response to the protests of recent weeks.<\/p> <p> I stand with the farmers.  The onus is on the large processors and retailers that are making lots of money and on the Government to ensure that farmers get a fair price and fair incomes for the work they do and the incredible and important role they play in holding rural Ireland together and maintaining the Irish rural economy.

It must change if we are to have movement and are to address the pickets outside meat plants across the country.<\/p>  <p>  As I stated last night, we need movement on the base price that is paid for cattle.  A realistic offer must be made by individual plants.  A producer organisation has been established through the Beef Plan Movement.  It must now be used as a vehicle for engaging with individual meat plants across the country and agreeing a base price.  Even if a base price is agreed, though, farmers are concerned about what there is to prevent movement in that price next week, next month or next year.  A minimum base price must be established and then tied into the variation in the European average price for beef.  As the House knows, the European Commission publishes a list of the average price paid across Europe for beef and a carcase every week.  As with tracker mortgages, there should be a tracker base price for beef.  Farmers could then work to get a higher price through bonuses and meeting various criteria.  Unless a baseline is put in place, however, we will not have movement on the issues.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with that, we need to examine some of the fundamental problems in the beef sector.  We must establish a distinct brand for certified grass-fed, extensively reared Irish suckler beef.  There is an application with the European Commission for EU protected geographical indication status for that very product.<\/p><p>The Government must redouble its efforts to establish that status and, in tandem, establish an individual brand similar to Kerrygold to market that product across Europe and the rest of the world.  The big difficulty is that Irish suckler beef is competing with manufacturing beef from the dairy herd.  There is domestic price competition in that regard, aside from being able to sell Irish suckler beef as a unique product on international markets.  Instead, Irish suckler beef is being used to sell manufacturing beef into international markets.  That must change immediately.<\/p> <p> Last May, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission recommended to the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine that a dedicated sectoral regulator be established to deal with the unfair trading practices directive coming from Europe and to improve the welfare of farmers.  We need to establish an independent regulator for this sector forthwith to protect small Irish family farms.  There can be no dithering in this regard. <\/p> <p> As I stated in the House last night, there are issues regarding threats issued by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  However, there are tools available to the Government though the commission to look at the beef sector in this country and who is controlling the levers of the sector.  Under section 10(4) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, may ask the commission to carry out an analysis of the beef market and make recommendations in that regard.  That needs to be done immediately.<\/p> <p> We will be back here dealing with this issue in the coming years and we will state that the fundamental mistake made in 2019 was the failure to establish a State owned and controlled block chain supply chain for the beef sector.  This is new technology which is being employed across the pharmaceutical sector.  Someone in Ireland will establish that block chain.  If it is not State owned and controlled, it will be used to further abuse the existing significant market share and compound the problem facing Irish farmers.  There is a responsibility on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to bring all of the players together to establish a publicly owned and controlled national beef supply block chain which will increase the value of beef and, more importantly, increase the return available to Irish farmers.<\/p> <p> The steps I have outlined will not improve the price of beef tomorrow morning or next week; only movement on the base price will do that.  However, if these measures are not taken now, we will regret it.  If the measures had been taken in the past, we would not be in the situation we are in today.  It is fundamentally important that we address the current crisis and ensure there is a base price and a future for Irish suckler beef.<\/p> <p> It is disingenuous to state that we should be reducing the Irish suckler beef herd.  I acknowledge that there is an issue in respect of cattle numbers in this country but, as all Members know, those numbers are going askew in the dairy sector, not the suckler beef sector.  We need to protect the latter sector.  Unless we do, green fields across the country will turn into yellow fields of ragwort and furze.  Farmers will, hand over fist, abandon land west of the River Shannon which is not suitable for tillage or dairy production but is providing a sustainable livelihood for many elements of the economy.  Unless we are prepared to put gates on the bridges over the River Shannon, we must acknowledge the fundamental importance of the suckler herd and the suckler beef industry.  We need to roll up our sleeves and support it for tomorrow, next week and the years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800034#NN00200","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568817900,"counter":404,"content":"<p>The fundamental priority must be to re-engage with all of the major stakeholders such that we can bring this crisis to a conclusion.  It is clear that unless a mechanism can be found which permits the raising of the base price for beef, this issue will be prolonged with devastating consequences.  To date, the consequences have been worsening.  There is too much on the line and too many jobs, families' income and lives at stake for rural Ireland to allow this issue to drag on.  Now that the Beef Plan Movement has been approved as a producer organisation, there is no reason a commitment could not be given.<\/p>  <p>  There must be an immediate end to the threats of legal action by Meat Industry Ireland, MII, which have begun to re-emerge.  Another day has been wasted.  There were developments on Sunday evening.  Today is Wednesday and the Government is out the gap again.  It is making no move to re-engage with independent farmers and various other groups to try to get a base price somewhere along the line.  Given that the Beef Plan Movement has been approved as a producer organisation, one can no longer say that the base price cannot be discussed.<\/p>  <p>  I support the motion tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il.  The Government is dragging its feet.  It stayed away from the table for too long.  Now that it has been to the table, it should engage and try to get the people who have lost their jobs and been displaced by the reckless meat industry back into work and production to ensure that no further damage is done to the products on shop shelves here or our exports.<\/p>  <p>  This is a crisis.  Where are the Fine Gael backbenchers for the debate of this motion?  They are not here.  They must not be interested.  It does not bother them.  By hell, it will bother them at election time because they will get it in the neck.  Fine Gael is supposed to be looking after the big farmers, but is not looking after any farmers.  It has lost its way and has a Dublin-centric Cabinet which does not care about rural Ireland.  The Taoiseach stated that he would eat less beef because it is carcinogenic and because of climate change.  What else could we expect from the Government while he is its leader?  It was a disgraceful thing for him to say and it shows the inertia at Cabinet level in regard to doing anything about this crisis or for the farmers on the picket line.  There is no semblance of movement by the Government.  The Ministers need to get off their you-know-whats, talk to the people and get this crisis sorted out because it is drifting on and on.

I was there, as were Deputies Danny Healy-Rae and Michael Collins on an almost nightly basis.  Why did some politicians see fit to listen to the concerns of farmers while others, some of them very senior politicians, did not?  Being a Minister does not mean one does not have to listen to the people whom one is supposed to represent.  When one becomes a Minister, one should not forget the people who put one there.  I am sure there are many farmers who voted for the Minister, Deputy Creed.  The least they expected was for him to listen to them when they needed him.  It is awful that a person in Government would not listen to them.  That was wrong.<\/p>  <p>  It is wrong that the base price could not be discussed during the talks.

They are making substantial losses.  That is recognised by all, including the meat factories.  Meat processors are making a substantial profit.  They have been allowed to gain a monopoly, which allows them to control and dictate prices without any reference to the producer.  They can manipulate the price by using their feedlots.  There is a need to have a recalibration of the financial imbalance that exists in the market.  That recalibration needs to bring a sustainable price to the producer and both sides should be allowed to make a reasonable profit.<\/p>  <p>  The existing model is not sustainable.  There is fair trade in many parts of the world.  There is fair trade in coffee and in the production of fruit in countries that are much poorer than ours yet we do not have a fair trade policy in respect of beef production.  Last night, I spoke about meat producers operating a financial blockade at their factory gates.  That is an invisible blockade.  It is just as damaging as the visible blockade by the farmers protesting outside the gates but that financial blockade is just as damaging to the meat industry as the farmers' blockade at the gates.<\/p>  <p>  The price for cattle needs to match the cost of production.  Bonus payments will not solve the problem.  They are variable.  They can be changed at a whim.  Many farmers do not qualify for them.  They do not ensure the cost of meat production and many of the criteria used are meaningless.

As it is the week of the National Ploughing Championships, issues in our agriculture sector are all people are talking about.<\/p>  <p>  I raised the many issues that family farms are currently facing as a result of poor treatment and the delayed intervention in the crisis on the part our Government.  Other members of the Rural Independent Group and I called for the D&aacute;il to be reconvened in early August when the farmers first started staging protests outside the gates of meat processing factories.  The Government did not listen and we are still in the same mess.  In fact, we are in a worse situation, particularly in view of the job losses at factories across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The farmers' message is simple.  All they want is a fair price for their hard work and their produce.  These are decent, hard-working people, many of whom have never been on a picket line in their lives.  They do not want to be on the picket line but they believe they have no other choice.  Many of them are going out of existence, and they know it.<\/p>  <p>  I call on the Government to act urgently and reconvene talks with all farming groups in order that we can resolve the outstanding issues around a fair base price, the 30-month age restrictions, the four-movement rule and the 70-day residency requirement with meat processors, retailers and farming organisations.  Earlier, I asked the Taoiseach to personally intervene in this dispute.  I put a question to him and he failed to answer it.  He passed the mantle to the Minister of State in terms of having to answer the question.  Why will the Taoiseach not intervene?  Why has he not spoken out strongly in favour of the ordinary men and women who have gone out day and night to fight for their survival?  It is not good enough.  When it comes to this issue, our Taoiseach has stood idly by.  I do not know if he clearly understands the crisis in the beef sector.  I ask him again this evening to come out and fight for the ordinary man and woman who is fighting for their survival.<\/p>  <p>  I am happy to support this motion.  I support also any aspect of it that calls on the Government to ensure that all 2019 CAP payments issue swiftly.

The Minister came back and stated that he cannot tell farmers what to do.  I do not want to tell farmers what to do.  We need farmers who are innovative and good business people.  Farmers know best how to manage the land.  They know their farms better than anyone else.  Far be it from me to tell them exactly what to do, but we need to pay them properly to deliver services we want.  We have this opportunity coming up in the CAP reform to pay farmers properly for the key front-line task they have in managing climate, restoring nature, providing high-quality food and protecting water quality.  We should pay them properly for doing that.<\/p>  <p>  We need to opt for a truly origin green approach in everything we do.  We need to get an origin green premium and pay farmers properly for the services they provide.  We do not need to do what they did in New Zealand, which was to have industrial dairy everywhere, trash the land and pollute the waters.  New Zealand is now retreating from that strategy, one which, I believe, Fine Gael is leading us towards.<\/p>  <p>  We should learn from what has gone on up North where they have gone down the way of bringing the cattle back into lots.  However, low cost, high debt, high capital, not quality and not origin green is not the way we should go.  We should opt for high animal welfare, which is what we are close to doing.  We have good farmers who manage our cattle.  We have traceability and proper measures in that regard.  We do not do it by relying on selling cattle who go off on a ship to Libya every time we have a market problem.  We do the exact opposite.  We make our product something special that meets the highest environmental and welfare standards and gets the higher price.<\/p>  <p>  When I suggested to the Minister last night that organic farming was more profitable he slightly pooh-poohed it and stated that it accounted for only 1% or 2%.  I cited Austria, for example, where the figure is 40%.  I ask the Minister of State to answer a question.  If I am selling organic beef on the market, what is my base price?  Is it &euro;4.30 or &euro;4.20 per kilogram?  What is wrong with that as a base price?  What is wrong with lower input costs and smaller breeds that will mean the farmer will not be up at 5 a.m. pulling a continental bull calf out of a cow with which one can have all sorts of difficulties.  There are smaller cattle that might fit on our land without churning it up every time it rains.<\/p>  <p>  This green approach makes sense.  It is the best secured model for Irish farming.  It belongs to every party in this House.  It does not belong to anyone but if we are going out on a brand of Origin Green, let us be really green about how we do it.

On yesterday's edition of \"Today with Sean O'Rourke\", Cormac Healy of MII stated clearly that &euro;3.60 is the base price.  I asked if he would come out and clarify if that was the position because a price of &euro;3.45 is being quoted in parts of the country.  However, as per usual, the MII did not come out and clarify the position.  The Minister needs to find out what base price is being given because depending on the part of the country one is in, there is a variance in the price.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister gave the go-ahead in respect of the POs.  He hailed it as a great step forward but, unfortunately, the factories are stonewalling.  The Minister needs to put pressure on the processors and tell them that they have to engage.<\/p>  <p>  An agreement was reached last weekend.  I stated on Sunday - I say it again now - that there are many good parts to that agreement.  The current situation needs to be resolved.  Farmers are very unclear on the base price.  That is what is causing the problem.  There are cattle and sheep waiting to be slaughtered.<\/p><p>We have to be mindful that there is a backlog and that these animals have to be killed shortly.  To put it very simply, are we going to keep going down the road where we raise cattle under protected geographical indication, PGI, status, in feed lots, where they never see daylight and look out through a barrier or are we going to raise them, as we were brought up to do in natural farming, where they had grass for most of their lives?  Are we codding people in other countries by putting this green Bord Bia symbol on cattle that for six, nine or ten months are looking out through barriers?<\/p> <p> We have the finest product in Europe, if not in the world, and we have the stock to prove it.  We have the grass to grow it and we are still not giving the farmers the premium price.  If we want to tackle this whole problem, we must put a maximum stocking limit.  I would always suggest two units per hectare to give everybody a fair chance.  We cannot continue giving derogations to feed lots and to industrialised dairy outfits, letting them export the slurry out of their farms under the nitrates.  This arose during the year where it was suggested that by spreading a little bit of lime, it would be all right.  If we continue to do that, it is like voting for the same people where we will continue to get the same result.<\/p> <p> There was warning today from Teagasc about dairy calves next year.

I have met many farmers on the picket lines and at meat processing factories around south east over the summer.  Farmers are fighting for the livelihoods as the beef industry is being brought to its knees.  These farms are producing the best grass-fed product in the world but the processors and supermarkets are being allowed to skim off the lion's share of the profits.  Our farmers have been consistently been obliged to put up with a situation where they have been the price-takers while others along the way can see their own margins and ensure massive profits.  The fact that there is no clarity as to what margins farmers get for the work they carry out in producing beef illustrates the lack of transparency in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  The so-called protesters are honest hard-working people who would much rather be at home with their families, on their land and with their stock.

There has always been farm protests about various failings in the agribusiness.

Agreement was reached at the weekend and all the farm organisations agreed to go back to the picket line but we can see how difficult it is for them to help stand down this protest.  They are finding it an incredibly hard sell.  There is a caveat in all this which is the beef producers organisation.  That can be the conduit for delivery but it is being stonewalled by the factories.  They are not returning its calls, they are not engaging with it and are not giving it the opportunity to help stand down this protest.<\/p><p>It can be done if the factories engage with the organisation.  That is the space in which the price can be negotiated and delivered.  In discussing matters this evening, however, it does not appear that we have reached that point.  We need the Minister&rsquo;s assistance.  He must intervene and somebody needs to talk to the factories.  I do not refer to the price in this regard.  That should be decided upon by the factories and the representative organisation.  It needs to happen.<\/p> <p> Last night, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine commended the beef producing organisation on coming forward and setting this up.  It is innovative and progressive.  Let us support those involved and assist them by engaging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800037#QQ00600","speaker":"1231","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568819700,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies McConalogue and Cahill for bringing forward this motion.  This is a wage negotiation for farmers.  Can the Minister of State imagine if workers involved in negotiations with their employers could not discuss their remuneration and a deal was done that did not address the wage issue?  That highlights the frustration felt by farmers.  Successive Deputies have spoken about the inconsistencies in base pricing throughout the country.  That matter must be resolved.  It goes to the heart of the lack of confidence and transparency.  One of the most important elements of the deal agreed at the weekend involves the setting up of a task force to address the beef industry.  The Minister needs to get that established immediately and to appoint somebody of credibility, whose stature is respected on all sides, to be the lead person in dealing with that task force and setting its work.  That could engender the confidence that is needed.  Transparency in respect of the base price extends to so many parts of the industry, not only to processing but also to the rendering and other areas.<\/p>  <p>  Other issues also arise.  When I was at the National Ploughing Championships yesterday, I was struck by the very up-to-date marketing in which the National Dairy Council is involved whereby it engages on Instagram and other social media platforms.  If we consider the range of dairy products that have become available in recent years and how they have evolved to suit demand, we would note that beef products have not evolved to suit demand.  In terms of beef marketing, we tell ourselves we have the best product in the world and we keep shouting about that but we must market it in a manner that is relevant to the 21st century.  If we do that, we will increase the base line.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste was in this Department.  He knows of the lack of trust that exists.  How can this deal be sold at the factory gates when people who are trying to sell the deal have been threatened with legal action for being at those gates selling the deal?  That is what has happened today, four days after the deal was done.  That is wrong.  It will not create the atmosphere we need to get this deal through.  MII has to be called out and asked to allow a little space for this deal to grow and for people to reflect and see what it involves.  That will build a type of confidence.  The Minister cannot any longer continue to stick his head in the sand and hope this will go away.  We are here now because he has had six months warning about this issue.  Deputy McConalogue has been raising it for a very long time but the Minister ignored it.  We cannot do that any longer.  We must move quickly and in a way that builds confidence and shines a light on the practices in the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800038#RR00200","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1568819700,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Sometimes the term \"crisis\" can be bandied around but that is not the position in this instance.  The beef sector in Ireland, one of the largest and best in Europe and in the world, is not only in crisis and under threat but in danger of disappearing if positive action is not taken soon.  The downward spiral in beef prices, despite being very well flagged to the Government - which ignored it, unfortunately - has resulted in protests by farmers, factories being closed, workers being laid off, other business interests, such as hauliers, being affected, etc.<\/p>  <p>  There was general relief last Wednesday when it was felt that a deal which could be implemented had been reached but that relief soon turned to despair.  This was compounded earlier today when it was reported on the radio that there is a very strong possibility beef will soon disappear from restaurant menus and that international contracts could be lost.  If that happens, there will be no coming back.<\/p>  <p>  I come from a farming background.  I have stood with the farmers in Kildare and listened to their stories, anger, frustration, despair, mistrust and sadness about being placed in such a situation.  Only this morning, I spoke to a farmer who was in tears not only because of his inability to pay his upcoming bills and to deal with the meat processors but also as a result of a level of intimidation that is happening at the protests at some of the factory gates.  That is wrong and it must be called out.  There needs to be a rebalancing in the beef supply in order to ensure fair play and transparency for farmers.  Those are the three most important terms we can use in this context.  That is what this is about, namely, the primary producer, fair play and transparency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800038#RR00300","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1568819700,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this important debate and I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for bringing forward the motion.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to be deeply committed to supporting and developing Ireland's beef sector.  I am keenly aware that the past few months have been very challenging for beef farmers and their families following a difficult year for farm incomes in 2018 due to very bad weather conditions.  There was a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices lasting from autumn 2018 to spring 2019, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit among other factors contributing to this market disturbance.<\/p>  <p>  Over the weekend, significant efforts were made to reach a resolution to the current dispute after lengthy and very tough negotiations.  Leaders of all of the main farming organisations and representatives of farmers who were still protesting agreed to recommend an agreement to their members and those at factory gates.  The agreement is a compromise.  Nobody got everything they wanted.  As Members opposite will be aware, it was not legally possible to discuss base price but the agreement contains a number of commitments relating to new and increased bonus payments that will have an immediate impact for farmers and, more importantly, a detailed package that also includes a number of commitments around transparency and fairness in the supply chain which in time will deliver greater certainty and clarity for farmers, which is what is needed.  In truth, we need to restructure the beef sector in a way that is farmer friendly, supports family farms for the future and empowers farmers to be able to negotiate with a lot more power and weight with the factories to which they are selling.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine stated, we are at a critical tipping point in this dispute, and I do not say that lightly, as somebody who is passionate about the agrifood sector and about farming.  A significant number of employees have been temporarily laid off and more are on the protective notice.  Farmers with finished stock have no outlet for their produce and the continued premium position of Irish beef on supermarket shelves both at home and abroad is under threat if this dispute continues.  I said today to many farmers to whom I spoke at the National Ploughing Championships that I believe we are very close to a point where we may do damage that is irreversible to this sector if we are not careful.  I urge all the farmers continuing to protest and to mount blockades to consider the agreement that was negotiated on their behalf in detail.  It will not deliver everything they want overnight but it is a basis for a way forward and it puts farmers in a stronger position in the supply chain.<\/p>  <p>  I was at the National Ploughing Championships for a number of hours today and even though it was a beautiful day, the sun was shining and it was probably the best organised ploughing match that I have ever been at in terms of getting in and getting out, there was tension in the air.  There was anger among many farmers.  There was a sense that there was a real absence of trust between farmers and factories.  That tension clearly is what we are seeing at the gates of many factories still.  People are desperate.  They are producing cattle, and have been doing so now for many months, for a price that is below the cost of production and we know that is not sustainable.  Given the other challenges that are also on the horizon for the beef sector, particularly around Brexit, for which I have a specific responsibility in the context of protecting the agrifood sector and farming during these negotiations, we need to be really careful we do not do significant damage here that makes the other challenges we may face in six weeks' time even more difficult to face.  I would ask farmers to think about that.  That is not saying we do not feel their anger, pain and utter frustration in many cases.<\/p><p>We do.  The farm leaders who have negotiated on their behalf understand that too but they are willing to recommend this deal because it is a basis for a way forward.  It is not an end in itself.  It is a means to deliver a better beef sector that can, as I stated earlier, empower farmers to be able to demand not only better prices by negotiating collectively through producer organisations, but also better conditions around the timing of delivery, etc., as opposed to simply being price takers at a time when factories want their product.  The whole point of producer organisations is to try to equalise that relationship in terms of how and when supply happens, at what cost and under what conditions.  That is essentially what we need to try to create in this sector.<\/p> <p> The Government is trying to provide three key pillars for beef and the beef sector in the future to ensure that family farming remains a key feature, and in many ways the heartbeat, of rural Ireland into the future.  The first is there needs to be decent financial support coming from Government and from the EU.  This is a deal, essentially, between food consumers and food producers, where taxpayers need to pay farmers to ensure that the standards of environmental protection and food safety, and animal husbandry considerations, etc., are part of the food chain.  I have always argued that the CAP is a great deal for taxpayers and consumers given the quality of the food that they get in return for it.  The second area is about producer organisations, which I am a big believer in, and the third is to ensure that we continue to diversify and develop new markets internationally.<\/p> <p> Looking at financial supports, I do not have time to talk about all the different schemes that are in place now but they are significant.  They range from the beef data and genomics programmes to a &euro;4 billion rural development programme, direct payments under CAP and GLAS, areas of natural constraints, ANCs, etc.  When there are specific challenges to the sector, as we have seen from the impact of Brexit even though it has not yet happened, that has driven prices down.  We have seen an exceptional aid measure come forward from the European Commission - a fund, of course, that was matched by the Irish taxpayer also.<\/p> <p> As we negotiate a future CAP, we need to ensure that we protect the budget as best we can.  The proposed 5% cut in the budget is something that we, along with many other EU countries, are anxious and determined to try to reverse to ensure that we still have a CAP package for the next period of CAP of approximately &euro;12 billion to support rural economies, farmers and farm families as we have done in the past.<\/p> <p> Producer organisations are something that, when I was Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, we were talking about and trying to generate.  We had a beef forum then too where we looked at all the issues that were discussed and debated, and in some cases agreed in terms of new thinking, on Sunday last.  At that time, we were talking about the need to empower farmers as a collective.  There is not much point in having 70,000 beef farmers, and another 30,000 who have some beef as part of their farm operations, if they are all individual price-takers selling animals, one by one, into the factories when the factories want them, when there is not an oversupply, etc.  Farmers have the power in their hands if they organise in a way that creates a collective strength.  One cannot have one producer organisation - that would be anti-competitive - but one can certainly have five or six where there are large numbers of farmers with a professional management team managing the sale of their produce, negotiating directly with factories around conditions and price.  That can empower the producer in a way that we have never seen previously.  That is something that we have to make work, in particular, with farming organisations, but also individual farmers.  We know that works.  If one looks at the impact on the dairy side of co-operatives in how they work, lobby and guarantee certain price floors, etc., for their members, we can do the same with producer organisations in beef, and the facilities are there to do that, and the next round of the Common Agricultural Policy can financially support that too in terms of the cost of setting them up.  I would encourage enthusiasm, but also making it a priority for Government to deliver on the potential of producer organisations, and we already have one fully recognised.<\/p> <p> The other point I would make is in terms of market development.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy Creed, and, indeed, the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, on this.  Since April 2017, we have seen beef access into China.  We have seen beef, as well as pork, access into the Ukraine.  We have seen beef and sheepmeat, and poultry, access into Qatar and Kuwait and we have seen significant steps forward in terms of Japan, Israel, Singapore, Saudi Arabia and South Africa.  The work continues but we face an immediate crisis.<\/p> <p> The question is, can we collectively solve it in the interests of farmers and their future so that we can look ahead to the next challenge on the horizon that we face linked to Brexit?  Believe me, it is a big challenge.  In my view, together we can overcome that too, but we need to get over the immediate challenges we face today that seriously threaten the viability of this sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800038#RR00400","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568820300,"counter":429,"content":"<p>To conclude, I understand we have Deputies Eugene Murphy, O'Keeffe, Brassil, Lisa Chambers and McConalogue.

With Brexit coming down the tracks and the Mercosur deal that the Government signed our country up to, farmers will be under increasing pressure for years to come.<\/p>  <p>  We need to look at the policy at an EU level as well.  If we want sustainable food produced within the European Union to feed EU citizens that is of good quality under good regulations, we need to pay for it.

It is not so many years ago that some well-known beef processors were in financial difficulties and the word was that a cheque from Anglo-Irish Beef Processors, AIBP, would definitely bounce.

I thank Sinn F&eacute;in and Deputy Naughten for their amendments, which we will be accepting.  As everyone has outlined, the debates today and yesterday take place at a time of grave uncertainty for our beef sector and great difficulty for the farming community.  What we have seen over the last weeks needs to lead to a total change in the relationships within the beef supply chain.  There is a need to ensure that farmers become respected, that they actually get full information and are a key partner in how beef is priced and in respect of the margin they get in it, that they are no longer trampled upon as has been their feeling and experience for many years now.  There is a clear understanding that the agreement from the weekend offers a basis to move forward.  However, in terms of the prices factories are offering to farmers, we also need to see the factories ensuring that the base price is the best possible price that can be offered, given the market circumstances and the background.  They need to understand that farmers must be given fair play.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to see the Government do its part and start listening to the farming community.  That certainly has not been the case up until now.  Many debates and motions have been put forward by ourselves and other parties to which the Government has not responded.

The T&aacute;naiste is here tonight.  He is in Europe very regularly and, while there has not been any commitment from him tonight in this regard, I emphasise that we need to hear him say he will go to the European Commission and seek to deliver further funding.  The beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, fund that was in place covers a reference period of September to May.  Prices have been worse since then.  The Government needs to make a contribution to support the income of farmers for the losses they have already experienced in the past few months.  We have not heard that tonight.  Overall, the lesson has to be that everyone must work together.  Farmers, who are the foundation of our food industry, must be respected for being just that.  They must not be treated as cannon fodder or expected to carry a loss while everybody else and the national Exchequer benefit from the hard work they carry out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800040#TT00500","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1568820900,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1568820900,"counter":441,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 26 September 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800040#TT00700","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Investment Limited Partnerships (Amendment) Bill 2019: Order for Second Stage","time":1568820900,"counter":442,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800040#TT00800"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1568820900,"counter":443,"content":"<p>Bill entitled an Act to amend and extend the Investment Limited Partnerships Act 1994 and the Irish Collective Asset management Vehicles Act 2015 and to provide for related matters.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1568820900,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I move:&quot;That Second Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800040#TT01000","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1568820900,"counter":445,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Investment Limited Partnerships (Amendment) Bill 2019: Second Stage","time":1568820900,"counter":446,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800040#TT01200"},{"type":"speech","time":1568820900,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to address D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann today on the Investment Limited Partnerships (Amendment) Bill 2019, which was published on 18 June 2019.  The Bill seeks to update the operation of the Investment Limited Partnerships Act to implement changes which were put forward in the IFS 2020 action plan and more recently the Ireland for Finance strategy.  The amendments proposed in the Bill will modernise the operation of investment limited partnerships, ILPs, in Ireland.  These amendments will support the further development of the funds industry in Ireland.  As part of these amendments to the ILP framework, the Bill is also making a number of technical amendments to the Irish Collective Asset Management Vehicles Act of 2015.<\/p><p> The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and I launched the Ireland for Finance strategy earlier this year.  It is a multi-annual plan setting out the Government's commitment to further develop the successful international financial services industry.  The strategy makes clear that Ireland's success in attracting top tier global financial services is set against an increasingly dynamic and competitive backdrop.  The changes I put forward today to amend the Investment Limited Partnerships Act 1994 and the Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicles Act 2015, known as the ICAV Act, form part of that strategy.  They aim to enhance Ireland's offering for investment funds and improve our robust and transparent regulatory environment for investment funds.<\/p> <p> The Irish funds industry is a key part of the internationally traded financial services sector, also referred to as the IFS.  In June 2019, there were 7,531 investment funds authorised and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Some 16,000 people are employed directly and indirectly in the industry and the industry generates substantial direct and indirect Exchequer receipts.  The funds industry in Ireland is not just based in Dublin but provides high quality jobs across the country.  Ireland's offering in alternative investment fund domiciliation is already strong due to a highly educated and motivated staff and a pro-business environment that is overseen by a regulatory regime, which is responsive to the needs of industry while all the time ensuring the protection of the interests of investors.  The intention of this Bill is to ensure our corporate structures for investment funds remain fit for purpose and maintain our strong global reputation as a jurisdiction to domicile investment funds.<\/p> <p> An investment limited partnership, ILP, is a regulated partnership structure that does not have a separate legal personality.  ILPs are tailored specifically for investment in a collective investment fund.  An ILP is formed under the Investment Limited Partnerships Act 1994 and is established once it is authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland.  It is constituted according to the partnership agreement entered into by one or more general partners, who manage the business of the partnership, and any number of limited partners.  The general partner has unlimited liability in this structure, while limited partners can, at a maximum, only lose their investment in the ILP.<\/p> <p> When compared with our other investment funds vehicles ILPs have particular advantages for specialised investment schemes such as private equity or venture capital funds which have smaller numbers of professional investors and also have more bespoke investment structures, such as investments made by partners at predetermined points in time and different ways of splitting the gains and losses from the partnership.  In an ILP, the general partner is responsible for managing the business of the ILP and is ultimately liable for the debts and obligations of the ILP to the extent that the ILP does not have sufficient assets.  An ILP is subject to oversight by the Central Bank of Ireland and will be subject to its rules regarding Irish domiciled alternative investment funds.<\/p> <p> The ILP Act has been in use since 1994.  It is widely acknowledged that it is needs to be updated to fit the environment at which it is aimed and to take account of the changes that have been introduced in Europe via the alternative investment fund managers directive, AIFMD.  This revision is aimed at modernising the legislation by making changes such as allowing an advisory role in the management of the fund for limited partners without putting their limited liability at risk.  The changes proposed in this Bill will enable Irish industry to compete for some of the global private equity market that to date has chosen other European or global locations to base such investment funds.<\/p> <p> The Bill also makes minor changes to the ICAV Act 2015, including correcting typographical errors and aligning the Act with other company legislation.  The ICAV is a legal structure for the holding of investment schemes established in accordance with the ICAV Act 2015.  The ICAV structure was specifically designed to be distinguishable from a trading company.  A number of Irish company law provisions are often irrelevant or inappropriate to investment funds and can create unintended consequences where applied in the funds context.  I will set out later the changes being made to the ICAV legislation in this Bill which are technical in nature.<\/p> <p> I will now outline the key features of the Bill.  The Bill contains three Parts.  Part 1 is the preliminary and general section, Part 2 relates to ILPs and Part 3 to the ICAV Act.  The first Part of the Bill consists of three sections.  It deals with preliminary matters and contains definitions used in the Bill.  Section 1 provides in standard form for the Short Title and commencement.  Section 2 provides in a standard form the collective citation.  Section 3 is a standard form for clarifying the Acts referred to in the Bill which are the Investment Limited Partnerships Act 1994 and the Irish Collective Asset-management Act 2015.<\/p> <p> A number of changes to ILPs relate to alignment with EU and domestic funds legislation, for example, changing the term \"custodian\" to \"depositary\".  There are also some typographical corrections, correction of cross-references and replacement of the term \"Companies Act 1963\" with \"Companies Act 2014\".  Section 4 adds definitions for new terms relating to \"alternative foreign name\", \"depositary\", and \"limited partner\".  The section also transfers responsibility for the Act from the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation to the Minister for Finance.<\/p> <p> Section 5 replaces the word \"custodian\" with \"depositary\" throughout the Act of 1994 to align it with other funds legislation.  Sections 6 and 35 insert text to permit the establishment of umbrella funds.  These sub-funds permit the establishment of a fund with several distinct sub-funds that are traded as individual investment funds but are not liable for the debts of the other sub-funds under the umbrella.  These funds will share a general partner but are ring-fenced from each other in the event of insolvency.  This \"umbrella\" framework also exists in other investment fund vehicles, including ICAVs and common contractual funds.<\/p> <p> Section 7 amends section 6(4) of the Act of 1994 to permit a limited partner to participate on boards and committees related to an investment limited partnership.  This adds board participation to the \"White List\", a list of activities which, if undertaken by a limited partner, will be deemed not to be taking part in the conduct of the business and so does not result in loss of liability for a limited partner.  The white list concept is common to limited partnership regimes in other jurisdictions such as in the Legislative Reform (Private Fund Limited Partnerships) Order 2017 in the United Kingdom, which clearly sets out the actions that are not regarded as taking part in the management of the partnership business for the limited partner.<\/p> <p> Section 8 amends section 8(4) of the Act of 1994 to correct the reference to the fee prescribed under the Central Bank Act 1942.  This is to correct a typographical error.  Section 9 amends section 8(4A) of the Act of 1994 correcting a cross-reference, adding reference to the \"alternative foreign name\", changing the \"Companies Act 1963\" reference to the \"Companies Act 2014\" and deleting the reference to \"and address\".<\/p> <p> Section 10 adds a new section 8(4B) to the Act of 1994 to allow the use of an alternative foreign name in the case of foreign investment limited partnerships.  Section 11 amends section 8 of the Act of 1994 by adding a new section 8A to give the Central Bank the power to refuse to authorise an investment limited partnership where the name, or alternative foreign name, of the ILP is deemed undesirable.<\/p> <p> Section 12 substitutes section 10 of the Act of 1994 with new requirements for the Central Bank of Ireland to maintain records of all investment limited partnerships authorised.  That is to align the requirements with records maintained with other funds legislation.  Section 13 amends section 11(1) of the Act of 1994.  Section 11(1A) of the 1994 Act sets out the requirements for amending a partnership agreement, requiring all partners to be notified prior to an alteration and provides for alterations in writing via the agreement of the majority of partners, provided the existing partnership agreement allows for changes via majority.<\/p><p>Section 11(1B) of the 1994 Act allows for alterations to the partnership agreement to be implemented if the depositary certifies in writing that the alteration does not prejudice the interests of the limited partnerships, provided that the alteration is not one which the Central Bank of Ireland stipulates must be made via section 11(1), and that the partnership agreement provides that the depositary has the power to certify that the alteration does not prejudice the interests.<br\/><br\/>Section 14 adds two new subsections to section 11 of the Act of 1994.  Section 11(5) creates a statutory transfer of assets and liabilities on the admission or replacement of a general partner, so that all rights or property of the investment limited partnership shall vest in the incoming partner or existing general partners.  Section 11(6) sets out a similar provision on the withdrawal of a general partner, wherein all rights or property of the investment limited partnership shall vest in the remaining partner or existing partners.<br\/><br\/>Section 15 amends section 12(2) of the Act of 1994 to stipulate that the words &quot;investment limited partnership&quot; or &ldquo;comhph&aacute;irt&iacute;ocht theoranta infheist&iacute;ochta&rdquo;, or &quot;CTI&quot;, which the Irish acronym for ILP, must be used at the end of the name of every investment limited partnership.  It also states that where an investment limited partnership is permitted to use an alternative foreign name, it must use the words &quot;investment limited partnership&quot; at the end of the name in the same language as the alternative foreign name.<br\/><br\/>Sections 16 and 17 are technical amendments relating to the maintenance of the register of the ILP.  Section 18 deletes section 14(3) of the Act of 1994.  Section 19 inserts a new subsection 19A to the Act of 1994 setting out the meaning of &quot;majority of limited partners&quot; for different purposes, for example, in regard to rights or interests of a majority of the limited partners, and in regard to its use of simple majority.<br\/><br\/>Section 20 replaces section 20 of the Act of 1994 and sets out how capital contributions by limited partners and liability of limited partners for partnership debts operates.  Section 21 rewords and expands section 22(2) of the Act of 1994 for greater clarification.  Section 22 clarifies that section 30 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 only applies where the general partner adjudicated bankrupt is the sole general partner.  Section 23 amends section 24(4) of the Act of 1994 by inserting two subsections to permit the investment limited partnership to purchase insurance for a general partner or auditor, or former general partner of a former auditor, to indemnify him against any liability in the event of a case of negligence or default where the general partner or auditor is found not be negligent or in default.<br\/><br\/>Section 24 amends section 24, subsections (5) and (6), of the Act of 1994 to ensure that if the partnership agreement provides that where a partner fails to perform any of its obligations under, or otherwise breaches, the partnership agreement, the sanctions applicable for the failure of performance or breach will not be unenforceable solely because they are penal in nature.  This is necessary because courts in Ireland and other common law jurisdictions have previously determined that provisions in an agreement which impose additional obligations on a party in the event of a breach or a default may be unenforceable if they are subsequently adjudicated to be penal in nature.<br\/><br\/>Section 25 amends section 25, subsections (1) and (4), of the Act of 1994, substituting &quot;a general partner&quot; for &quot;every general partner&quot; in subsection (1) and &quot;subsidiary&quot; for &quot;associated undertaking&quot; in subsection (4).  Section 26 amends section 27 of the Act of 1994 to provide greater clarification of the subsection being referenced and rewording of text.  Section 27 amends section 29 of the Act of 1994 by deleting subsection (3) to remove the requirement for the bank to publish notice of revocation of authorisation in Iris Oifigi&uacute;il.  Section 28 amends section 31(1) of the Act of 1994 by inserting the words &quot;or depositary&quot; after &quot;proposed new general partner&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Section 29 amends section 33(3) of the Act of 1994.  It is a technical amendment to require the general partner to notify the limited partners of a direction from the bank immediately upon receipt.<br\/><br\/>Section 30 amends section 35 of the Act of 1994 to correct a typographical error: section 35, subsections (7) and (8), are updated to refer to &quot;officer of such a general partner&quot; rather than &quot;officer of the investment limited partnership.&quot;<br\/><br\/>Section 31 amends section 37 of the Act of 1994.  Section 37, subsection (1), is amended to clarify that there must be at least one general partner so as to avoid conflict with section 5(1)(b) of the Act of 1994.  Section 37, subsections (2) and (3), are amended so that the partnership is not immediately dissolved in the case of death, but within a time period as specified by the Central Bank of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Section 32 clarifies that the limited partner does not have unlimited liability for the debts of the partnership once the partnership is dissolved unless the limited partner purports to carry on the business of the partnership after dissolution.  Section 33 amends section 39 of the Act of 1994 to ensure that limited partners who do not take any part in the conduct of the business of the partnership cannot be prosecuted for any offences committed in the management of the partnership.<br\/><br\/>Section 34 amends the Act of 1994 by adding section 42A after section 42.  Section 42A seeks to align the ability of an investment limited partnership to indemnify against liability with the ICAV Act 2015 and the Companies Act 2014.  This reflects the changes that were introduced under the EU AIFMD, which provides for a liability regime for depositories set out under European legislation.<br\/><br\/>Section 37 adds a new section 2A to the ICAV Act 2015, providing supplemental interpretation provisions regarding ordinary and special resolutions.  Section 38 amends sections 5 and 6 of the Act of 2015 to provide that the sole object in an ICAV constitutional document reflects Regulation 4(3)(a) of the UCITS Regulations (European Communities (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) Regulations 2011 (S.l. No. 352 of 2011)).  Section 39 adds a new section 8A to the Act of 2015 to ensure that the validity of an act done by an ICAV shall not be called into question on the ground of lack of capacity by reason of anything contained in the ICAV's instrument of incorporation, without affecting the duty of the directors of an ICAV to observe any limitation on their powers.<br\/><br\/>Section 40 adds a new section 8B to the Act of 2015 after section 8A to provide that a contract entered into outside the <i>vires<\/i>of an ICAV is nevertheless enforceable.  The Company Law Review Group recommended in its First Report 2000-2001 that the <i>ultra vires<\/i>doctrine be abolished for companies limited by shares.  The omission of such a provision in the ICAV Act was not intentional and this amendment is to bring the Act in line with this recommendation.<br\/><br\/>Section 41 amends section 14(2) of the Act of 2015 to require the Central Bank of Ireland to update the register following the change of name of an ICAV.  Section 42 amends section 30 of the Act of 2015 to require the Central Bank of Ireland to alter the copy of the registration order and notify the ICAV of the same following the change of name of an ICAV.  Section 43 amends section 32 of the Act of 2015 by deleting subsection (7), removing the requirement for the director of an ICAV acting on behalf of various ICAVs to sign an agreement multiple times in respect of the various ICAVs to which that agreement relates.<br\/><br\/>Section 44 amends section 33 of the Act of 2015 by inserting a new subsection (4) after subsection (3), clarifying the requirements for affixing or attesting to the affixing of the seal in circumstances where an ICAV has a seal.  This aligns with similar provisions in the Companies Act 2014.  Section 45 adds a new section 85A to the Act of 2015 to allow an officer of an ICAV to make an application to the court in anticipation of apprehended proceedings.<br\/><br\/>Section 46 adds Part 5A after Part 5 of the Act of 2015 containing three new sections - sections 91A, 91B, and 91C - regarding written resolutions.  This is to align the Act with the similar provisions in sections 193 to 195, inclusive, of the Companies Act 2014.  This change will provide for written resolutions by members of an ICAV in regard to the ICAV itself or a sub-fund, as well as the existing ordinary and special resolutions at a general meeting.  This amendment also requires two additional amendments: sections 36 and 51.  Section 36 amends section 2 of the Act of 2015 by adding a new definition of &quot;Category 4 offence&quot; to the definitions.  Section 51 amends section 186 of the Act of 2015 by inserting a new subsection after subsection (3) stating that a person guilty of a category 4 offence under the Act shall be liable to a class A fine.<\/p><p>Section 47 amends section 96 of the 2015 Act by substituting a new subsection (8) clarifying that where an investment company converts to an ICAV, the priority of pre-existing charges should remain unchanged.<br\/><br\/>I have a couple of pages left.  It is important to put this on the record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800040#TT01300","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568822700,"counter":451,"content":"<p>The Minister may do so if we get agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800043#WW00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1568822700,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I am happy for the Minister of State to continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800043#WW00300","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1568822700,"counter":453,"content":"<p>Section 48 amends section 140 of the 2015 Act to correct a typographical error by substituting \"waived\" for \"varied\" to reflect the language used in section 1490 of the Companies Act 2014.<\/p>  <p>  Section 49 amends section 141(1) of the 2015 Act by inserting \"being the debts identified for the purposes of subsection (2)(b)\" after \"debts\".

I intend to bring forward a number of technical changes to provide some additional clarity to the operation of the Bill following ongoing consultation with industry.  In addition, there will be a substantive amendment related to the introduction of a beneficial ownership register for ILPs.  This is to ensure any investors in an ILP structure will be treated the same as one in our other investment funds vehicles with separate legal personality or structured as a trust.  The requirements of a beneficial ownership register on those other vehicles have been introduced via provisions in the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, which do not apply to ILPs due to its partnership structure.  Therefore, this important amendment will ensure a level playing field in the area of transparency for Ireland's corporate vehicles for investment funds and ensure that such entities meet the best international anti-money laundering standards.  My officials are continuing to consider another potential amendment to provide for the redomiciliation of ILPs.  These are complex amendments and are still being worked on by officials, who are engaging with the relevant State bodies and industry.  If work is completed satisfactorily on these additional amendments, I will move them on Committee Stage.  I wish to signal my intention to do so at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the outline I have given will help Deputies understand the background and context underlining the benefits which will arise from the Bill.  The Irish funds industry is, as I highlighted earlier, an important part of our international financial services sector based in Ireland.  It is a significant employer and a sector we hope to see grow and deepen its links into the Irish economy throughout the country.  Given its importance, it is now timely to make some legislative amendments to the framework, and I believe that this Bill will do just that.  I look forward to hearing Members' contributions and assure them that I will be happy to provide any further clarifications they may need.<\/p>  <p>  I will make just one final point, and I appreciate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's indulgence.  The industry tells me that with the passing of this legislation an additional 1,500 people will be employed directly because of the extent to which private equity will be based in Ireland.  We currently have no such jobs.  That is where we find ourselves.  This Bill addresses that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800043#WW00400","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1568822700,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on the Bill.  It is appropriate to recognise the great success we have had in the area of international financial services.  Successive Governments have worked on the sector.  We as a party are very proud of the role we played in the 1980s in the establishment of the IFSC here in Dublin.  Since then, international financial services have developed right throughout the country, and that is important to recognise.<\/p>  <p>  Even in the Minister of State's plan for the next five years or so he has acknowledged some remarkable statistics, with 44,000 people now employed in international financial services.  Fourteen of the top 15 global aircraft lessors are now based in Ireland.  Ireland is home to 20 of the world's top 25 financial services companies.  With more than &euro;4 trillion in fund assets under administration, Ireland is the third largest global investment funds domicile, the largest European domicile for exchange-traded funds, ETFs, and a leading location worldwide for hedge fund administration.  Seventeen of the top 20 global banks and 11 of the world's top 15 insurance companies have a presence in Ireland, and the Irish cross-Border insurance sector, the report points out, writes business into more than 100 countries with more than 25 million customers.  By any yardstick, this is a very impressive record that Ireland has accrued over time in international financial services.  This success cannot be taken for granted because this is a very dynamic industry in which the pace of change is rapid and the nature of the investment is highly mobile.  We are increasingly facing a very competitive international environment, and this must be acknowledged and at the fore of the debate on the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Within the overall figure of 44,000 people, as the Minister of State said, more than 16,000 people are directly employed in the Irish funds industry, which is part of the wider international financial services industry.  In that regard, Indecon, which carried out an independent impact assessment for Irish Funds, the industry body, of the industry's contribution to the Exchequer, put the figure at &euro;837 million per annum.  I saw this in real terms only last week in Cork, where the T&aacute;naiste officiated at the official opening of the new Clearstream offices in Cork city, part of the Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group, which operates within the funds industry in the depository space, providing post-trade infrastructure and security services.  It now directly employs close to 500 people in the heart of Cork city, having moved in from Cork Airport Business Park.  That is a phenomenal success story and we want to see much more of it.  The Minister of State has had success in Wexford as well in bringing aspects of the fund industry there - or encouraging it, I should say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800043#WW00500","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1568822700,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Enticing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800043#WW00600","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1568822700,"counter":456,"content":"<p>We want to see more of that spread around the country in line with that trend because it is important.<\/p>  <p>  All that is on the positive side.  I do have to make a criticism of the delay in getting the Bill to the floor of the House.  I have been asking questions for probably two years at this stage about the investment limited partnerships legislation.  It has been pointed out to me, and no doubt to the Minister of State, on many occasions that the delay in bringing forward this legislation and in modernising the framework for ILPs in Ireland has cost us investment, particularly in the context of Brexit.  Many decisions relating to ILPs have been already made, from which Ireland has not benefited.  I think we have missed out on some benefits, but it is important we now move as quickly as we can while at the same time getting the legislation right.  By the Minister of State's own acknowledgement, the legislative architecture has not kept pace with market or regulatory developments, so it is past time we focus on this legislation.  I hope we can get it enacted in a reasonably short timeframe.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State took us through the detail of the Bill in his opening speech and indicated that he intends to bring forward a number of amendments relating to the introduction of a beneficial ownership register for ILPs.  He acknowledges that this is a complex area.  I hope the work on those amendments will not delay us significantly and that we can move quickly because quite some time ago the members of the Oireachtas finance committee, on my suggestion, agreed to waive the right to pre-legislative scrutiny in order to try to get this legislation through the system.<\/p><p>The goodwill is there on our part to facilitate the passage of this Bill while also subjecting it to detailed examination on Committee and Report Stages in the normal fashion.<\/p> <p> As the Minister of State outlined, an ILP is essentially a regulated partnership structure that does not have a separate legal personality.  It is important to acknowledge that for a quarter of a century, Ireland has been a leading domicile for internationally distributed investment funds.  Over that time, we have built a solid reputation as a well-regulated EU location for investment funds and a centre of excellence for services provided to investment funds, whether oversight, fund administration or depository legal compliance and audit.  While we have had much success in the so-called open-ended fund structures, we have had much less success in the closed-ended space in which this ILP structure sits.  That type of structure lends itself more as the vehicle of choice for investment in the real economy because it meets the requirements of long-term professional investors in ways that are hard to achieve in other fund structures.  It is important to make that point and make the connection between the ILP structure and potential benefits it can bring for the real economy by way of actual investments that can deliver significant benefits to the country.<\/p> <p> I understand that of more than 7,000 regulated investment funds in Ireland, only six or seven are ILPs, as the Minister of State mentioned.  A limited partnership fund is a form of business partnership which is common globally in many of the key jurisdictions with which we compete.  It is a common fund structure which is used as a vehicle for investment in the real economy.  Given that the ILP legislation is 23 years old, it has been acknowledged already that it has not kept pace with developments in this area, including the most important regulatory development in the alternative investment fund space, the 2013 alternative investment fund managers directive or AIFMD.<\/p> <p> I have been engaging, as I know the Minister of State has, with the sector for some time now to try to get a handle on what this legislation means from its perspective.  We must have our own independent examination of that.  I know the Central Bank was heavily involved in drafting the legislation.  It is important to note that this is very much a regulated sector and ILPs are a regulated fund structure.  The Central Bank will have the full suite of regulatory and enforcement powers at its disposal in respect of these fund structures under the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013.  It is important to make clear that we are not talking about the wild west.  These are highly regulated, sophisticated fund structures which will be monitored closely by the Central Bank.  The Minister of State will need to reassure us that the Central Bank will be adequately resourced to meet the extra regulatory burden that will inevitably follow if there is major growth in the ILP space.  As many as 1,500 jobs could be created in the coming years, which would mean considerable activity relating to ILP fund structures.  The Central Bank will need to be resourced and have adequate expertise to ensure the area is properly regulated.  That is a key point.  The Central Bank carries out extensive reporting, including monthly and quarterly statistical reporting which is done on an aggregated basis, on all Irish regulated investment funds.  As I understand, however, this reporting is not done specifically for any type of fund legal structure such as ILPs.<\/p> <p> It is important that we examine in detail the nature of these fund structures and the impact they will have on tax, which will no doubt feature in the Committee Stage debate.  Unlike corporate entities, partnerships are treated as transparent for tax purposes.  Partnership funds, including ILPs, follow the same treatment.  In essence, it means that investors or limited partners are treated as directly holding the underlying assets in the ILP and are taxed accordingly.  Similar to other funds, when an ILP makes distributions to the limited partners, the limited partner will be taxed in its home jurisdiction according to the tax treatment applicable to it.  As limited partners directly own a portion of the underlying assets, the investors can be subject to tax on capital gains or income even where they have not received the relevant cash proceeds.  This is the case under the Irish tax system where investors, both resident and non-resident, will be individually liable to pay any taxes as they fall due in respect of Irish assets that they hold.  An investor will have the same tax liabilities whether it purchases the asset itself or, alternatively, invests in an ILP which purchases the asset through that structure.  We will tease out in greater detail on Committee Stage the taxation issues involved here.  From my examination, I do not see any basis for an argument that the introduction of this legislation will facilitate tax avoidance because the investors are directly accountable and liable for their own tax liabilities on the basis that they are holding the assets directly as opposed to as a collective.  It does not seem at this point to be a tax-driven structure.  We will examine that matter on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> ILPs can be a very important vehicle for real investments.  They typically invest in a very broad range of assets, ranging from equities and bonds to investments in non-listed companies, infrastructure, renewable energy and real estate.  It is expected that the most significant proportion of the investment will be private equity in the area of non-listed companies, including venture capital in small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and start-ups, growth investing in established companies, and buy-outs.  It is important to point out who the end investors are likely to be.  They are professional investors and typically institutional investors.  Investment in such funds comes predominantly from public pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, private sector pension funds and insurance companies.  These institutional investors account for about three quarters of all investment in ILPs.<\/p> <p> The Fianna F&aacute;il Party is supportive of the Bill.  We would like to see it progress to the next Stage as quickly as possible.  We will engage collaboratively on Committee Stage and closely examine the Bill and any amendments the Minister of State proposes.  It is important that the ILP legislation is updated.  This will bring benefits for Ireland.  It will facilitate further expansion of international financial services here and that is to be welcomed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800043#WW00700","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568823300,"counter":458,"content":"<p>Deputy Pearse Doherty, who is at the National Ploughing Championships, sends his apologies.

There are an awful lot of Bills that are being held up through money messages and there are Opposition Bills dealing with a lot of the pressing issues that are bearing down on many families but the Government finds the time to bring forward this technical legislation which is aimed at a tiny number of people who live here.<\/p> <p> The Irish investment limited partnership product was established under the 1994 Act.  It was thought then that the ILP would become a popular investment vehicle for real estate investments and private equity.  We know that the Bill before us is intended to update the existing ILP regime and make Ireland an attractive place for international investors.  The ILP is a partnership whose primary business is investment in property of all kinds.  It consists of one general partner who assumes unlimited liability and limited partners who assume assets and liabilities in proportion only to the capital they each contribute.  The partnership does not have an independent legal status like a normal company but the profits are owned by the partners with each able to use tax reliefs available to that partnership.  Unlike the general partner, the limited partner cannot take part in the management of the firm without taking on full liability for the partnership's debt and liabilities.  The ILP is established as an alternative investment fund, AIF, and is regulated by the Central Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800044#XX00200","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568823900,"counter":460,"content":"<p>We will return to Second Stage of the Bill after the next debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800045#YY00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1568823900,"counter":461,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union: Statements","time":1568823900,"counter":462,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800045#YY00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1568823900,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to again brief the D&aacute;il on developments on Brexit.  There have been significant shifts in British politics over the summer impacting on Brexit but before focusing on developments, it is worth recalling the priorities which have shaped the Government's approach to Brexit negotiations from the outset.  These were: the need to protect the Northern Ireland peace process; maintaining the common travel area; minimising the impact on trade and the economy; influencing the future of the European Union and maintaining a strong Ireland-UK relationship.  Throughout this process, we have maintained a remarkably consistent approach and have worked with a broad range of stakeholders, at home and across the EU, to minimise the impacts for our citizens and businesses as much as possible.  It remains the case that Brexit presents a unique and unprecedented challenge for Ireland.  Its impact, particularly in the case of no deal, will be considerable.<\/p>  <p>  Turning now to the state of play in the EU-UK talks, in December 2018 the EU and UK agreed a withdrawal agreement and a political declaration.  As it stands, the best way to ensure an orderly Brexit remains through that withdrawal agreement.  The withdrawal agreement is a fair and balanced outcome that addresses the key concerns of both sides.  It also allows us to move on to building the strongest possible future relationship with the UK after its departure.  Despite what we are hearing from London and elsewhere, the EU has demonstrated a significant degree of flexibility and compromise to date.  We also always negotiated in good faith.  The Prime Minister, Mr. Johnson, has stated that he is seriously looking for a deal, along with his firm determination to leave the EU on 31 October.  His visit to Dublin last week was helpful, as was his meeting earlier this week with President Juncker.  We welcome the intensification of discussions between the European Commission and the UK.  However, meetings are not enough.  The UK must match its stated aspirations with actions.  It is now vital that the UK side bring forward proposals for the EU side to consider.  The UK has communicated its wish to remove the backstop but has made no concrete proposals on how to replace it in order to achieve the same outcomes, with the same legal certainty.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland and our EU partners stand by the withdrawal agreement.  However, we are also committed to finding a way forward.  We want to be helpful.  We are willing to consider proposals that might break the impasse so long as they provide the same operational and legal protections as the backstop.  Ireland cannot move away from an agreed negotiated position to an unknown and untested solution.  That is simply a non-starter.  This approach is fully supported by our EU partners and it is important to recall that the backstop has had the support of a cross-community majority of the people of Northern Ireland since it was negotiated.  The Government continues to maintain close contact with the Commission and other EU partners.  I have had the opportunity over the past few weeks to speak with Michel Barnier and to meet with EU colleagues to reflect on where things are going.  The unity of the EU 27 remains strong and intact.  We continue also to engage with the UK.  As well as the Taoiseach meeting the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, I have, in recent weeks, met the Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, Brexit Secretary, Stephen Barclay, and Northern Ireland Secretary, Julian Smith, on many occasions, as well as with Michael Gove.  While we have plenty to discuss, we are very clear with our UK counterparts that Brexit negotiations cannot be bilateralised and must be conducted with the Commission.<\/p>  <p>  Much of the focus of the debate, particularly in the House of Commons, has been on the backstop.  A key priority for Ireland, which is shared by our EU partners, has been the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement, and to protect the EU's Single Market and Ireland's place in it, now and in the future.  In December 2017, the EU and the UK set out their shared understanding of what needed to be addressed regarding the Border, and they made commitments in how to address that.  This was the basis for the backstop, contained within the withdrawal agreement, recognising the importance of avoiding a hard Border to the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the UK's red lines.  It followed the intensive mapping of North-South co-operation and months of detailed forensic negotiations on isolating only the elements of the Single Market and customs union necessary to avoid a hard Border.  The backstop is the only viable solution on the table that avoids any physical infrastructure and related checks and controls, fully protects the Good Friday Agreement and North-South co-operation and preserves the all-island economy, as well the integrity of the EU Single Market and Ireland's place in it.  No one has yet come up with any alternatives aimed at avoiding a hard Border that match what is safeguarded by the backstop.<\/p>  <p>  This is far more than an economic issue.  It is a guarantee that there is a clear plan and commitment to engage temporary, minimal measures to preserve the delicate balance of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process, if needed.  The European Union set stable, predictable foundations for trade in goods and services, freedom of movement, questions of equality and of rights, citizenship and identity, cultural and educational exchanges and cross-Border co-operation on this island.  Many areas of North-South co-operation expressly rely on our common EU framework and the avoidance of a hard Border, including related customs or regulatory checks and controls.  In areas from agriculture, environment and transport to health, education and tourism, cross-Border co-operation and community ties will be undermined by a no-deal Brexit or by any approach that does not have the level of safeguards and protections provided by the backstop.<\/p>  <p>  The idea of an all-island sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, area has been floated.  The alignment of SPS rules should form part of any solution, but would clearly not be enough by itself.  Agreeing to this limited approach would have considerable negative impacts on life on both sides of the Border, without the additional regulatory alignment provided for by the protocol.  This is why the backstop remains an absolutely necessary part of the withdrawal agreement and the UK proposal to completely abolish the backstop is totally unacceptable to both Ireland and the EU.  We saw this again in the European Parliament today in how they voted on the debate.  As Michel Barnier stated in Brussels last week, the EU remains firm on its three core objectives, namely, avoiding a hard Border on the island of Ireland, preserving the integrity of the EU Single Market, and protecting North-South co-operation and the all-island economy.  It is deeply disappointing that the British Government has decided now to step back from its commitments of December 2017.  Equally, its stance on the future relationship, its wish to diverge from the EU and its rejection of level playing field issues make things more problematic.<\/p><p> We do not want a no-deal outcome &ndash; that is clear &ndash; but neither can we afford to take the chance of undermining the Good Friday Agreement or of putting ourselves in a position where our place in the Single Market is jeopardised by unproven solutions or, worse still, future promises.  As we have said all along, the backstop is an insurance policy, and we have no intention or wish to trap the UK in any arrangement against its will.<\/p> <p> As I have made clear on many occasions, in the absence of a withdrawal agreement, there are no easy solutions.  Ireland is working closely with the European Commission to address our shared twin objectives of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, and protecting the Single Market and Ireland's place in it.  I refer to interim arrangements we would need to put in place in the event of no deal that do not involve physical infrastructure at the Border.  These are highly politically sensitive and technically complex issues, and more precise details will not be available until discussions with the Commission reach a conclusion.  We are meeting representatives of the Commission again this week to discuss that.  The goal is to reach an outcome with the Commission that enables us to provide reassurance to member states that Ireland is taking sufficient steps to protect the integrity of the Single Market, thus protecting our position within it.  Any arrangements for the Border in a no-deal scenario will be temporary.  They cannot provide the same level of protection as the backstop, and will result in significant disruption for Northern Ireland and the all-island economy.  Only the backstop can fully protect the Single Market, avoid a hard border and protect the all-island economy, which is what it sets out to do.<\/p> <p> A no-deal Brexit will unavoidably mean far-reaching change on the island of Ireland.  North-South trade would no longer be as frictionless as it is today.  Tariffs would apply.  The impact of customs and SPS requirements and associated checks, necessary to protect Ireland's place in the Single Market, would be significant to the operation of the all-island economy.  The need to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process remains central, deal or no deal.  The concerns of everyone in Northern Ireland - of all communities and backgrounds and who are deeply anxious about the impact of Brexit &ndash; are a matter of genuine concern to this Government.  I am referring to unionists, nationalists and those who identify as neither.  As the Taoiseach made clear to Prime Minister Johnson, it remains the position that the issue of protecting the Good Friday Agreement, including the issues relating to the Border, will need to be resolved in advance of opening negotiations on the future EU-UK relationship.<\/p> <p> A no-deal outcome will never be Ireland's or the EU&rsquo;s choice.  Unfortunately, prudence means this is a scenario we must plan for.  We have been clear since the beginning that every form of Brexit has negative consequences, and a no-deal Brexit is the worst-case scenario.  The Government has been actively preparing for Brexit for more than two years to make sure that Irish citizens and businesses are as ready as possible for all scenarios.  This has the highest priority across government, and involves every Department and key agencies, in tandem with the EU.<\/p> <p> Our consistent message has been that a no-deal Brexit will have profound implications for Ireland on all levels.  This is why we have published two comprehensive contingency action plans, setting out the impact of a no-deal Brexit and the work being done to mitigate these risks and passed key legislation to protect our citizens and support the economy, enterprise and jobs in key economic sectors.  Other parties have played a key role in helping us to do that.  We have held over 1,200 events relating to stakeholder preparedness in all key sectors.  I will be at another tomorrow night in a Border county.  We provided training and financial supports to increase our customs capacity.  We included dedicated measures to get Ireland Brexit ready in budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019.  We continue to implement the steps laid out in the July contingency action plan update - steps to be taken between now and 31 October.  These measures are working, I am glad to say.  Take the example of Revenue's trader engagement programme.  Since July, Revenue has contacted approximately 92,000 businesses that traded with the UK last year.  It wrote to all 92,000 and I understand it had follow-up telephone calls with about 44,000 of them.  This has helped to foster significant growth in the number of businesses taking the key step of registering for an EORI number.  Businesses registered for EORI numbers now represent 88% of the value of import trade and 96% of the value of export trade with the UK in 2018.  This approach underlines why it is so important that exposed businesses, in particular, prepare for no deal.  Many have, and we are working with companies, mainly smaller ones, to ensure everyone will be ready on time.  To support businesses in this, we recently launched Getting Your Business Brexit Ready - Practical Steps, a campaign that focuses on the nine steps every business, large or small, should take now to help it prepare for Brexit pragmatically.<\/p> <p> At this week's National Ploughing Championships, a dedicated Brexit hub has been engaging with business and citizens on steps they can take.  I saw it in action earlier today and I was encouraged by the level of activity and people's awareness of the issues they need to prepare for.  Funding supports for businesses have been an important pillar of the Government's preparations for Brexit and dedicated measures have been made available over the last three budgets.  Budget 2019 included the introduction of the future growth loan scheme, with &euro;300 million to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment, and over &euro;450 million in supports in previous budgets.  Budget 2020, which will be in three weeks, will be based on the assumption of a no-deal Brexit, which is necessary if we are to be prudent.  In that context, the Government is considering the provision of timely, targeted, temporary measures for the sectors most exposed.  We know what they are.  They include the fishing, tourism and hospitality, farming and agrifood sectors.<\/p> <p> The Government is prepared for a no-deal Brexit and stands ready to support the economy in such a scenario.  There is clearly no perfect level of preparation.  The more time we have, the more we can do, but we have done a considerable amount to prepare the country for the disruption it may have to deal with.<\/p> <p> We welcome the publication, at the start of this month, of the Commission's Brexit preparedness communication, including proposals to roll over the timelines for existing contingency measures in certain key areas from an Irish perspective, including on air connectivity and international road haulage.  The contingency plans for air connectivity have been rolled forward until the end of October and those for haulage until the middle of July of next year, I believe.  Both sets of plans have been pushed back by approximately six months.<\/p> <p> The proposal to extend EU-level financial supports in the case of no deal to support member states and affected workers is also welcome.  At the same time, our work on securing the land bridge is continuing.  There are some things we can influence and some we cannot but certainly in all the areas we can influence, we have been doing that.  We have been doing it effectively.  The land bridge will remain a strategically important link for Ireland in order to get our products to and from the Single Market, which we value.  Brexit unavoidably means, however, that the way operators use the land bridge will have to change.  Physical capacity at our ports and airports has been enhanced and additional staff have been recruited.  We are working with our European partners to clarify their plans for the operation of the land bridge at their ports.  Despite this, as we have said in the action plan, it is likely that there will be initial delays at ports in the early weeks.  I thank France, in particular, for the commitment it has made, particularly at Calais and perhaps other ports, to separate Irish and British trucks coming off ships into lanes in order to ensure that ours do not get stuck in the queues in which many from the UK will certainly be stuck, at least initially.<\/p><p> I again state how much we appreciate the support and advice received from people all sides of the House in respect of these complex issues.  We will continue to keep the House fully informed of developments relating to this matter, which has far-reaching implications for all of us.  We regret the UK's decision to leave and we believe that both parties will be diminished as a result.  The fact remains, however, that the UK is due to leave the European Union and we need to prepare for that.  The Government will continue to represent and protect the interests of Ireland.  It is for London to decide what it intends to do next.  Time is very short.  However, there is still time to find sensible solutions.  This Government will continue to engage in good faith to find a way forward with all involved and with all who have a stake in the outcome.  Regardless of the outcome, Brexit will, come what may, bring real and significant change for us all.  We continue to prepare, but we are doing so with confidence as an active and committed member state of the EU.  Let us not forget that our biggest contingency in all scenarios remains our ongoing EU membership and all of the support, solidarity, and security which it brings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800045#YY00500","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568825100,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Haughey and Troy.  With six weeks to go until 31 October, we are facing the very real threat of a no-deal Brexit.  We should heed the numerous warning from many EU leaders, including Jean-Claude Juncker who warned earlier today that there is very little time left and that the risk of a no-deal is very real.  Despite the persistent political instability in the United Kingdom, it is important that Ireland keeps its cool during the increasingly tense few weeks ahead.  Fianna F&aacute;il will do its part and continue to act responsibly to help provide stability during these turbulent times.<\/p>  <p>  The Government must be honest and transparent regarding its preparations for the worst-case scenario, namely, a potential no-deal outcome.  We still have no answer to very obvious and genuine questions and the Government continues to keep citizens and businesses in the dark about what a no-deal Brexit will mean for the Border and for trade on the island.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes the backstop to be an integral part of the withdrawal agreement and that it must remain in place.  The backstop protects the Good Friday Agreement, North-South co-operation and the all-island economy.  It is incumbent upon Prime Minister Johnson and the British Government, as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to protect the agreement in full and to honour the commitments given in this regard.  Allowing the UK to crash out of the European Union without a deal does not erase those responsibilities and the UK Government will find itself back at the negotiating table still having to solve the Border issue, address citizens' rights, and settle the withdrawal bill.<\/p>  <p>  There is also an onus on the parties in Northern Ireland to restore the institutions, to get back working and to put an end to the political vacuum that has existed for more than two and half years.  From an economic, social, and political perspective, a no-deal Brexit would devastate the region.  Warnings have issued from many quarters that a recession could be on the cards for Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  Given the make-up of the North's economy, which is structured around small and medium enterprises and the agrifood sector, and the very tight supply chains linking north with south and east with west, the effects of a no-deal Brexit on Northern Ireland would be severe and damaging.  It is therefore incumbent upon the parties in Northern Ireland and the British Government to protect the North, the peace process, and all the associated benefits that have flowed from it.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear to all watching and studying Brexit that a solution specific to Northern Ireland is the key to unlocking the impasse that exists.  The only way to avoid checks on the island of Ireland is to have regulatory alignment for trade between the North and the South.  There is no way around this reality.  We have spent the last three years searching for any such alternative.  More than two years ago, Fianna F&aacute;il proposed a special economic zone for Northern Ireland as a potential solution to the Brexit difficulty.  The North would continue to be part of the UK constitutionally but would also enjoy the benefits of the EU market.  This is essentially what is being proposed with a Northern Ireland-specific backstop, which is a bespoke solution for the North that would give it a clear trade advantage over Great Britain and even the Republic.  This has, unfortunately, been rejected by the DUP, which is looking a gift horse in the mouth.  While I can, to a certain extent, understand from where the DUP is coming and while I respect its right to have its own Brexit policy, I disagree intensely with its approach and believe it is not acting in the interests of the island of Ireland.  I sincerely hope that the gap that persists can be bridged in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  There are also significant concerns about the relationships between Ireland and the UK and between the UK and the European Union.  These relationships will undoubtedly change significantly as a result of Brexit.  For the very first time, the UK and Ireland will go on very different paths.  There will be an impact on the geopolitical landscape, as the UK seems to move further towards the United States.  That impact will be seen in the coming decades.<\/p>  <p>  There must be a step change in the Government's approach to preparing for Brexit and in how it informs the public about what will happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The argument for keeping one's cards close to one's chest, which is that it may undermine the State's negotiating position, is now defunct.  With six weeks to go, people need to know.  We cannot inform businesses, citizens and farmers as to how the Border may work on 1 November; we need to get that information today.  It is evident that, since March, the Government has taken its foot off the pedal in terms of preparations for Brexit outcomes.  We have been playing catch-up.  Information received today by way of parliamentary question shows that, with six weeks to go to Brexit, 205 businesses with imports in excess of &euro;1 million and 60 businesses with exports in excess of &euro;1 million still do not have EORI numbers.  This needs to be addressed urgently.  We also know that the Government still has not tested the robustness of systems in place at ports and airports to see if they will work in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  There is now insufficient time to do so and to rectify any potential problems.  This oversight is unacceptable and inexcusable.<\/p>  <p>  When we ask about the funding that will be made available to vulnerable sectors such as tourism, agriculture, and haulage - a question I have continuously asked over the past two years - we are told that budget 2020 will be based on a no-deal scenario and that the Government will make provision for timely, targeted, temporary measures for the most exposed sectors.  We have absolutely no clarity, however, on how much will be made available, on whether these measures will be loans or grants, and on how soon after 31 October this money will be available.  Given that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has stated that he will have to borrow to fund Brexit emergency planning, we have to expect that this funding will not be available immediately in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  These are obvious questions that the Minister continues to avoid answering.  This lack of information is only compounding the anxiety being experienced by farmers, businesses, and citizens who are looking to the Government for leadership and support.<\/p>  <p>  Reports last week from Ernst &amp;amp; Young suggest that while our cities will continue to grow in the event of a no-deal Brexit, albeit at a slower rate, rural communities could slip into recession.  That is deeply worrying.  Reports from the Central Bank of Ireland suggest that one third of farms could close down in the event of a no-deal Brexit and that we are looking at potentially losing 10,000 jobs in the tourism sector.  In the west, for example, tourism and agriculture are the biggest employers.  We cannot sustain job losses of this magnitude.  We will need direct supports, not three or six months after the fact, but immediately.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, there is still a lack of clarity regarding how the Government plans to ensure there is no hard border on the island while protecting the integrity of the Single Market, which we all accept must be protected.  Earlier today, the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, stated that the force is ready for Brexit.  Have additional resources been provided to an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or will current resources be redirected?  Again, this is a reasonable question that has not been answered.  This House also requires an update on the preparedness of our Defence Forces, particularly in view of the fact that the Government has cut the Permanent Defence Force to such an extent over the past decade that it is now a skeleton operation.<\/p><p>It is also questionable whether it would be able to respond to emergency Brexit scenarios.<\/p> <p> It is essential that the Government be upfront and transparent with the Oireachtas and the public about the full implications of Brexit and its level of preparedness for every sector.  We need to hear further details about what the Government plans to do to rebuild the relationship with the UK and to put in place new mechanisms for the continued work, exchange and dialogue between the Prime Minister, the Taoiseach, Secretaries of State and Ministers.  Today, the T&aacute;naiste admitted that the mechanisms and forums available through the EU will obviously no longer be available.  We need to know the details of what forums will be available to ensure continued dialogue and engagement with our closest neighbour and nearest market.<\/p> <p> There has been a great deal of posturing on all sides in the Brexit process over the past three years, but we all accept that politics will have failed miserably if we allow a no-deal Brexit to happen.  We simply cannot wear a no-deal Brexit.  It would devastate our country, our economy and the rural communities that rely on the most vulnerable sectors.  We must do everything that we can to ensure that a deal is done.  I dread to think of the implications for our country if a deal is not reached.  Food exports of in excess of 40%, with the beef sector already in considerable difficulty, tourism and the haulage sector will all be severely impacted.  I urge all parties to the Brexit process to do everything they can in the coming weeks to ensure that a deal is delivered for all citizens in Ireland, the UK and across the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800047#AAA00200","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568825700,"counter":468,"content":"<p>At the outset, I will draw the House's attention to the political stability that we in this country currently have as we come to terms with the ongoing Brexit crisis.  It has to be said that Fianna F&aacute;il has played a major role in ensuring that we have that stability at this crucial time.  There are undoubtedly many reasons this country needs a change in Government now.  The housing and homelessness crisis and the numerous problems in the health service are just two.  The failure to provide school places and to put in place adequate services for children with special needs is another.  Until the outcome of Brexit is clear, however, the country will not be served by having a general election.<\/p><p>The position in the Oireachtas is in sharp contrast to what is happening across the water in Westminster.  Parliament has been prorogued in unusual and controversial circumstances and it seems that the democratic institutions and political parties in the UK are at breaking point as they endeavour to respond to the Brexit crisis.  All we can do is look on in disbelief.  We have been aghast at what we have seen in the House of Commons night after night and at what is happening at Government level.<\/p><p>I wish to highlight the solidarity shown to Ireland by our EU partners.  From day one, the President-elect of the European Commission, Dr. Ursula von der Leyen, stood with Ireland on the backstop and the reasons for it to remain as part of the withdrawal agreement.  I welcome the appointment of Mr. Phil Hogan as the new Commissioner dealing with trade issues.  I have no doubt that he will play a crucial role if and when we get to the stage of negotiating a new trade agreement between the UK and the EU.  The EU 27 Heads of State and Government have also stood with us.  The latest demonstration of this was in the past few days when the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr. Xavier Bettel, outlined the position clearly.  He is our new hero, so to speak.  The European Parliament has stood with Ireland, and I welcome the motion it passed today.<\/p><p>As Deputy Lisa Chambers stated, Fianna F&aacute;il believes that the backstop is an integral part of the withdrawal agreement and must remain in place.  It protects the Good Friday Agreement, North-South co-operation and the all-Ireland economy.

What exactly is under discussion and what progress has been made in respect of these talks?  Is something happening?  Will the T&aacute;naiste outline the Government's position regarding the DUP?  I note that its leader, Ms Arlene Foster, is in Dublin this evening.  Former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern has stated that any Brexit solution must be supported by unionists.  Farming and business interests in Northern Ireland clearly want a deal.  In an interview in last weekend's <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>, Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson of the DUP outlined the need to agree alternative arrangements to protect cross-Border trade and co-operation in the form of practical solutions.

It was positive to see the Taoiseach being so resolute with Prime Minister Johnson on the backstop when he visited Dublin.  The backstop is not only important for economic reasons, but for social and historical reasons.<\/p>  <p>  While no one wants to see a crash-out, which would be catastrophic, there is a real possibility that it will happen.

People are stalling on making investment decisions and the market is stagnant, which is damaging our SMEs.  SMEs are the most important sector of our economy, one that often cannot afford to hedge or put in place risk measures.  Small and micro-sized businesses account for 85% of all Irish enterprises exporting to the UK.  It is for this reason that the Government needs to be open and honest with our SME sector and give it as much detail as possible about what a no-deal Brexit means and the likely next steps in terms of trading and the knock-on effects of the UK crashing out on 31 October.  SMEs are the backbone of our economy and deserve an honest Government that is prepared to tell them the facts.<\/p>  <p>  Estimates of Ireland's national level of Brexit trade-related risk exposure are in the region of 10%.  The current advice being provided by the Government is poor, to say the least.  Consider two pieces of advice that the Government provides in the Brexit document, Getting Your Business Brexit Ready - Practical Steps.  First, people should be \"aware of possible changes to transport &amp;amp; logistics for goods transiting via the UK\".  We are an island that relies on a landbridge, so of course there are going to be changes.  What people need to know is what those changes will be and what alternatives will be in place.  Second, people should know \"more about the impact on your sector\".  They are looking to the Government to tell them more about those impacts, but they are not being told.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800048#BBB00700","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1568825700,"counter":474,"content":"<p>It is all there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800048#BBB00800","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1568825700,"counter":475,"content":"<p>They are being told.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800048#BBB00900","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1568825700,"counter":476,"content":"<p>These are the categories in the Government's own Brexit preparedness document.

However, only 11% of that funding has been availed of.  Small and medium enterprises are facing many unknowns.  Given the many challenges they face, they may not be able to take out a further loan for which they may be personally responsible.  Our SMEs need an update on the Government's discussions with the Commission regarding access to state aid and the relaxation of the rules in that regard.  They need to know what EU funding will be injected into the various sectors that would be severely challenged by a crash-out Brexit.  The Government was not prepared for a crash-out Brexit on 31 March.

Returning to the Chamber after the summer recess, we are no wiser as to whether the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, will take Britain out of the European Union with or without a deal.  In spite of his claims, I fear he is, at best, agnostic on which option he should choose.<\/p>  <p>  We must ensure that there is no form of border or customs checks in Ireland.  Many citizens and businesses are frustrated by the ongoing posturing and indecision in London and the consequences this may have for this island.  For those who are so frustrated and feel that there is no positive way for them to influence the situation, I wish to commend the approach taken by my party colleagues.  I especially endorse the strong comments made earlier today by my colleague, Martina Anderson, MEP, who outlined a pathway for Ireland remaining in the European Union, protecting the Good Friday Agreement and ensuring that all the consequent benefits arising from it in terms of trade and enterprise are not squandered.  Of course, that pathway is a referendum on Irish unity.  The French President, Emmanuel Macron, recently came out in favour of unity as the way to keep all of Ireland within the European Union.  There is a clear commitment from the EU that in the event of a successful unity referendum, Ireland as a whole could remain part of the European Union.  We need the Government to join others and begin the preparations for such a scenario.  I note that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, who is present, stated that he would like to see a united Ireland within his political lifetime.  I welcome that sentiment; it is the expression and hope of most Deputies in this House.  Regardless of one's age, ensuring something occurs within one's political lifetime requires imminent preparation and planning.  A debate on Irish unity is needed as a solution to the Brexit chaos.  We need it to be respectful of all the opinions on this island.  In order for the optimum number of opinions to be heard, we need the debate to occur in advance of any proposed constitutional change.<\/p>  <p>  We need the Government to identify exactly how it intends to deal with the worst-case scenario as outlined in the Operation Yellowhammer report.  Recent revelations in the Yellowhammer document regarding health services show that the British Government is unwilling to listen to its own experts.  Given the current rancour in the British body politic, it is difficult to have any confidence in assurances from Whitehall, let alone rely on them as part of our preparations for Brexit.  That report is now a matter of common knowledge.  I do not wish for the Government to take its lead from a report by the British civil service or any section of the British Government, but we need far more detail on the supports and assistance that will be available here.  I join other Deputies in making that point strongly this evening.<\/p>  <p>  Border communities want a far more proactive response from the Government to these latest concerns.  That is not a criticism of what the Government has been doing with the support of all parties in this House but, rather, a clear expression of exasperation and fear at what may lie ahead.  Those communities want their elected Government to be upfront and honest with them.  They want to know what the Government is doing in preparation for what appears to be ahead of us.  Ringing the warning bells in the final minutes of the countdown will not cut it.  Many fear we are heading, Titanic-like, for the Brexit iceberg.  That is not good enough.  Our people, economy and island deserve better than the daily platitudes from the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and other Government spokespersons.  It is time to spell out in detail the measures that will be introduced to help secure the interests of Irish business and people, especially those in the Border counties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800049#CCC00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1568826300,"counter":481,"content":"<p>As representatives of Border areas, my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, and I are acutely aware of the damage that will be caused by a no-deal Brexit.  Last year, the Department of Finance published a report which stated that any form of Brexit is likely to cause a structural change in the Irish economy.  As such, any response needs to be structural in nature and cannot merely be about managing Brexit.  Whatever form Brexit takes, it will affect the dynamics of Irish imports and exports.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of infrastructure, Brexit will accelerate the current over-reliance on Dublin and its catchment area.  We need a regional balance.  Its lack is evident in County Louth, which I represent.  Last week, I spoke to the head of Dundalk Chamber of Commerce, who shared his deep concerns and frustration regarding the Dublin-Belfast and Drogheda-Dundalk-Newry corridors and the lack of information and practical business plans from the Government.  We spoke about the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act.  It is a preparatory Act which is now effectively out of date.  Its purpose was to advise people on the preparations they needed to take.  We are six weeks from a possible no-deal Brexit and we have not seen a practical Government plan for businesses.  As all Members know, a no-deal Brexit would have catastrophic consequences for Border communities and counties, not to mention the entire island of Ireland.<\/p><p>People in the Six Counties voted to remain.  The Border communities and counties, and the people of Ireland, will never accept any attempt to reinstate a hard border on our island.<\/p> <p> In my town of Drogheda, people are sick and tired of the lack of effort and commitment the Government, and IDA Ireland, have shown to date to attract new jobs and investment for our town.  To give one example, when Coca-Cola announced a review of its operations in January, I contacted the Minister asking her to do what she could to intervene to try to save the jobs but to no avail.  Just last week, a US firm, MTI, closed its Irish headquarters in Drogheda after just two years.  We need to see and feel the real benefit of both the Government and IDA Ireland's focused attention being put not just on Drogheda but throughout the Border counties.<\/p> <p> I am disappointed but not surprised by the lack of progress from IDA Ireland so far.  The threat of a no-deal Brexit only heightens the need for investment, not just in Louth but in every other county across the island.  Drogheda has lost out on enough over the years and has had massive underinvestment as matters stand.  This makes it even more imperative that we retain the jobs we have already.  We need to invest to tackle the threat of Brexit but also to allow County Louth in particular to develop as a centre for jobs and education.<\/p> <p> Brexit has exposed the incredible laziness of this Government, and previous Governments, in terms of planning in the State.  The default position, which has been to simply pile everything within the confines of the M50 corridor and hope for the best, has to change.  It is blindingly obvious that any action planned for Brexit must allow for regions to develop as that is the only sustainable project possible.  That means investment, jobs and allowing communities to survive and thrive.  It means a future for the main streets of regional towns like Dundalk and Drogheda.<\/p> <p> We know that Brexit will be used by the Government, and Fianna F&aacute;il, to withhold investment where it is most needed.  It will do this because it is not interested in public service but private profit for the well connected.  The challenge of Brexit is not only to mitigate its effects but to ensure it is not used as a Trojan horse for the further dismantling of our shared social services and infrastructure.<\/p> <p> At a time when corporate tax receipts continue to exceed expectations, the State is in a position to invest in essential non-recurring projects needed across society.  In no area is this approach more needed than the severe shortage of housing.  The State cannot continue to be a cash cow for corporate landlords and speculators.  We need to make rents more affordable and start building houses.  Education and research are key to future productivity and growth.  We need a jobs and investment plan from IDA Ireland that is more regional in scope than what exists today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800049#CCC00500","speaker":"1333","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568826900,"counter":483,"content":"<p>In June 2016, when we woke up one morning and found out that Britain had voted to leave the European Union, I do not believe any of us fully expected what would unfold over the two and a half years that followed.  Many of us who watched the referendum campaign in Britain, and some of us who campaigned for the North to stay in the European Union and to keep the entire island in the European Union for all the understandable reasons, including to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border, knew what the implications would be for Ireland.  We knew that the utopian Brexit that was sold to people in Britain was a pack of lies that would come crashing down around the ears of those who had delivered that message.<\/p>  <p>  In many respects it was amazing to see what unfolded.  When Project Yellowhammer was published last week, it referred to medicine shortages, food shortages and delays at ports in Britain.  It stated that the most vulnerable in society would be the ones who would pay the biggest price.  It refers to the consequences for Ireland and a hard border, yet there are still some people who believe that is the best option rather than facing up to the reality that the Brexit utopian dream they were promised would never be a reality.<\/p>  <p>  Collectively, as politicians in this House and in the North where a majority of politicians favour a more sensible approach and argue for the North to stay in the customs union and the Single Market, we have had to deal with the various crises within the British Tory Party.  I happen to believe, and I have said it on several occasions, that the T&aacute;naiste has done a very good job negotiating with his European partners in getting the Irish protocol and the backstop.  I am very proud that we in this State and certainly the political parties and the vast majority of politicians, although not all of them, did not support Brexit.  A small number in this House were comfortable to support Brexit, albeit a different type of Brexit.  If we contrast that unity and the approach that was taken here in Ireland with what is happening in Westminster, within both the Tory Party and the Labour Party, we can be proud of what we achieved.<\/p>  <p>  The problem is that we were not always in control.  We are veering towards a hard crash, not because of anything we have done or not done but because we have a British Prime Minister who is reckless and always knew that, rather than utopian, the outcome was going to be dystopian.  Some are thriving in the chaos because they want people to believe that the people in Ireland, the Irish Government and Europe are at fault.  According to them, the reason Brexit is being frustrated is not that the British people were sold a pup but the result of what is happening in Europe or Ireland.  All of that is very disingenuous but it is also very harmful.<\/p>  <p>  What we must do at this crucial time is hold our nerve.  There is a great deal of pressure on the European Union and Ireland because people do not want to see a hard crash but the alternative is to have some sort of compromise that will not work.  I do not believe one can compromise with Boris Johnson or the hard right in the Tory Party.  They have to come forward with the solutions but they have not done so, yet we are the ones who are now paying the price.<\/p>  <p>  There have been comments from both Fianna F&aacute;il and from some of my colleagues about Brexit preparedness.  The Government will argue its corner, while others will say we should do more.  We are at a critical stage in this process.  We have watched the drama unfold over two and a half years.  We have all gone through this journey collectively and in an honourable way to get to the point we are at now.  While we reach this critical stage over the next few weeks, it is very important that we maintain that political consensus while standing up for the interests of the people of Ireland and make sure that we are not the ones who will pay a price because of the foolhardy and selfish politics we have seen from Boris Johnson and his colleagues in the past number of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091800050#DDD00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1568826900,"counter":484,"content":"<p>As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, the Brexit situation is getting worse, not better.
