I am joined today by Mr. Peadar &Oacute; Scanaill, president of the Veterinary Council of Ireland.  We welcome the opportunity to appear before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine for the second time, to discuss the important issue of corporate ownership of veterinary practices.  We look forward to continuing this discussion on an area of great relevance and importance to the veterinary sector.<\/p> <p>  The Veterinary Council of Ireland is the statutory body responsible for the regulation and management of the practice of veterinary medicine and veterinary nursing.  The principal function of the veterinary council is to regulate the practice of veterinary medicine and veterinary nursing in the Republic of Ireland, in the interest of animal health and welfare and in the interest of veterinary public health.  The functions of the veterinary council include protection of the public through the supervision of veterinary education, the maintenance of the register of veterinary practitioners and nurses, the registration of veterinary premises, and through disciplinary action in cases of professional misconduct.  In order to legally practice veterinary medicine in the Republic of Ireland, a veterinary practitioner or veterinary nurse must be registered with the council.  The practitioner or nurse must also carry out the practice of veterinary medicine at and from a premises registered with the veterinary council.  There are currently 2,933 veterinary practitioners and 966 veterinary nurses registered with the Veterinary Council of Ireland.  We also have 752 veterinary premises registered under the council&rsquo;s statutory premises accreditation scheme, at and from which veterinary services are provided to the public.  These include veterinary clinics, veterinary practices and veterinary hospitals.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, the topic of corporate ownership of veterinary practices is a challenging one and has been the subject of much debate.  Further to our appearance before the committee in May of this year, the veterinary council has since clarified the position with regards to ownership and the provision of veterinary services to the public, having benefited from a period of extensive consultation on the matter.  It remains the role and remit of the council to continue to ensure the highest standards of veterinary medicine in the regulation and management of the professions.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly recap the history and experience of the veterinary council as it relates to this issue.  Historically, section 54(2) of the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 was interpreted to prevent a body corporate from owning a veterinary practice, and this understanding was reflected in the veterinary council&rsquo;s code of professional conduct.  However, legal advice received by the veterinary council advised that the legislation does not speak to the ownership of practices, and thus the council has no legal authority in determining such issues.  The parameters of our powers as established under the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 involve the regulation of veterinary services to the public and the practice of veterinary medicine within that service.  They do not extend to the area of ownership of practices.  In light of this, the veterinary council initially amended its code of professional conduct in December 2017, explicitly stating that there was no prohibition on a non-registered person or body corporate owning a veterinary practice, provided that the practice of veterinary medicine was carried out by a veterinary professional registered with the council.  This amendment was then put on hold in January 2018 to allow for a period of comprehensive consultation with the public, stakeholders and members of the veterinary professions.  The results of this consultation have been compiled in a report by Grant Thornton offering an analysis of the VCI consultation on corporate ownership of veterinary practices, which was shared with members of this committee along with the clerk of the committee in July of this year.<\/p> <p>  The council commenced the public consultation in early 2018 which concluded in summer of this year, culminating in the report by Grant Thornton.  The consultations conducted, which are reflected in the report, included a survey of the general public conducted by market research company Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes; a consultation process whereby any interested parties could submit their views; a survey of the veterinary professions conducted by market research company Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes; research and analysis of other veterinary regulators internationally; and research and analysis of other regulated professions in Ireland.  The veterinary council has also benefited from legal advice on the matter and all of these inputs, together with the results of a consultation process and survey of the public, have been consolidated into this report.  Overall, the responses to the introduction of corporate ownership of veterinary practices in Ireland were divided.  Some were opposed, while some were in favour of the idea.  Industry perspectives on corporate ownership can sway dependent on the circumstance.<\/p> <p>  Analysis of other professions in Ireland, in addition to veterinary professions in other jurisdictions is also reflected in the report.  Consultations were held with different jurisdictions globally to understand the issue of corporate ownership.  It was apparent from the consultations that corporate ownership is prevalent internationally, but how it is regulated varies across the jurisdictions.  The majority of other professions examined allow corporate ownership to exist with the exception of the legal profession.  The council sought independent legal advice on the issue of corporate ownership with regards to the Veterinary Practice Act 2005.  This advice highlighted that the governing legislation does not provide for a role for the veterinary council in the ownership of veterinary practices.  The council&rsquo;s role lies in the regulation of the practice of veterinary medicine in the public interest.  Our focus therefore is on the regulation of veterinary services to the public, the licensing of the veterinary premises and the registrants who provide that service, at and from those premises.<\/p> <p>  Following the period of consultation with stakeholders, the Veterinary Council of Ireland updated its code of professional conduct in respect of the matter of the provision of veterinary services to the public and the ownership of veterinary practices.  The council provides guidance to veterinary registrants on matters relating to conduct and ethics through their code of professional conduct for registered veterinary practitioners and veterinary nurses.  The code of professional conduct consists of the rules and principles which govern veterinary practitioners and veterinary nurses in the exercise of their profession.<\/p><p>The Veterinary Council also regulates and licenses veterinary premises at and from which veterinary services to the public are provided.  Registrants are bound by the code and the regulations relating to the veterinary premises where the practice of veterinary medicine occurs.<\/p><p> The council continues, as always, to use its statutory powers to ensure the highest standards of clinical governance are employed in veterinary medicine within the State.  Those standards are to be found in the council's code of professional conduct and the regulations which underpin certificates of suitability.  A certificate of suitability is the licence issued by the council to persons registered with it who wish to provide veterinary services at and from the premises to which the certificate relates.  A certificate of suitability for the veterinary premises is required before any veterinary service to the public may begin from that premises, and the certificate is renewed on a four-year-cycle.  Only individuals registered with the council may apply for and be granted a certificate to provide veterinary services to the public at and from a veterinary premises.  For example, a veterinary practitioner cannot provide veterinary services from a premises without such a certificate in place.<\/p><p> The regulations relating to that certificate are one of the means by which the council regulates veterinary services to the public.  The certificate of suitability for veterinary services involving the practice of veterinary medicine may only be held in the name of a registered person.  The code of professional conduct is another means by which the Veterinary Council regulates the practice of veterinary medicine and nursing in the State.  The code of professional conduct and the council regulations underpin veterinary services to the public.  The Veterinary Council issues the code and regulations, and determines the issuing of the certificates required to enable veterinary services to be delivered at and from a veterinary premises.<\/p><p> The update by the council to the code on 11 July 2019 reaffirms that veterinary services to the public, the performance of which forms part of the practice of veterinary medicine, must at all times be provided by the veterinary practitioners who usually practice veterinary medicine at and from the registered veterinary premises.  The clinical discretion of the veterinary practitioner is paramount, acting at all times in the interest of animal health, welfare and public health.  This decision brings clarity to the matter.<\/p><p> The council's words updating the code clearly state that the veterinary practitioner provides the veterinary medicine service to the public at and from a premises, certified and licensed by the council.  The code of professional conduct and the regulations relating to the veterinary premises are the means by which the Veterinary Council regulates that service in the public interest.  Ownership bears no influence on the provision of veterinary services.<\/p><p> The Veterinary Council's updating of the code of conduct of veterinary practitioners clarifies that only veterinary practitioners may provide veterinary services, the performance of which constitute the practice of veterinary medicine, to the public and also strengthens the clinical discretion and autonomy of registered veterinary professionals in discharging clinical duties.<\/p><p> The Veterinary Council recently began its period of public consultation for its strategy for 2019 to 2023, which is to be published later this year.  The strategy will seek to work with partner bodies to shape the professional lives of veterinary registrants and to ensure the development and oversight of the veterinary profession continues to foster best professional practice, in the best interest of animal welfare and the public.<\/p><p> Its proposed strategic objectives are leading animal health and welfare in line with one health, one welfare initiatives; maintaining the confidence of the public and veterinary professions in the Veterinary Council of Ireland processes; enabling good professional practice and professionalism through education; supporting the health and well-being of registrants; supporting and developing the role of the veterinary nurse; and enhancing and influencing and informing policy through insightful research and meaningful engagement.<\/p><p> While a number of different challenges face veterinary practitioners and nurses in Ireland today, the council will continue to work to ensure that registrants continue to provide best in class services, and that registrants are supported in their provision of veterinary medicine services, in their development as professionals and in their own personal well-being.  We will continue to work to ensure the high standards expected in the veterinary industry are upheld, and that quality of veterinary care enjoyed in this country continuously improves.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to address them today.  The president of the Veterinary Council, Mr. &Oacute; Scanaill, and I are happy to address any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019092400002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Muldoon for her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019092400002#J00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Muldoon for her presentation.

I have been an employee, as I am sure many in this room have been, and whether in the case of a factory, workshop or office floor it is always the owners who make the decision.

The quality of the service will diminish because vets will not be their own masters - that will be the owner of the corporate body.  That is what we have a concern over.

If we pull back a little, before ever we talk about an owner or a corporate body laying down rules and regulations, there is no service to the public until a registrant applies to us to open a service to the public at and from a certain premises.  That is the first step.  That is the hands on the wheel.  As we said when we were here last, it would be very important for us that there would only be three parties on the playing field.  The hands on the wheel would be the vet's hands only - the registrant's hands only - and that is on the certificate.<\/p> <p>  In fairness, there will be contracts between the registrants and the owners but that contract can never come across the provision of the service, which is in the hands of the veterinary practitioners, who apply to us for that certificate.  The certificate is only for four years.

I cannot believe what I am hearing.  What I have been hearing for the last ten minutes is akin to a bouncer outside a nightclub who watches a 16 year old get an ID from an 18 year old, says that is fine and tells them to go on in, it will be all right on the night.  I have worked in companies as both a manager and an employee.  I have never been asked to sign on behalf of management or on behalf of the owner.  If I was, I do not think my signature could have been accepted.  I was always answerable to the manager or owner.  The witnesses are basically saying that I can buy a veterinary practice in the morning and ask any qualified vet who is prepared to put his or her letters behind it to sign my application for me.  There are not even checks and balances to find out if the vet is an employee of the person who owns the practice or the building.<\/p> <p>  Suppose the vet is an employee.  If that vet decides to live by what he or she has signed and provide a 24-hour service, and if I as the employer decide it is not economically viable to send him or her out at 4 a.m. to deliver lambs, we might part company by the end of the week.  Do I still have certification for the next four years?  The witnesses have given me no indication, in their report or anywhere else, that the VCI checks what the vet's role in the company is, apart from verifying that he or she is a qualified vet and signed the application.  The VCI has been ignoring the fact that there is a fourth party in the relationship.  Is it not the case that in the context of the TB eradication scheme, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine recently stated that the service provider cannot be an employee of the practice?  If that is correct, and I am led to believe it is, can the witnesses provide an answer?  The VCI has allowed this relationship to develop by totally ignoring the fourth party because it suits the VCI to do so.  It undermines its own role in policing this code by turning its back on the fact that it will accept a signature from anybody, on anybody else's behalf, once the signatory has gone to UCD or wherever to get the right letters after his or her name.  The VCI is not even interested in what the vet's role within that organisation is, other than to note that he or she has the qualification.  A week later he or she might not be working under the licence the VCI grants or in the building for which it has granted a licence. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019092400002#N01900","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569279600,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I cannot comment on the TB matter so I will not stray into that.

I am disappointed.  We have a model in this country that has worked well.  The welfare of the animal has to be paramount.  I have noted a few statements from the presentation.  For example, &quot;Ownership bears no influence on the provision of veterinary services.&quot;  I am not going to swallow that pill.  Unfortunately, we have an example where a corporate buying a practice has had an influence on the provision of veterinary services and an area has been left without it.  That has been blown out of the water already.  Ms Muldoon stated:<\/p><blockquote>The clinical discretion of the veterinary practitioner is paramount, acting at all times in the interest of animal health, welfare and public health.  This decision brings clarity to the matter. <\/blockquote> <p>In my mind it does, because the welfare of the animal often involves an uneconomical call, perhaps going to a call where the vet knows there is not an earthly hope of getting paid.  Vets do that on a regular basis.  This corporate structure has gained ground in other countries and the service provided to farmers is not like the service we have grown accustomed to in this country.  As Deputy Fitzmaurice said, if a farmer picks up the phone and rings for a vet, he will be in the farmer's yard within half an hour no matter what hour of the day it is.  That is a tremendous service.  I take issue with the veterinary council's statement that it has no remit in regard to ownership.  Unless there is a remit and strong ethics, the welfare of the animal is going to be put at risk.  I do not question the ethics of vets because they have the track record to show that they put animal welfare at the top of the list.  A corporate ownership will not put it at the top of the list.  They may say they will ensure there is a 24-hour service.  There might be a 24-hour service but in other jurisdictions a call-out can attract such an exorbitant fee that it is just not economically viable to bring a vet to an animal.  That would result in animal welfare issues.<\/p><p>The question of testing has not arisen yet because the corporates are only cherry-picking the specialised practices or the lucrative small animal practices in large urban centres.  However, they will go into the diary areas where there are large herds and cherry-pick the large practices and form a massive practice in that area.  We have seen this model in the UK.  Farmers will have the vet come to their yard once a year and engage in a programme for preventative medicine rather than provide a service to them.<\/p><p>I am disappointed that the veterinary council is abdicating its role in regard to ownership.  It can say that the legislation says so but for 13 or 14 years the legislation said different.  I just cannot understand how the interpretation of the legislation can change after 12 or 13 years.  We will discuss this as a committee after the witnesses leave.  If the legislation does not allow ownership of a practice to stay in veterinary hands, the legislation has to be amended.  We have a veterinary practice system that is working well.  There are no welfare issues in veterinary practice in this country.  Now we are going to go down a road where corporates are going to have their say.  We have seen it already where a practice has been closed for whatever reason and the vets who were working in that practice arrived to a locked door.  The service we have known in rural Ireland could not be provided by corporate structures going forward.  I had a lot of vets talking to me over the weekend.  For many of them economically, it would be a good decision if corporates could buy them out because they would in a position to sell their practice and retire, but to a man and woman they were opposed to this.  They feel that the service they pride themselves on will not remain and that the fabric and structure of veterinary practice that we have in Ireland will be seriously undermined.  <\/p><p>To regulate all the aspects of delivering a veterinary service to the public, would it beneficial to the veterinary council if there was an amendment to the Veterinary Practice Act 2015 confining ownership of practices to veterinary practitioners only?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019092400002#Q00400","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569279600,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

We have seen it come into play already that lay ownership has an influence.  That goes against the grain of what the council is trying to achieve and oversee.  Only vets should have control.  With the change that has been made, allowing lay ownership to come into play, there is now a level of lay control over veterinary practice.<\/p><p>I know the law was silent on the matter, but it would have been appropriate to bear in mind the VCI's rules of conduct specifying that only veterinary practitioners should own practices because only veterinary practitioners should have control and influence over the provision of veterinary medicine.  Whenever lay ownership is allowed, those owners interfere and take on a level of control.  These lay owners do not have responsibilities for animal welfare under the code of conduct for veterinary medicine practitioners.  Allowing lay owners in the industry allows non-veterinary influence on the conduct of medicine in Ireland.  That is why we see veterinary practitioners throughout the country being so opposed to this.  A Veterinary Ireland survey showed that 86% of practitioners opposed such ownership.  There is widespread concern about it and a lack of support for it.<\/p><p> The other point I will make relates to cost.  There is some evidence of cherry-picking.  Practices are sold and the company taking over only wants to keep the big clients and small animal practice.  They want to keep the profitable parts and cut the rest adrift.  The primary motive of a lay owner is not to look after the animals or to follow the veterinary code of conduct, but to make a profit.  That is their driver when they come in.  That is at loggerheads with the veterinary practitioners' obligation to keep their code of care for animals at the centre of what they do.  These two things are in conflict.  If the lay ownership had no control and no influence, there could be a way forward.  The concern is always that such owners would have influence.  Only a very small number of practices have been sold, but we have already seen that, in practice, such owners do have control, get on top of things, and interfere with the vets' operation and ability to conform to their code of conduct.<\/p><p> Another thing that comes into play is pricing.  A vet is supposed to care for animals, respond to emergencies, and keep caring at the centre of what they do.  Big clients, however, can be cherry-picked and smaller clients let go.  There is a sense that they can fend for themselves however they like.  It is not the practice's responsibility.  A charge of &euro;500 can be put on unprofitable calls the practice does not want, which is far more than the actual cost of responding to such calls.  These calls will never pass the vets' desk.  They will not get the call if it costs &euro;500.  That does not interfere with the code of ethics in care in theory, because the call will not come as a result of the &euro;500 fee.  Where is the animal in this?  What happens to the sheep or the animal that is worth less than &euro;500?  They will not be looked after.  They are left to their own devices and can die on their own accord.  There certainly will not be a vet looking after them.  Despite this, vets throughout the country want to ensure that all of this is looked after in the carrying out of their duties, even in unprofitable cases.<\/p><p> Where lay ownership occurs, we are now seeing evidence of profit beginning to rule the roost and of farmers, especially those who are not profitable customers for vets, not getting service.  Vets are very disturbed by this interference in their ability to carry out their job, to which they are all very committed.  That is why the decision that has been made needs to be revisited.  If it is not possible for the Veterinary Council of Ireland to overturn this decision, the legislation needs to be revisited by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Oireachtas.  It is clear, and there is no doubt, that lay ownership means lay control, lay interference, and profit ruling the roost rather the duty of care.  We have seen it internationally.  It is going to happen here very rapidly if this is not addressed.  We need to address it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019092400002#R03600","speaker":"1244","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569279600,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McConalogue.  He has given us many points to return to.  There has been a lot of debate about corporate ownership.  It has been challenging for the profession and for the council.  The council did not take this decision lightly.  In the consultation, just shy of 60% of those surveyed were against corporate ownership, with 40% in favour.  It is entirely contextual.  One sees vets being more open to corporate ownership at certain stages in their careers.  For example, veterinary nurses tend to be in favour.  It varies depending on the context.  This committee will take its own legal advice as to what is sustainable.  The council acknowledges that it is a changing environment.  There will be challenges and the nuances of these decisions will be played out throughout the country over the coming years.  The council will keep an eye on all of this.  It is not going to undermine its own function by allowing something to come in that it cannot regulate.  The council is confident that it can regulate the practice of veterinary medicine.  It will be revisiting, reforming and revising certain aspects of the procedures over the coming months.  All of this will be kept under review.  The council will not be found wanting in playing its role in all of this.  The council is not requesting legislative change or amendment at this time.  It is, of course, open to this great House to introduce whatever laws it deems appropriate, but the council has not arrived at the conclusion that any such legislative amendment is required.<\/p> <p>  With regard to pricing, this is just outside the role of a regulator.  It is just not within our gift.  Life might be a lot easier if it were.  The Medical Council cannot set the fees for doctors and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland cannot set the fees and charges that pharmacists levy.  It is the same for the Dental Council.  We are a regulator.  We have a public interest focus on the regulation of the practice but we cannot control every facet.  We acknowledge that there will be many challenges in the years to come, but the council will not be found wanting and will rise to meet those challenges to ensure effective regulation in the public interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019092400002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>If the council cannot control matters such as price and yet allows owners who will be driven by profit, it cannot have control.  I have seen it in my own county.  The fees for out-of-hours calls increase to &euro;500.  Vets cannot feasibly be available to carry out their duties in that situation.  The council does not have control over ensuring veterinary services are available whenever they are needed.  It does not have control over that particular aspect.<\/p> <p>  I will make one final point with regard to the cherry-picking of customers and letting non-profitable customers go.  What obligations fall on individual practices?  In my own county I am well aware of a situation in which a large practice was closed after being bought by lay owners.  This removed a very significant veterinary service for large parts of the county.  There is real difficulty and challenges as to how these areas will now be served.  Will the witnesses comment on that particular issue?  How can it be ensured, from the Veterinary Council of Ireland's point of view, that there will be service in that area, in which there is no practice?  That is important.  On cherry-picking customers and leaving small customers adrift, what obligations fall on vets in scenarios where a person is no longer a customer of the practice?

Every one of his concerns formed part of our debate, discussion and thought on this issue.  We are quite confident, and I stand firmly with my registrar on this, about putting provision of the service into the hands of the vet only and about specifying only the registrant on the certificate of suitability provided for in primary legislation.  If the registrant wishes to close a practice, open one, move it or change it, it will be the registrant's decision to do so.  If there are issues of control with which the registrant is unhappy or which in any way affect his or her ability to provide service, the registrant has the ability to move next door.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about after-hours service.  The council does oblige veterinary practitioners not to turn away animals that are in need of succour or emergency treatment, but in fairness, the vet would usually try to come to an arrangement with somebody who is close enough to provide that service.  It is not the case that somebody in County Kildare must answer a phone call at any hour from someone in Donegal and then go to the farmer's assistance.  If an animal is in need of veterinary attention, we would be asked to go.  I do not know if that answers the Deputy's question.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland would not, however, say that a given vet must provide a service for Mr. Riordan, a farmer who has only ten animals, if he or she is providing it for Mr. Jones next door, who has 100.

In such cases, the VCI would not insist that the practice provide X, Y or Z service.  It is a concern that small farmers might have difficulties accessing a service but larger farmers would not.  However, the market usually finds its own level.  If people are being left behind, someone will have to provide a service.

It is not us, as members of the committee, but they who will have to ratify the agreement reached between the European Union and the United Kingdom, which is a major responsibility.

There cannot be any reduction in subsidies.  They are well aware of the dispute between farmers and the meat factories.  If there is any cut in subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy, it will leave farmers in dire straits, even worse off than they are now.  I come from an agricultural area where we depend greatly on the subsidies paid by the European Union for organic suckler cow herds.  I will be relying on all Members of the European Parliament to ensure they will fight tooth and nail to preserve the subsidies payable under the Common Agricultural Policy at the maximum rate.  I am in favour of capping them at a reasonable amount, not the major amounts paid to individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019092400002#A00300","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":254,"content":"<p>We will start with Mick Wallace, if he wishes to reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019092400002#A00400","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569279600,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and Senator Leyden for all of their kind words.

The new developments in the UK Parliament earlier are disturbing.<\/p> <p>  I am a member of the European Parliament's committee on economic and monetary affairs, which is an important committee for Ireland because it deals with financial services and banking and has been caught up in the significant challenges Europe has been through over the past ten years.  I agree with what Mick Wallace MEP said about the green deal.  Ursula von der Leyen is very striking and strong on that.  It is everywhere.  People are utterly committed and it is now about the implementation of that.  We will do a lot of work together because this is where there is a lot of compromise as opposed to adversarial politics.  There is a lot of working together.  Different parties will put forward their priorities and we will end up with stronger action but it will take time.  <\/p> <p>  The committee on economic and monetary affairs is also examining money laundering and more effective legislation across Europe.  Ireland does well in this regard but it is a critical issue.  It is a much bigger problem in other countries and we need to get working on that.  Sustainable finance will be a significant topic that the committee will hear more about.  Our banks and financial institutions will need more instruments to support what can done in respect of financial support for green energy.  I attended an interesting meeting last week on the sustainable development goals.  It was very disturbing to hear about the trillions of euro that are needed to implement those and the low level of support from the public and private sectors.  Both sectors need to up their game considerably if we are to implement these goals.  That is a topic that this committee might like to pursue at another point.  <\/p> <p>  The European Investment Bank, EIB, has a significant amount - &euro;700 billion - to invest over the next number of years.  We must make sure that Ireland gets its fair share of that.  Approximately &euro;1 billion is currently going towards climate change initiatives and support for small business that will experience difficulties one way or another during Brexit.  The EIB makes funding available through the banks for small businesses.  This is something this committee might be interested in keeping an eye on to see how the implementation of that fares over the next few years and to make sure we put forward reasons we should get money from this fund.  In the past, we have not always taken down the full amount of European funding we could have taken.  <\/p> <p>  I am also a member of the European Parliament committees on development and women's rights and gender equality.  A new gender equality strategy will be brought forward by the Commission, which will be important.  It will involve making sure every project that comes from Europe has a gender budgeting aspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019092400002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Good morning everyone, this is Dublin calling.  It sounds like Eurovision.  Apparently, the Chairman is going to buy the pints afterwards so I do not know how he is going to deliver them to the MEPs.  I do not know how relevant my questions are.  I welcome our witnesses, including my friend and colleague, Martina Anderson MEP.  The first question is the most obvious one.  How can we better support the work of our MEPs in the European Parliament, specifically their work on designated committees, and how can we improve engagement between them and the Oireachtas?  I know it was a challenge previously.  The day the Joint Committee on European Affairs met, we tried to tie in so it might be too soon to ask that question but we are all agreed that we want more serious engagement with MEPs so how can we facilitate that and the witnesses' work on various committees?<\/p> <p>  Do our MEPs believe the European Commissioner-designates will be supported by the European Parliament?  Will they vote to support them and if not, why?  What do they think about the decision by the President-elect von der Leyen, to create a vice president with responsibility for protecting our European way of life?  Do they agree that this is the language of the far right and racist?  Even Marine Le Pen endorsed the new portfolio calling it an ideological victory.  What exactly is President-elect von der Leyen talking about when she refers to protecting our European way of life?  That might tie in with some of the more controversial statements that have been made by Irish politicians about refugees.<\/p><p>That is also one of the major challenges facing Europe.  I know Mick Wallace MEP would have been involved in going to Calais, and many of the MEPs have been interested in this issue.  The number of refugees Ireland takes in compared with Italy, Greece and so on is a major challenge for Europe.  If there is time, I would like one of the MEPs to comment on that.<\/p><p> The MEPs will have heard about the decision of the UK Supreme Court and people are calling for Prime Minister Johnson's resignation and so on, but Ireland is in a unique position.  In fairness to all the previous MEPs, a lot of the groundwork has been done.  Will the MEPs give us a sense of how they can work together on the Brexit issue?<\/p><p> Like Senator Leyden, I congratulate the MEPs on their election and I am looking forward to working with them in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019092400002#B00600","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569279600,"counter":263,"content":"<p>It is a great honour to be in the European Parliament and to be speaking to our Oireachtas colleagues.  I mention the first point Deputy Crowe raised about communications and the facilitation of same.  This is it and this is the start of it.  It is great the initiative has been taken for us to make an input to the committee and to share points of interests.<\/p> <p>  On the last point Deputy Crowe raised on Brexit, we had Mr. Barnier in last week to brief us in the Greens-European Free Alliance on the negotiations.  The one thing I noticed in that briefing that I have also noticed more generally in the European Parliament is that every time the word \"Brexit\" is used, Ireland is mentioned.  It is almost like they are glued together.  Everyone recognises the greatest impact of Brexit, should it happen, will probably be on the island of Ireland and on the UK itself.  Ireland is clearly front and centre in all talk about Brexit, and that is to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>  This morning at a meeting of the European Parliament Committee on Fisheries, PECH, we had a Commissioner in to talk about the technicalities of access to EU waters by EU members should Brexit happen.  Equally, the issue of British access to Irish waters was raised in terms of reciprocity so some kind of an agreement would be made.  It was very clear from the language that was being used today at that meeting in terms of the fishers on both sides that there is still a sense, just five weeks out from a potential Brexit, that we are not really ready should the UK leave.  For European nations, particularly the eight countries that use the UK waters, because nothing has really been finalised, there is still a great sense of uncertainty for the fishers.  Inasmuch as some attempts have been made at trying to achieve some kind of agreement, it is difficult because the EU is finding it difficult to get engagement with the UK on this.  Also, there is an issue with the habitual use by many fishers in Ireland of UK waters.  What will happen?  Will some kind of barrier go down on 31 October or on 1 November?  There is a lack of security for fishing communities, processors and the industry in general.  It is concerning.  The members of the committee have all alluded to the fact there have been significant developments today, so we will see how it plays out in the UK.<\/p> <p>  I am also on the European Parliament Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, ENVI.  I will go back to what Mick Wallace MEP said on this.  Climate change is another area that is front and centre.  To my mind, Brexit and climate change are probably the two areas that are most spoken about in the European Parliament since I have entered it.  I will be very involved in all environmental issues, such as public health, food safety and the environment in general.  I am a member of the European Parliament Delegation for relations with Mercosur, DMER, as well, so we have to get going on that, but we have been watching closely what has been happening in Ireland in recent weeks with the negotiations between the Minister and the different farming organisations.  I am also on the Delegation for relations with Palestine.  That gives a sense of the work areas I have in my portfolio.<\/p> <p>  The new Commissioners-designate will come before us next week.  I am the co-ordinator in PECH for the Greens-European Free Alliance, so I met Commissioner-designate Sinkeviius, who is from Lithuania.  He seems quite competent but he will come before the Parliament to be questioned and scrutinised, as should be the case.  Maybe that is an area where the members of the committee could contribute.  If they had questions they thought we could ask on their behalf of the Commissioners-designate next week, that is something we could do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019092400002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Grace O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I want to inform the MEPs joining us from Brussels that we have been joined by Deputy Mattie McGrath and Senator Craughwell.

Now that it has been clearly established that Parliament is sovereign in Britain, I would be interested in a preliminary view from Brussels from the MEPs on that.  Do they see Prime Minister Johnson having to obey the law and write for an extension of time on the basis that he probably will not be able to get a deal in place before 14 October?  How do the MEPs see that?  Will he be extreme and resign?  I would be interested in any preliminary views the MEPs have on that matter.  I have no doubt that, from Ireland's point of view, the MEPs will all work well together and they will get on and work very well with Commissioner Hogan, as has already been said by Senator Leyden.  I would be interested to hear any view the MEPs have on that and on the new Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019092400002#C00400","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569279600,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I thank the members for their kind words and I wish them well.  We are at two ends of political cycles.  We are at the start of our cycle and the members of the committee are coming to the end of their cycle, so I can understand that the focus will change dramatically in the coming weeks in the Oireachtas.  From the perspective of the matters raised by Senator Coghlan, what was interesting in recent days was the exceptional and intense briefing by the UK, both semi-official and unofficial, around the European Parliament.  They were saying Ireland will be under huge pressure and Ireland would be exceptionally vulnerable in the event of a crash-out Brexit.  They were doing a lot of briefings like that quite intensively.  They were also trying to divide the European members, especially those that are affiliated to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO, by pointing out that the UK is a NATO member, that the UK would defend European interests, and that Ireland is a neutral country and it would not defend European interests.  That was more or less targeting the eastern countries that have major concerns about threats from further to the east of the European Union.  There has been an intensive lobbying in recent days to drive a wedge between the varying views and groupings in Europe.<\/p><p>Overall, I can safely say that there is significant solidarity among all political groupings and countries for Ireland's predicament with Brexit and what could flow from it.  The Supreme Court decision will bring about its own internal issues in the UK.  From our perspective, there is a simple view that we must do everything to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.  It would undermine all that we have achieved on the island.  It certainly is not in keeping with the spirit and possibly even the law of the Good Friday Agreement relating to the all-Ireland economy, North-South co-operation, and normalising life on the island.  There has been strong support and solidarity from all political groupings and countries for Ireland's position and our vulnerabilities to a Brexit with no deal or a bad deal.  We have been gazing into the crystal ball for some time about this issue, guessing what will happen, but we know for sure that there is a political crisis in the UK, and many of the decisions that will have an impact will be made in Westminster or by the Executive itself.  As long as the UK sticks to its original commitments to the Good Friday Agreement and has that as its base point, I expect that the UK is honour and duty-bound to do nothing and should do nothing to install a hard border, either by design or by accident, on the island itself.<\/p><p> The Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, has been mentioned.  We can all say nice things.  I get the sense that the CAP budget will be under a lot of pressure in the next years.  While the previous agricultural committee in the outgoing Parliament made its recommendations, there is no doubt that CAP recommendations will be revisited by the new agricultural committee.  It may not open it up to full discussions and amendments from outside the committee itself, but it will certainly have a view on it, as will Parliament, along with the new Commissioner, who will most likely be the Polish candidate, Janusz Wojciechowski.  He will be a Commissioner for the European Union but there is a lot of pressure from the east to talk about parity of payments in any CAP reform.  There will be pressure there, but our duty as elected representatives is to defend Ireland's interest in those negotiations.<\/p><p> Ms Frances Fitzgerald and I sit on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, ECON.  Significant issues there include access to credit for small and medium-sized businesses, capital markets, and how we fund small and medium-sized businesses in the years ahead.  The committee probably knows more than anybody else that the Irish banking system is not functioning as we would like it to.  It seems to be incapable of assessing business loans and unsure of whether banks should be interested in lending and in supporting small and medium-sized businesses.  The latest figures indicate that it is not lending to the broader economy and that it is not acting as a stimulus to support small and medium-sized businesses.  That is having a profound effect on the capacity of businesses.  If we have a shock Brexit with short-term cashflow problems for many small and medium-sized businesses, the Irish banks have to step up to the plate and significantly improve on what they are currently doing, where they do not lend into the broader economy.  That is an issue which Oireachtas committees and Members should pursue in the short and medium term to address the immediate issues of Brexit, a potential crash-out and cashflow crisis and, in the longer term, the sustainability of the economy and underpinning that with proper credit.<\/p><p> Deputy Crowe asked about one of the portfolios of a Commissioner-elect, namely, protecting the European way of life.  We should really talk about protecting life in Europe and across the planet.  Our priorities in every aspect of policy will be first benchmarked with regard to environmental impact.  That is my reading of the political dynamics now at play in Europe and across national governments, with an increase in people participating both civically and electorally, who are pushing the climate change agenda.  It is now very much in the mainstream here.  That will have implications for agriculture, transport and how we construct in Ireland.  We should be at the forefront of it.  There is a question of how we fund all these things in the Irish context when our banking system is not sound enough to lend into the broader economy to stimulate investment in the green agenda and green economy.<\/p><p> Those are thoughts and opinions.  Brexit is the short and medium-term issue here that we are concentrating on.  The Commission hearings will happen and there will obviously be varying views from political groupings and individuals, and one or two may not make it into the final selection process.  My view on Commissioner Hogan is that he will be a great asset to the European Union.  Facing potential trade negotiations with the UK in the context of Brexit, I welcome that we have Mr. Hogan as trade Commissioner because he will bring a perspective and understanding of the all-Ireland economy and what is required to ensure that we have as little disruption as possible between the Republic and the North, and the island and Britain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019092400002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Billy Kelleher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I congratulate the MEPs, who fought a sterling campaign.  I am delighted for them and think that we have a solid team representing Ireland.  The first thing that I want to talk about is Brexit, as everybody here seems to talk about.  Eleven countries, between Finland and Greece, have borders.  What would make Ireland different in the event of a soft or a hard Brexit?  I have been saying since 2016, and it is beginning to catch on, that we would have no choice but to manage a border.  The level of management will be a function of the way in which Britain leaves the EU.  As I am sure the MEPs would agree, there cannot be an open border with a third country.<\/p> <p>  The European community has failed to deal with the issue of migration, forcing economic migrants to declare themselves as refugees.  We have no policy with respect to economic migration and Ireland, above all countries, should be leading on this.  We have been economic migrants for as far back in our history as we can remember.  Forcing people to declare themselves as refugees so that they can get residency in Europe is causing significant problems across Europe, especially in eastern Europe and lately in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The final matter relates to defence.  There is an ongoing discussion in this country about a European army.  One cannot have an army without an intelligence unit that is independent of all countries.  Can any of the MEPs see a situation where the European Parliament and the 27 members ratify the setting up of an intelligence agency for Europe independent of all countries?  I cannot see it happening in any way and I think there is an obligation on those who have been elected to the European Parliament to dispel myth.  I can certainly see a need for a defence or security agreement.  We need greater co-operation between our police forces with respect to people trafficking, drug trafficking etc., but the notion of a European army is miles away from that.  There is an onus on those in the European Parliament to spell out whether we are heading in that direction or that this is a nonsense and that we are trying to have a security policy rather than a defence policy.<\/p> <p>  I thank the MEPs for their time.

Mr. Michel Barnier spoke passionately and wisely last week, not only at the main plenary session in Strasbourg but also to groups.  He spent about an hour with the Green group.  He said very clearly that he has listened to the voices of women on the Border, who are very afraid of what might happen.  When a man like that, a negotiator, has sat down to listen to those voices, one can have confidence that the EU is acting in the best interest of Ireland and the Union.  Brexit is very much in the news.  Our colleague, Ms Naomi Long, is hosting a Brexit hearing tomorrow.  Two former taoisigh, namely, Mr. John Bruton and Mr. Bertie Ahern, and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair will be addressing it.  It will be great to be at that event.  Ms Long has just joined us in the room.  I congratulate her on organising the event and bringing so many of us together.<\/p><p> In a sense, however, Europe has moved on.  We are looking at the next Commission and the multi-annual financial framework.  We should not kid ourselves that Brexit is the only show in town in Brussels or Strasbourg.  There have been significant negotiations on what Europe will spend the money on over the next seven years.  All of us in our respective committees are part of that process.  From my party's perspective and the perspectives of all of us, we are very focused on the speech from Ursula von der Leyen about a green new deal and the prospect of aiming for lower emissions.  That was summed up in the incredible video from yesterday in which one saw the US President walk past a child from Sweden, therein capturing the global challenges we face at the moment.<\/p><p> The Chairman and I realise that these challenges are not easy.  They are tough and will affect what we build, where we build, how we travel and what we eat.  It is a huge challenge to reduce our carbon footprint.  Finding a meeting ground in the middle is a challenge to the policies the Chairman and I espouse.  I look forward to further discussion on that.<\/p><p> I will respond briefly to three questions, the first being on the challenge associated with the European way of life.  I am a European and very proud of it but I do not believe Europe would be what it is today without the influences of culture, food and people from the Middle East, China and Africa.  That is a significant part of what makes Europe.  It was very dangerous for Ursula von der Leyen to pit migration and the European way of life against each other in the same portfolio.  That was wrong.  I hope she will reconsider that proposal.<\/p><p> On the second question, Senator Craughwell raised the issue of the 12 countries, stretching from Finland to Greece, that have a border with the region outside the Union.  The difference is that Ireland is very dependent on its friend and nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom.  The countries stretching down the eastern border of the European Union do not have strong economic, social or environmental links with their neighbours but Ireland is inextricably bound to the United Kingdom and must manage the separation process.  It looks likely that there will be very significant job losses as part of that.  That is where the European Union comes in and where the Irish and UK Governments have to show leadership.<\/p><p> The final question was on an intelligence service or army for Europe.  The European Union has an internal security and situation centre.  We have an external action service.  Therefore, there is a lot of co-operation on how we meet the threats Europe faces within and without.  It is a very large jump to go all the way to the suggestion of a common European army from the clear need to have internal and external co-operation on issues of security.  We should be very careful not to conflate good security and intelligence with the need for a common European army.<\/p><p> I will leave it at that.  I must attend a meeting of the industry and energy committee so I will not be able to remain here for much longer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019092400002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cuffe.

We miss the Deputies and Senators who have been elected and we will deal with the by-elections that they have left us with in due course.  I thank them very much for that.<\/p> <p>  The European Parliament elections were very interesting in that the European People's Party and the Socialists and Democrats no longer command a majority.  There were gains for Renew Europe and the Greens.  It is quite a fragmented Parliament.  Do the witnesses believe there is any fallout from the appointment of the new President of the European Commission, in that the Spitzenkandidat system broke down and the European Council leaders did their own thing?  Is there bad feeling about that?  The mechanism for making major appointments in Brussels seemed a bit unseemly from this distance.<\/p> <p>  To follow on from that, it is suggested that Ursula von der Leyen had to rely in the European Parliament on votes from far right and populist MEPs from Italy, Poland and Hungary.  Is she compromised in that regard, in that she will not be seen to be effectively doing everything possible to ensure the rule of law is enforced at European Union level?  This is related to some of the questions some of my colleagues asked.<\/p> <p>  I have a final question.  The Brexit situation is unfolding as we speak and every day there is a new development.  The UK Supreme Court's judgment today is significant.  How do the MEPs and other movers and shakers in Europe feel about another request for an extension of Article 50?  It must be a genuine possibility arising from developments today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019092400002#E00300","speaker":"1360"},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":274,"content":"<p>We will now take two MEPs together for a bit of balance.

I will deal with the questions in three parts.  First, I will deal with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, AFCO, of which I am a member and the co-ordinator.  I am also member of the Committee on International Trade, and I am the co-ordinator of my group on Brexit.<\/p> <p>  On the AFCO committee, I will run through the current position on the files.  The committee is the lead committee dealing with Brexit.  The right of inquiry is one of the files that is still on our table.  It was on the table before the last mandate.  Unfortunately, the European Council, of which the Irish Government is a member, is blocking the right of inquiry in the sense of the Parliament having a role in strengthening the power of the Parliament.  That said, we have had legal services telling us we could possibly take the Council to court.  That is a discussion that is taking place among the co-ordinators and the Chair.<\/p> <p>  The other objective is to enhance the remit of the ombudsman.  As the committee knows, will be voting for the ombudsman in the time ahead.<\/p> <p>  We are currently doing work, led by me, on a proposal on possible treaty change that will cover climate justice and climate accountability.<\/p><p>Reference was made to the Commissioner's comments on European values.  When it comes to the environment and the carbon credit allowing global industries to pay to pollute, this does not meet the values promoted by our group.  The AFCO committee will be the lead committee in respect of the receipt of information on Brexit.  <\/p><p> On trade, I am a member of the trade committee, on which, along with my colleague, Mr. Matt Carthy, I am working hard on issues relating to the Mercosur agreement.  The D&aacute;il has already indicated its opposition to this agreement and Mr. Carthy and I propose to organise a hearing on the matter in the future, on which we will provide information to the committee.  <\/p><p> Like Ms Grace O'Sullivan, I work on the Palestinian delegation and previously chaired that delegation.  I have been calling relentlessly for the suspension of the association agreement because of the behaviour of the Israelis acting with impunity.  The D&aacute;il has supported the occupied territories Bill, which provides that the EU should not access goods made in the illegal settlements.  <\/p><p> The Australia-New Zealand trade agreement, which is at an advanced stage, is likely to provide for agricultural access.  Mr. Carthy is very concerned about the implications it will have in Ireland.  On the question of the difference between us and the other 11 countries referenced, Ireland is partitioned, it has had a conflict and is party to an international agreement that was lodged at the United Nations.  I could go on.  <\/p><p> Brexit will have profound implications for the island of Ireland.  The North of Ireland will be severely damaged by it.  This meeting is more than just an exchange of views between MEPs and Members of the Oireachtas or the observer status that exists.  This committee should be facilitating the conversation that is well under way, particularly in the North of Ireland, with regard to our future.  That is a democratic right.  People cannot speak out of both sides of their mouth, in my opinion.  They cannot continue to say they are going to uphold the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts, respecting the democratic provision in that agreement that affords us the opportunity to get out off this train that is going to potentially crash and go over a cliff, and at the same time tell us that we have to remain on it when there is a trigger mechanism in the Good Friday Agreement, an international agreement, and in law in terms of the two Governments having put in statute our right to self-determination.  Nine opinion polls have shown that the majority of people in the North do not want to crash out of the EU and do not want to be taken out of the EU.  <\/p><p> In regard to Brexit and the backstop, the backstop is the least-worst option, which we have stated repeatedly, but it still drags us out of the EU.  We do not want a situation where cows and washing machines have more EU legal standing than people.  This is about people.  It is about the peace process and the political process.  While not speaking for the people of Monaghan, Cavan and Donegal, I would say the last thing they want to see is physical infrastructure being moved onto that part of the island because of a UK crash-out from the EU, with the North being designated a third country.  This should not be tolerated and nor should it be expected that the people of Ireland would put up with it.  The sum of &euro;1.2 billion in weekly trade supports 200,000 jobs across this island.  This list of possible damage is endless.  Time does not permit me to go into all of the likely affected areas.<\/p><p> Next week, on 9 October, Matt Carthy and I will launch a report here in the European Parliament by Colin Harvey and Mark Bassett, which sets out the role the EU should be playing, as it did in Germany and Cyprus.  They identify all of Cyprus as being in the EU, even though the north of Cyprus is under Turkish control.  They set out the role the EU could play in facilitating a calm and considered conversation about the time ahead with regard to when a unity poll should be triggered, what should happen were the outworkings of that poll to be consent across the island - obviously, the consent of the two parts of the island is required - and the role and the work that would need to be done by the EU in planning for the day when the country would be reunited.<\/p><p> Later today, wearing my hat as co-ordinator of the AFCO committee and as GUE-NGL co-ordinator for Brexit, I will meet one of the Commissioner-designates and I will meet another tomorrow.  Mr. Carthy will address Commissioner Hogan's appointment.  Ireland could have nominated someone that had garnered the support of more of the people of Ireland than he did.  Mr. Carthy has been quite vocal on that issue.  I could say a lot more but I will leave it at that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019092400002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Martina Anderson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Anderson for her remarks and I acknowledge that we have been joined on the Brussels side by MEPs, Matt Carthy and Naomi Long.

I will be brief.  I am a member the Committee on Industry, Trade, Research and Energy, INTE and the Committee on International Trade, INTA.  <\/p> <p>  On trade, as the committee will be aware the outgoing Commissioner for Agriculture, Commissioner Hogan, is now the Commissioner-designate for trade.  His hearing will take place here in Brussels next Monday at 6 p.m. in respect of which we do not envisage any problems.  Based on the meetings I have attended thus far, Parliament has up to nine Commissioner-designates in its sight.  One or two may be dropped, or to use the unfortunate word used here, \"killed\", but Commissioner Hogan will not be one of them.  He will get through with flying colours and he will do a very good job.<\/p> <p>  On data, earlier this morning Ms Frances Fitzgerald and I had a meeting with Facebook on issues such as fake news and how to control it, etc.  I also attended another meeting with representatives of the biopharma industry in Ireland who are concerned about Brexit and industrial policy here and the IT climate, which is an area in which I have been involved for the past five years.  The areas on which I will be concentrating over the next few years are climate, industry, trade and agriculture.<\/p> <p>  Senator Craughwell asked whether Boris Johnson is likely to resign as a result of today's decision.  As we would say in Kerry, he will like hell, not a hope of it.  He is likely to come up with some other concoction.  There is no point going into too much detail on that issue.  We will just have to let it run its course.  <\/p> <p>  On Brexit and Deputy Haughey's question regarding whether, if an extension was requested, it would be granted, I believe it would.  It is encouraging that last Wednesday in Parliament, we voted on the European Parliament's resolution on the United Kingdom withdrawing from the European Union, which provided for the granting of an extension, if required, and the result was 544 for and 126 against.  This is an indication that if there is a crash out, the European Union will not be to blame for it. <\/p> <p>  As has been said, a meeting has been organised for tomorrow morning by Naomi Long, at which all Irish MEPs, North and South, will, hopefully, be in attendance, to discuss Brexit and its consequences.  Ms Long will be able to elaborate further on that meeting.  There is cross-party support here on Brexit, with not only MEPs from Ireland but from across Europe wearing the green vest on this issue.  We have held the line and this will be a further indication in that regard.  I will leave it at that because I also have to attend the INTA committee, which has already commenced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019092400002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly for his contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019092400002#F00400","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to engage with former and new colleagues in this fashion.  We are living in very interesting times.  We wish all the MEPs the very best in the challenges they face into the future.  I have long held the view that the UK leaving the European Union will be a disaster for the UK and will be of no great help to the European Union.  The European Commission, Mr. Barnier and his negotiators, have remained constant on the unified approach of the European Union.  That is the secret of success.<\/p><p>There will be other challenges.  There will be challenges to the rule of law across Europe, but I have no doubt that the European Parliament will be well able to deal with them as they arise.  However, we are living in a changing world.  It will be dramatically different from the world of the past 15 or 20 years.  In dealing with the challenges we, as Members of the national parliament, and the Members of the European Parliament need to keep in touch with each other to co-ordinate our approaches and recognise a common cause.<\/p><p> It is often said the European Union should be brought closer to the people.  I have the opposite view, that the people need to be brought closer to the European Union to ensure we all recognise each other as contributors to the European agenda, as well as major stakeholders in the European picture.<\/p><p> For several months there will be a serious recognition on many sides of the dire consequences if a member of the European Union breaks out with or without a deal.  The theory about a better deal being available after a break-out needs to be dealt with as it cannot be that way.  If it were to happen, the European Union would be no more.  There is a recognition on all sides that Brexit was not a good idea to start with and will not improve anybody&rsquo;s position, either elsewhere in Europe, the United Kingdom or Ireland.  The Good Friday Agreement was agreed to by the UK Government, supported by the United States and the European Union, while the Irish Government was a co-sponsor.  Much has been said about how the backstop is undemocratic.  The Good Friday Agreement was not undemocratic.  It was strongly supported by people on both sides of the political and social divide in Northern Ireland, as well as in the South.  In the time ahead Members of the national parliament and the European Parliament need to keep in close contact with each other to ensure we will have an influence on the agenda, as well as to recognise the challenges faced.  We must also recognise that the next five years in the formulation of the modern Europe will be vastly different from what we have experienced in the past 40 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019092400002#F00500","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569279600,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I thank members of the joint committee for hosting and facilitating this engagement.  It is another useful opportunity for us to share our views.<\/p> <p>  I hope Phil Hogan will be a success in his new commissionership role.  As Se&aacute;n Kelly said, I do not see much opposition in the European Parliament to his appointment.  I personally hope he will succeed, but I do not believe he will as he has not succeeded in any political role he has ever had before.  He was a disaster as a Minister and failed miserably as European agriculture Commissioner.  His final act in that role was to endorse the Mercosur trade deal which was a kick in the teeth for Irish farmers, the environment and the domestic economy.  It was done for the sole purpose that he did not want much opposition at European level to him taking on the trade commissionership.  Time will tell and I hope I will be proved wrong.  It is important that we have a strong Commissioner and it would have been my wish for the Government to appoint somebody with a track record who would have given confidence.<\/p> <p>  There are significant debates occurring all at once.  The EU trade agenda is the subject of one such debate.  I get the sense that the prevailing political opinion in Dublin is that free trade has been good for Ireland and that, therefore, all free trade deals are good.  I accept that free trade has been good for Ireland and that we need an open economy with trade agreements.  However, I do not agree with the premise that all trade agreements are good.  I do not believe the Mercosur trade deal is a good one for Ireland.  I am also concerned about the New Zealand trade deal.  What the beef sector will lose in Mercosur, the dairy sector will lose in the New Zealand trade deal.  I disagree with the proposition of investor-state dispute courts which will allow foreign corporations to sue national governments for implementing democratic decisions if they believe their profits have been impacted on.  This has been incorporated into most of the EU trade deals being negotiated.<\/p> <p>  There will be a big battle over the EU budget.  This is the crux of Senator Craughwells&rsquo;s point and where our opinions diverge.  There is an argument about whether we are on the road to having a European army.  Oireachtas Members and others across Europe, including the Commissioners responsible, have cited permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, and the European Defence Fund as pivotal building blocks for a European army.  That is their language, not mine, and they celebrate that fact, which is regrettable.  The proposal made by the European Commission is that Ireland will pay hundreds of millions of euro extra into the European budget.  In return, we will get less back under important programmes such as the CAP, in cohesion funding and other vital funding streams, for which EU membership is so valued.  Instead, the Commission is proposing that we open up a new budget line of &euro;13 billion for a European Defence Fund.  Ironically, that amount corresponds to what the British Government contributes to the European Union.  This is a militarisation agenda which does not have the support of people across Europe or the Irish people.  It is one of the mechanisms by which we see growth in the far right and other xenophobic elements.  This is a crucial time in terms of the direction the European Union will take.  If it wants the support of peoples across Europe, rather pursuing an expensive vanity exercise which will contribute nothing to peace and more to conflict, we need to change tack.  The Irish people, through their representatives, should be leading the charge in that regard.<\/p> <p>  CAP reform has fallen slightly off the agenda, but it will be crucial.  We have to protect and increase the budget, but this will proving difficult considering that our Commissioner signed off on a budget which will see a 15% cut in real terms in CAP funding.  For several weeks we have seen farmers protesting at beef factory gates because they have reached breaking point.  While it is welcome that the protests have been lifted, there is an onus to use all mechanisms to address the inequalities in our farming model.  They will be addressed partly through reform of the CAP.  I look forward to working with our colleagues in Dublin to ensure we will have a strong voice in calling for a redistribution model for the CAP that will ensure family farms that need most support receive an increased contribution under the CAP which, in turn, will allow them to continue providing the most sustainable agrifood products.<\/p> <p>  Much has been said about Brexit.  What we saw happen today was another outworking of the dysfunctionality of the Westminster system.<\/p><p>Given that the British Government is being taken to court and losing, with the court essentially describing its actions as unlawful, one can see why more and more people in Ireland are turning their backs on Westminster.  We have a big job of work to do.  We have been working here in the EU with everybody who will work with us to try to minimise the damage Brexit presents.<\/p><p> On Senator Craughwell's question, I am astounded that somebody would ask what is the difference between the border of Finland with another country and the border that partitions our country.  That is the fundamental difference.  The Border in Ireland is an artificial border that was put in place for political purposes and has been nothing but a cause of grief since being implemented.  The Border and partition has cost Ireland economically, politically and socially.  It has cost us countless lives as a result of the conflict and, therefore, the mechanisms that were put in place to undo the damage of partition and undo the impact of the Border were twofold.  These are the Good Friday Agreement and the rights that were provided within it, especially the right of the people in the North to identify themselves as Irish citizens if that was their choice.  This means there is a responsibility on Oireachtas Members to protect the rights of those citizens.  Coupled with that was the membership of the Single Market and the customs union, which meant the physical manifestations of the Border could be undone.<\/p><p> I am from County Monaghan and my nearest county is Armagh.  To suggest to me or to anyone in the community where I live that we would just have to accept checks or regulations between Monaghan and Armagh is the equivalent of someone saying that the Chairman should have to do the same between counties Kerry and Cork.  It would not be tolerated in Munster, and it should not be in Ulster.  I believe we should be strong in that position.  If the British Government or the EU are insistent that some checks or hardening of the Border takes place, there will be an onus on us to consider constitutional avenues to ensure this does not happen.  Those constitutional avenues are available within the Good Friday Agreement.  There is an onus on all of us to start having the conversation in event that we need to use those avenues to undo the damage of Brexit in our country so that the preparatory work is done and we will have had the conversation around the constitutional, economic and political frameworks of a united Ireland, the transitional arrangements, and what all of the outworkings would look like.  There is an onus and responsibility on all of us to have those conversations now so that we do not make the same mistakes as the Brexiteers and end up having a referendum with nobody knowing what happens next the day after the referendum.  We want to make sure that does not happen, but for us to be able to that we must collectively have those big conversations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019092400002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Carthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Carthy.

I apologise for running late.  Reference was made to the events unfolding in Westminster today and before I arrived, I was dealing with some of those issues in the media.<\/p> <p>  I shall briefly outline the committees I am on and I shall also refer to the appointment and election of Ursula von der Leyen.  I want to focus on Brexit because that is my central focus in the EU Parliament.  Brexit is at a critical juncture and it is important that I retain my focus on that above everything else.<\/p> <p>  I am a member of the EU Parliament's committee on regional development, REGI, and of the FEMM committee, both of which are important in terms of equality and rights.  Those committees will also have an impact on funding in a post-Brexit scenario, which I take a particularly keen interest in.  I am also a sub on the committee on agriculture and rural development, AGRI.  Some of the joint committee members will have rehearsed the challenges of Mercosur, especially for beef farming, and for agriculture more generally.  I am keeping an eye on this for farming and environmental reasons.  I have quoted the figures I got from the Ulster Farmers' Union, UFU, previously.  A kilogramme of beef produced in Ireland has a carbon footprint of about 16 kg.  A kilogramme of beef produced in South America has a carbon footprint 80 kg.  When it comes to reducing carbon uptake, this is a significant difference.  We need to get this across.  There is no point having high ideals on the environment if our trade relations do not reinforce those high ideals.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to Ursula von der Leyen.  I have no issue with promoting EU values such as openness, equality, freedom and democracy.  These are all very valuable values that we should act to protect and promote.  I have a problem, however, when people use phrases such as \"our European way of life\" because I believe there is a tendency for phrases like that to be used as a dog whistle to those on the far right, those who are Islamophobic and those who are xenophobic.  The President-elect, Ms von der Leyen, has coupled this with the work on migration and this is an unfortunate juxtaposition because I believe it says that it is in some way related to migration.  I do not believe that immigration is a threat to our way of life.  Some of the threats to democracy at the moment are coming from within, not from without.  We need to be conscious of othering people who come to the EU from all around the globe and who make a valuable contribution.  I will wait, with a degree of scepticism, to see how that pans out.<\/p> <p>  With regard to what is happening in EU Parliament on Brexit, which is of acute concern to those of us in Northern Ireland in the Border counties and beyond, I detect that patience is starting to run out with the process.  I detect this particularly among some of our French colleagues.  I believe there is something of a power play going on at the moment.  The exit of the UK would leave France in a much stronger position within the EU, and I suspect this has contributed somewhat to their eagerness to see this resolved in sharpish fashion.  We also need to be careful because it plays into the general exhaustion of the public, the political class and the media with Brexit.  People are sick of Brexit and I hold my hands up because I am also sick of Brexit.  There is a tendency of people to get into the mindset of, \"Just let us get this done.\"  One of the key messages I am trying to get out with colleagues is that this will not go away once a decision has been made.  Over the next ten to 15 years, this will continue to be on the political agenda, affect decision-making going forward and influence policy.  Right now, it is more important to get this right than to get it done.  It is much more important that we take the time to make decisions correctly and not rush towards a conclusion simply because of people being fed up.<\/p> <p>  It is almost inevitable that the UK Government will not survive the current crisis without a general election.  There is also the possibility of a second referendum, momentum for which is growing in the EU Parliament.  Even if a deal is possible in the short timeframe available, there will need to be an extension for it to be ratified in the UK Parliament and in the EU 27 member states.  Some form of extension is almost inevitable.  I am reasonably confident that this extension will be granted if asked for, and certainly the resolution that was passed last week in the EU Parliament indicates support for that.  I have a concern that there is a degree of conditionality attached to this.  While I have sympathy with those who want a clear answer as to what the UK intends to use the extension for, I am concerned that the conditionality could give Boris Johnson wriggle room to say that he has complied with the letter of the law in asking for an extension but that he will not accept the extension given because of the attached conditions.  We need to tread cautiously.  There is work for the Irish Government and others to make sure that any extension is not framed in a way that allows Boris Johnson to wriggle out of his responsibilities.  As we saw with the ruling of the Supreme Court today, he is more than happy to wriggle out of responsibilities at every single level.  On the question of his future and whether he should resign, I have no doubt whatsoever that he should.  He is unfit for office and this has been reinforced by today's judgment, not discovered by it.<\/p><p>He ought to go but will he resign?  I do not believe he will.  He may use today's ruling to try, through some machinations, to get a vote of no confidence moved in the British Parliament against him that would put the Labour Party in the invidious position of having to vote confidence in the British Prime Minister to keep the British Parliament standing and avoid the snap general election that he has sought all along.  That could cause real problems.  Trying to predict what might happen from here is incredibly difficult but I am pretty certain that whatever is Mr. Johnson's next move, it will be to try to sustain himself in Downing Street.  That is his only objective.<\/p><p> It has been mentioned by others that we will have an event tomorrow focusing specifically on Northern Ireland and the issues around the Good Friday Agreement and people's quality of life.  Much has been said about the economic impact of Brexit and that is understandable because it will have a massive impact across the island.  There are also psychological, political and social ramifications of Brexit that we must consider.  We must examine how people's lives will be impacted by changes at the Border.  Tomorrow we will start by looking at the Good Friday Agreement and we have a former Taoiseach, Mr. John Bruton, as keynote speaker.  We will also have contributions from Mr. Tony Blair and Mr. Bertie Ahern.  All the MEPs from Ireland, North and South, and the UK who are pro-remain have been party to the organisation of the event.  I have also invited Ms Diane Dodds, MEP, from Northern Ireland.  I invited a member from the Brexit Party because it is important that such people hear first hand the realities of the Border and do not simply sweep away or dismiss the concerns that people are expressing.<\/p><p> The second panel will involve people from Northern Ireland.  They started to arrive today.  It is a broad mix, with people from Border Communities Against Brexit and the Climate Change Coalition in Northern Ireland, as well as a community worker from Derry and some academics.  It is a broad panel and the idea is to try to give a lived experience that brings colour to the concerns relating to the Border.  MEPs who observe the proceedings should feel they can understand better than when they arrived the complexities of the position. <\/p><p> There are different views among all the parties and I have listened to Mr. Carthy and Ms Anderson understandably arguing that the solution to this is a united Ireland.  It is the solution to everything when one speaks to them and I understand where they are coming from on that.  There are complexities in other people's positioning.  Some of the UK MEPs want a people's vote and others want a general election, etc.  We are trying to get to a point where everyone agrees that a hard Brexit would be incredibly damaging, as all the Northern Irish parties do, on the surface at least.  That is a common position taken North and South and it is a position that I want to see other UK MEPs bring on board, as well as other MEPs from across the European Union.  We need to reinforce at this point just how vulnerable Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement would be to any hard border.<\/p><p> It is also important to say that I hope we will be able to get some kind of joint statement from all the MEPs as a result of this, which would be quite a powerful counter to what we have seen of late where much of the diplomacy between Dublin and London feels like megaphone diplomacy.  I do not necessarily hold Dublin responsible for it and the way the UK Government has responded to the Brexit issue has made it incredibly difficult.  I was a member of the Assembly but it has been suspended for three years and there is no serious prospect of it being restored because of what is going on with Brexit and the inability of the UK Government to shake loose of the Democratic Unionist Party.  I am concerned that the Good Friday Agreement should be front and centre of the discussions we have on Brexit and the restoration of the Agreement in all its parts.  I agree with Ms Anderson as all its parts should include having a working Assembly and delivering for people on the ground through it, as well as all the other structures North and South, east and west, as envisaged.  Until we get to that point, we have much work to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2019092400002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Naomi Long","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":287,"content":"<p>To those who were able to make the meeting today this has been a very worthwhile experience.

I am told today's meeting might even go viral.  It is great that there is such a level of interest in this serious matter of mental health issues and their effects on the Traveller community.  This is the first public session of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community.  The joint committee was established at the end of May to consider a number of topics over the next six months.  As such, the clock starts ticking for our work as a committee today.<\/p> <p>  We are starting our deliberations with mental health, on which we will have three sessions.  We will then consider health, education, employment and accommodation and how these issues impact on the Traveller community.  As we listen to the voices and undertake our deliberations, I am sure we will realise that all of these matters are interconnected.  We will, however, consider them in their own right.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of today's meeting is to meet and listen to representatives of the Traveller Mental Health Network, the Irish Traveller Movement, Kerry Traveller Health Community Development Project, the Wexford Development Group and Pavee Point.  Mental health is a critical issue for the committee to consider.  Suicide was the cause of 11% of all Traveller deaths in 2010 according to the all-Ireland Traveller study.  That report is nearly ten years old and the committee must address the importance of updating that study.  The statistics were stark then but we also need to know what the current position is.  In 2017, seven years after the 2010 study, the national Traveller behaviour and attitudes study found that suicide affected the lives of 82% of Travellers.  It is not only families but the whole community that is affected by suicide, as we will hear in great detail.<\/p> <p>  While the numbers are shocking, even more shocking is that very little changed between 2010 and 2017.  The experiences of racism, exclusion and discrimination that members of the Traveller community face have a profound and deeply troubling impact on mental health.  With 90% of Travellers in 2017 agreeing that mental health problems were common in their community, action, not just listening and talking, is urgently required.  Over the course of the three sessions we are devoting to mental health, we want to understand the scale and impact of the issue, the causes and drivers of mental ill-health and, crucially, how the State and its agencies respond to the scale of the crisis we have.<\/p> <p>  The Traveller population is approximately 40,000, which is equivalent to the population of Swords.  If there was such a high rate of suicide or mental ill-health in a town with such a population, we would declare a national emergency.<\/p><p>It is very important that we understand this, in that context of mental health.  It is grossly misunderstood and under-reported.  We, as a committee, need to understand the horrifying effects the mental ill-health epidemic has on Travellers' lives and communities.<br\/><br\/>Second, we need to address the causes and the pressure points.  Mental health cannot be analysed in a vacuum.  In the case of the Traveller community, it may be looked at as reaction - a reaction to racism, to unemployment, to persistent discrimination in schools, in workplaces and in the broader society and to poverty.<br\/><br\/>Third, the committee will recommend responses and solutions to improve the mental health and lives of Travellers.<br\/><br\/>A greater emphasis needs to be placed on Traveller mental health, without losing sight of the impact of internal factors on a person's mental health, which include the experiences of discrimination, internalised racism, inequality and the lack of cultural respect.  Most importantly, however, we must listen to the testimonials we will hear today, to the Traveller community and their voices.<br\/><br\/>We have with us today the National Traveller Mental Health Network, The Irish Traveller Movement, Pavee Point, the Wexford Traveller Development Group and Kerry Traveller Health Community Development Project.  In future sessions we will be hearing more voices, including on 8 October, and from health professionals, Government Departments, the Minister and the HSE.<br\/><br\/>On behalf of the committee I welcome Mr. Martin Reilly from the National Traveller Metal Health Network; Mr. Bernard Joyce from the Irish Traveller Movement; Ms Brigid Quilligan, Kerry Traveller Health Community Development Project; Ms Minnie Connors and Mr. Anthony Walsh from the Wexford Traveller Development Group; and Mr. Patrick Reilly.<br\/><br\/>One of the matters we need to be very careful about is privilege.  Therefore, in accordance with procedures, I am required to draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings, which is mental health and Travellers, is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make that person identifiable, all of which is very important.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice members to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of these Houses, or on any official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br\/><br\/>I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones because this interferes with the sound system and the recording.  I also wish to advise that any submissions or opening statements that witnesses have made to the joint committee will be published on the committee website's after this meeting.<br\/><br\/>After the presentations by witnesses, there will be questions from members of the joint committee.  We will allow all the submissions to be made and will have questions then afterwards, so that we ensure witnesses' voices can be heard first.  Questions will follow.<br\/><br\/>I call on Mr. Reilly to make the opening statement for the National Traveller Mental Health Network.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019092400002#C00200","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569279600,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I ask the committee to bear with me as this is my first time here.

As the director of the Irish Traveller movement, a national membership-based, Traveller-led organisation, I very much welcome the committee's examination on the matter of Traveller mental health and the opportunity to present to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Traveller experience of mental health is long-established and reflected in Government policy as far back as the Traveller health status study from 1986.  Traveller health was a national Traveller strategy from 2000 to 2005 that led to the Traveller health advisory committee being set up and recommendations which delivered the most comprehensive audit of Traveller health, referred to as the all-Ireland health study, in 2010.<\/p> <p>  Despite the Government strategy of 2002 and the benchmark and pathway all-Ireland study, no dedicated budget was made available to resource the critical actions within it.  Since then, there has been no prioritising towards resourcing Travellers' distinct mental health outcomes with a dedicated framework.  Since the 2010 study, there has been an ongoing increase in the level of suicide in the community and poor health outcomes broadly.  The national Travellers sample survey in 2017 found that 90% of all Travellers said that mental health was a problem in the community.  Some 82% of Travellers reported having been affected by suicide, four in ten of these being affected by suicide in the wider family, 49% among local Travellers or neighbours, and 38% among friends or colleagues, creating a multi-level effect on the family.<\/p><p>There are particular concerns regarding the rise of suicide among young women.  Suicide represented 11% of all Traveller deaths in 2010, most commonly in Traveller men aged 15 to 26 years.  This rate is six times higher than in the settled population.  There has been a steep rise in the incidence of suicide in the past five years, with a distinct emergence among Traveller women.  The past two years in particular have been a cause of great concern to us, where female deaths have included children as young as 14 years.  Reports suggest an increase of suicide among young women in their teens and early 20s.  Based on deaths reported to the Irish Traveller Movement by our members and networks, there were at least 30 deaths by suicide in the period January to August 2019 in Dublin, Cork, Tipperary, Limerick, Wexford, Clare and Kerry.  From our figures, though, this is an underestimate.<\/p><p> The incidence of suicide in the community is outrunning the very low progress to date of limited strategies such as Connecting for Life, the National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015-2020, where Travellers are included in only one of 39 actions.  The lack of data by way of a national study or an assessment of need worsens the problem.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, and National Suicide Research Foundation have a role to play when recording and monitoring.  However, the CSO does not collect statistics on Travellers.  There is no specific inclusion of Travellers as a high-risk group in the HSE national service plan 2019.<\/p><p> Of grave concern to the community is that, in the nine years since the all-island health study, which demonstrated a disproportionate level of suicide and poor mental health outcomes, there has been little intervention.  In 2017, seven years after the study, 13 actions towards Traveller and Roma mental health were identified as part of a national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy.  The latest progress shows that one of these has been achieved, namely, the recruitment of nine mental health service co-ordinators to support access to and delivery of mental health services for Travellers in each community area.  Progress on other actions has either not been initiated or is at an early stage of development.  A budget to deliver on these actions has not been ring-fenced.<\/p><p> The policies and strategies to address Traveller mental health are disconnected and, given the scale of the programme, lack a priority focus.  There is no ring-fenced budget to provide resources.  There is additional complexity, as the actions are dispersed across Departments.  There is no advisory group overseeing the implementation and progress, and supporting data collection is inadequate.<\/p><p> In our submission, we have made a number of key recommendations.  I can refer to them later in my reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019092400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Joyce","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Joyce.

I am the manager of Kerry Travellers Health &amp;amp; Community Development Project.  On behalf of our organisation and the Travellers in Kerry, I thank the committee for the opportunity to make a presentation on the topic of mental health issues affecting the Traveller community.  Ours is a county-wide community development project which incorporates a health action zone.  We work with Travellers who are static, those who are nomadic and those who have emigrated but who find it difficult to access services abroad.  We operate from the principles of community development, equality, participation, empowerment, inclusion and self-determination.<\/p> <p>  We have been working for 21 years to support the local communities of Travellers in Kerry to respond proactively to the issues facing us.  We have developed innovative programmes and initiatives in the areas of health, education, culture, identity, accommodation, leadership, Traveller economy, employment, enterprise, horse ownership, gender-based violence and youth development.  Our work has evolved over the years, as has our analysis.  We are fortunate to have the benefit of a strong HSE community work department in the region, strong links with mental health services locally and nationally, a strong Traveller health unit in the region and a Traveller community that is proactive and committed to creating change.<\/p> <p>  Using a social determinants of health model, we see clear implications for health associated with poor living conditions and high levels of exclusion and discrimination faced by Travellers every day.  All these issues, experienced to a greater or lesser extent by most Travellers, impact negatively on both mental and physical well-being.  While we work on supporting access to mental health services, in order to have an appropriate response to prevention we must look at the root causes of the mental health issues and suicide epidemic among Travellers.  We use the word \"epidemic\" because it is an epidemic.  There is no single Traveller in the country or in this room who does not know the heartbreak, pain and hopelessness of seeing somebody one loves spiral into darkness in mental health, thinking that suicide is the only option.  Fine young men, women and children are dying before our eyes.  Travellers in Kerry are diverse.  We have the most beautiful county in the country, and this sometimes is part of the problem.  The beauty belies the mental health crisis that the Traveller constituents of Kerry are experiencing.  A strong, proud and resilient community, we are at breaking point.  There is no person in the community who has not experienced the devastation of losing somebody he or she loves to suicide.  We watch our loved ones battle anxiety, depression, severe mental illness and addiction.<\/p> <p>  In preparing this submission, we consulted 61 individuals from a diverse range of backgrounds and experience within the Traveller community.  The findings were that the Traveller community in Kerry feels under siege, externally and internally, and that our mental and physical health is suffering.  The key message from the community is that there is a mental health and suicide crisis in the community.  All 61 respondents had lost family members or close friends to suicide.  Five respondents had attempted suicide and 22 are being treated for depression.  Seven respondents were hospitalised in the past five years for psychiatric problems.  The abuse of alcohol, prescription drugs, illegal drugs and gambling were named as co-existing problems.  We asked them what was the one message they wanted the committee to hear.  Overwhelmingly it was that they had been treated badly from a young age because of their Traveller identity, that this had created great trauma and that the mental health crisis in the Traveller community is a result of the denial of, and attack on, Traveller identity, ethnicity, culture, history and ways.<\/p> <p>  The community feels that the work the Traveller projects the mental health services in the community work department do is very valuable.  However, it is viewed as addressing the symptoms, not the causes.  A culture of blame is perceived to exist, where Travellers are blamed for their oppression, the marginalisation and discrimination they experience and the poor outcomes they experience in the areas of health, education, employment, integration and equality.  The hurt and pain the community feels as a result of its mistreatment over generations by the State was relayed time and again.  There is a sadness that addiction, suicide and intra-Traveller conflict appear to be increasing and an analysis that the community is turning on each other.<\/p> <p>  The 2016 census showed that there were 998 Travellers in Kerry.  Conservatively, we believe the figure to be 50% higher.<\/p><p>We have a large nomadic population in Killarney, the second largest in Ireland.  The nomadic Traveller community from Kerry travels within Ireland, the UK, the US, Europe, Australia and Canada.  There has been a strong history and culture in Kerry of Travellers from all towns travelling frequently for short spells between the UK and Ireland for the past 50 years.  We have no concrete research on this, just anecdotal evidence but we believe that nomadic Travellers who self-identify as such fare better in terms of their mental health.<\/p><p> There is a national unconscious bias against Travellers.  It is the last acceptable form of racism in Ireland.  Being a Traveller and being proud of one's identity feels like an act of resistance.  There is no acknowledgement of the pain, hurt, abuse and racism that generations of Irish Travellers in this State have suffered.  <\/p><p> I will now give a brief outline of our recommendations which are covered in depth in our written submission.  The main recommendation is that Traveller mental health and suicide be approached and named as a national crisis.  We need a different approach to dealing with Traveller mental health.  It must be taken much more seriously because too many of our people are dying and effective policies are not being implemented.  We call for an independent national inquiry into the treatment of Travellers since the formation of the State and for enhanced legal protection of Travellers.  We recommend the introduction of targeted mental health programmes specifically for Travellers and a national media campaign to highlight the issues around mental health for Travellers.  We call for a review of services to Travellers, the representation of Travellers across all Departments in Ireland and for an ethnic identifier to be implemented across all State services.  Anti-racism and discrimination training for all staff must be prioritised by the Department of Health.  In order to address inequality, Travellers must be central to the design and delivery of services to their community.  The inequality in the political representation of Travellers must be addressed by the State.  Community development departments must be reinstated within all CHO areas.  <\/p><p> On behalf of Kerry Travellers, I thank the committee for listening to our presentation and welcome the opportunity to elaborate on some of the points made and to answer questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019092400002#G00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Brigid Quilligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Quilligan for her presentation.

The submission before the committee was difficult and painful to put together but the Wexford group has little confidence that it will make any difference to the lives of Travellers in Ireland.  Since speaking in this House in July, many other examples of the worst type of discrimination have occurred around me.  A young Traveller family was granted a house after passing Garda vetting but, following objections from local people with the support of local councillors acting on information passed on freely by the council, the decision was overturned and the house was taken back.  Only last Monday, my husband brought my children to school early.  He was told by a member of the staff that children could only enter the school at 9 a.m., a rule we had never heard of in decades of connection with the same school.  In the school playground about 25 children played freely, including children of the staff member.  We have been accustomed to such treatment but our children should not be made to suffer the same level of racism and discrimination.<\/p> <p>  Almost everywhere Travellers go, there are judgments and assumptions made about us.  In Ireland's social pecking order, Travellers are given the lowest status.  Travellers are viewed by the vast majority of settled people as engaging in anti-social and criminal activity, particularly stealing whenever they have the opportunity.  As long as these blatantly unfair assumptions exist, based on ignorance and prejudice, there is little hope of developing social inclusion within our communities.<\/p><p>The stereotyping of Travellers is also the reason so few are employed.  This means that Travellers are dependent on the State for social welfare, which reinforces low social status.<\/p><p> Many important questions have to be answered.  Why are Traveller mothers encouraged to use Wysoy food supplement for their newborn babies when settled mothers are encouraged to breastfeed?  Why, even in death, do people not want to be buried beside members of the Traveller community?  Why are Travellers, especially male Travellers, who present for mental health services treated in an off-hand way and asked questions which settled people are never asked, such as whether they are facing any criminal charges?  All of these factors contribute to the feelings of hopelessness and isolation which many Travellers experience.  As a result of the erosion of Traveller culture due to laws enacted by the Irish State and Travellers being forced to settle, mental health problems, including suicide, have increased greatly.  I would not wish to see this horrendous level of pain inflicted on any person, but Travellers live with it every day.<\/p><p> There are positive and negative practices and values in the Traveller community, the settled community, and every other community.  Despite this, the Traveller community is blamed for all the ills it experiences to justify the high levels of prejudice heaped upon it.  Stigma and myths are taken as fact.  When a person is made a scapegoat in a society, many unhealthy social traits are expected of that person.  I have been at many Traveller events and I have never experienced any trouble at any of them.  Despite this, I have to suffer the consequences of the few instances that have occurred.  I do not steal or take what is not mine, yet I am followed around shops and often asked to leave.<\/p><p> One of the recommendations we have presented in our submission, recommendation 1.3, is the vital need to raise awareness of Traveller culture at every level of society.  This includes schools, the HSE, mental health services, county councils, any organisation part-funded by the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, all Departments and, most important, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Training for Travellers with regard to the promotion of positive mental health would be beneficial, particularly if groups were established in which members of the Traveller community could work together with members of the settled community, motivated by a common focus and common goals.  A model could be developed that celebrates and challenges positive and negative aspects of both communities with a view to greater understanding and inclusivity.<\/p><p> I dream of the day when Traveller culture is honoured and celebrated.  This will greatly boost our self-esteem on a bedrock of good mental health.  I represent all the Traveller community today, but I especially represent my children in the hope that they will one day be treated with respect and fairness and seen for the unique, beautiful people they are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019092400002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Minnie Connors","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Connors for her powerful testimony about the things that create feelings of inadequacy, such as exclusion in shops and schools.

I compliment my colleagues from the other Traveller organisations for highlighting the issues affecting our community.  Given the limited time we have and the complexity of the issues we wish to highlight, we will focus specifically on the key issues and the strategic recommendations.<\/p><p>All members of the joint committee have received a copy of our submission, which sets out some key issues and recommendations for Travellers with regard to mental health.  To date, Travellers have been invisible in mental health policy and service provision.  The well-established findings of the all-Ireland Traveller health study reveal the extent of the Traveller mental health crisis and identify the Traveller community as a high-risk group in relation to suicide and poor mental health, including frequent mental distress.  The Traveller population experiences a higher burden of mental illness and suicide than the non-Traveller population.  The suicide rate among Travellers is six times higher than the rate among the general population.  Suicide accounts for approximately 11% of all Traveller deaths.  I ask the members of the joint committee to take a moment to reflect on the fact that one in ten Travellers dies by suicide.  We have moved beyond crisis point.<br\/><br\/>As the mental health worker in Pavee Point, I engage on a daily basis with Travellers who are experiencing crises of this nature.  As a Traveller man, I see directly the impact that suicide and poor mental health are having on our community.  To put this in perspective, suicide is so common in our community that it is part of everyday reality.  When I was at a Traveller funeral two years ago, someone said to me that suicide has become so common that we do not make a wonder of it anymore.  That is the level we are at.  We are tired of the <i>status quo<\/i>.  Traveller organisations alone cannot take the burden of addressing these issues.  We have done our part in responding to the crisis by developing local responses within existing budgets which are already under-resourced.  Traveller health has not received any new dedicated funding since 2008, although we acknowledge the once-off funding from the HSE from the Dormant Accounts Fund 2017-2019 action plan mental health initiative for Travellers.  Nine HSE mental health service co-ordinators for Travellers have been appointed, but just eight of them are in their positions at present.  If we are serious about having better outcomes, we need a long-term plan that is focused, strategic and resourced.<br\/><br\/>I ask members of the committee to bear in mind that the Traveller mental health crisis is arising in the broader context of widening Traveller health inequalities.  We do not think such inequalities have been prioritised or supported at senior management level in the Department of Health.  It is clear from the recent draft of the national Traveller health action plan, which was circulated by the HSE earlier this year, that the Department has absolved itself of any responsibility for Traveller health.  This is further evidenced by the Department's refusal to re-establish the Traveller health advisory committee, which has not met since 2012 despite the support of the Minister, Deputy Harris.  This is an unsustainable solution to a protracted crisis.  A well-resourced and co-ordinated strategic national response with all key stakeholders, including the Department of Health , is urgently required.  Traveller organisations, health units and primary health care projects are ready, willing and able to play a part in identifying the issues and developing appropriate responses.<br\/><br\/>It is in this context that we are making our recommendations.  The national Traveller health action plan should be published as a matter of urgency and an independent implementation body, with ring-fenced budgets to drive delivery and implementation, should be established.  Sl&aacute;intecare recommends that there should be access to universal GP care within five years.  We recommend that Travellers should be prioritised and fast-tracked in this process.  Furthermore, we recommend that all Travellers employed in primary healthcare projects should be entitled to retain their medical cards with immediate effect.  The service that the employees in question have given to the State, when taken with the level of health inequality among the Traveller population, which is similar to disability, means that this entitlement should be extended to community service programmes and community employment schemes.  This would involve approximately 300 medical cards across the country.<br\/><br\/>Traveller-specific health infrastructure, including Traveller health units and primary healthcare projects, should be protected.  Increased resources should be allocated for their expansion and development.  A clear budget should be allocated and protected to address Traveller health inequalities at national level.  Dedicated resources should be provided to support Traveller mental health.  A standardised ethnic identifier, consistent with the national census and inclusive of the Roma population, should be implemented as a matter of priority across all routine data and administrative systems, including mental health services, to monitor equality of access, participation and outcomes across suicide prevention and mental health services for Travellers, the Roma population and other priority groups.  It is essential for the application of an ethnic identifier to take place within a human rights framework.  Finally, the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care should be implemented without further delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019092400002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Reilly.

I am reminded that we are here to try to look at solutions.

We have been tasked with finding solutions.<\/p> <p>  It reminds me of putting a lot of people in a working class community who have experienced poverty into a room and asking them to figure out how to get out of poverty.

People who have the least amount of resources and control are expected to change policy and services.  Sitting here today as a Senator, I know how difficult it will be to make sure that we do something that is strong and representative enough and can actually create change because nobody wants to have to keep telling their stories for the rest of their lives in the hope that the regurgitation of the discrimination, pain and trauma a person feels will result in something coming of it.  That has an effect on mental health.<\/p> <p>  We see the headline stuff that massively impacts on mental health, namely, accommodation, education, discrimination and exclusion.  Anybody who wants to contribute to what I am saying is welcome to do so.  My comments are not directed at anyone in particular.<\/p> <p>  Exclusion between settled people and Travellers is something I have always observed in my community and between students in our classrooms.  I always wondered if there was a way to create better solidarity at a very basic community level.  Growing up, when I felt State discrimination and exclusion due to my background I still had a strong community to identify with and relate to, and I knew it would have my back.  We do not support and back many of the Traveller friends and students living in our communities, and the very first instance of exclusion begins in the classroom with peers and students.  I want to know how we begin to challenge the very first point of exclusion of communities within communities.<\/p> <p>  I try to challenge bias within groups of friends and people I love and respect.  I find myself backing away from the conversation because I am always very conscious that I am in a room full of people and if there are Travellers in the room I do not want them to all of a sudden hear a heated debate between someone who is advocating for respect for Travellers and someone in the room who has an awful view which I am trying to fight.  <\/p> <p>  How can we be better allies in classrooms, schools and our communities?  When walking through my community I always wondered why I could walk through the whole estate, but not the purpose-built estates where Travellers lived.  There was no avenue for me to walk from my house to the shop and be able to pass my Traveller friends in my class and say, &ldquo;Hello.  How are you doing?&rdquo;  In the makeup of the estate we always seemed to be separated.  How do we create conversation, awareness and be allies in a safe way for Traveller inclusion on that basic level in our local services, communities and schools?<\/p> <p>  My next question concerns schools.<\/p><p>I visit a lot of schools and I hear a lot of conversations which teachers have.  Recently, a teacher kept speaking of \"dealing with the Traveller children\".  I wondered what she meant by \"dealing with\".  Every student in the classroom is a student but she used this phrase in this case, instead of \"teach\" or some other such word.  She framed the matter as a problem to be dealt with.  How can we begin to change that and get to the stage where schools have Traveller or Roma teachers or board members, with whom young Traveller students can identify?  How can we educate people to change this?  It is awful to have to talk of training people to be human.  We should not have to teach people about unconscious bias.  People should treat people with respect and should respect other cultures and diversity.  Indeed, we should celebrate these things.  How can we begin to address the community aspect of discrimination from primary school through to the final school levels?  A young child feels exclusion and discrimination from an early stage in the education system.  If we address this only towards the end of a child's time in school, we only put plasters on the problem such as with targeted mental health programmes.  What do we need to do to prevent high suicide rates, depression and anxiety in the Traveller community?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019092400002#L00100","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":317,"content":"<p>What are the witnesses' thoughts on solidarity and building allies in the community?

It is very difficult for our community but we want to address it and that is why we are here.  We have striven at local level for 30 years to build relationships and to understand the contexts for exclusion.  We have tried to build an analysis and find ways to build bridges with communities in local areas and in society, which is now quite diverse.  In the context of the values and principles of Traveller organisations, we work towards building solidarity and unity and the issues we have are very much those that affect the wider community at some level.  Racism affects our community but it also affects other communities, such as migrant workers who come from different countries.<\/p> <p>  There is an extent to which people want to integrate Travellers into their way of life, as opposed to accepting our way of life, and this shows an imbalance of power.  Nomadism is one of the core parts of Traveller culture, identity and way of life.  It is not a lifestyle but a way of being, yet it was robbed from us by the 2000 Act, which criminalises Travellers for moving.  Other legislation in recent years curtailed horse ownership while other legislation, made by non-Travellers, restricts every element of Travellers' culture and identity and strips it away.<\/p><p>We have only recently come before the political establishment in terms of these forums.  We have moved from policy to legislation followed by more legislation seeking to literally eradicate or remove Travellers to then assimilating them, and that has been happening since the foundation of the State.  We have no Traveller representatives in the D&aacute;il, no Senators or Deputies, no political representation.  Every discussion we have is on the back foot.  When we talk about culture people talk about justification and try to convince me about Traveller identity and culture.  When we talk about racism people try to justify or explain how Travellers should be better citizens and again we are starting from being on the back foot.  Yet when it comes to national level and representing Ireland, we are to the forefront; we carry the flag.  Francis Barrett went to the Olympics and he was a frontrunner in carrying the Irish flag.  We feel very proud of our nationality, culture and the achievements people have made on our behalf, both nationally and abroad.  We watched the rugby over the weekend and all the other sports.<\/p><p> In terms of where we are coming from and where we are going, first, we need to address the legislation and policy.  We need to ensure we address the core cause of Travellers&rsquo; mental health issues.  We must put forward some of the recommendations that have been made.  It really is about the ethnic identifier, the ring-fencing of resources and having a national Traveller health strategy.  Some members of this committee have championed a Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  It is not up to individuals to constantly have to articulate these issues and we cannot expect them to do so.  In terms of legislation, it is important society starts to look at Travellers differently post-Traveller ethnicity recognition and examines how we can build a better society that acknowledges and recognises everybody and that the Traveller community have a really important role within that.  It is about acceptance.  When one accepts that one accepts other cultures and one accepts Travellers as an indigenous group within Ireland who want to play a full and active role.  We have been doing that for as long as I - both an activist and member of a local organisation, now the Irish Traveller Movement &ndash; can remember.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019092400002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Joyce","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Joyce for that.

We now have political will.  We have the Minister saying that this is what is needed and that this is what will happen but at Department level it was completely blocked.  When we talk about solidarity, it needs to be at that level because as Traveller organisations or Traveller representatives, we have done the studies.  The All-Ireland Traveller Health Study  and the Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes study is available.  We cannot do any more research.  It is available and staring people in the face.<\/p> <p>  I know Martin, whose son-in-law died, and I have seen the effects of that.  I cannot talk for anyone else here.  We know what is happening on the ground.  We have good politicians.  The political will is there but the solidarity is not there at departmental level.  We saw that with the Traveller Health Action Plan on which there were good consultations across the country.  However, when that plan went back to the Department of Health, it was butchered.  <\/p> <p>  Brigid Quilligan spoke about the social determinants.  We cannot look at Traveller health or mental health without taking into consideration the social determinants.  I cannot tell a Traveller that he or she needs to go for a walk or join a football team if he or she is having issues with their home in that there is no accommodation.  It is a broad issue.  We cannot examine Traveller mental health without looking at the social determinants.<\/p> <p>  Some suggestions have been made regarding the schools.  Traveller culture, language and identity needs to be part of the school curriculum without any consideration and that needs to be taught.  I learned about Cuchulainn.

Like my colleagues, I have been living and working with Travellers and putting community development into practice for as long as I have been walking.  We have been justifying ourselves for as long as we have been walking.  Most people say that their first experience of discrimination was when they started school at four years of age.  I was very lucky with my school experience.  However, while doing this survey, we met people who experienced discrimination in County Kerry until the 1980s and early 1990s.  Lines were drawn in the yard; one was for Travellers and one for non-Travellers.  People were taken from their homes and bused into school in the morning, which looks like a very supportive act, but then they showered <i>en masse<\/i>.  They were practically hosed down.  They were humiliated.  Girls and boys were showered together with their clothes taken off.<br\/><br\/>I am rambling a bit.  What I want to bring the discussion back to is that our community is in a lot of pain.  In Irish history there has been an awful lot of covering up people's experiences.  Thankfully, in recent years those people have had their experiences acknowledged.  Travellers were part of that as well.  There needs to be more exploration and acknowledgement of the deep hurt people face.  Every day we encounter parents who tell us about their experience with education, sending their children to school and the retention and attainment of children at school.  We meet parents who, even as adults, are still deeply traumatised by their own experiences of the education system.<br\/><br\/>One of my colleagues said something very profound in our office at a consultation in recent weeks on World Suicide Prevention Day.  She asked why someone would turn to the person who has hurt them to heal them.  We need representation of our community in the different spectrums of society, but first we will do the work on the ground.  People are engaged in community development work, education and access to services.  That is what we do and we do it very well, but we need leadership from the top if we are to change anything concerning Traveller mental health.  We need the State to say there will be zero tolerance for racism against Travellers, for lack of attainment and lack of outcomes for Travellers and for Travellers being treated differently and less favourably in the State.  We must have true acknowledgement of Traveller history and Travellers' contribution to this country.<br\/><br\/>Alongside all of the work that Mr. Reilly and Mr. Joyce spoke very well about in terms of policy work nationally, there needs to be an acknowledgement of the true, deep pain Travellers have gone through.  If that trauma is not addressed, it will continue through the generations.  It is intergenerational now.  The question is how long people can be resistant and resilient.  For how long and for how many generations?  We are now seeing that even the most resilient people are falling.  If it is not alcohol, they are overeating, taking drugs or they are engaged in violence.  We are turning on each other and there is conflict and violence.  There are so many issues.  Education and solidarity require leadership.  Sometimes it only requires one person in the school or other setting to make the change.  I always tell people to reach out to other people.  Whether it is a Traveller or an immigrant, we are all human beings.  A child is a child.  What has happened for generations in this country is that Travellers have not been seen as human.  People are being dehumanised.  We face that now.  We see that some of our youth have no hope.<\/p><p>When people have no hope and feel as if they do not have opportunities, there is not much left.  We are facing a scenario where an entire generation has no hope.  We want the members' solidarity but we want it to be meaningful such that it can be transferred into legislation and implemented in policies and action.  We do not want to come back here in ten years' time to raise the same issues.  If we come back here, we want it to be to report on the success and how all of us together turned around the mental health crisis and suicide epidemic among the Traveller community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019092400002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Brigid Quilligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Quilligan.

There does not seem to be a driving force to have reports on mental health and other areas implemented and ensure there are checks and balances and accountability.  I can see that coming from the top because there is no real drive to try to deal with the issue.  That is probably one of the main issues the committee will have to raise in its report.

As Mr. Reilly said, the Traveller community is in pain.  The internalisation of racism and discrimination is hard to quantify if one has never experienced it.  I have experienced it but not at the level of members of the Traveller community.  The institutionalisation of racism against the Travelling community is hard to quantify mentally and physically.<\/p> <p>  Let me refer to the terrible connotations of the media in this country and certain politicians who stored up horrible stereotypes of the Traveller community.  We are all human and there is only so much of this a person can take.  This leads to internalisation and mental health difficulties.  It can be very difficult to share the hurt, which leads to people taking their own lives.<\/p><p>If this involved any other ethnic group in this country, it would be deemed a crisis.

As Mr. Reilly alluded to, there has been an 80% cut in funding to the Traveller community since 2008.  The advisory committee has not met since 2012.  The landscape is stark.  This all feeds down to a negative perception that members of the Traveller community do not have a contribution to make to society.  Nothing could be further from the truth.

On primary healthcare projects, for example, Martin asked where a person goes for support.  Primary care centres are primarily based on office hours and outside those hours, at 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday, someone who is in crisis cannot be told to come back on Monday morning.  In the Traveller projects, it is the primary healthcare workers, the men's health workers and the mental health workers who take on that mental health work.  It needs to be considered that some of these are on 20 hours or 12 hours.  Some of them have issues with medical cards if they go over the threshold.  Some of them are not even getting the basic minimum wage.  These have been workers for more than 20 years.  There are staff within the Departments for 20 years or 30 years who will receive a pension on retirement and our people are working on the ground day in, day out.

My family is probably better known for music than for politics.<\/p><p>When I was growing up and was distressed because of sexuality, I would have taken it out through music - the violin, the fiddle and traditional music.

There were songs about the Travelling people, like Ewan MacColl's \"Go, Move, Shift\" and John Spillane's gorgeous song about John Reilly.

I must also apologise as I am going to have to leave early for the same reason.<\/p> <p>  When I was in my office getting my papers, I had the opportunity to listen to Mr. Reilly, and I know Mr. Joyce has been before the Committee on Education and Skills a number of times at meetings instigated by Senator Kelleher, who is certainly a champion of Travellers' rights.  We have had hearings on the education of vulnerable groups to find where the gaps are.  Most certainly, we were including Travellers as one of those vulnerable groups that need to have extra supports.  One of the recommendations we made from those committee hearings was that the teachers for Traveller children should be reinstated because children from Traveller families can fall behind.  Some do not and I have had the experience of teaching children from Travelling backgrounds in primary school, but in many cases, that extra help and support is needed.<\/p> <p>  It strikes me, and the witnesses might comment on it, that young children in the education system need to have confidence to be able to blossom, and that may well help to support their mental health and resilience in terms of dealing with the other challenges they have.  When I was a young teacher and young local public representative, the late Brian Lenihan was Minister of State with responsibility for children, and he undertook a special project on Cant and launched it at the Riverbank Arts Centre in Newbridge.  This ties in with what Senator Warfield said in terms of celebrating culture and heritage.  It was one of the most fascinating and interesting events that I ever attended and I still have the book I was given on that day.  It was wonderful to see the children there so proud of their uniqueness and of something they could contribute that the rest of us could not.  I remember thinking at the time that if we could bottle this and try to bring it out, life would be so much easier.<\/p> <p>  Senator Warfield mentioned emotional intelligence and he is absolutely right.  We need to have public representatives who are in touch and who are emotionally intelligent, but who also have compassion for the different groups of people we come across.  We cannot legislate for middle of the road children or people who have access to a middle-class education.<\/p><p>However, that is what is happening.  I feel for the teachers, too.  When they come out of college, they are all too often geared towards a certain type of child from a certain type of background.  While much has been done in terms of home-school liaisons, more needs to done in respect of vulnerable groups.<\/p><p> I worked with the Special Olympics years ago.  Ireland hosted the world games in 2003, and we considered ways of having a legacy programme subsequent to the games that would develop new clubs and give support to young people and their families.  We tried to reach out to the Traveller community, but there were no Traveller children in our clubs.  That was a failing on our part, but we also found a block to getting Traveller children with disabilities to join.  Something has to change.

That is baffling in light of how important education is.  If people have good qualifications, they can get good jobs and have a good lifestyle.  It has physical and mental health impacts.  Education is very important.  Unfortunately, 85% of Traveller education funding was cut.<\/p> <p>  A point was mentioned that I had meant to make, but it left my mind.  In terms of mental health, we are talking about youth mental health, maternal mental health, women's mental health, men's mental health, LGBT mental health, etc.  It is broad.  There is a major issue with access to services, with services not meeting Travellers where they are at.  There is a cultural lesson to be learned from this.

There is a great move in that regard and it will be of immense value to our young people.  It will be a validation, an acknowledgement that we matter and that what we have to say is right.  In certain places, when we were children we were slapped if we were speaking our language, and not by our parents.

That can go hand-in-hand with the policy implementation.  My final words today are that whatever is agreed in any committee must be implemented and monitored.  There is no point in making recommendations, policy and legislation for the sake of it.  They must be implemented, enforced and monitored.  There must be outcomes.

It is a difficult issue for people to articulate.  I also strongly feel that where people have been very closely affected by that it is a big thing to ask people who are directly impacted to make a presentation.  It is quite an unfair request.  However, individuals present because they feel they need to air their living experience.  It is their living experience.  I should add that Travellers are very resilient.  They have overcome many hurdles.  At this stage they probably feel they are ready for, and nearly anticipate, how society is going to treat them.  They are geared and resilient.  Part of it is about preparing their children for that hostile, difficult and challenging environment.<\/p> <p>  However, cracks tend to happen.  One of the big aspects is that our culture has been and continues to be under siege.  People pick some nice parts of it, such as the music and poetry, and say it is great but they do not do much to support or enable it.  There has been no support for nomadism, which is a core part of it.  With regard to Traveller accommodation, there is very little in terms of the budgets being drawn down.  In the case of education, we are still playing catch up from a system that was institutionalised.  Brigid Quilligan spoke about the segregation but I was one of those, along with many others, who were in a special, segregated class.  I would nearly describe it as apartheid, like in South Africa.  There was really no difference.<\/p> <p>  We are resilient and we have a positive outlook on life, despite the negative elements that affect us.  We want to achieve and do better.  We want to reach out to the community.  It is probably in our genes that we want to reach out because we are a community that strives on what a community is and we have much to learn from others.<\/p> <p>  I saw some positive elements recently, such as the formal State recognition of Traveller ethnicity.<\/p><p>Recently Cant and tin-smithing were named as part of the tangible assets of the Traveller community, along with hurling, which is a really positive step.  In the areas of sports, music, arts and culture, Travellers are really putting themselves out there.  Reference was made to Traveller musicians and the song \"Go, Move, Shift\".  My family lived on the Darndale Road at the time that song was written and it has a personal resonance for me; it is all about people's lived experience.  The focus should not just be on the musicians of the past but also on the musicians of today like Sharon Ward, an absolutely fantastic, resilient singer and persona, Thomas McCarthy and Pecker Dunne.  <\/p><p> The approach to addressing the underlying issues must be right across the spectrum.  People might hinge on music or other areas but we must get back to the real issues in terms of recommendations, political will and resources.  It is about putting forward key recommendations that can be delivered and monitored, with clear outcomes.

We have been given a really good insight but there is more to be explored with regard to the root causes, as Ms Quilligan mentioned.<\/p><p> Our next session be on 8 October, when we will meet with the Traveller Counselling Service, a group from west Limerick, the Offaly Traveller Movement, the Galway Traveller Movement and Exchange House.  We had a record number of submissions, which is a powerful indication in its own right.  The powers that be will also be coming before the committee.  We will be putting to them the questions our guests have asked.  We will be meeting the Minister for Health and officials from his Department, HSE officials and Dr. Brian Keogh, an academic from Trinity College Dublin who is interested in these matters.  We have also invited Senator Joan Freeman to appear because there were strong recommendations in the report of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care about which we do not want to forget.  It was hard enough for some of us around the table to get those recommendations included in the report and we want to ensure that they are not forgotten.<\/p><p> If our guests will accept us, we will be their allies.  It is up to them to decide but those on the committee are allies and it is our intent to produce a report to be acted upon rather than another document which will be considered to have been full of broken and unfulfilled promises in ten years' time.  I thank the members of the committee for their great attention and for the great questions they have asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019092400002#X00700","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":382,"content":"<p>Before we go back into private session, I want to clarify something.  At the start of the meeting, we laid out the plan for future sessions.  In private session last week, we agreed that there would be a session after those that have been set out at which we could hear the voices of those who would not normally contribute to policy or academia.  The Chair did not mention that session and I wanted to ensure that it is still to be held.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019092400002#Y00200","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1569279600,"counter":383,"content":"<p>Certainly.  That was discussed.  We will put the proposal to invite a wider selection of people to members and I am sure there will be agreement.  Mr. Reilly and Mr. Joyce have paths worn to the Oireachtas but there are other voices we want to hear.  Ms Quilligan stated that 61 people are engaged in this process.  That is very encouraging.  When the committee is finishing its overall deliberations, we will try to invite some of those who, unfortunately, are not regular visitors to Leinster House.  We will take that up.  If there is agreement, I will make sure to include it in our schedule.<\/p> <p>  We will now adjourn until 11 a.m. on Tuesday, 8 October, when we will continue our discussions on mental health issues affecting the Traveller community.  We would be grateful if our guests could stay around for a quick photograph because it is important to document and record the work of the committee.  I again thank them very much for their kindness, candour, and direction.  It is very much appreciated.  Maya Angelou said that when one knows better, one does better.  We are all learning all of the time.  We have learned a lot today, although there is more to learn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019092400002#Y00300","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1569279600,"counter":384,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 1 p.m. until 11 a.m. on Tuesday, 8 October 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
