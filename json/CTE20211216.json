I would like to begin by welcoming our members and witnesses to the meeting.  Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerks, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of where the Parliament has chosen to sit.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and joins us this morning, when we will engage with officials from the Department of Health to examine the 2020 appropriation account, Vote 38 - Health.  The Department has also been advised that the committee might wish to examine matters relating to the value for money review of the nursing home support scheme, or fair deal scheme, as well as analysis undertaken by the national paediatric hospital development board on the new children's hospital.  Arising from consideration of an item of correspondence at last week's meeting, we also sought information regarding the governance arrangements pertaining to the State expenditure on prescription medicines.<\/p> <p>  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, and by Mr. Kevin Colman, Mr. John O'Grady and Ms Fiona Larthwell, principal officers.  We are also joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by Mr. Jim Deane, principal officer in the health Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They are all very welcome. <\/p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I would ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent or switched off.  Before we start, I wish to explain some of the limitations of parliamentary privilege and the practice of the House as regards references that our witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, one of today's witnesses is giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present on campus.  That witness has already been advised and they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provision in Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objective of such policies.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  To assist our broadcast and debates services, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question is not being directed to a specific witness, I would ask each witness to state their name when they first contribute.  I am mindful of the fact that we are online and there is sometimes a delay.  I do not want to interrupt anyone but if I have to intervene, I ask members and witnesses to comply with that and ensure we are not talking over each other.  I ask members and witnesses to be mindful that it is a little more difficult to run a meeting remotely than when we are all physically present in a committee room.  I ask them for their co-operation in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I now call the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021121600002#A00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1639647000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The appropriation account for Vote 38 - Health records gross expenditure of &euro;20.8 billion in 2020.

It is good to join them this morning. I have a brief statement, as the Chairman mentioned.  As Accounting Officer for the Department of Health&rsquo;s Vote 38, I am pleased to be here today to discuss the 2020 annual report and appropriation account of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Kevin Colman and Mr. John O&rsquo;Grady, from the resources division, and Ms Fiona Larthwell from the social care division in my Department.  I will now set out the main points of the 2020 accounts as they pertain to Vote 38.<br\/><br\/><i><\/i>The initial 2020 net provision, current and capital, for Vote 38 was &euro;17.9 billion, which consisted of a gross provision of &euro;18.3 billion and appropriationsinaid of &euro;430 million.<\/p><p>As the scale of the challenge presented by Covid19 became clear, it was evident that unprecedented action was needed here to prevent the spread of the disease, high rates of hospitalisation and intensive care unit admissions, and significant mortality.  New structures and processes were put in place between the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE to facilitate timely decisionmaking while also ensuring that high levels of governance were maintained, where the HSE reported to the Department each week on the estimated Covid19 related noncapital and capital expenditure that had been incurred to date.<\/p><p> Additional funding of &euro;1.997 billion was voted to the Department in a Revised Estimate in June 2020 to support the measures outlined in the national action plan on Covid19.  This represented the expenditure approved by the Government for Covid19 measures taken up to the date of the passing of the Revised Estimate.  A further net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;514.5 million was approved to meet additional funding requirements that arose to the end of 2020.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General stated, this resulted in a net overall provision for Vote 38 of &euro;20.44 billion, incorporating a deferred capital surrender of &euro;30 million carried over from the previous year.  The 2020 outturn was &euro;20.3 billion, leaving an overall surplus of &euro;120 million.  The Department of Health received sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to carry forward &euro;68.2 million of unspent allocations in respect of the capital elements of subhead M2 into 2021.<\/p><p> As members are aware, the pandemic has been an extremely difficult time for frontline employees and workers in the health service.  They have responded with diligence, resilience, agility and a level of commitment that has been extraordinary.  With the support of the Department and the Government, the HSE has introduced new capabilities and innovations across the system.  These include implementing eprescribing in general practice and introducing alternative care pathways and new models of care.<\/p><p> An example of the innovation of the health system was seen in responding to Covid19 last year.  New testing and contact tracing capability was implemented, with the delivery of 720,000 GP referrals, 2.3 million laboratory tests and more than 440,000 contact tracing calls during the year.  We have implemented a hugely successful Covid19 vaccination strategy with one of the highest levels of uptake in Europe and we are making very strong progress in delivering booster vaccines across the population.<\/p><p> Further investment in the overall reform of the health system includes very significant investments in clinical strategies such as the cancer, gynaecological and maternity strategy, coupled with an unprecedented investment to address the shortcomings identified by the 2018 capacity review that has seen us deliver the largest increase in acute and critical care beds and in community beds in decades.  Allied to increasing acute capacity, we are undertaking a critical shift left in moving care out of acute settings and into the community, with the recruitment of an additional workforce of more than 3,000 staff to implement community care networks across every community in Ireland.<\/p><p> The Department has continued to successfully discharge its other functions.  Importantly, we seek to frame policies and legislation to promote health.  The life expectancy in Ireland is now estimated at 82.8 years, which is above the EU average of 81 years.  However, with the prevalence of preventable noncommunicable diseases, it is important to promote healthy behaviours and prevent ill health.  Under the Healthy Ireland umbrella, which is a Government of Ireland initiative, we work crosssectorally to achieve this objective.<\/p><p> We also support the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Ministers of State in their work, including their legislative priorities and their public and parliamentary accountability.  For example, in 2020, the Department processed more than 9,224 parliamentary questions, representing 24%, or almost one quarter, of all parliamentary questions tabled to Ministers across the entire government system.<\/p><p> The Department continues to enhance its governance and performance oversight in respect of the services and reform being delivered by the HSE.  In line with Sl&aacute;intecare, legislation was enacted in 2019 to introduce new accountability structures in the HSE, with the formal appointment of a non-executive and competencybased governing board.  In recognition of these new structures, the Department put in place a revised engagement model with the HSE and its board with a view to strengthening the oversight of governance and performance management and accountability of the HSE.  This oversight model is operational and will continue to be improved and enhanced as necessary to ensure there is more effective oversight within the Department.<\/p><p> This improvement work continues.  The Government has committed to bringing forward regional health areas.  A business plan for the implementation of regional health areas been developed by the Department.  The HSE has provided feedback and implementation considerations on this business plan.  A memorandum for Government on the next steps for implementation is being drafted.  I anticipate the Minister will bring the memorandum to Government for decision in January 2022.  To ensure we have front-line and expert input as we move forward, the Minister established an advisory group.  Given this progress, the Minister has informed the hospital group boards that they are being stood down this month as their terms of office expire.  There are many reforms and improvements taking place that are providing better healthcare to citizens.  Together with our colleagues in the HSE, we are focused on further reforms in 2022.<\/p><p> Finally, I thank the staff in the Department of Health for their ongoing commitment and dedication to our work programme across many dimensions of our work.  I look forward to continuing to work with the committee and with the Oireachtas and am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021121600002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639647000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The lead committee member today is Deputy Munster, who has 15 minutes.

We have also identified that there is a significant risk, given the delay in the project.  It is delayed, as the Deputy is aware, likely into 2024 now, and that will increase the costs of the project.  There are ongoing issues in respect of construction inflation.  There will be further claims relating to contract stipulations in the context of inflation above 4.5% in 2019.  There are ongoing claims and disputes between the contractor and the board.  There is uncertainty in respect of what the final figure is.  We have set that out.

It is very unsatisfactory for Mr. Watt to say today that \"discussion of costs by officials, however hypothetical or otherwise at this time, may prejudice enforcement of the existing contract, and very likely negatively impact or jeopardise the Development Board in its ongoing engagement with the main contractor\".  Ultimately that statement presents itself less as a discussion of the complexity of a contract and more as an attempt to constrain, control or remove the public oversight of this project.  Nobody likes to talk about spiralling costs, but oversight of public spending is a fundamental principle of public life.  It is not Mr. Watt's role to act as gatekeeper.

I, too, want to start with the issue of the national children's hospital.  I was present at the meeting of the committee in January 2017, when members of the NPHDB were in.  The figures were discussed.  The projected cost had gone from &euro;983 million to &euro;1.433 billion for the building of the project, and to &euro;1.7 billion when the fit-out was taken into account.  On that day, we got a one-page breakdown of how the costs changed between 2017 and 2018.  As I recall, we looked for it and it was dragged out of the people who were there.  Reading from the report that was given to us that day by members of the board, there are two sentences that I want to reference, in particular:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe February 2017 figure was &euro;983 million, which was the approved business case. The project was tendered on a two stage basis. The bill of quantities for the first stage was based on a partially developed design. The second stage included involvement of contractors with designers in finalising the design and confirming the actual quantity of materials. This included a targeted schedule of &euro;66 million value for money savings ... The November 2018 figure of &euro;1.433 billion is the cost to completion in 2022 based on a completed and fully developed design. All risks on quantities, programme, omissions, co-ordination and ground conditions are now transferred to contractors.  <\/blockquote> <p>We now know that the hospital will not be delivered for a further two years.  There are building costs for a further two years.  Are those costs on top of what was included in that &euro;1.433 billion?  Building inflation was very low going into 2018.  We are now in a very serious position in respect of building inflation.  That will add to the costs of this hospital.  More than &euro;4.5 million in inflation is built into the contract.  Were any penalty clauses built into the contract?  Contracts have two sides to them.  The obligation on the part of the contractor was to build the hospital by 2022, which it did not do.  Part of that was because there was not a sufficient number of builders on-site or oversight.  Does the Secretary General accept that the figure of &euro;1.433 billion is the cost to completion in 2022?  If it is not being delivered until 2024, does he also accept that it is going to cost more by virtue of the fact that it is going to take two years longer?  Is there the prospect of a counterclaim with the contractor who had an obligation to deliver the hospital by 2022 being looked at?  It is what the contractor signed up for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021121600002#M03300","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1639647000,"counter":344,"content":"<p>There can be a counterclaim if there is a breach of contract.  I am not involved in the day-to-day details of the contract, so members of the NPHDB are probably best placed to answer those questions.  For there to be a counterclaim, one must demonstrate that there has been a breach of contract, and that the delay is due to contractual failure as opposed to external factors.  I presume the contractor will argue that external factors have impacted upon its ability to deliver the contract.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021121600002#M03400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1639647000,"counter":345,"content":"<p>We know that during lockdown last year, there were months when construction on the hospital was not recommenced.

The more we go into this, the more building inflation is going to be an issue.  It is part of the reason the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Oireachtas on Health want to keep a close watch on this to keep costs down - not to put it out into the public arena to drive costs up.

That needs to be acknowledged.<\/p> <p>  A number of important issues across many different areas have been brought up with Mr. Watt today, but I want to focus on one particular area.  The Department has one of the biggest budgetary allocations of any Department in the State.  One concern that I have, and it is important that we look at it in the year ahead, is around staffing within the organisation, particularly in the context of front-line medical professionals.  In terms of attracting staff and getting value for public money, which is important, is Mr. Watt satisfied with the current salaries within the HSE system for doctors, nurses and consultants in general?  Does he think it needs a degree of analysis of where we currently stand in that particular area, in order to prevent the exodus of skilled working professionals who are going to places like Canada and Australia?  This is common for many people in my age group.  I want to ask Mr. Watt this from the outset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021121600002#N01900","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1639647000,"counter":369,"content":"<p>There are now 131,000 full-time equivalents in the health system.  That figure is up about 10,000 since the beginning of 2020.  There is significant recruitment taking place and net increases in staff.  Within that, there are people who have left for a variety of reasons.  Those may be for the reasons that the Deputy mentioned - they may be leaving to work in other places for better opportunities, better employment or better salaries.  Overall, however, the system is able to recruit more staff and to provide better services.<\/p> <p>  Consistently, of course, there are gaps.  We would have liked to have done more recruitment this year than we were able to do.  There are gaps in many different areas.  I am sure the Deputy is familiar with the areas where there are gaps and staff shortages.  The question of salary can be an issue, depending on the area and on the sector.  There are other issues involved around working conditions, the physical environment, the hours people are expected to work and so on.  There is a variety of different issues.<\/p> <p>  Pay is constantly kept under review.  It is under ongoing review as part of the overall pay agreement.  The HSE, as a big employer, is always looking at trends in the workforce, the number of applicants for jobs and the ability to attract people.  It is an ongoing concern.  Certainly, into the future, as we try to recruit more people, we need to train our own people and provide them with more opportunities.  We are providing more opportunities for people to go into medicine, nursing and all the different areas.  The number of available college places has increased again for this September.  There are plans to increase it further.  There is a wide range of issues.

The State has gone through the enormous cost of supporting their education and higher education.  There is no disputing that.  However, I feel we need to look at this.<\/p> <p>  Like many public representatives and indeed the public, I question the overall strength of the public healthcare system in this country, considering the level of investment and the billions upon billions of capital going into this area.  I would like to see the Department undertake a body of work that involves a deep-rooted analysis of why this happening.  It should get into the universities and talk to people who are nearing the completion of their higher education before they start work in our hospitals and the healthcare system.  I feel there is a necessity to do that.<\/p> <p>  We have seen throughout the pandemic that so much strain has been put on the health system in general.  ICU capacity has been increased from 200 to 300 beds.  We want that figure to increase further to give us scope to prevent us going back into lockdown situations and scenarios with new challenges that may arise as a result of the pandemic.

There are areas in the health system which are challenged, and there are challenging roles.<\/p><p>He mentioned ICUs where the Government has increased the number of beds and has plans to increase them further next year, which is really critical and important.  Our big challenge is to get trained ICU staff, particularly nursing staff, of which I understand there is a short supply around the world.  There are many different elements here.  It is about salary, training and working conditions.  There is also an element that people will want to go and live in Canada, Australia and other places for a period.  That is part of what many people want to do when they graduate.  That is the reality of it.<\/p><p> The key thing for us, however, is to ensure that we are attractive so that people come back.  The majority of people who go away for a few years come back and then find employment in the health system.  There is an ongoing challenge to make the jobs attractive, however.  Pay is one aspect of it but it is really about the opportunity to learn and the physical environment in which people work in terms of the general atmosphere.  If people are working in an environment where they are under strain all the time, which has been the situation for large parts of the health system for the past two years, that is a very difficult environment to have to face every day.  We all hear the stories of the enormous effort people have put in and will have to put in even more in the next few months to deal with the challenges that will probably be coming down the tracks.

Does Mr. Watt feel this is an area into which the Department needs to put an effort around reviewing working hours?  He acknowledged conditions and there is obviously a cost to the State.

The new elective hospitals will be part of that and so on.  Obviously, the big issue is about the actual procurement model and the two-stage approach that was used for the children's hospital.  I do not think that will be used for the electives.  It will be different.  In many ways, the elective hospitals are not as complex.  They have a significant footprint, particularly the one proposed for Dublin, but I do not believe they are as complex as the children's hospital.

I ask Mr. Watt to come back to us with clarification on that because it is very important.<\/p> <p>  We visited the site back in June, which was informative.  We learned about the number of claims and what they were for, as well as about changes, some of which were very last minute.  I know that everything cannot be foreseen, particularly on a big project but there were a huge number of claims, some of which were for very small things such as moving a window or changing a partition, for example.  I asked the person from the board and the contractor to show me examples of what the claims were about.  I was struck by the claims.  Another issue that struck me was related to energy usage.  I asked what provision was made to harvest any energy generated on site and whether there would be solar panels.  I was told there was no room for solar panels.  We were standing on top of the building, looking across the area at this point.  We were looking down on terraces of houses that have gable ends of about 6 m or 7 m by 5 or 6 m across.  We were looking at two-up, two-down and three-bedroom semi-detached houses, an awful lot of which were covered in solar panels but we were standing on a new building and were told that there would be no solar panels on it and no energy harvested from such panels.  Again, I know Mr. Watt came in after the contract was signed and the work commenced but am I correct that none of this was built into the contract?  <\/p> <p>  I am sure the hospital will be put into a very glossy portfolio by the architects involved in its design.  It is one of those \"wow\" projects, for want of a better word.  This is an amazing design of an amazing building and there is nothing like it anywhere in the State.  However, in terms of maintenance, it will take an army of window cleaners alone to keep the windows clean.  What is the annual estimated cost for maintenance and what is the situation regarding energy usage?  I hope that some thought was given to this before it was signed off by the Department and the Minister.  Can Mr. Watt give me an answer on the issues of energy usage and overall maintenance on an annual basis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021121600002#R03300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1639647000,"counter":461,"content":"<p>As I said, my responsibilities relate to managing the Department of Health in all of its facets, including Vote 38 and all its dimensions.

In relation to pharma companies, is there any funding, benefit-in-kind, sponsorship or money for research for any particular projects that may transfer to healthcare professionals, healthcare facilities, hospitals or any entity working in the public system?  We spend in the region of &euro;2.3 billion a year on drugs.  It is a substantial amount of money.  A number of other European countries and the USA have regulations in place to govern the situation.  Mr. Watt will be aware that a number of companies are buying up GP practices, so they could have ten or 20.  We do know that we have a high prescription rate of drugs.  I am not medically qualified to say whether that is right or wrong but, apparently, compared to other countries we do dish them out fairly plentifully.  We do not have any way of tracking that.  I wish to raise the concern that people may be receiving more medication than they need or more expensive medication than is necessary.  I acknowledge that we have made progress over the years.  It is not that long ago that a standard antibiotic was approximately &euro;28 and now we can get it for &euro;8 or &euro;9.  I acknowledge the work that has been done by the Department in that regard.  Has Mr. Watt discussed with his colleagues or with the Minister the need to bring in regulations to ensure transparency so that if anyone working in the public system or entities attached to the public system or working within it are receiving any benefit, financial or otherwise, or benefit-in-kind from a pharma company, that the information is put on a register.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021121600002#S00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1639647000,"counter":466,"content":"<p>You raise a fundamental question, Chair.  First, based on prescription patterns, an awful lot of drugs are prescribed.  I have the number of 60 million prescriptions a year in the GMS system in this country in my head.  I do not know if that encompasses drugs under the refund scheme as well, but the figure may encompass both.  There is a very significant level of prescription and it is a worry if it is inappropriate prescribing.  The overall cost now is very expensive at &euro;2.5 billion and it is increasing by 5.5% a year, which is not sustainable.  The cost is not sustainable and the level of drugs being taken is an issue as well.  We negotiated a deal with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, which the Government will sign off soon for an enhanced scheme to reduce the price, but we need to push ahead with more prescribing of generic, off-patent drugs, biosimilars and so on.  There is a big job of work to do in that regard.<\/p> <p>  You also raise an interesting question, Chair.  Public health officials who work in the public system cannot receive any hospitality or supports from anybody beyond a certain level covered by the ethics legislation.  GPs are not public servants, even though a lot of their income is funded by the public system.  I do not know whether the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, or other bodies have ethics guidelines to ensure that people are not unduly influenced when it comes to their prescribing patterns, but I imagine it is not an issue.

The first relates to University College Cork.  Those are the 2019-20 financial statements.  I have given a qualified audit opinion for those statements.  The university recognises an asset in respect of deferred pension funding and that is standard practice for universities.  I do not normally qualify in such circumstances.  However, in this case, the amount of the asset that is recognised includes &euro;11.1 million in respect of liabilities relating to professional added years for transferred in service.  There is an agreement between the university and the Higher Education Authority that the expenses relating to the professional added years for transferred in service would be split on a 50:50 basis, but the university is over-recognising by &euro;3.8 million in respect of that.  In my view, that is not in accordance with the agreement and, therefore, I have qualified the audit opinion.<\/p> <p>  I also draw attention to significant non-compliance with procurement rules by the university.  More detail in that regard is given in the fees statement on internal control.  <\/p> <p>  The second set of financial statements relates to the Oberstown Children Detention Campus.  Those are the financial statements for 2020 and I have given a clear audit opinion.<\/p> <p>  The third relates to the Credit Union Restructuring Board, ReBo.  These financial statements relate to the year of account 2017.  ReBo finished its restructuring operations in July 2017 and it was intended that the board would be dissolved at that stage.  However, the dissolution had to be done by way of new legislation and that Act was only passed in 2020.  I gave a clear audit opinion but there was a very significant delay in the finalisation of the 2017 financial statements.  The reason for that was that the board, in 2017, did not keep adequate accounting records.  It failed to correctly record and explain the transactions for the year and, therefore, we were unable to carry out an audit of the financial statements.  There was engagement with the Department of Finance, where the board is now housed.  In 2021, the board appointed external accounting expertise to investigate and rectify the accounting records.  Once that was done, we were able to complete the audit. <\/p> <p>  There are a number of further periods of account that we have now proceeded to audit with very few transactions.  I hope we will be able to do those fairly promptly.  As it stands, the board continues in existence until we have completed that process.<\/p> <p>  The accounts of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland for 2020 have been presented.

In that regard, the correspondence refers to the Eversheds review, stating that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tContrary to claims that RT&Eacute; has been operating as a &quot;bogus employer&quot;, arising from this review, we have addressed the employment status of any individual deemed to have characteristics akin to employment.  We have therefore taken a proactive and comprehensive approach to dealing with residual issues due to practices which occurred in the past.  Since 2019, RT&Eacute; has implemented significant reform in this area, and has adopted an &quot;employment first&quot; principal. <\/blockquote> <p>The correspondence continues by stating that because the Department of Social Protection audit process is ongoing, RT&Eacute; cannot provide high-level data such as the numbers of personnel involved, categorisation of individuals, income levels etc.  As the Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection previously informed the committee, the audit could take well over another year and will assess the employment specifics of the contractual relationships of some 500 individuals with RT&Eacute;.  It is therefore a significant investigation.  The correspondence from RT&Eacute; concludes by stating that it &ldquo;cannot provide any further details as to these reviews, which are either ongoing or pending, either in correspondence, or in committee session, until their conclusion.&rdquo;  Is it agreed that we note and publish this item?  Agreed.  I have flagged this item for discussion, along with Deputies Catherine Murphy and Munster.

The issue concerns what is happening regarding those people who have been reclassified and what their situation is now in respect of having proper PRSI credits paid for them for the years during which they were wrongly classified in that regard and any other benefits they would have been due if they had been categorised as PAYE workers during that time.  We will require an update on those aspects.  Representatives from RT&Eacute; are due in with us in our first sitting in January 2022, so we will look for that information then.  Is everybody else happy with that item?  Okay.<\/p> <p>  No. 957 is correspondence from Mr. Martin Whelan, head of public affairs and communications, National Treasury Management Agency, dated 6 December 2021, which provides further information as requested by the committee regarding the State Claims Agency, SCA.  It includes responses to requests for information in relation to the outstanding financial liability in respect of cell sanitation in the Irish Prison Service; the outstanding financial liability in respect of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na active claims; and a progress update on open disclosure and any engagement the SCA is having with the legal profession to encourage mediated settlements, as opposed to court settlements.  Is it agreed that we note and publish this item?  Agreed.  The only comment I have regarding this correspondence is that there are a considerable number of claims in this context.  There are 2,399 active claims against the Prison Service and many of those probably concern cell sanitation.  We should keep an eye on this matter because it involves a significant number of people and a certain amount of money.  In addition, 150 staff members and 47 members of the public are also involved in those claims.<\/p> <p>  No. 959B is from Mr. Jim Breslin, Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, dated 6 December 2021, and provides information requested by the committee regarding capital funding being withheld from the University of Limerick, UL.  This arises from a matter we examined when we engaged with representatives of UL in June, namely the acquisition by the university of a site in Limerick city centre in 2019.  It will be recalled that this concerns the old Dunnes Stores site.  The Secretary General states that the funding has been withheld \"pending assurances from [UL] in relation to capital management procedures\".  Several questions regarding this matter remained unanswered when we raised it with the representatives of UL, who stated that the matter was the subject of a review by KPMG.  I propose that we note and publish this item and request a progress update from UL on the KPMG report.  Our last update from UL on the matter was on 21 October 2021, in correspondence referenced as R0842.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  This item was flagged for discussion by Deputy Carthy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021121600002#AA00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1639647000,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I think I had flagged it as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021121600002#AA00400","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1639647000,"counter":544,"content":"<p>Okay.

We might have got this before, but, if not, could we request KPMG's terms of reference for the conduct of that inquiry and the details of who drew them up.  The fourth paragraph down piqued my interest, which referred to the total grant amount calculated for UL for 2021-22 as being &euro;2.4 million.  Of that, some &euro;757,000 was approved for release in August to support time-sensitive payments relating to additional places and ICT supports for disadvantaged students, with a decision on the balance of those funds pending.  I wonder if one aspect relates to the other.  It does seem like the institution is on a short leash.  For that reason, I would put this matter in with what we have heard about the audit in University College Cork.  There is an issue with both these institutions.  The concern for us in this regard is when we will have representatives from both institutions in before the committee.  We will want to see that report from KPMG in advance of speaking to witnesses from the two universities, but it does seem to be the case that the Department is keeping a close eye on things in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021121600002#AA00700","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1639647000,"counter":547,"content":"<p>The last paragraph of the letter referred to the report of the review being undertaken of the purchase of the site in Limerick having not yet been finalised.
