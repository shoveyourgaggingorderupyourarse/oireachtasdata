I would highlight in this regard the Sport Ireland women in sport programme established in 2005 which has provided funding for sport of more than &euro;20 million to a broad range of programmes aimed at increasing participation of women and girls.  I am an enthusiastic supporter of the Federation of Irish Sport 20X20 campaign.  The Minister and I already have had discussions to support this initiative.  We had a recent meeting with Mary O'Connor, CEO of the Federation of Irish Sport, who is very involved in this campaign.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that sporting associations in several countries have decided to bring into line payments of their international men's and women's teams.  This is a welcome if long overdue change.  I encourage all our sporting bodies to consider this and more broadly the parity of treatment of international men and women's teams at senior and junior levels.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the sporting body referred to by the Deputy, the national governing body of sport respects the autonomy of all the associations, competitions and selection of teams.  Payments to international players is a matter for the association itself.  We do not have a specific role in determining the level of payments for international teams selected by this or any other national governing body.<\/p>  <p>  It is important, however, to recognise that when members of the international team referred to by the Deputy highlighted the challenges in their remunerations and conditions, the issue was raised with the association on several occasions.  In 2018, the then Minister provided additional funding to support the women's international team.  In 2019, despite a number of challenges, the Department and Sport Ireland made arrangements to ensure the funding allocated to the women's international team was dispersed to it specifically and used to support its preparations for international fixtures.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for highlighting this important issue.  The Minister and I will be engaging with the FAI and the 20X20 campaign to ensure this is addressed.  The programme for Government specifically highlights the importance of women's participation in sport.

The Department gives the FAI &euro;800,000 a year.  Will the Minister of State ensure that money comes with strict conditions for appearance fees?  The book <i>Champagne Football<\/i>was released in recent weeks by Mark Tighe and Paul Rowan.  Any person with a love of this sport has been shocked by what they have read in this book.

The national sports policy asks all national governing bodies to set gender diversity targets and to develop equality action plans.  Support will be provided for dedicated leadership training programmes for women, including governance and technical training.<\/p>  <p>  Sport Ireland is monitoring the progress and reports on it annually.  In the context of the overall women's programme from 2005 to date, &euro;20 million has been invested through the national governing bodies and local sports partnerships.

The July stimulus package introduced significant measures to help businesses recover following the devastating impacts of the Covid-19 crisis.  Some of the key measures for tourism and hospitality include the stay and spend initiative, the &euro;26 million adaptation grant, the &euro;10 million grant for coach tourism and the revised restart grant, which now includes bed and breakfast establishments.  Tourism enterprises will also benefit from wider horizontal support, such as the new employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, liquidity and enterprise investment measures, warehousing of tax liabilities and the extension for a further three months of the waiver of commercial rates.  As part of its response to Covid-19 and to drive bookings for short breaks and holidays in Ireland in 2020, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has invested in a number of domestic holiday campaigns since June of this year, and I have seen at first hand that these campaigns have been successful in getting Irish people to holiday at home.<\/p> <p> All of these measures have helped the sector, but I appreciate that severe challenges remain and there is justified deep concern in the sector.  We need to continue to examine ways to ensure businesses survive and recover.  The tourism recovery task force, appointed in May, has just submitted its report to me.  It is making a number of recommendations to help the sector survive the crisis and recover.  That will feed into the roadmap the Deputy refers to in her question.  Along with my colleagues in Government, I will consider its recommendations as we prepare for the budget and the subsequent national economic plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100004#B01400","speaker":"1471","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601545800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>As the Minister says, she is acutely aware that the tourism and hospitality sectors are among the hardest hit sectors.

It will consider the extent to which the current models of delivery are appropriate for the next ten years and review the best practice in other comparable jurisdictions, particularly across the European economic area, in terms of providing future-proofed models for meeting the above public services in light of changing audience expectations, in particular the preferences and behaviours of younger audiences.<\/p>  <p>  Within this context, the commission will examine how these aims can be delivered in a way that is sustainable, give greater security of funding, ensure independent editorial oversight and deliver value for money to the public.

The Government is fully aware that, given the social nature of such gatherings, tourism, arts, and culture were the sectors first affected by the pandemic and may be the last to return to normal.  We must find a way to get our performers singing again and help them.

As the Minister, has rightly said, the local community has been campaigning and fundraising for a swimming pool for several decades.  Every time something has been asked of the people of Carrickmacross, they have delivered.  The difficulty is that many officials within the executive of the local authority are afraid that such a project, if it were to be developed, would end up becoming a drain on the local authority.  Projects of this scale cannot always make a profit.  It is important that the Department does not decide that this project needs to be cost-neutral.  Sometimes the cost-benefit of a project does not come in euros through the door but from its societal benefit, from how it increases the attractiveness of a town for new families to move to and stay, and from the avenue it provides for young and old within the town.

I am aware of the difficulties this will raise, especially in the sectors in question.  My focus is firmly on the survival, sustainability and recovery of this vital industry.  As the Deputy stated, there are 35,000 workers, but they bring &euro;3.5 billion to the economy.  As the Taoiseach said at the D&aacute;il on Tuesday, the Government is considering sector-specific supports to protect the livelihoods of as many people as possible.<\/p>  <p>  In the face of this pandemic, we have to be creative and innovative, and we have to think outside the box to support as many as possible.  All suggestions should be considered and all should remain on the table.

Measures introduced by the Government to date that have benefited the sports sector include the temporary wage subsidy scheme.<\/p>  <p>  There has been extensive engagement with the sports sector over recent months, and this has highlighted the significant adverse impact of Covid-19 at all levels of the Irish sporting landscape.  A Covid-19 sports management group, chaired at ministerial level, has been established to engage directly with the sports bodies.  An expert group on the return to sport, chaired by an official in my Department, has been established to provide advice and guidance to sports bodies.  Sport Ireland is engaging directly with sports bodies on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  A funding package of &euro;70 million has been put in place to support the sector.  The funding package, which will be administered by Sport Ireland, includes funding of up to &euro;40 million for the three main fields sport organisations, namely, the FAI, GAA and IRFU; a resilience fund of up to &euro;10 million to support the national governing bodies of sport; a sports club resilience fund of up to &euro;15 million to support clubs; and a sports restart and renewal fund of up to &euro;5 million.  The funding will be invested by way of new grant schemes through Sport Ireland's recognised public partners, including the national governing bodies of sport, the local sports partnerships and other funded sports organisations.<\/p>  <p>  The closing date for applications to Sport Ireland under the Covid-19 grant scheme was 14 September.  I understand a large number of applications was received.  Thirty-nine national governing bodies applied on their own behalf and on behalf of their member clubs.  Sport Ireland is currently processing and validating their applications.  There is significant interest in each of the four strands of funding.  The process will be complete by the end of October.  An announcement of all allocations will be made at that time.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this funding, I announced a special fund of &euro;2.5 million for the July stimulus scheme to support swimming pools and their operation.  This funding will also be administered by Sport Ireland.  The Deputy will note the &euro;15 million support for the GAA, the Camogie Association and ladies' football.  That is in direct recognition of the shortfall that will arise from the reduced number of spectators at all the games.<\/p>  <p>  We want to ensure our all-Ireland competitions across the three codes happen this year.  The reduction in spectators in stadiums and at local clubs and pitches has a direct impact on sport, and that is why we are providing the stimulus funding and buffer for all the organisations this year and why we are engaging in the budgetary process for next year.  While Covid stays with us, we want to ensure sport is supported by the Government in the context of participation and continuing competition.  That is why we have provided such a wide range of supports.  Sports have been referred to specifically in the context of the resilience roadmap and plan.

The music stimulus package involves three funding schemes designed to help sustain the popular commercial music sector across all music genres, including rock, pop, hip hop, indie, jazz, country and traditional folk.  Under this package, a fund of &euro;1 million has been put in place to stimulate areas of work which artists would usually fund with income from own sources, including live event fees.  These schemes are targeted at professional musicians and their teams and will support song writing camps, recording and album releases.  The aim is to ensure that Irish musicians, engineers, PR, media, agents, labels and publishers can continue to develop and insure their work in the context of Covid restrictions.  The music stimulus package schemes are being managed on behalf of the Department by First Music Contact and will be subject to peer panel assessment.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the live performance supports pilot scheme, a further allocation of &euro;5 million is being made available, which aims to assist commercial venues, producers, promoters of live performances and provide employment to workers in creative industries.  My Department developed the conditions of this scheme in consultation with the sector, with particular assistance from EPIC.  By the initial closing date, more than 100 applications had been received, requesting funding of over &euro;15 million.  That is why it is a pilot scheme.

The task force has already met twice.  Its proceedings will be conducted in a transparent manner and all correspondence will be published in due course.

Three months before the examinations the schools were shut due to the public health emergency.  As weeks passed, students faced the uncertainty of whether they would even sit the leaving certificate examination this year.  There was postponement, cancellation and then uncertainty about what model would be used.  These young people have had a horrendous year.

Instead, they have faced an extraordinary mess and further disadvantage due to errors in the calculated grades model.  In May, I made it clear to the Department that the calculated grades model was not the correct one to use, because it would be a blunt instrument that would cause students to miss out when they should not.  The Minister for Education and Skills persisted with the model and there have been persistent difficulties since then.  The flaws have become apparent following the issuing of the results.<\/p>  <p>  The events of yesterday beg many serious questions.  The Opposition and even the Cabinet were kept in the dark.  Most importantly, the leaving certificate students were kept in the dark.  There is a striking lack of clarity about who in the Government knew what and when.  We know that this information was in the Minister's hands for seven days, and she said nothing publicly about it.  Incredibly, this was while second round offers from the Central Applications Office, CAO, were being issued and accepted.  This is not academic.  We cannot forget that this affects the lives and futures of students.  There are likely almost 1,000 students who have missed courses due to these errors.  The Minister says it will be a few days before the full numbers are known.  Many students will have taken up lower choice courses in cities and counties in which they had not expected to be located.  They will have paid registration fees and deposits to landlords.  They do not know whether they are coming or going.<\/p>  <p>  It is most important that we fix this shambles.

The Minister, Deputy Foley, said that no student will be disadvantaged.  To achieve that, there must be a guarantee that every student who missed a college course will now be offered the place that is rightfully his or hers.<\/p>  <p>  We also must ensure accountability.  The Government decided on this model.  It hired the company in question.  How experienced was this company in doing this type of work?  How were the errors not picked up before the results were issued?  This smacks of serious incompetence.  What is the Government going to do to ensure there is accountability?  Can the Minister clarify what he was told about this and when he was told?  What did he do as a result?

They have suffered most in terms of the quality of their lives at this critical time.  In my experience, anyone making decisions in this entire process had the interests of the students at heart, first and foremost.  That will continue to be the case.  Included in that, following a coding error in the system, we will ensure there is no student who is unable to avail of a course he or she should have been able to access had that small change in code and those four characters being different in a 50,000 line code.  We must ensure those students do not lose out.  We are committed to doing that in every way possible.<\/p>  <p>  Nobody was kept in the dark on this.  The error only became apparent when the person who had been involved in doing the coding saw a slight variation in running the model again when working on the applied leaving certificate results.  The person decided to check, at the person's own instigation, and found out what had happened.  The person is eminently qualified.  The person worked previously with Statistics Canada, the Canadian statistics agency, and also had specific expertise with regard to the Irish academic system due to work the person had done here in assessing our programme for international student assessment, PISA, results and had published on the very area on which the person was working.  The person was eminently qualified.  At a time when every country is considering these calculated grade systems, it was difficult to find people with such international expertise and knowledge of the Irish system.<\/p>  <p>  On seeing the variation that occurred when the person ran the model for the applied leaving certificate, the person contacted the Department of Education and Skills late last Tuesday week.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Department were only informed on Wednesday morning that there was a difficulty, but it was not clear exactly what it was.  The CAO ran its second round of offers on that day because it was not clear whether it was going to have an effect on the CAO process.  The Department, correctly, started to address the issue.  It employed a firm of American international consultants with expertise - it is the company that runs the SAT system in the US - as an independent, outside consultancy to go through the 50,000 lines of coding to ensure there were no other errors and to check what were the consequences of that code error.  That work is due to be completed in the next day or two.  Once it is confirmed to the Department, the model will be run again and the CAO will be immediately informed whether there are any upgrades, so it will be able to ensure that those students are not disadvantaged and are able to get the courses they should have received.<\/p> <p>The Department informed my party and myself of the details on Friday.  At that stage, because it was a complex issue to look into, there was only still an initial sense of where the difficulty might be.  I was fully briefed on Monday in advance of a leaders' meeting where we discussed it at length.  It is not a matter of keeping anyone in the dark at any stage.  The Deputy can imagine if, at the early stage in this process, someone had gone out without full knowledge of what the consequences would be to all the thousands of students who did the leaving certificate.  That would have created real anguish and uncertainty.  It was only yesterday that the scale of the issue and the numbers were clear.  A press conference was planned for 4 p.m. yesterday in advance of it being raised in the D&aacute;il.  There was no intention to keep anyone in the dark.  There was an intention to try to get this right so that the risk or anguish to students would be minimised.  I think that was the right approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100012#K00800","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601550600,"counter":121,"content":"<p>The Minister talks about four characters.

What might seem small on a spreadsheet is very significant in terms of the error that was made.  The Minister talked about having no intention of keeping people in the dark.  People were kept in the dark for over a week.  The Minister still has not answered.  He was informed on Friday and I would be interested to see over the course of time what was known at that stage.  The Minister was given more detail on Monday and there was a Cabinet meeting - a meeting of the Government - at which the matter was not discussed.  The Minister was aware of that beforehand.  Why did he not insist that this be discussed at Cabinet?  It is one of the greatest challenges that this and the previous Government have faced over the last few months yet it was decided that it should not be discussed at Cabinet.

The Deputy is right that the characters are not the important thing.  The fact that it was a coding error is not the key thing.  The key thing is the students.  The key thing now is the estimates we have.  We will have to wait until we run the full programme on the checked code; it could be something like 6,500 students.  From experience, last year some 3,000 students would have been in a similar position where they were due to get an upgrade after an appeals process.  No one will know the number until the final coding check is completed and all the other systems are put in place.  We can expect that there will be a number of students - no one knows the exact number - but it will be equivalent to the sort of percentage one would expect that was done last year.  It may actually be less because they were students who were looking to get up a grade to get to the points that they just missed.  It will probably be less but we do not know that until we get the final numbers.

The value of the stock inside Debenhams is &euro;11 million, and &euro;11 million is what it would take to pay proper redundancy to the 1,000 workers and their families, namely the two weeks that were negotiated and bargained for.  The fee that was paid to KPMG to advise the Government on the national broadband plan also happens to be &euro;11 million, a fiasco for which the State is paying six times the cost and which we will never own.  I want to bring those figures together to illustrate to everybody and particularly the leaders of the Government that what they are doing in terms of their treatment of the Debenhams workers is disgraceful and unacceptable.  I walked behind what looked like an army of ordinary working class women towards the Fianna F&aacute;il headquarters this morning, where they were protesting.  I was telling them how shameful it looked for the State to be overseeing the 175 days of their struggle without getting justice, and said to them &quot;you are just ordinary women.&quot;  They said no, and that they have become extraordinary people.  I read the article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>describing how Jane Crowe, the chief shop steward, sat in a cell having been arrested after occupying Henry Street, with a bed and a hole in the floor for a toilet.  She wondered how it had come to this.  I am asking the Minister how it has come to this.<\/p><p>The State has no end of largesse when coughing out to companies like KPMG for failures, indeed, as KPMG was supposed to have overseen the accounts of Anglo and Irish Nationwide.  It failed to alert us before the bank bailout that there was a problem.  Why is it that the State has no end of largesse to treat those big conglomerates in this way but cannot hold up its hands and say it failed to implement the terms of Duffy-Cahill?  It has failed to give those workers a mechanism whereby they could receive justice and should admit that the hard-won rights that they fought for having given years and years of service are being thrown back at them.  It is five days now that the workers in Waterford are occupying their store.  Last night an official from KPMG walked in and more or less asked them what it would take to settle this.  They said it would take negotiating with them and KPMG said no way.  The State is the best customer of KPMG.  Here is the way to settle it.  The Government should tell KPMG to sit down and negotiate and that the State, regarding its ability to collect the insolvency money, will take one step sideways and allow the workers to have first preference as a creditor.  That is what should have happened under Duffy-Cahill but the State failed to legislate.  The Minister is now part of the Government.  How can he sit there and say it is not possible to look after 1,000 workers and their families while it is possible to throw the largesse of the State at the big conglomerates?  Which side is he on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100013#L00400","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1601550600,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I am on the side of every worker in this country.  Our partnership process, our model of working with unions, employers and the various interests, is critical.  The social democratic partnership model is the strength of our country and vital for our country.  If there is one first priority it is social justice and rights.  Those rights are preserved when we have law.  The rights of the workers are protected in law so that employers are not able to exploit them, which would happen in the absence of that legal system and outlook in a country.  We do have to abide by the law.<\/p>  <p>  The role of this House is such that if there are deficiencies in the law in protecting workers, then of course we would look to see if we needed to amend legislation, strengthen law or provide further funds.  On us going another way and ignoring the law, even as hard, cruel and significant as the circumstances of workers in any one situation are, including in this case of the Debenhams workers, although one wants to do everything one can, what one cannot do is start going outside the law.  Once one does that, some of the protections that exist in the law are lost and it actually undermines and weakens workers' rights.  This Government is committed to doing whatever it can within the law.  The liquidation is proceeding under the supervision of the High Court.  Once it is in that High Court process, we cannot directly interfere.  Under the Companies Act, a liquidator is under statutory duty to realise and distribute the assets from an insolvent company as prescribed by law.  For State creditors including Revenue, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and local authorities in respect of rates, their legal frameworks have to be respected.  We do not have the discretion to forego debts owed to the State by a particular company.  At the same time, we do guarantee statutory employment rights to the workers of Debenhams and if a company is unable to pay statutory redundancy then the State will step in.  The first case is that the company has to pursue all possible avenues to provide that its statutory obligations are honoured and met.<\/p> <p>The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection expects to receive claims on behalf of the former employees of Debenhams under two separate schemes, namely, the redundancy payment scheme and insolvency payment scheme.  The Department estimates there will be approximately 1,750 claims between the two schemes with some 300 claims arriving per week and that it might take three or four weeks for all the claims to be submitted.  As of 18 September, the Department received 600 claims under the redundancy payment scheme and 646 under the insolvency payment scheme.<\/p> <p> Members on every side of this House believe it is important to protect and meet workers' rights.

If it is the side of social justice and social rights, and the law has not provided for it, then the law is an ass and the Minister and the Government can sit down with KPMG reminding it that the Government is its best customer.  The Government pays KPMG millions for every other project it wants to engage in.  Therefore, KPMG must listen to the Government.  Tell KPMG to negotiate with the workers and that this State will step aside in terms of what it is owed as a creditor and allow the workers to be first creditor because this State failed to implement the Duffy Cahill report.  Now, the Minister is making a promise to do it.  That is great.  Do it.  However, it will be too late for the Debenhams workers so the Minister needs to make a special case.

It is reviewing the Companies Act 2014 with a view to addressing the practice of trading entities splitting their operations between trading and property.  I am aware that is more relevant to the Clearys case but it will have a result where any trading company is trying to separate out its operations.

However, from the responses of the Minister and other Government Deputies over the past while, it looks like the Government is trying to outsource the blame for this particular issue to the private sector as well.

I do not ask that question for the purpose of the blame game but because there will be a cost to this cock-up.<\/p>  <p>  The class of 2020 has gone through extraordinary turmoil over the past year.

Those are extra places for students in a third level sector that is already on its knees financially.  There is a &euro;500 million shortfall in that sector.  It will not be feasible to provide places for everybody; it is just not going to happen.  Many students will be left in limbo in respect of their preferences for a full year and many of these cases will lead to court cases.<\/p>  <p>  Did the company make this mistake?

To assist this calculated grades process - no one wanted to do it but the pandemic forced it on us - they decided they wanted to get in some of the best international expertise they could, that is, people who had knowledge of the area in this country.  It was appropriate for them to seek that international expertise and bring it in.<\/p>  <p>  There is a critical strength and benefit to the leaving certificate.  There are some downsides to the leaving certificate but, to my mind, one great strength is that it is a level playing field for everyone and for every household in this country.  No matter where one comes from, what school one went to or what one's background is, we all believe, truthfully, the leaving certificate is a level playing field test and not an arbitrary one.  There is no benefit to someone living in one part of the country or to someone coming from one side of society or from another side.

However, I trust that what they are doing here is to address an unfortunate error.  There is deep regret that it occurred.  The error was recognised by the person who made it.  When they discovered they made the mistake they immediately said that.  It is far better that the person said an error was made, and we need to reflect on what the consequences are.  Far better than that, to my mind, is that the Department said it wanted to get the truth of this and that it brought in international, independent and highly-regarded experts so that it could have confidence that their review would tell it that, hopefully, there were no further errors and would explain how and why the actual error was made so that it is absolutely clear what happened and that trust in the system is ultimately protected.<\/p>  <p>It is important that the younger students, who are key to this, believe they got the correct result in the end.

How can the Minister for Transport stand over instances where in the same household two siblings can get a ticket but one cannot?  That is bullying of young children and the pressure it is putting on their parents is disgraceful.  Then the parents, grandparents or carers must get into a car to follow the bus down the road to the school.  How does that fit in with the green agenda?<\/p>  <p>  In October 2019, the then Minister announced a review of the school transport scheme to ensure funds are being spent in the most effective way to meet the objectives of the scheme.

The school transport scheme is a pure mess.<\/p>  <p>  I know a man in Cloneen in Tipperary, Michael O'Brien, whose daughter Bianca is a recovering cancer patient and doing well, thank God.

The bus passes quite close but she cannot get a ticket on it.  It is not acceptable that the review of the school transport scheme has been delayed because of Covid.  With 3,100 students left to find alternative arrangements, the Government needs to sort this urgently.  It is beyond urgent; it should have been sorted last year.<\/p>  <p>  The future of the X8 Expressway service is in jeopardy and we cannot get a train out of Clonmel, Cahir or Carrick-on-Suir before 9 a.m. any morning.  The bus service is very poor.  I salute the private carriers and others, whom the Minister knows, who do the work there.  We have 85,000 people waiting for driving tests.

That was a decision by the company over how it wants to meet what it sees as growing demand and areas where it was suffering significant losses.  It was not because of a lack of financial support or a lack of willingness to support public transport services.  There will be an increased employment of drivers and a redeployment of drivers on existing routes.  As I told the company - I commit to it here - if there is any loss of service with any town left out or left behind, we will apply the public service obligation to ensure no town is left behind.<\/p>  <p>  This was the commercial side of its bus operations.  It was not under the public service route network, but that does not matter.  We still need to ensure every town is connected.  Indeed, we seek to expand the public transport network.  Under the towns first policy, we can use the strange opportunities Covid presents to change our transport system away from long-distance car commuting towards having local bus services.  People who are able to work remotely without the need to commute will have good quality local bus services in their own town as well as between cities.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously Covid restrictions have presented considerable difficulty for school transport.  With the recommencement of schools, the Government set up the school transport system to work effectively with student safety in mind.  The Department of Education and Skills provided funding for all the proper sanitisation and hygiene requirements on buses.  Because the numbers spiked about a week before the schools came back, we had to revise the plans further.  We did not have the 1,600 drivers needed and the extra coaches to meet the higher standards that the health authorities required.  The Minister for Education and Skills has been working on that.  We will introduce it shortly.  I estimate it will cost over &euro;100 million to further protect and improve the school bus transport system.<\/p>  <p>  Everyone in the House knows there are difficulties with that system.  About 20,000 students get buses in a separate private system.  There are issues with concession tickets, none of which are optimal.  There is no lack of support, no lack of commitment and no lack of funding.  Many hundreds of millions of euro of additional funding will be allocated to public transport this year and we will do the same again next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100015#N00500","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1601552400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>That is not very helpful.  The school transport system is a mess.  The Minister is talking about &euro;750 million this year, &euro;450 million more than last year.  He would be better off subsidising parents to drive their kids to school and forget his green ideals.  We have buses passing by and cars travelling in front of them and behind them and the whole thing is organised chaos.  The Minister said the numbers spiked in September but the Government knew, since the schools closed last March, that this problem was coming down the track.  Can the Government not think ahead?  The Department managers would not survive in business for a week.  The Minister should know as he is a former businessman.  Surely one plans ahead when one sees what is coming down the track.<\/p>  <p>  We have 85,000 people waiting for driver tests, we will have a carbon tax hitting us in the budget, we literally have no rail services in County Tipperary, although the Minister has made the right noises about how he wants to see stations restored, and we have no guarantee on the Expressway services.  Thank God for PJ Kavanagh, McCarra's, Lambert's, Denny and Kit Whelan and Mr. Toohey up in Nenagh.  Thank God also for the parents' groups who are able to organise private routes.  They can do it efficiently with buses.  Those bus owners have got no support whatsoever from the pandemic unemployment payment or anything else.  They are getting no support to sanitise their buses either.  It is discrimination against rural people all the time and rural children are being bullied.  Can the Minister imagine the damage it does to a child when his or her two siblings are taken on and they cannot be taken on?  Just think of it happening to a child of five, seven or eight years of age.

It is critical for the mental health and development of our children that we will do whatever it takes to do this.  In these circumstances, the message to the upcoming leaving certificate students is that there will be leaving certificate exams next May and June.

Before I begin, I want to acknowledge the enormous impact this virus has had on our society.  Every corner of the country has been affected on some level and it has touched every county, community and family.  We have had to stay away from friends and family members for months.  Some people have lost their jobs and others have lost businesses that they had dedicated their lives to building.  Some sectors have been particularly badly hit.  The arts community, the people to whom we turn to keep us going, inspire and comfort us in dark times, has been decimated by the virus.  The arts thrive on people gathering together for shared experiences and that is the very thing that Covid-19 forces us to limit.<\/p>  <p>  The same applies to the hospitality sector, sports and many other areas of our country, community and lives.  Those groups, like the arts community, have done everything they can to respond to the challenges of Covid-19.  They have adapted, innovated and worked tirelessly but the inescapable need for less social interaction in order to suppress this virus has come at a high cost to all of these sectors in every county across the nation.<\/p>  <p>  We have not been able to celebrate weddings, birthdays, communions and many other of life's milestones as we would want.  At funerals, we have not been able to say goodbye, pay our respects and mourn the deceased as we need to.<\/p> <p>We now have more than 36,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ireland.  We have reported the deaths of 1,804 women and men from Covid-19.  I express my deepest sympathies, as well as those of the Government, to the families and friends of every single one of these women and men.<\/p> <p> I pay tribute to the front line workers who have worked tirelessly since early this year.  Our healthcare workers have played an absolutely vital role in combating this disease and caring for those who needed healthcare when they were affected by it.  Other public services, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, local authority staff and many others are to be commended by us on their commitment to this national effort.  Tragically, some healthcare workers lost their lives while caring for others during this pandemic.  I pay particular tribute to them, their families and their loved ones.<\/p> <p> The virus is having a huge impact internationally.  There are more than 33 million confirmed cases and in excess of 1 million confirmed deaths from Covid-19.  We are not alone in trying to devise a strategy to limit the growth of this virus and its impact on our people, communities, economy and lives.<\/p> <p> It is clear at this point that the virus is going to be with us for some time.  While we cannot be certain how long that will be, we nevertheless have to plan our society and live with the virus in the meantime.  Chapter one in our fight against Covid-19 involved closing the country down in order to flatten the curve.  While that came at an extraordinarily high price for many people, it worked.  It is not something we can continue to do.  Therefore, we are taking a new approach.<\/p> <p> This is chapter two, keeping the country open while suppressing the virus, moving early and targeting the virus where we know it spreads so as to protect lives, resume health care services, keep our schools, colleges and childcare facilities open and protect jobs.  The resilience and recovery plan provides us with a way of navigating chapter two, allowing society and businesses to operate as normally as possible while continuing to suppress the virus.  It is designed to help individuals, organisations and sectors to better understand, anticipate and prepare for measures that might need to be introduced as the virus moves through the country.<\/p> <p> The framework in the plan brings clarity and certainty to how we will move forward with opening our society at this time.  Inherent in the framework is a prioritisation of activities.  It represents a move away from the short term emergency response that was needed to a medium-term risk management of the virus, including repairing the impact Covid-19 has had on our economy and society.<\/p> <p> Given the constantly evolving nature of this pandemic, it is critical that a certain amount of flexibility is built into the plan to allow for a nuanced approach.  This allows our public health doctors and the Government to take account of disease profile and trajectory at a given time and to make decisions accordingly.  Each numbered level in the plan corresponds to the measures that will be in place as a result of the pattern and progress of Covid-19 in a particular county or region at a particular time.  This is a framework to help guide decision-making by each of us individually as well as collectively and a society.<\/p> <p> The measures at each level have been carefully developed by our public health doctors and specialists in infectious diseases.  The national framework is built on three pillars.  The first of these is healthy people.  This involves taking personal responsibility and following the public health guidelines as a first line of defence.  It also includes accessible and sustainable testing and tracing, the flu vaccine, non-Covid health and social care services and additional capacity for new ways of delivering non-Covid care.<\/p> <p> The second pillar is strong businesses . These include the employment wage subsidy available to the end of March next year, the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, which is remaining open to new entrants and has been extended to April of next year, loans, grants, rate waivers, vouchers and other support schemes for small and medium enterprises, enhanced restart grants worth more than &euro;550 million, &euro;200 million in training and support for people who have lost jobs, and &euro;500 million in capital works.  A stay and spend tax incentive is in place from October to April of next year.  There is a six-month VAT reduction from 23% to 21%.  The Covid-19 illness benefit has been extended until the end of March next year and local authorities will develop local recovery initiatives.<\/p> <p> The third pillar is resilient communities.  There will be a strong focus on the well-being and resilience of our communities and a programme of well-being activities and initiatives will be delivered locally, including supporting healthy living, physical activity, managing chronic disease, positive ageing and the needs of young people.  There will be local community and voluntary group funding to enable them to adapt their services.  Libraries will expand online and digital book delivery services will take place.  There will be a permanent volunteer reserve corps established in every county, and individual mental health supports will be provided.<\/p> <p> In tandem with the plan, I am working with the HSE to develop services as part of the winter plan to ensure that resources are devoted to those areas that will see the most benefit as we approach the seasonal impacts on our hospitals and other healthcare services.  Central to all of our efforts is a robust testing and contact tracing strategy for the virus.  The HSE and Department have worked intensively over recent months to put in place a comprehensive, reliable and responsive testing and tracing regime.<\/p> <p> The HSE has increased resources significantly, including optimising and maximising our laboratory testing capacity on the island.  The HSE is finalising its future service model for testing and contact tracing at this time.  This includes recruiting a permanent workforce as well as other service improvements.  The National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, continues to be a vital resource for the Government, advising on public health measures and strategies to limit the growth of virus in our society.  It continues to monitor the emerging international evidence and the advice of the WHO and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC. <\/p> <p> In the absence of a vaccine for Covid-19, the advice for the public continues to be to limit the number of people we meet outside our homes and the time we spend with people.  It includes wearing a face covering on public transport, in shops and in other indoor settings, avoiding crowded places as much as we can, avoiding public transport where possible and walking or cycling instead &ndash; that is obviously not possible for all people at all times - avoiding places where we cannot keep 2 m apart from each other where possible, and working from home if possible.  I recognise that many people, including many essential workers, simply cannot work from home, but there are measures that can be taken in some instances, such as social distancing.<\/p> <p> We have seen very positive responses to the communication of this roadmap.  The high number of people wearing face coverings, for example, demonstrates the solidarity in our society in respect of dealing with this virus.  We must continue this solidarity if we are to suppress the virus.<\/p> <p> We have come a long way since March.  We have learned to live in a world with this virus.  We have reopened many aspects of our society and economy.  Around a million children have returned to school.  Students are returning to college.  Our health services are resuming.  The majority of society is open, despite the highly infectious and dangerous disease circulating among us.<\/p> <p>We succeeded in doing these things thanks to the collective efforts of all of us to adhere to the guidelines, as well as to the expert knowledge and advice from our public health doctors and specialists and the dedication and hard work of our frontline workers.  Right now, we need individually and collectively to keep doing the basics right.  This is what the vast majority of people are doing everyday.  We have the power to adhere to the public health guidelines.  The regulations in place are designed to assist each of us to make choices to reduce the risk to ourselves, our family and our vulnerable loved ones.  I urge everyone to listen to the public health doctors, to the public health advice and I ask all Members of this House to use their influence to support this message, support our public health doctors and the national guidelines in place.  Together we will suppress this virus.  We will keep people safe.  We will keep our schools and colleges open, protect jobs and continue this fight.  I thank the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100020#T00200","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601555700,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and call Deputy P&aacute;draig O&rsquo;Sullivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100022#V00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1601555700,"counter":244,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCeann Comhairle agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.<\/p>  <p>  I greatly welcome the publication two weeks ago of the roadmap for living alongside Covid-19.  Covid-19 has placed great demands on every one of us, as individuals, parents, families, workers and indeed business owners.  The overall aim of this plan is to keep schools and cr&egrave;ches open in as many of these scenarios as possible.  The Government prioritised that schools would remain open.  We are all well aware that children depend crucially on education and learning.  I recognise the great amount of work undertaken to make this possible.<\/p>  <p>  The reopening of international travel formed a key part of this plan.  The aviation industry is one of the industries that has been most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.  All airlines have suffered a severe depletion of revenue and are now facing significant financial challenges.  I recently attended a briefing at Cork Airport where I was told that the passenger numbers there had declined by 95% due to Covid-19.  Its impact on Cork Airport is expected to see the loss of over 2 million passengers this year and more than &euro;23 million in lost revenue by year end.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s approach to international travel has sought to protect public health.  This has certainly been the correct approach in the earlier phases of the pandemic.  It is now time to find a reasonable balance that combines public health requirements with those of a functioning economy.  The Aviation Recovery Task Force published its final report recently and it contained several recommendations relating to the provision of further support to the industry.  The European Commission has also published a proposal to promote a common approach to travel restrictions and movement within the EU.  The Minister has previously stated that work is required to develop these recommendations into effective interventions and that this work is well underway.  I ask that the Minister and his Department make this an urgent priority and would appreciate an update or general timeframe as to when these interventions will be in place.  The importance of Cork Airport to our economy and to the region cannot be underestimated.  I want to ensure that Cork Airport&rsquo;s interests are to the forefront of this Government&rsquo;s agenda.<\/p>  <p>  On a totally different topic I will talk about messaging.  I compliment the Minister and his Department in tackling in recent months what has been a national crisis.  I understand the key messaging regarding the Covid-19 tracker app and the various tools that he has at his disposal.  I urge that we look at other countries in Europe, such as Belgium, France and Germany, and even countries in Asia such as India, in order to complement our own Covid-19 tracker app, with a specific messaging service, be it through WhatsApp or through mobile providers.  If messaging was made directly into people&rsquo;s individual mobile phones every day or couple of days, with specific problems or problem areas highlighted and specific messaging around identifying cases and so on, this would be of great benefit.<\/p>  <p>  Another point is regarding the local electoral area, LEA, breakdown and the figures that are available on the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, website.  The data on this website is updated every Thursday, so we will be waiting to have it uploaded later today, based on last week&rsquo;s figures.  Every week there is some chaos, as people are asking are we going into lockdown.  Is the city, in the case of Cork, or the county, going into lockdown, or are both?  I point people towards the HPSC website to look at their LEA but I urge the Minister and the Government, with a county the size of Cork which equates to the size of four or five counties, to consider seriously this point in future area specific lockdowns, be it urban or LEA.  This needs to be looked at.  I thank the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100022#V00300","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1601555700,"counter":245,"content":"<p>We move to the Sinn F&eacute;in slot where Deputy Cullinane will be sharing with Deputies Cronin and Ward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100022#V00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1601555700,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Yes, and with Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh as well, a Cheann Comhairle, when he come in.  We have a number of speakers.  I will start straight away with my eight minutes.<\/p>  <p>  First, I welcome the opportunity that we have been given to debate this plan.  As he knows we have been looking for this debate for some time.  As someone who has been calling for briefings and more interactions between health spokespersons and party leaders with Deputy Donnelly, as Minister, and with NPHET, I welcome an email I received from the Minister and his office yesterday saying that those briefings will be put in place.  They are very useful and as much engagement as we can possibly have will be of benefit to all of us.  Analysing, probity and scrutiny does not in any way underestimate the public health advice or indeed any decisions taken by the Minister.  It strengthens the overall approach.<\/p>  <p>  I also join with the Minister in calling on people to do whatever they can to play their role in suppressing this virus.  Local leadership can play a great part.  Look no further than Waterford, and indeed Tipperary and Limerick, as examples of that.  I spoke to the CEO of Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council yesterday on this matter and he quite rightly pointed out that what we should be looking at is more localised input into the public health advice that is given, having local influencers, using the local radio station, using the local GAA, sporting, rugby and football clubs and getting as many people as possible to spread the positive message.  Indeed this should include politicians, from councillors to Oireachtas Members.  That is what we did in Waterford over the past number of weeks and we can see that the numbers have gone down.  They have also come down in Limerick and in Tipperary.  That needs to be looked at.<\/p>  <p>  The national message is important.  Sometimes the national message can get muddled if different counties are in different positions.  The national public health officials and the Minister should also look at ways in which we incorporate more localised responses and leadership into the overall responses.<\/p>  <p>  The plan to live with the virus has to do a number of things.  It has to keep schools open which we all accept.  I have two children going to school and I want to see them continuing to go to school for all sorts of reasons but mainly for their own personal development.  We also have to ensure that we keep people in jobs and that people can go to work, which is of great importance to them.  We have to protect our health services, which includes not just the acute services but mental health services as well.<\/p>  <p>  We also, however, have to allow people to live.  That is the more complicated part but it is important.  Living means that people have to have social outlets and opportunities.  We have to find ways where we can adhere to public health guidelines, keep socially distant, do all of the things that are required of us with the hand washing, cough etiquette, the wearing of a mask and all of the things that we need to do, but people need to live.  When people hear that this will be with us for six, nine, 12 months or more, that is all the more reason that we must give people hope.<\/p>  <p>  We also have to stop blaming certain sections of society, whether it is pubs or restaurants, or young people, for the spread of the virus.  Some of the commentary that I have seen in recent times about young people has been unhelpful.  We need to speak to young people and to acknowledge that young people play a role of great importance in suppressing the virus.  When mistakes are made these should be pointed out, but it has to be balanced and proportionate.  We have to understand that young people need social opportunities.  It is a big issue for them when they cannot go to college, when it is online, when they cannot interact with people and when they cannot go and meet their friends in the way they did before.  We have to accept that and explain that it cannot be the way that it was.  We also have to give people hope that it can be better.  That is what the plan should be about.<\/p>  <p>  I need to put a number of questions to the Minister and I will give him two minutes to respond to them.  One concerns comments from the acting CMO yesterday that the window of opportunity for it not to be a national issue is closing.  Can the Minister reaffirm for this House that he was not talking about all counties going to level 3?<\/p> <p>That is a very important point.  There was a significant amount of speculation on social media about what the acting CMO said.  It is very important that there is clarity.  The plan has five levels and different counties will be at different levels.  If the Government is looking to move the whole State into level 3, that should be communicated.  If it is not looking to do so, then the acting CMO needs to explain better what he meant by referring to this becoming a national issue in the context of the various phases.  It is important that there is no misrepresentation of what is being said.  I am giving the Minister the opportunity to clear that matter up from the Government's perspective.<\/p> <p> My final question relates to a comment made yesterday by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar.  He seemed to indicate that we should only use the incidence of hospitalisations to determine whether a county goes  up a level or down a level, as opposed to all the other factors of which NPHET would take account.  To me, that would be a departure from what is in the plan.  That statement needs to be explained.  Will the Minister explain what the T&aacute;naiste meant?  It is important that we do not have very senior politicians flying kites after the Government has published a plan that sets out guidelines.  I ask the Minister to respond on those two issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100022#V00500","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601556300,"counter":248,"content":"<p>This is not a question and answer session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100023#W00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1601556300,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I was allowing the Minister to answer in the time allocated to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100023#W00300","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1601556300,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I am afraid the Deputy may not do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100023#W00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1601556300,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Does the Minister not wish to answer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100023#W00500","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1601556300,"counter":252,"content":"<p>It does not matter whether he wishes to answer.

The moulds must be snug in her ears.  Just like Goldilocks, C&eacute;il&iacute; needs her hearing aids just right.  However, for months during the summer she could not get them adjusted because of the bizarre political decision made in March to redeploy the highly skilled paediatric audiologists on whom C&eacute;il&iacute; depends as Covid-19 contact trackers.  I have heard of service dogs smelling the virus, but I have never heard of audiologists hearing the virus.<\/p>  <p>  Children such as C&eacute;il&iacute; were told to go whistle and her hearing aids certainly did that.  Her mother could hear the hearing aids whistling on the ground floor while she was on the first floor of their home.  C&eacute;il&iacute; did not get an appointment until seven months later.  Her mother is now seeking assurances that there will not be a repeat of this lack of service because C&eacute;il&iacute; is missing out on the tiny opportunity she has to learn how to speak in order that she can keep up with her peers.  I spoke to her mother last night.  She is frantic, and rightly so, because she knows her daughter needs to take this chance.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister guarantee that these highly skilled and desperately needed audiologists will be free to work with children such as C&eacute;il&iacute; who need their specialist skills, rather than wasting those skills contact tracing?  When I think of the thousands of people who volunteered under the Be On Call For Ireland initiative, it seems to me that the past six months have been wasted.  To give C&eacute;il&iacute; the chance to speak, I ask the Minister to listen to what she and her parents are saying.  Will he guarantee that the audiologists will be available to carry out this necessary fitting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100023#W00700","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1601556300,"counter":254,"content":"<p>If this was a real roadmap for living with Covid, I am afraid we would be turning into dead end after dead end when it comes to people seeking supports for mental health.  I am a member of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  I listened to expert after expert tell the committee that we are facing an avalanche of mental health issues.  The experts stated that mental health services that were already out of date and not fit for purpose prior to Covid were facing unprecedented demands on their services.  The many years of underinvestment in mental health supports are coming home to roost.<\/p>  <p>  The previous Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, spouted at every opportunity about how he got &euro;1 billion spent on mental health last year.  I remind the Minister that that is the same amount that was spent in 2009.  The fact that there has been no substantial increase in mental health supports for more than a decade shows the indifference of the Government and previous Governments to mental health supports.<\/p>  <p>  Tonight on RT&Eacute;1 there will be a special broadcast of a programme entitled \"The Next Normal\".  It will relate how 33% or one third of the people surveyed for the programme have suffered with their mental health in the past six months.  Mental health providers have stated that they are inundated with people crying out for help.  The warning signs are stark, but there is no mention of mental health in the winter plan that has been developed to prepare for and manage the anticipated pressures this winter.  That plan will be discussed later today but I will not have the opportunity to contribute on it.  Where is the winter plan for mental health?  Where is the roadmap for mental health supports?  It is simply not good enough that we are forced to rely on non-governmental organisations and charities to plug the gap in State mental health supports.  Only yesterday, the St. John of God group, which has provided mental health supports for more than a century, had to give notice to the HSE that it can no longer operate due to its financial difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  We are facing a tsunami of mental health issues due to Covid-19.  Not only is the Government standing on the beach watching the wave approaching, it is also burying its head in the sand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100023#W00800","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1601556300,"counter":255,"content":"<p>In the little time I have, I wish to raise several points with the Minister.  The Labour Party welcomes the roadmap.  We consistently stated that it is necessary.  The Minister should have had the acting CMO with him when it was announced.  It might have helped with the deep issues that came across in communications.  I was glad that he recently projected we need to be planning for this for six to nine months.  It was with that in mind that I told the Taoiseach that we need to deal with the next six months differently from the way we dealt with the previous six months.  I would like the Minister to listen to these remarks and maybe pass them on to Dr. Holohan who will be returning to his post.  I acknowledge Dr. Glynn for the way he stood in for Dr. Holohan.   Covid came at the best time for Ireland.  We had a very good spring and then it was summer.  Now we face six months of bad weather in autumn and winter.<\/p>  <p>  We need to give people hope.  We need to prepare in two three-month projections.  I am asking the Minister to set out such projections and give people hope that they will be able to enjoy Christmas, see their loved ones again and possibly travel outside the country.  People need reassurance that they will be able to have a Christmas that at least resembles a normal Christmas.  If all Deputies work together on the matter, would the Minister consider preparing two such projections?  It is just a suggestion to give people hope.  The Minister is a reasonable person.  I know it is a suggestion that comes from the Opposition, but would the Minister consider preparing a plan for the weeks between now and Christmas, setting the situation out county by county, and stating that if we all pull together, we can have a Christmas when loved ones will be able to see each other.  Another plan would be released in early January to bring us up to St. Patrick's Day.  That would break the back of it and we would then be back into spring and summer and we would then see where we would be.<\/p>  <p>  On lockdowns and changing phases, I appreciate what is stated in the roadmap, but there is no doubt that some counties are adapting.  My own county has one of the lowest rates, but as I stated on local media in an attempt to show leadership, that could change pretty quickly.  Will the Government give consideration to more localised lockdowns, particularly in urban areas, rather than locking down entire counties?  Has modelling been done on how that could work?  Dr. Glynn stated that he was concerned about the amount of traffic in Dublin, but in an interview an hour or two ago, the Minister stated there was a lesser amount of traffic.  We need to make sure the messaging is consistent.  My principal question regards whether more localised lockdowns could be used and whether that has been modelled.<\/p>  <p>  On moving from phase to phase, the Government needs to give notice of such changes, especially when an area is moving into a more stringent phase.  The hospitality and tourism industry needs more notice.  Yesterday I discussed budgetary measures with the Taoiseach.  We need to ensure there are budgetary measures in place to support sectors that are impacted by decisions to move to stricter phases.  The hospitality and tourism sector, including those providing food and accommodation, lose out immediately when such decisions are made.  We need to customise and mould the response to such circumstances.<\/p> <p>Similarly, students have paid their fees and also paid for accommodation, and then everything suddenly moved online.<\/p> <p> Turning to older people, my parents are both aged over 80.  I have spoken about this issue before, and this situation has not been good for people in that category.  We need to give those older people hope.  During the phases to come, we need to give older people the capacity to socialise and have normal lives.  They have given the most and paid the most taxes, but unfortunately they have the least amount of time left with us, on average.  We need, however, to give those people hope and to do that we need a plan for that group of people.  We also need a plan, and I want to see this in the budget, that will ensure that people with disabilities, particularly those with intellectual disabilities, who are our most vulnerable and those we should be most concerned about, are looked after during the phases of this roadmap.<\/p> <p> I will move on to the last issues I want to raise.  It has always been said that we follow the public health advice and the Government has always said that it follows the public health advice.  We now know, however, about a date when the CMO wrote to the Government stating that the issue of sick pay had to be dealt with, but the Government did not follow that public health advice.  The Government did not follow that advice, it is as simple as that and that is an anomaly.  We are asking people to follow public health advice, so when NPHET asks the Government to do things and but it does not, I ask that the Government to please explain why it is not doing what has been recommended.  I ask that because I see that as a complete contradiction.<\/p> <p> One issue I really want to get to is the area of testing and tracing.  It is obvious that we must let those therapists and specialists who are doing some of this work back to their day jobs.  I understand that the Minister agrees with me.  I have some ideas about how we could undertake the recruitment necessary for that roll-out, but I want to present them to the Minister personally and privately.  I do not have time to do that in detail here, but I will do it separately.<\/p> <p> In addition, we also need to look at other technologies, such as rapid testing.  We need to examine how we are going to facilitate people coming in through the airports.  I met some of the people who look at this testing and I have had a Covid-19 test, which has a high level of accuracy, and I had the result in ten minutes.  The test was done in front of me.  We need to look at what other technologies being used across Europe and the world.  We must examine how can we use them if we can get them through the regulatory process quickly enough and if Dr. Cillian de Gascun and his team approve them.  Might it be possible that we could model it so that we could bring such testing into some sectors, test and check the process several times and then use that method?  <\/p> <p> I state that because we need that type of technology rolled out into society to allow people to go about their business a little bit more freely.  I encourage the Minister to look at other technologies.  We have the analogue version of testing, but we also need to look at the digital version of testing.  They may have other issues, but we need to check them all out.  If we can use those technologies then they may have a positive impact on some of this roadmap, how we move through the phases and how we open up society and allow businesses to operate.  I ask the Minister to please take on some of my suggestions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100023#W00900","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601556900,"counter":257,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Connor is sharing time with Deputy Lahart.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100024#X00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1601556900,"counter":258,"content":"<p>Covid-19 restrictions were initially put in place as it was feared that the unknown nature of the virus would overload our healthcare capacity which would, in turn, cause a downward spiral in healthcare provision and increase the level of deaths.  These measures were initially introduced with a short timeframe of several weeks in mind.  The virus remains in our society today, but more is now known about it than when it first came to Ireland in March.  According to our current knowledge, a vaccine for the virus will not be available within the next 18 months, at a minimum.  Considering the rate of fatalities from Covid-19 compared with other established human illnesses and the potential long-term consequences for society, I feel that a reassessment of the objectives of how we manage the virus should be considered.<\/p>  <p>  The capacity of our ICUs is a critical metric for determining the significance of the level of cases.  While it is understood that it is beneficial to reduce the number of cases in general as this ultimately reduces the number of deaths, the ratio between the number of cases and deaths and our ability to impact on that ratio should be considered and the necessary investment in healthcare capacity should be prioritised by the Government to deal with that issue.  If we have an adequate level of ICU provision to deal with the level of cases within society at present, then we should look to balance this against the level of restrictions throughout our society and the impact that such restrictions are having on the quality of life of our citizens.<\/p>  <p>  It must also be noted that the nature of restrictions must be questioned.  Under the medium-term nature of the restrictions, as compared with the short-term measures in March, people are likely to forgo social interactions and reduce their social contacts.  This can be seen in the increase of uncontrolled social gatherings.  A logical conclusion to draw from that, therefore, considering the balancing act required between ensuring hospital capacity is not overrun and the level of societal damage that restrictions are causing, is that a strong case can be made for reopening controlled environments such as restaurants, hotels and pubs.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, clearer objectives regarding the significance of the meaning of the level of cases need to be considered alongside the potential long-term consequences of restricting part of our economy.  If capital investment is required in the healthcare sector, the initial upfront cost will be mitigated by the potential savings of lost economic growth arising from maintaining a level of restrictions.  Regarding damage to our economy, a 2020 report from the World Bank recognised the need to incentivise a switch to more sustainable production processes, including a move towards a great digitalisation and green investment which will enhance the productivity of our economy.  There must be a recognition that the dynamic of the economy has changed and it is not sustainable to continue to support industries in their current form.  A realignment of resources should be undertaken during the budget.<\/p>  <p>  At the same time, we must be conscious of the economic scarring of certain sections of our society in adapting to this changing work environment.  Systems must be put in place to ensure that reskilling and job reactivation schemes are put in place so that the levels of inequality within the economy do not widen, as stressed within the World Bank report.  Large capital investment programmes should be pursued across several areas where the economic return on the investment will be redeemed over time.  With current Irish borrowing costs at record low levels, this is an excellent opportunity to raise the capital necessary to pursue such initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the impact on young people, this must be more of a priority for the Government.  The long-term development of the country is dependent upon young people buying into the institutional structures of our State.  If the level of trust that our young people have in this State is diminished, that can make it harder to have a functioning institutional framework within society and to mobilise knowledge and the productive capacities of a significant sector of our society.  If this issue is not addressed, it will make it far more difficult to return to the level of economic growth required to return our economy, country and society to the standards of living we enjoyed previously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100024#X00300","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speech","time":1601556900,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate, and I commend the Minister on the task he has been given to undertake and deliver on in the most trying and challenging of times.  The Minister is doing a fine job.  He has the best wishes of this side of the House and, I hope, the other side of the House.  The Minister is in the position at a unique time in history when we are faced with a pandemic for the first time in a century.  That is quite a burden and responsibility to deal with.  He is entitled to the support of his peers and he certainly has it.<\/p>  <p>  I want to focus on one facet of this plan, because I know some of my colleagues have dwelt on the different aspects of the Roadmap for Living with Covid-19.  The strategy has much to recommend it and there is much to read in it.  Clearly, there has been much thought and planning and an awareness of the impact that phase one of Covid-19 had on people.  There has been a huge amount of learning and I want to come back to one specific aspect of that.<\/p>  <p>  In a previous professional chapter in my own life I practised as a psychotherapist and I took a particular interest in the literature and research around loss.  Generally speaking, the public - I hope I am not underestimating them - tend to associate loss and grieving with the loss of a loved one.  The literature, however, tells us that we can go through the same stages of grieving, if perhaps not so acutely, when we lose many other different things that we take for granted in life.  That can include loss of health, loss of status, loss of routine, loss of friendships, loss of work colleagues, loss of work, loss of business, loss of a partner present during labour and loss of having a partner present during pregnancy-related appointments.<\/p> <p>It can include loss of hugs, loss of granny, loss of granddad, loss of work colleagues and loss of joy.  My sister sent me a photograph on WhatsApp recently of myself and herself and her husband outside Mulligan's this time last year celebrating the drawn all-Ireland game and the picture really hit me right between the eyes.  What I saw in one little moment encapsulated what has been taken away from us.  There we were with not a care in the world drinking our pints and the people around us very happy, and all of that has been robbed of us.  In the literature, they tend to say, generally speaking, that there are five stages in grieving a loss.  The most underestimated response to loss is anger when people do not get to express their feelings around the loss that they have just experienced.  I have elucidated just a few of those kind of losses.  We could have a much longer list than that.  As a parliament and as a society, we need to watch out for anger.  There is a significant amount of unexpressed anger in society at present.<br\/><br\/>I am particularly taken with the emphasis and the research work done.  I am looking forward to what the Minister will produce in practical terms because there is a good roadmap in, I think, section 6 on resilience and community.  I am taken with the work that SpunOut has done, particularly with the generation aged 16 to 25.  As Dr. Tony Bates said in an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>this morning, people in this age group have suffered more than most because it is the time when they develop primarily through contact and interactions with their peer group and that has been denied to them.  Do we begrudge them when they break out of the rules a little?  I would side with Dr. Bates on this.  We need to practise the rules but we need to be human too and resist pointing the finger.<br\/><br\/>We need to give people hope.  How does one give people hope?  Generally, when we get bad news, we learn to live with it, cope with it, absorb it, internalise it, digest it, grieve the consequences of it and move on.  There is no moving on with this pandemic because we do not know when it will go.  This means that there will be continued losses carried on by society.  I often think of how useful Dr. Maureen Gaffney's morning piece with the late Gay Byrne on the radio used to be years ago.  She psychologically analysed the nation and dealt with its problems.  I know that much of this stuff happens on social media and it is really positive.  I think the Government needs to step into this space.  There is one useful thing we could do.  It is not for the Minister; it is for the Cabinet.  We need to do something special for people this Christmas, such as give city and county councils significant budgets for fantastic public lighting displays that people can go out safely and admire.  We need to put some thought into this.  It will be a Christmas like no other and the State needs to step in.<br\/><br\/>I refer to all the messages people are receiving from the State.  I looked at the make-up of NPHET this morning.  It is such a fine body of people, generally from a medical background.  I hope I am not being harsh on them when I say that the people who have a psychological, mental health or well-being background are on the administrative side rather than on the medical side.  In Ireland, we tend to separate physical and mental health from each other instead of looking at them as one integrated piece.  We have a big task as a Government on the mental health and well-being piece.  People across society, even people who have been virtually unaffected by the virus, have suffered losses.  It could be that they cannot go to see their son or daughter playing the local sport.  That is a loss.  People are angry about that.  The Government needs to acknowledge that.  In our messaging, we need to find a way to give people hope.  Hope has been missing from much of the messaging coming from the Government.  We need to devise a way to give people something to cling on to or hope for, whether it is the promise of a great festival the likes of which has never been seen in the country or whether it is devising ways of memorialising those people who have been lost to Covid, even now at distance in our churches, in our places of worship or in a humanistic way.<br\/><br\/>There is much good.  I am looking forward to the outworkings of the SpunOut investigation into the needs of younger people, but this is a cross-society requirement.  In bringing this back to his Cabinet colleagues, the Minister should watch out for anger, which is the most underestimated response to loss.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100024#X00400","speaker":"1572","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601557500,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Deputy Paul Donnelly is sharing time with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100025#Y00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1601557500,"counter":262,"content":"<p>First, I pay tribute to all the front-line workers and all those who have been working so hard over the past number of months.  I express sympathy again to the family and friends of those who have passed way and those who have suffered throughout this pandemic and crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Covid-19 has seen the decimation of many small businesses across the State, certainly across my constituency.  I have been in contact with many of them over the past number of months since the initial shutdown and also as the guidelines changed and came out and we went into different phases.  I am sure all Members will be aware of this.  I am sure many of these businesses and similar ones in the Minister's constituency have been in touch with him time and again.  They are terrified of what is to come.  They are terrified at what has happened.  They are afraid for their businesses, for their employees and for their employees' families and loved ones and how they will see their way through this.  As the Minister will be aware, all of these business people work extremely hard to pay their bills, keep their businesses going, pay their employees and create local employment.  Many of them have dug deep into their reserves financially, psychologically and emotionally to deal with the Covid-19 crisis, to reopen their businesses and to get their workers back to work so that they can also pay their bills.  Some of the businesses that come to mind in my constituency include the gym that I go to, Ger Conroy Fitness, and a wonderful water babies group in the swimming pool in Junction 6.  There is also a salt cave, which was a brand new business that had only opened in February.  Those involved had put their heart and soul into it.  These are people who had come to the country, had an idea and wanted to build a future in this country.  I have seen many such businesses struggle with it.<\/p>  <p>  The overarching theme I am getting from constituents is that there is confusion over the guidelines and that is what we need to get right.  There is fear around how they can continue to open up and close down.  That is what happened many of the businesses that have been in contact with me.  I will mention as an example a caf&eacute; which is right next door to a bookies.  The caf&eacute; is closed to people inside.  They have tables outside to try and keep the business going and they offer a takeaway service, but the bookies next door has virtually no guidelines or rules.  Up to 30 people are allowed in depending on the size.  There are no names being taken.  There is no rule on how long the customers can remain within.  Two businesses are operating side by side under the same guidelines but there is confusion about why in one case, customers can stay all day if they wish because there are no rules to say that they cannot and in the other case, customers cannot even walk in the front door and have to stay outside.  People are looking for clarity and an understanding of where they need to be.  That is where we need to be in relation to moving forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100025#Y00300","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1601557500,"counter":263,"content":"<p>There are two issues I want to raise with the Minister.  I will be as brief as I can.  The first is in relation to Cork.  There is little other talk than concern around the potential move to level 3.<\/p> <p> There is also the very serious situation in hospitals.  Dr. Ronan Boland told Claire Byrne's show on Tuesday that there were just three acute beds left between the Mercy University Hospital and Cork University Hospital, CUH, to treat any acute case that might arise among Cork's 500,000 people.  Yesterday, the Mercy hospital said that patients should seek care elsewhere due to the pressure on the system.  It is clear there is a particular issue regarding hospital beds in Cork.  Currently, there are issues with regard to community hospitals and issues like that, which I know have been discussed in other areas, and that due to the pressures they may not be admitting additional patients.  Can we look at that with a view to resolving some of those issues, even at a later stage, because beds in community hospitals and step-down beds relieve the pressure on acute hospitals?  Whatever the case, we need to find additional capacity in hospitals in Cork.<\/p> <p> The other issue I want to raise is that schools are open.  I welcome that and give credit to the people involved in that, including many people in the Department and the Minister, but we need a specific plan to keep the schools open.  The Minister knows that teachers and school staff are very concerned about the difficulty with regard to social distancing.  We have 1,300 schools in the State with classes of more than 30 children.  There is a need for a significant investment to fund and deliver additional space and the staff required for them.  We need additional space to ensure that schools can adhere to social distancing and safety for the children, the school staff and everyone connected to the schools because there is a great deal of concern and it needs to be addressed.  There are issues around communication also.  I have corresponded with the Minister on that but it needs to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100025#Y00400","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601558100,"counter":265,"content":"<p>At the outset I commend Deputy Lahart on an excellent, thought-provoking and challenging contribution.  It was really good and very moving.  There was so much in it and I hope his Government colleagues were listening because there are major issues about loss in many different ways, the real fear that that will engender anger and the absolute need for people to be given hope.  I want to thank the Deputy for that.  I believe his contribution stopped many people in their tracks and made us think.<\/p>  <p>  I have a few points to make.  The Minister referred to this document as a roadmap.  He is probably the only one here referring to it as a roadmap.  It is generally referred to as a plan.  The previous document we had was a roadmap going from stage to stage.  This is a plan and it is more accurately described as a framework because it sets out a structure or framework where we can see that if we meet certain unspecified criteria in terms of danger we will move to the next level.  It is helpful from that point of view and, hopefully, people will become more familiar with it and motivated to pull together in order to go down the levels.<\/p>  <p>  I have to say that this is not a strategy; I have said that already to the Taoiseach.  I am not sure at this stage, seven months into the Covid-19 pandemic, exactly what is the strategy.  It is not clear to me and I believe it is not clear to many people.  That is critical to keeping people with the Minister.  What we have done is concentrated, supposedly, on having a very good testing and tracing system.  That has been a patchy experience.  Ultimately, however, the approach that is being taken is that every time there is an upsurge there is a lockdown.  That is not a sustainable strategy by any means, not least for business, but for everybody in living their lives.  I ask the Minister again to ensure that consideration is given to suggested strategies and learning, in particular, from the experience in other countries.  There are many elements in terms of what we should be doing to try to minimise the incidence of Covid-19.  There are many things we are ignoring in that regard, and I will come to them shortly, but it must be to come as close as possible to eliminating the virus.  People talk about zero Covid-19.  Those same people are saying that the aim should be at least zero.  By doing that we identify all of the high-risk areas and then take action on those.  That does need to be the approach but there needs to be at least debate on what is the best strategy and the pros and cons of different approaches.  That debate has not taken place.<\/p>  <p>  The second point I would make is that messaging is key in terms of keeping the public with the Minister.  The launch of this document was a missed opportunity; we have said a good bit about that.  It was a time when people were listening in but the messages were very unclear and confused.  That was a missed opportunity but we now need to make up for that.  The Taoiseach mentioned a couple of weeks ago the possibility of using influencers.  I thought that was a very good idea and I suggested that it would have our support.  It is not just about influencers on social media for young people.  It is about influencing all different categories of people, including those older and middle-aged, people with different interests, sports people, people with an interest in music and different ethnic groups.  The message needs to be tailored to those different cohorts.  We should be using influencers because with all due respect, many people have switched off watching the standard six o'clock news or reading the broadsheets.  People access their news or information on different platforms and in different media and we need to get to people through those different media by using people to whom those different cohorts will listen.  What is happening about that?  We have been talking about it for a long time.<\/p>  <p>  The next point I would make is on decision-making.  NPHET has very significant power.  It is making major decisions that are affecting every part of our lives and our country.  I said a long time ago that we needed to broaden out the decision-making and that we needed a task force that drew expertise from different areas.  It is regrettable we did not do that.  We need to have people who understand sport, business, logistics and travel in there who also have an expertise in risk assessment because every aspect of our lives carries risk in respect of Covid-19.  It is a matter of assessing the level of that risk and then balancing that risk.  In the absence of that kind of expertise, there is an element of guesswork and closing down everything is not sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  Also in terms of the decision-making, I find it very hard to understand the reason the Opposition has been completely excluded from any kind of debate, and I am talking about engaging debate, not shouting across the floor of the D&aacute;il.  I am talking about bringing people into a room and looking at different aspects of it.  As the Minister knows, there have been hardly any briefings since this Government took office.  That is a big mistake.  Party leaders and spokespersons want to be involved in that.  We have legitimate questions and proposals to make and there should be a forum established.  The Taoiseach said two weeks ago that he would give consideration to that.  We have heard nothing since.<\/p>  <p>  It is absolutely essential that the 14-day tracing back happens.  On travel, and I will talk more to the Minister about this later, I refer to the example that was given at the briefing last night of two people who had been away coming back, mixing with others and spreading the virus to 30 other people.  We have to go back to the source.  I take it those people were abroad.  It would be very interesting to know where they were but when we look at the figures of people coming into the country at the ports and airports, effectively, there is no oversight or monitoring of where the people have been or what they do when they come back.  That is a glaring omission in terms of any approach to tackling this virus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100026#Z00200","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1601558100,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Shortall.

The Minister, his Department and, importantly, the very many front-line HSE staff are doing a great job in grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic, which it now appears we will be co-existing with for some time to come.  Covid-19 has thrown a major curveball at this country.  Ways of life have changed utterly, and possibly forever, and politically we are now dealing with very real and deep issues in our constituencies and communities.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to bring public orthodontic and dental care to the Minister's attention.  With up to 40% of HSE community dental staff currently redeployed to help with contact tracing and testing, there is a backlog of those waiting on public lists for essential treatments.  Those who can afford private care to short-circuit that delay are doing so but at great personal cost.  I ask the Minister to propose at Cabinet some form of enhanced tax rebate for parents who ordinarily would have brought their child to the public dentist or orthodontist but these days are paying for private treatment.<\/p> <p> The next issue I wish to raise concerns Covid outbreaks in schools.  It was great to see 1 million students return to school last month.  The reopening-of-schools roadmap has been one of the major successes of this Government.  The Irish Primary Principals&rsquo; Network has a major concern, however.  When there is a suspected or confirmed case of Covid in a school, the principal seeks advice from the HSE as to what actions he or she should take.  The HSE, at that moment, effectively takes over the management and communication of the event, and the principal defers functions to it.  Ideally, the HSE would communicate rapidly and clearly but, in some cases of which I am aware, it has taken up to 24 hours for the communication to filter out from the HSE.  In that 24-hour period, the principal is effectively gagged.  There may be a member of staff with an acute underlying health problem or living at home with an elderly or high-risk parent but the principal is prevented from having a cautionary word with his or her colleagues.  I ask the Minister to take this up with HSE.  We cannot have principals stewing and stressing over having knowledge of a Covid case in their schools without having the sanction to inform their staff.<\/p> <p> I welcome the fact that the Government's winter plan will inject unprecedented support into our health system this winter.  This &euro;600 million will definitely help to resource our health system better over the very tough months ahead.  The funding, while welcome as a medium-term measure, does not fully address the challenges that we in Clare and the wider mid-west region face in terms of hospital care.  Before Covid hit this country, University Hospital Limerick was consistently the worst off hospital in terms of trolley numbers.  The much-needed fix here is very obvious; it lies in increased funding and supports for the other hospitals of the region, namely Ennis General Hospital and Nenagh and St. John's hospitals.  I am glad the programme for Government commits to hiring more consultants but I would like to know the strategy that exists to send some of them west of the Shannon.  That is certainly a concern we have in Clare.<\/p> <p> I wish to address the issue of maternity hospitals.  Generally speaking, being pregnant is a medical condition, not an illness.  Most women attending for scans or antenatal appointments are in good health.  On this basis, maternity hospitals need to be considered to be somewhat different from other hospitals.  I hope public health guidance will change in the quickest time possible so more men can attend appointments with their partner or spouse.  I was fortunate to be able to attend appointments with my wife when our three children were expected.  Some leave the room full of jubilation and butterflies in the stomach but, for those who get bad news in the scanning room, it can be a devastating moment and people need considerable support.  Either way, it is a landmark moment in someone's life and the expectant mother needs to be fully supported.  I hope current arrangements can be revisited urgently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100026#Z00400","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601558700,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the roadmap.  I will start simply by echoing the statements of other Members on the direction of the roadmap regarding businesses closing, reopening and then closing again and the long-term consequences not only for our economy but also for those who work in the businesses and industries that have been devastated over recent months.  As we know and have accepted at this stage, we will be living with Covid for well in excess of 12 months, if not more.  Even if a vaccination or feasible treatment is developed in the next few months, it will probably take 12 to 18 months to roll it out to the country.  We have to take that on board.<\/p>  <p>  I want to focus primarily on mental health, fatigue associated with Covid, messaging and the lack of positivity, among citizens as opposed to the State, regarding how well we as a country have managed to deal with this virus.  In spring, there were camaraderie and togetherness in communities throughout the country, with people working together to help the vulnerable, including the elderly and the immunocompromised.  The exceptional weather probably helped to raise people's spirits but we are now approaching the winter, when we will be facing 14 or 15 hours of darkness per day.  In the context of mental health, the manner in which people are being bombarded with information, often negative, in the guise of necessary information is problematic.  NPHET and the Minister need to spend a little more time talking about the fact that citizens in general have done exceptional work in stepping away from one another and taking the responsible steps of wearing a mask, washing hands and respecting cough etiquette.<\/p>  <p>  To echo the comments of the previous speaker, it is problematic when the media, to a certain extent, and others regard younger people or other groups as the cause of a resurgence of Covid-19.  We are all in this together, or so we have been saying for the past seven months.  We have to take responsibility.  The scenes from Galway over the past couple of days really make one's heart sink.  The scenes in nearly every village and town I visited in the past few months would make one's heart sink.<\/p>  <p>  To be constructive, however, I want to reiterate what I have said to the Minister.  In fairness to him, he has already implemented some of the requests made of him regarding the provision of information allowing people to see where there is Covid in their community.  Most people - 1.8 million, in fact - have a Covid app that allows NPHET to communicate directly to them.  That app and the opportunity it presents are not being used properly by NPHET.  There is an opportunity to convey information directly to people about localised outbreaks and what people could and should be doing to prevent them.  I have not yet seen what I suggest and it is critical that we now take that step.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100027#AA00200","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1601558700,"counter":270,"content":"<p>Irish people are defined by their music, arts and culture.  We thrive on this identity not only domestically but right across the globe.  The arts, however, have been decimated by this pandemic and we must rebuild them.  We can start small by allowing dance classes to return.  We know that dancing bolsters physical and mental health.  It improves posture and flexibility.  It lifts our mood and it eases our anxiety.  For children, dance classes offer so much more than just dance.  They provide an opportunity to make friends, learn a new skill and, most important, build confidence.  Kids in my area - Lucan and the rest of Dublin Mid-West - are desperately missing their Dancity classes, their Irish dancing classes and the beats of Zumba.  Dancing is a fun activity that sharpens the mind, increases strength and builds social bonds.<\/p>  <p>  For older people, dance classes may be the highlight of the week but, owing to Covid, they can no longer rely on that social outlet.  Loneliness is often described as being more detrimental to older people's health than physical illness but not every older person wants to play bridge, bingo or bowls.  Some want to dance.  Let us face it: human beings of all ages, cultures, religions and countries all love to dance.  Dance, whether it is Irish dancing or the Maori haka, is a part of life.<\/p>  <p>  While many of us have got used to dancing in our sitting rooms during lockdown, there is nowhere better to dance than at a live gig.  The live entertainment industry is bursting with talent.  It is an industry that has offered employment to everyone from sound engineers and roadies to musicians and dancers.  All are real people and all are missing their income and outlet right now.  All are in need of hope right now.  The Minister has the opportunity to give them hope.  We have plenty of opportunities to facilitate smaller, more intimate crowds in large venues using social distancing.  We have the ability to tweak the pandemic unemployment payment rules so people can do the odd gig or resurrect their dance class without losing the payment that has become a lifeline for them.  Let us reignite the arts by thinking outside the box and by moving outside our silos.<\/p>  <p>  Music and dance are so much more than jobs or hobbies; they are passions.  I do not know one artist who would not jump at the chance to play to a crowd again, no matter how small.  They live for performing and so does the next generation of artists and dancers, who should be preparing for their Christmas concert right now.  We must offer them hope and trust so we can get dance back in our legs, music back in our ears and creativity back flowing in our veins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100027#AA00300","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1601559300,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Higgins for that uplifting contribution.

Front-line staff are at burnout and cannot continue to work overtime in understaffed conditions.  This is not safe or fair to the staff or the patients they care for.  Trolleys line the corridors and there is not enough staff to look after patients.  Staff are being moved from one area to another.  I welcome that extra capacity has been provided, as in the case of Mayo, in terms of the stepping down of patients from Mayo University Hospital to the Sacred Heart home, but extra staff are also needed and nobody seems to understand that.<\/p>  <p>  There is also an issue around communication with staff.  Decisions are being made without staff being consulted.  We do not need reports and expertise to know of the issues in our health services.  We need only to listen to the front-line staff.

Unless managers listen to the front-line staff, I fear for what is going to happen this winter.<\/p>  <p>  It is only 1 October and in Mayo there are already trolleys lining the hospital corridors.  There will be many more trolleys lining those corridors and not enough staff even to look after patients in the corridors.  This is a serious situation.  Staff tell me that every night they go into work they do not know where they are going, who will be left with them or where they are going to be.  Emergency meetings are happening without them.  They are being treated like pawns on a chessboard in terms of trying to deal with a really serious situation.  We want people to live with Covid, we do not people to die from it.  Many nurses are in fear of losing their registration because of the stress that they are under and the mistakes that they may make.

We all appreciate that this framework was needed and that it is a roadmap for living with the virus over the coming months.  However, it quickly became clear that the announcement was not as clear as was hoped.  From day one, we heard Dublin was being placed on a type of level 2.5.  It has since moved to level 3.5 or thereabouts.  All of us in this House appreciate the need for this type of roadmap as we learn to live with the virus.  While this framework reduces the numbers of people permitted to attend weddings and sports events, there is no mention of reduced class sizes in our schools.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has been forced to extend the deadline for new applicants to the pandemic unemployment payment.  It must be accepted that this payment and other wage supports need to be secured for the foreseeable future while there is a possibility of rolling lockdowns and closure of businesses.  There has been no mention of people with disabilities in these guidelines.  These people are being left behind by the Government in terms of reduced capacity in our care centres and reduced respite services.  Prior to Covid, people with disabilities were attending classes five days per week.  Many of them have seen either a reduction in the number of days or hours that they can attend, or both in some cases.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding visitation rights in our hospitals and care homes, I appreciate that the framework allows for visits across the health care system, and I particularly welcome that it allows for visits on compassionate grounds.  We need to ensure that this continues as we cannot underestimate the need for family support for people at the start of life and at the end of life.  As a mother of five children, I had the experience of having my fourth child completely on my own.  Thankfully, everything went okay.  I cannot imagine how that experience would have been or is for any woman left completely on her own in a clinical environment.<\/p>  <p>  The announcement of this roadmap was welcomed but it only ever appeared to give a broad outline of the procedures by which we are to live.  The specifics of it were never detailed.  For example, I have heard from principals of schools in Clare that they are winging the guidelines, with some of them carrying out temperature checks and others not doing so.  They feel that they are burdened with ensuring that the guidelines are being adhered to.  The messaging around the guidelines has not been clear, concise or coherent.

The message that we are all in this together, which underpinned the huge efforts that people made in the early stage of the pandemic, has been blown out the window by the Government.  Day in and day out young people are being lectured about their behaviour or supposedly endangering public health because of family gatherings or other gatherings in their homes.  They are being berated yet it is deemed disproportionate to ask a judge of the Supreme Court who attended a party to resign.

The pandemic unemployment payment is being cut as these people face into further restrictions and the likelihood for many of their jobs and income being severely reduced for the foreseeable.  At the same time, Ministers of State are given shocking pay increases on already excessive salaries and politicians are to receive pay increases.  All of this does nothing to underpin the solidarity that we need to face the threat of Covid-19.

There are those whom one might describe as the Covid hawks, who want zero tolerance and maximum restrictions.  On the other hand, there are those who might not quite be calling for herd immunity but who are seeking to tip the balance towards living with the virus more than public health restrictions allow.  My view is that the Government has treaded a middle course between the two in dealing with the pandemic.  It has sought to protect lives and livelihoods in equal measure.  In many ways, we have protected the most vulnerable in society from this virus, and the financial intervention for those who are working and not working has been unprecedented.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the plan.  It helps us look forward for the next six to nine months.  The strategy is to suppress the virus.  It is a public health-led plan which involves acting quickly and locally and targeting the spread of the virus to protect lives, health services, schools, colleges and jobs.  It has easily understood geographical boundaries for restrictions and easily understood levels of restriction.  Each level is not a judgment on how a particular sector is operating or even how safe that activity is.  Instead, it is a judgment on how that activity increases discretionary social contact or decreases it.  That is the guiding light in this plan.  That is the coherence and beauty of the plan.<\/p>  <p>  Undoubtedly, this virus has had a massive impact on mental health.  Sport is a great outlet to help deal with that.  I understand the restrictions, but I call on the Minister to review the restrictions in level 3 for fitness classes, which I believe can be meticulously balanced for fitness classes that help mental health and have safe regimes.  I have been contacted by entrepreneurs who have invested in sport and business in my local community.  They are on their knees.  I believe we can help them while still protecting against the virus.  We can also do the same regarding sports matches without spectators for children.  I call on Sport Ireland to have a level playing field in how it governs restrictions for all sports codes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100029#CC00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1601559900,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication by the Government of the roadmap for living with Covid-19.  It is a valuable contribution to the debate.  It is also a valuable contribution to the public in terms of how to deal with this crisis.  I also welcome what the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, said earlier, that in this chapter of Covid-19 the State is seeking to open up the country while, at the same time, trying to suppress the virus.  It is important that Members of the House discuss this issue and how the country should propose to deal with it.<\/p>  <p>  Many issues must be taken into account when deciding, as a society, how to respond to the pandemic.  Obviously, public health must predominate, but other factors must be taken into account as well, such as mental health, particularly of younger people, and the economic impact of the restrictions on society.  I believe we probably have three options, and the Government has done well in identifying the roadmap it is setting out in the Covid-19 plan.  I do not have great wisdom on this matter.  No Member of the House is absolutely sure what the correct answer is.  Although this is not an unprecedented event, it is an extraordinary one.  Some individuals advocate that we should take the elimination route.  I have great respect for the individuals who advocate that, but I am concerned about how attainable it is.  When one sees how this virus is spreading around the world and sees its spread in Ireland in light of the restrictions we have been imposing for six months, my opinion, and I could be wrong, is that we will not be able to eliminate the virus from this country in the short term.<\/p>  <p>  A second option is to reduce human activity to a considerable degree in the hope that the reduction will result in a reduction in the case load of the virus and consequent deaths.  We are seeking to do that in a measured way under the Government, but we must also recognise there are consequences to that.  Deputy McAuliffe mentioned the impact it is having on sport.  For the life of me I cannot understand why we cannot let children play matches.  One of the great public health measures for children is to enable them to get involved in sport.  What we learn from this pandemic and our reaction to it is that our response in any area is not risk-free.  There is no risk-free response we can take to this virus.  I am concerned about reducing human activity and if we are going from one level up to another and down again.  It is going to have a consequential impact on mental health and other public health issues.  There are other public health issues facing the country, be it mental health, cancer or heart disease.  All are very serious, and that is not in any way denigrating the seriousness of Covid-19 as a disease and pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  A third option is what the Government has set out, which is trying to live with Covid-19 as best we can while suppressing it.  That is the approach we have adopted.  We must ensure that it is a measured approach.  Obviously, it will have consequences for people if it is the case that we are moving up levels all the time.  As time goes on, we will be able to see what the impact is of moving up a level and whether it will simply reduce the numbers in the short term and when we go from the higher level to a lower level the numbers return again.  We are all learning as this develops and we need to keep a close eye on it.<\/p>  <p>  We should not try to fool ourselves into believing that we can deal with this pandemic as though it is some other political issue such as housing, homelessness or unemployment.<\/p> <p>The language we use in respect of it is that we are going to fight this.  I hear people say we are going to crush it into the ground.  I do not think we are ever going to be able to do that.  We need to recognise that around the world they have tried to control this virus through coercion, regulation and law.  Regrettably, that approach has not succeeded yet.  That does not mean it will not succeed and I am not advocating that we go down the route of complete libertarianism where there is no regulation.  There has to be strict regulation in respect of it.  However, we need to recognise that where coercion and regulation have been used around the world, to date they have not succeeded.  I know people who disagree and refer to China, Taiwan and New Zealand.  Certainly they are at present in a different, much better position than Ireland although I am sceptical as to what is the actual position in China.  In other countries around the world, particularly in Europe, we can see that notwithstanding the enormous efforts that have been made by societies and countries to try to ensure that we get on top of this pandemic, as the restrictions have been lifted the numbers have inevitably risen.  The reason that has happened is that we are social animals.  We have to cut down on our sociability but we made a decision centuries ago that we were going to live proximate to other humans.  That is what cities and large towns are about.  It is what schools and collective community activity are about.  It is very difficult to tell people to pull away from that proximity to other humans.  It is a huge ask.  We have done extremely well in this country to date and we should recognise that.  It is difficult.<\/p> <p> Deputy McAuliffe spoke about sports and others have spoken about young people.  I have spoken probably too much about young people.  There are two groups that have suffered very much from this.  One is young people and the other is the elderly, who have been put in a position in their lives where they are very fearful about going out and meeting younger persons and their relatives.  I suppose they have to be very careful.  NPHET was before the Covid-19 committee yesterday and gave us some very valuable information.  The median age of the 1,803 people who have died to date is in the late 80s.  Obviously elderly people need to be particularly careful.  I know it is a dangerous disease that affects everyone but people who are elderly need to be particularly careful, especially if they have underlying conditions.  The roadmap is a good map.  We need to give it time.  We need to listen to the public health advice we are being given.  However, we also need to recognise that we cannot close our minds to the societal and economic impacts, the other public health impacts and the mental health impacts of the restrictions.  We can see the consequences of the pandemic by looking at the tragic figures representing those who have died in Ireland and around the world.  What we cannot see are the repercussions of the restrictions around the world and here.

However, the public health guidelines for team sports are very unclear, as Deputy McAuliffe mentioned.  There is much confusion and unanswered questions for clubs playing soccer.  I raised this issue with the Taoiseach yesterday and his sidestep was very impressive but that was all.  I got no real clarity.  Different sporting organisations are interpreting the rules differently.  It is possible to play or train with a rugby or GAA club but not a soccer club.  St. Pat's CYFC women's team cannot play their matches but the same players can play for their GAA club.  Juvenile soccer players cannot train with their clubs unless they are part of the elite structure yet the same kids can train with their rugby or GAA teams.  These examples are replicated across Dublin to Aungier Celtic, Liffey Wanderers, Kilbarrack and Clontarf.  Right across Dublin clubs are being excluded from playing their sport.  The Government has taken a back seat on this and has only added to the lack of clarity around public health rules for national sporting organisations.  The wording of the guidelines is not clear enough.  If it was, all sports would be treated equally.  The Government needs to give clear guidance to sports organisations.  Why can amateur GAA sports clubs and amateur rugby clubs play while amateur soccer is excluded?  No one is willing to answer this question.  Playing sports should be open to everybody.  Thousands of kids are missing out on football and it is impacting on their mental health.  Covid does not attack amateur soccer players and leave amateur GAA and rugby players alone.  All sports clubs, whether rugby, soccer, GAA or hockey, should be open or closed at the same time.  All sports must be treated equally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100030#DD00200","speaker":"1555"},{"type":"speech","time":1601560500,"counter":282,"content":"<p>Today is International Day of Older Persons, a group of people who have been left behind in the many roadmap announcements over the past few months.  I have asked on numerous occasions in this House that the Government consider older people when formulating plans and that it consider those who have different abilities.  We cannot continue to ask them to live like hermits.  We need a balance between physical and mental health.  They need to be allowed to have a quality of life.  Day care centres need to reopen.  They are an invaluable service and we should be investing in them.  A lady called into my office the day after the roadmap for living with Covid-19 was announced.  Her words to me were very telling.  She said that if people were not confused, they were not paying attention.  I ask the Minister of State to save our money, ditch the PR firm and talk to the National Adult Literacy Agency for advice on delivering messages in plain and easy to understand language.  On this International Day of Older Persons I commend all groups working with older people on ensuring they have an improved quality of life and that their voices are heard at the highest level.  I have met many of them and hope to meet others over the next few weeks.  It will most likely be online due to the current restrictions.  I would particularly like to commend my former volunteering colleagues in the Vincent's shops in Kilcullen and Athy.  Many of the older volunteers were the backbone of these important fundraising outlets.  I urge everyone to keep donating and purchasing from these charity shops.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100030#DD00300","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1601560500,"counter":283,"content":"<p>There is no doubt that we have seen unprecedented times over the past seven months and unfortunately we continue to experience them.  There was no previous roadmap to deal with Covid, which makes our task all the more challenging.  I welcome the publication of the Government's plan to deal with the virus over the coming six to nine months.  It is important that we as public representatives work together to ensure that correct decisions are made on how to safeguard the people of this country first and the economy second.  At all times the health and safety of our people must take absolute priority over everything else.  This virus does not distinguish based on age, gender, health or vulnerability.  It simply looks for the next victim regardless.  Unfortunately I fear we will be living with this disease for the foreseeable future and as such we need to plan for this scenario.  There was no roadmap for dealing with a pandemic like Covid.  However, we know that we as individuals have the power to control this virus by following the health guidelines.  It is important that this message is constantly given and that the public is made aware of the importance of it.  I feel that over the past couple of months this message was lost and the public let its guard down.  As a result, the virus has started to take hold.  The public health measures must be at the front of any campaign.  Even in this House we must reiterate their importance.  These measures include washing our hands properly and regularly; wearing face coverings on public transport and in shops, shopping centres and all indoor settings where social distancing is difficult to achieve; having good coughing and sneezing etiquette; always maintaining social distance; reducing social interactions; working remotely where possible; isolating immediately and contacting our GP if we experience any symptoms; and downloading the Covid tracker app.<\/p> <p>If we, as a group of people, can observe these actions then there is no doubt we can control this virus and protect the most vulnerable in our society.<\/p> <p> The next area we need to look at is protecting our economy.  Without a functioning economy we will not be able to maintain our public services.  I welcome the supports put in place for businesses already but certain sectors will need more support than others.  The hospitality sector has been badly affected and we must ensure every support is given to ensure its survival.  This sector employs a great number of people and we must protect their jobs.  The tourism sector in my constituency has been badly affected.  The north of the county, including the Carlingford and Cooley region, has seen the number of tourists greatly reduced and the knock-on effect has been felt by many businesses there.<\/p> <p> We must ensure at all costs that our businesses are given every opportunity to survive.  We will hear many people say we cannot afford to keep supporting the economy in the way we have.  My view, however, is that we cannot afford not support them.  If businesses are allowed to fail then they are gone; jobs are lost forever.  This will be a greater cost to the economy.<\/p> <p> Over the past number of weeks, the number of incidences of Covid-19 in my constituency increased to alarming levels.  This was particularly true for the north of the county.  One measure we need to look at is restricting cross-Border travel to essential travel only.  I do not advocate closing the Border but we need to address the issue of large Covid-19 numbers along this area.  Restricting travel to essential travel, as happened in Dublin, will probably help to control the numbers.  <\/p> <p> Another issue is that of the mental health of younger generations during the pandemic.  From working with many of our younger generations I know of the pressure this pandemic has brought on them both emotionally and physically.  We must be able to reach out to them and offer real support.<\/p> <p> Finally, I wish to put on the record my support for the Government in its efforts to beat this virus and urge all Deputies from all sides of the House to work together in this regard.  We must protect the most vulnerable in our society and help them at the most critical time.  We must offer hope to everyone that there is an end to this pandemic and that everyone working together will defeat this virus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100030#DD00400","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601561100,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I call Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.

It is a significant threat to life and health and to the country.  We need to do all we can to make sure we reduce the numbers and be careful and cautious.  I hear both sides of the debate about this on a regular basis.  The truth of the matter is that nobody knows what will happen in the future with regard to Covid-19 so we need to be careful.<\/p>  <p>  It is an absolute disgrace that the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, did not see fit to remain in this Chamber to listen to Deputies from all sides with regard to the most serious issue that is happening in our country.  Right now, there is absolutely no democratic accountability for the significant decisions being made in this country.  We have a society where businesses are being massacred.  Hundreds of thousands of people are being pushed into poverty and significant sections of our health service are being decommissioned from their normal activities and reorientated.<\/p>  <p>  Today, 480 people got cancer and 24 people died of cancer.  Today, approximately 27 people will die from heart disease and a similar number will die from a stroke.  That number is roughly the same as the entire number of people who died from Covid-19 last month.  I do not say that one is more equal than others.  All those deaths deserve an equal response from the State to protect those lives but they are not getting it.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke to a doctor recently who told me that, thankfully, none of his patients had died from Covid-19.  He had, however, three cancer patients.  All had delayed diagnosis and delayed treatments and he was of the view that their lives were lost.  I spoke to another doctor recently who has a patient with serious heart disease who has been waiting for treatment since last April.  He has been told he will not get it until next year as a result of this.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health has stated that between 20% and 50% of the capacity of the health service has been taken out from normal serves and reoriented towards Covid-19.  These serious decisions need to be teased out, discussed and debated.  The truth of the matter is that I asked the previous Minister for Health what research has been undertaken by the State regarding the level of mortality and morbidity in all the other elements of society.<\/p>  <p>  Right now, 200,000 women are affected by the cancer screening backlog in this country.  The previous and current Minister have admitted to me that no research has carried out at all by the State with regard to the cost of the current plan.  When we try to ask questions of the decision-makers - NPHET, which is the most powerful organisation in the country at the moment - we are not allowed.  I know of Deputies who must ask journalists to ask NPHET questions about what is happening in the country at the moment.  We are having a debate at a time when the Covid committee has been wrapped up and the Minister for Health will not bother his arse to sit in this Chamber and answer questions from Deputies.  It is an absolute disgrace.  Perhaps he has a busy timetable where he has to be away somewhere else and that is fine.  It should, however, have been possible to schedule Deputies' engagement with the Minister for Health in some way that we could ask questions and give our views.<\/p>  <p>  This is a serious illness and we need to do our best to reduce the numbers.  NPHET has an important job, and I believe it is doing the best it can, but its terms of reference are narrow.  Our terms of reference as a D&aacute;il and as a parliament of the people is to deal with all the issues in society.  We need to make sure that cancer, heart disease, stroke and mental health patients are not put to the back of the queue.  We need to make sure businesses can operate at some level and that workers and children are not pushed into poverty.  We need to be able to live with this illness.  To do that, we need to be able to make decisions collectively as a D&aacute;il.  That right, which the people gave us when they democratically elected us back in February, has been taken away from us and it is absolutely wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100031#EE00300","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1601561100,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I ask Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n to withdraw the unparliamentary language.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100031#EE00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1601561100,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I withdraw the unparliamentary language but it is an absolute disgrace that the Minister is not here.

I mention that today is international older people's day and fair play to them.  They have done everything they could and have stuck by the guidelines.  They have done their best and we need to congratulate them.<\/p>  <p>  On Tuesday at the Covid committee I asked if there was an active recruitment campaign for a dedicated test and trace workforce and I was told there was.  However, I was contacted by someone who tried to apply for such a position and he was told the recruitment was internal.  Are we recruiting?  Who are we recruiting?  What is the timescale on recruiting?  It is vital that we employ those who returned to answer Ireland's call and are now unemployed.  It is vital that we recruit people with several languages.  We are a multinational country and we cannot use language barriers as an excuse for not tracing properly.<\/p>  <p>  We need to get in front of Covid-19 and not continue to react to it.  There may still be things we do not know but we have learned an awful lot in the last seven months.  I repeat that the HSE staff and all those front-line services, our advisers and all the public health officials have done a tremendous job so let us do what we must and learn what we must.  It is a learning curve.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to talk about schools.  With regard to school cases, a total of 4,328 children and teachers have been tested for Covid-19.<\/p> <p>The rate of positive results in schools has been 1.9%.  If we are to live with Covid, how are we to reduce the number of negative tests and target more accurately?  I would be very careful and wary of that.

Whether it is mentally or physically, we all need a proper roadmap in the sense that we know there are supports available for people who need mental health services and other services.<\/p> <p> With all the talk about living with Covid, we seem to have forgotten the other major disruption in our lives, which also has a relationship to our food industry and supply, and that is Brexit.

This document is a useful guide for business planning and provides hope for future economic recovery.  The onus is on us as parliamentarians to display leadership and hope.  It is more important than ever that we focus on the language of economic recovery.  In times such as this, a rising tide lifts all boats.<\/p>  <p>  This document and the Return to Work Safely Protocol will be fundamental documents in the months ahead for employers and their staff as we adapt to the challenges presented by the pandemic.  Many of my constituents in Mayo ask when things will return to normal.  While none of us can definitively answer that, I take solace in the roadmap's plans for resuming public service delivery as well as building economic and community resilience.<\/p>  <p>  The importance of our rural post offices is not covered in the roadmap document.  They are facing problems significantly compounded by Covid-19.  Post offices in Mayo, from Binghamstown to Shrule, and from Louisburgh to Bunnyconnellan, are often the only places where Mayo residents engage with public services.  Having a strong network of local post offices, thereby avoiding people having to travel to large urban centres, is more important now than ever.  Many of us have spoken about the importance of our older people being able to remain connected during the Covid-19 era, and our post offices play an important role in that.<\/p>  <p>  The roadmap refers to the European Commission's plan to promote a common approach to travel restrictions and movement within the EU.  Something similar should be done with the common travel area.  Ideally both plans should be aligned as much as possible.  Such a move would greatly benefit airports such as Ireland West Airport Knock as all its flights operate to the UK and EU countries.<\/p>  <p>  I particularly welcome the focus on community well-being, including mental health support and supports to encourage community working.  Many community organisations will need support to resume as close as possible to normal services.  I note the commitment to support local community development committees in assisting local community and voluntary groups to adapt their operations to fit into the new Covid-19 reality.  However, I hope the Minister of State will be able to provide further details on such supports for community well-being.  Many voluntary organisations provided useful services in pre-Covid times and their work is now critical in this pandemic.  I especially think of Castlebar voluntary social services, including the meals on wheels service, which many older people rely on as they limit their movements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100032#FF00200","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speech","time":1601561700,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his attendance earlier today and for the time he spent at the Covid committee along with members of NPHET yesterday.  We had a frank and open discussion, including suggestions from members for how we might further engage with the public.  As has been said in this session and in others, we are in uncharted waters.  Nobody has the right answer.  We are learning as we go.  It is important to listen to suggestions and take them on board.  We all need to work together.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome this opportunity to discuss the Government's resilience and recovery plan, the Roadmap for Living with Covid-19.  I note that the national framework is built on three pillars: healthy people, strong businesses and resilient communities.  I will touch on those in the time I have.  With the roadmap, there is a doubling of the public health workforce and the publication of the guidance on visits to long-term residential care.  The doubling of the public health workforce is critical because we need more staff there.  I welcome that the recruitment is under way.  On the guidance on the long-term residential care, many if not all of us have had contact from constituents who have loved ones in nursing homes.  They want an easing of restrictions so that they can visit them.  I welcome that that is contained in the plan.  It gives a clear roadmap for those families who wish to visit loved ones in residential care settings.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the Government will be able to develop an all-island response, both North and South.  I know the acting CMO here in the Republic is in discussions with his counterpart in the North.  That is a very important part of any future plan.<\/p>  <p>  Care and assistance in our communities, which is one of the three pillars in the roadmap, is critical.  The local authorities are playing a crucial role in this.  As I have mentioned in the Chamber previously, the local authority community calls represent an essential part of engaging with those who are isolating or cocooning.  Volunteers in sports clubs and other groups have given their time to deliver groceries and medicines to people.  I also commend the library service which is delivering audiobooks and engaging with those who cannot or do not want to leave their homes.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the Government will take this on board.  As we work with this roadmap in the next six or nine months - it could be longer - we need to bear in mind outpatient appointments and screening services.  Many people with other ailments may be nervous of going into a hospital or healthcare setting.  It is very important to keep those services running as much as possible, irrespective of the level we are at.  It is equally important that partners and husbands are permitted to attend maternity appointments.  That issue needs to be dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier my colleagues spoke about sports.  While training is taking place and it is very important for children, it is critical for mental health.  The green ribbon campaign was launched today.  The two of them are part and parcel.<\/p>  <p>  I hope there will be improvements to the Covid app.  I suggested some improvements through the parliamentary question system and the Minister might take them on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100032#FF00300","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1601561700,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I register my disappointment and annoyance that the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has fled the Chamber again.  As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will know from being a Member of a smaller group speaking at the end, it is very annoying for the Minister always to run away.  This is a serious issue throughout the country.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, but the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, just disappeared and he has a habit of doing that.<\/p>  <p>  This is a very frustrating situation and above all our people need hope.  I compliment Deputy Lahart on his powerful speech earlier.  People need hope.  The demonising of students in Galway and the demonising of old people and the fear that has been peddled and portrayed on RT&Eacute; morning, noon and night are wrong.  I would love to know how much the local radio stations are getting for advertising.  I will be asking questions about that.  It is shocking.  We seem to want people frightened, wearing masks, cowering in corners and afraid to move.  It is shocking.  It is the wrong way to deal with it.<\/p>  <p>  Have we looked at European best practice or how issues work in Europe?  Based on OECD data, Denmark with a population of 5.8 million has had 27,464 cases, about 33% less than Ireland, and 650 deaths, about 70% less than Ireland.  Hungary with a population of 9.7 million, approximately twice Ireland's, has had 26,461 cases, about 67% less than Ireland, and 765 deaths, about 80% less than Ireland.  Finland with a population of 5.5 million has had 9,892 cases, more than 50% less than Ireland and 345 deaths, a staggering 80% less than Ireland.<\/p> <p>There is something wrong here.  We are manipulating the figures and I have evidence of this.  People have been in touch with me whose loved ones died and were recorded as Covid deaths although they had tests which were clear.  We need to get honest here and level with the people.  The people showed the meitheal spirit and did everything they were asked to, as did all of the GAA clubs, the community development associations and everybody else, and in that respect I want to salute again the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na community policing units in Cahir, Clonmel and all of County Tipperary.  However, mind games are being played now with the people and they are getting fed up with it or are already fed up with it because it is not good enough.<\/p> <p> As I said, before we start clapping ourselves on the back for a job well done, we need to have a national debate on why Ireland has a Covid-19 case rate so much higher than the three countries I mentioned.  Additionally, and perhaps more alarmingly, we have dramatically higher death rates than they do.  What can be learned from these comments?  I hope the Minister for Health and the Minister, Deputy Harris, are listening.  Has the Government been in touch with these countries to find out how we can improve?  Are we just cocooning here and saying we know best?  We have a bad history with the HSE.  The CMO, Dr. Tony Houlihan, is coming in back and I hope his wife is well but he has a bad history in the HSE with the cervical smear deaths and the death sentences perpetrated on women.  We have not got a great history on a plethora of issues.  Consider the waste on the national children's hospital and the scandals that went on.<\/p> <p> We need to discuss and scrutinise these numbers.  We cannot have a situation where anyone who speaks out or questions the system is shut up or sacked from senior positions, and that is what is happening.  One such individual who spoke out recently was Dr. Martin Feeley, the former clinical director of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.  He called for a debate and raised some concerns at the imposition of restrictions and the approach being taken several weeks ago.  What happened to him?  He was fired almost instantly.  He was sacked and it is not good enough and we have to ask why.  What kind of suppression are we trying to get here?  Is it going to be a complete communist state?  That is the way it is heading.<\/p> <p> Sections of the community have got nothing.  The elderly, the publicans and those over 66 have not got a penny in any payment whether they were bus drivers or business people or whatever.  Look at our only source of help, namely, artists and the creative and music industries.  They have been blackguarded and they are not getting a shilling.  Now the moratorium has been lifted from the banks and they can mercilessly take those people's houses, vans and equipment.  That is what is going to happen.  There is something sinister going on here and something rotten in the State of Ireland.<\/p> <p> Dr. Martin Feeley has since spoken out on the RT&Eacute; \"Prime Time\" programme this week and called for a full debate on the ongoing strategy and restrictions.  I support him in this call because I believe in democracy, including freedom of speech which we are suppressing too.  Dr. Feeley said the cost to the community, financially and socially, is enormous, as we know, and one of the difficulties with this is we cannot measure those costs.  We cannot.  It is international mental health day today or suicide awareness day.  I want the Minister of State to write this down because I want answers.  Has the collating of figures on self-harm and suicide been stopped?  I want a specific answer to that, please, and the Minister of State might take note of it.  It has been asked here before and I did not get an answer.  However, I can say, again according to Dr. Feeley, that most people are depressed and the country is depressed and this is why we need a debate on this.  We have no debate and discourse here.  There is no engagement with party and group leaders.  It has stopped.  The damage to our children, our youth, our mental health people and everything else is just enormous.  We must have meaningful debates and answers to questions, not a Minister who floats out, especially when I come in, because I will ask the questions without fear or favour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100032#FF00400","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601562300,"counter":302,"content":"<p>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on a point of information, which figures is the Deputy looking for?

Mention was made by other Deputies about people waiting for cancer smears, bowel screening and prostate cancer.  It is all stacking up and people are dying.  The figures were given of people dying from all the other ailments.  It is one every hour for cancer and 27 a day from stroke and heart disease.  There is no talk about it, and some of these are being put down as Covid deaths.<\/p>  <p>  I have one last question for the Minister of State.  One day the figures were corrected downward by 500 from about 1,700.  They were corrected by the HSE.  That was the day the T&aacute;naiste, then the Taoiseach, was out sunning himself in the park on the day before.

One overarching area where we could improve things is to make every effort we can when moving from one level to another to give businesses more notice.  The Minister of State knows as I do that many businesses have lost heavily because they only get 24 or 36 hours' notice.  People feel they are only back up and running again and the rug has been pulled.  It is not so much that the rug is pulled but the speed at which it is pulled and the uncertainty around the financial loss that many people experience.  While I understand Covid moves swiftly, I would make that general point first.<\/p>  <p>  Before I address the framework itself, I have a comment about some of the debate today.  There is a lot of debate about what the figures tell us about the second wave of Covid.  While every single death is a tragedy for the individual and their family, the argument is being made nonetheless that because deaths in August were 14 and September were 27, somehow the second wave is not as deadly because the ratio of infections compared with the number of deaths is less than it was back in April and May.  However, that misses the extremely important point that we are testing far more people now than we did in April and May, so any comparisons we make of figures have to be valid.  Otherwise conclusions that flow from them are simply invalid.<\/p>  <p>  The one thing we cannot do is lose control of this virus because we know what happens if we do.  I do not know how some people can have forgotten what happened in northern Italy, the scandal of people walking out of care homes in Spain and other countries and the terror that was New York.  Members may know the phrase \"it has not gone away\" and Covid has not.  People really need to be careful about what they are saying and the messages they are giving out.<\/p>  <p>  Many things have changed, however, and one area where we remain behind the curve is testing and subsequent tracing.  I am convinced we can do much better and we must do so if the Government's three pillars are to stand and its framework is to hold.  As the Minster of State knows, there are new tests on the market.  There is pilot PCR testing taking place where between ten and 20 people can be tested at a time.  If it comes back positive, all of these people have to be tested individually, but if it returns negative, then at least ten tests have been done in one go.  Given that the positive testing rate is around 2%, it means that kind of test statistically should work very well.  As such, if we can move forward with our testing and upgrade and update our regime, the pillars of the Government's roadmap will, as I said, be much more likely to remain in place and give us a fighting chance of living with Covid.  Otherwise we will be looking at looking at living at level 2 the odd time, but more likely level 3 to level 4.<\/p>  <p>  The Minster mentioned the three pillars and I will return to pillar 1 when we are discussing the winter plan later.  For the few minutes I have however, I want to concentrate on pillar 2.  I have said it before and will say it again, we need to increase the PUP to what it was.  This is a safety net for so many people so that they can continue to pay part of their mortgage and so that their lives do not simply fall apart.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State and I know these people cannot work because sectors are closed.  We speak to them and hear from them all the time.  They have no understanding of why that payment has been cut.  It is an act of solidarity.  As I have said previously, we must pay it because it keeps families and households afloat.  That is what we are asking for if we are to live with Covid.<\/p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, mentioned a cut in VAT rates.  The Minister of State and I come from the Border region.  We know the importance of lowering the VAT rate in the hospitality sector from 13.5% to 9%.  I ask again that the Government considers it.<\/p> <p> While the employment wage subsidy scheme is good, it absolutely needs to be revised because it is a cliff edge for businesses.  If their turnover drops by 30% or more, then businesses can access these supports, but if their turnover drops by 15%, 20% or even 28%, they receive no assistance for employing people.  Many businesses have contacted me about this.  If two businesses are side by side and the turnover of one drops by 30% and the other by 22%, one of them will get full support and the other will get nothing.  I ask for a graduated approach.  For example, if turnover drops by 10% a business might get &euro;50 per employee, a drop of between 10% and 20% would mean &euro;100 per employee, a drop of between 20% and 30% would mean &euro;150 per employee while a drop of more than 30% would mean, as it does now, &euro;200 per employee.  This would be a much fairer system for businesses and would significantly improve the workings of the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100033#GG00600","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601562900,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies throughout the House for their contributions in this vital debate on the Government's response to Covid-19, including the plan for living with Covid-19, Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021.  Our overall goal is to reopen our society and economy as safely as possible.  This is a challenge facing governments the world over.  We have seen the statistics from the WHO in recent days that worldwide case numbers have passed 33 million and worldwide deaths have exceeded 1 million.  In many parts of the world, the pandemic is returning at an increasing and alarming rate and we do not want this to happen in our country.  The resilience and recovery plan sets out a very clear framework for decision-making with regard to this public health pandemic.  Our objective is to strike a balance between what is safe and what may risk increasing transmission of the disease.  Therefore, we are prioritising certain sectors of society at this time in the knowledge that we will be able to return to normal life in future.<\/p>  <p>  We have now moved from the initial emergency response phase and objective of flattening the curve to the next chapter of opening society while living with the virus.  That said, the objective remains, as it always has been, to eliminate and eradicate the virus wherever it is detected.  This is the reason for the robust testing and tracing strategy put in place by the HSE.  The plan has a framework for decision-making by the Government.  We also to continue to promote the very clear public health advice for individuals, much of which has not changed for many months.  These include good cough and hand hygiene, wearing a face covering where required by law and when visiting vulnerable people, avoiding crowded places, including public transport, as much as possible, and working from home if possible, and I recognise that for many people this is not an option due to the nature of their work.  As a society, to suppress transmission of the virus and reduce the impact of the disease, it is important for all of us in all walks of life to heed this advice.  While the Government can legislate for mandatory face coverings on public transport and in retail settings, we cannot legislate for every situation.  We must all take an element of personal responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  We have contained outbreaks of the virus in Kildare, Laois and Offaly, and more recently we have seen how the efforts of the public in Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford have turned the tide of the trajectory of the disease.  We succeeded in doing this thanks to the collective efforts of the public, who adhered to the guidelines, as well as the expert knowledge and advice from our public health specialists and the dedication and hard work of all front-line workers.  We need individually and collectively to keep doing the basic things right, which the vast majority of us are doing already.<\/p>  <p>  I will now deal with some of the issues raised by Deputies.  Deputy Harkin outlined the fact that businesses need more notice.  We will take this on board.  It has been an issue in recent months, certainly in the north west and Donegal.  Many businesses did not get enough notice.  It is something we have taken on board.  The Deputy also spoke about northern Italy, Spain and New York and the new tests and pilot testing.  There are certainly options.  She spoke about the employment wage subsidy scheme and that businesses that loses 28% of turnover get nothing.  Perhaps there can be a better system than a cut-off point.  The Deputy also spoke about the VAT rate reducing from 13.5% to 9%.  I hope this will be considered in the budget.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Mattie McGrath spoke about Deputy Lahart's contribution.  He also praised the Garda, the GAA and various organisations for the work they are doing.  He stated that figures on mental health and self-harm have not been collated since April.  I will try to get the figures for the Deputy through the Department as soon as I can.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Shortall spoke about considering the experience of other countries with regard to minimising Covid-19 and the messaging is key.  She spoke about influencers and that the GAA in Dublin could be serious influencers on the ground.  We find that a certain cohort of people, perhaps those aged over 50, still get their news from the old traditional news outlets, such as local and national newspapers or the news on television at 6 p.m.  It is a very effective way but it is not getting through to younger people.  We do need to use different outlets.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Cathal Crowe spoke about dental care and the backlog for orthodontic services.  He asked about a tax rebate for people who have to get private treatment.  There is merit in this.  He also spoke about communication when a school has an outbreak and that perhaps communication between the HSE and the principal might be a bit quicker instead of waiting 24 hours.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies Alan Farrell, McAuliffe, Boyd Barrett, Barry and Jim O'Callaghan spoke about mental health and fatigue .  It is an issue we are facing after many months of living with Covid and with regard to businesses and industries.  We may have to look at a different way of approaching it.  I know NPHET and the Government are working together.  Somebody said that perhaps businesses and other people could be brought onto NPHET.  The NPHET team is primarily from the health sector but they also have knowledge of sporting events and business.  Just because somebody is from one area does not mean to say they do not have knowledge.  It would be ideal to bring in people from sporting organisations but the NPHET members also have links with sporting organisations.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Higgins spoke about the arts and dance classes for young and old.  It would be great to get those classes back.  She also spoke about opening venues that are capable of bringing in fewer people than they used to and that the Covid payments could be tweaked so sound engineers, roadies and musicians could get back working.  She absolutely has a point.<\/p> <p> Deputy Conway-Walsh spoke about staff burnout in Mayo University Hospital and the need to listen to them.  Deputy Wynne spoke about visiting hospitals and other health services on compassionate grounds.  She has a point too.<\/p> <p> Deputy Boyd Barrett talked about trusting the people and giving them the information they need.  Deputy Barry spoke about taxi driver protests and their financial plight, as well as emergency accommodation and suicide in Cork.  It is an issue which I heard loud and clear.<\/p> <p> Deputy McAuliffe spoke about protecting the vulnerable in society.  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan had some interesting views that we could crush the virus into the ground but we need to open up sport.  It is spreading around the world but reducing human activity may not be the right approach.  Young people will gladly listen to messages but it is having a serious economic impact.<\/p> <p> Deputy Andrews spoke about team sports and the difference between soccer, Gaelic football and rugby.  Hopefully, soccer might be included in the sports allowed.  I would have thought it was but maybe junior soccer is an issue.<\/p> <p> Deputy Fitzpatrick talked about the health and safety of people.  We need to protect jobs.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n spoke about cancer screening and cancer patients.  There are many other areas in the health services from where people have gone to work on the Covid-19 issue.  It is hard to get the right balance.<\/p> <p> Deputy Murnane O'Connor spoke about older people.  Deputy Dillon spoke about leadership.  Hopefully, we can return to normal.  Deputy Devlin spoke about uncharted waters but we need an all-island response.  That is what we are doing.  I know the various teams from the health Departments in both jurisdictions are working together.  There is another meeting between them tomorrow.  We need to work collectively, across the island of Ireland, North and South, east and west, to sort out and attack this virus as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100034#HH00200","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1601563500,"counter":310,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.03 p.m. and resumed at 4.23 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Winter Plan 2020: Statements","time":1601563800,"counter":311,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100036#LL00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1601563800,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I welcome this opportunity to address the House on the winter plan which was published last week.  Every winter, our healthcare system faces increasing pressures, resulting in difficulties for many people and many patients, particularly older people, in accessing services in a timely way.  This becomes most evident, as we know, in the hospital emergency departments in the form of overcrowding, longer waiting times and patients receiving care on trolleys.<\/p>  <p>  Before Covid arrived in Ireland, we already had the longest waiting lists in Europe.  Last winter saw the highest trolley counts since records began.  That was our starting point.  Since March of this year, Covid has caused a substantial increase in waiting lists due to the necessary pausing of many aspects of healthcare.  Covid has also caused a very serious fall in our healthcare capacity, due largely to the need for extra infection prevention and control measures.  In short, it takes longer and it costs more to provide the same care to the same patient.<\/p>  <p>  For all these reasons, this winter is likely to be the most challenging time our health services have faced in many years.  The winter plan is one of the ways that we are responding to this challenge.  None of us wants to see patients and staff enduring overcrowded conditions.  The problems giving rise to these challenges are varied.  Many are rooted in the way services have been historically delivered.<\/p>  <p>  This is why a strategic approach was agreed on an all-party basis to bring about long-term structural reform to our healthcare system, namely, Sl&aacute;intecare.  I re-emphasise the Government&rsquo;s and my commitment to the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  I know colleagues recognise, and the Sl&aacute;intecare report itself acknowledges, that these deep-seated reforms, which we need to make, take time to implement.  There is no magic formula to immediately fix the various waiting list and trolley issues that we see.  Nonetheless, Sl&aacute;intecare is the strategy we are pursuing and the winter plan is designed according to Sl&aacute;intecare principles and, I am very happy to share with the House, in a way that substantially accelerates the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the publication of the plan.  It is ambitious.  Its aim is to deliver safe, efficient and effective services this winter and to do this by reorienting service delivery towards primary care and community-based services.  I particularly welcome the HSE's undertaking to reduce the number of patients receiving care on trolleys in emergency departments and the improvement of patient experience times while they are in emergency departments.  Both of these objectives are critically important to keeping patients and staff safe in response to Covid-19 this winter.<\/p>  <p>  Last winter, more than 620,000 people visited emergency departments.  While anybody who needs emergency medical treatment should, of course, receive it, it is generally accepted among experts that there are many patients who could be cared for in alternative settings other than hospital and who would indeed be better cared for in non-acute settings.  Therefore, it is a central part of this plan to provide alternative pathways of care where they are appropriate.  This is to ease pressures on the hospital system, including emergency departments, to speed up patient discharge and to provide patients with care as close to the home and their communities as possible and where possible.  This will, of course, free up hospital resources for the patients who need to access acute care.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's determination to meet the challenges of winter this year and support the healthcare system are demonstrated by the commitment of &euro;600 million to underpinning this plan.  That includes &euro;200 million for the rest of this year and an additional &euro;400 million for next year - that is, the 2021 part of this coming winter.  The plan is designed to enable patients to be seen in the community wherever possible.<\/p> <p>It does this by providing a better service in the community healthcare settings.  The plan supports patients receiving timely care in hospitals when needed and supports patients returning home or to appropriate care settings when they are well enough to leave hospital.  It does this by providing home care and step-down options.<\/p> <p> I am particularly pleased to share with the House that there are additional supports in the plan for people at greater risk, including elderly people, homeless people, those in addiction, those with chronic illnesses and many more by allowing them to stay home while they are receiving the right level of care.<\/p> <p> The plan provides for building capacity and resilience in the system.  One of the big challenges facing us is building this extra capacity in the acute hospital system.  In 2018, the health service capacity review was published.  It sets out the necessity for increased acute and non-acute bed capacity right across the system in the context of major reforms being implemented in the way healthcare is delivered.  These major reforms are a critical part of the plan.  The plan that has been set and to which we are all working has approximately 2,590 acute beds but it is worth noting that the capacity review states that this is one end of a range and if the necessary reforms are not delivered, we would need in excess of 7,000 beds.  These are essential reforms.  The programme for Government commits to continuing investment in our health services in line with the recommendations of the capacity review and the commitments in Project Ireland 2040.  <\/p> <p> The winter plan provides additional health service capacity across a range of services and settings, including acute capacity, to reduce admissions and facilitate egress.  Key initiatives include funding for nearly 900 acute hospital beds, nearly 500 sub-acute beds, 631 rehabilitation places and 530 repurposed community beds.  Some of those are beds that have been put in place since the arrival of Covid-19 and were funded for several months through the initial Covid-19 response fund.  The winter plan will continue the funding of those beds until the end of April and double the number of acute beds in the same timescale.  The plan also provides for the utilisation of private hospitals for urgent complex care to reduce waiting lists and for their use in the event of a surge of Covid-19.<\/p> <p> Many of these measures are aimed at reducing the number of those over 75 years of age who need to be treated in, or admitted to, acute hospitals.  They also aim to reduce the number of patients whose discharge from hospital is delayed because of a lack of alternative care available to them.  We saw that happen last winter although it was tackled with some success at the time.  It must be comprehensively tackled this year.<\/p> <p> The plan also provides additional community healthcare networks, more community specialist teams and additional acute hospital front-of-house teams.  This will create the foundation and organisational structure through which integrated care can be provided locally within the community at the appropriate level of complexity.  These networks and specialist teams will work closely with the National Ambulance Service to deliver end-to-end care with the aim of keeping people out of hospital or, where they are admitted, to ensure they are discharged without delay.  It is anticipated in the plan that these measures could lead to a decrease of 20% in the number of emergency department admissions for people who are over 75.<\/p> <p> Having mentioned the National Ambulance Service, I would like to put on the record my acknowledgement of the extraordinary work the men and women in that service have provided.  They always do extraordinary work, but their response to Covid-19 has been nothing short of exemplary.<\/p> <p> The plan also commits to delivering more diagnostics in the community, allowing patients to be seen closer to home and avoid going to hospital.  The plan puts in place supports for GPs, including those in rural practices, to support service continuity.  GP access to diagnostics has been coming up for many years.  GPs all over the country are firmly of the view that they can reduce admissions to hospital and referrals to consultants and emergency departments by accessing diagnostics and bringing their own patients back to their practices to continuing their care.  This winter, we are putting a substantial investment into making that happen and I hope we will see exactly the sorts of results that the GPs intend to deliver.<\/p> <p> The plan also aims to double the existing level of home support hours to support the Home First initiative.  This is designed to enable those with high and moderate levels of frailty to be cared for in their own homes.  With this objective in mind, 4.7 million additional home support hours are being provided for in the plan.<\/p> <p> A key action will be a comprehensive flu vaccination programme.  The HSE has placed orders for approximately 1.35 million doses of the quadrivalent influenza vaccine as well as 600,000 doses of the live attenuated influenza vaccine, which is essentially a nasal spray rather than an injection for children aged two to 12.  I remind people that the flu vaccination for these vulnerable groups is being administered for free, which is an important message and I would appreciate the help of my colleagues to get that message out to people that if they are in one of the vulnerable groups, they should approach their GP or pharmacist for a free vaccination.<\/p> <p> Funding is also provided for waiting lists.  I would like to acknowledge and support the necessary decision taken earlier this year to defer elective care.  I know that this has had an impact on scheduled care waiting lists.  Hospital waiting list figures are higher than at the start of the year with the inpatient day case and outpatient waiting lists 17% and 10%, respectively, higher than at the start of January.  However, there are some indications of improvement which I think are worth noting.  As a result of concerted efforts by front-line workers, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the trajectory of growth in waiting lists has been slowed since services resumed in June.  There has been an almost 11% reduction in the numbers waiting for inpatient procedures since May, with early evidence that the rate of growth on the outpatient list has slowed.  The HSE has actively sought to improve productivity through the increasing use of alternative work practices.  This includes telemedicine, virtual clinics and other alternative settings.  Private hospitals, community facilities, atypical outpatient settings, the HSE and particularly community health organisations have been innovative and deserve great credit for their response to Covid-19.  They have responded with great creativity and professionalism.  The HSE is also currently working to secure access to private hospital facilities for urgent and time-critical procedures for public patients.<\/p> <p> The National Treatment Purchase Fund has resumed its activities on behalf of public patients and is currently reviewing strategies to maximise activity and benefit for patients.  These include the increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, and funding see-and-treat services where minor procedures are provided for at the same time as outpatient consultations.  The funding of hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients and the funding of virtual clinics and clinical validation are also included.  We need, of course, to acknowledge that waiting lists are at record levels but the combined impact of this work should help to offset to some extent the awful impact of Covid-19 on waiting lists.  The HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund will continue to work together to address this issue.<\/p> <p> I very much welcome today's debate and look forward to hearing from my colleagues their views on the plan.  The objective of the Government is to fully implement Sl&aacute;intecare and I want to work collaboratively with all stakeholders and right across this House to do so.  Sl&aacute;intecare is not owned by this Government, it is owned by the Oireachtas and I hope to see it implemented to a great extent in the coming months and years.  In the immediate term, we need to get services back up and running to at least the level they were at prior to the outbreak of the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>The winter plan is part of that process and is designed to meet the immediate challenges we anticipate this winter.  With the ambitious targets in it and the funding provided by the Government, I am confident that we can make inroads into the problems in the system.  I hope this is something all Deputies in the House want and will support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100036#LL00200","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601564700,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with my colleague, Deputy Patricia Ryan.  I will take ten minutes and she will have five minutes.<\/p>  <p>  I have said to the Minister on a number of occasions, and I think he has accepted it because it is a statement of the obvious, that we are facing a very difficult winter.  The onset of Covid has been tragic in many ways for our health services, not just in terms of trying to battle Covid and save people's lives but also because of the impact it is having on non-Covid care across a range of areas.  We need to get it right as we try to strike a balance between protecting people against Covid and maintaining all critical non-Covid care.  We would both agree that we are facing into a very difficult winter for our front-line staff and patients.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister will have seen from the most recent figures from the National Treatment Purchase Fund that we now have record numbers of people waiting to see a consultant and get into the system, and people are also waiting for treatment.  We need urgent resources and an injection of serious capacity.  We needed a serious long-term plan that would deal with the challenges we face.  There is some additionality in the Minister's plan, which I welcome, but much of it resembles more of a wish list.  It lacks urgency and ambition.<\/p>  <p>  In the first week of August, I launched the Sinn F&eacute;in proposals.  We launched a plan that would succeed, not a plan that was designed to fail.  We called for 1,100 additional acute beds between now and the end of the year as well as all necessary staff, a proposal that was completely costed and funded.  We also called for 2,500 additional staff between now and the end of the year to take the pressure off front-line staff who we know have worked extremely hard and face very real difficulties and challenges.  We committed to &euro;50 million in additional spending on cancer services and, separate from our plan, we also talked about additional resources for disability services, mental health and other areas.  The Minister's plan for most of those areas has been underwhelming.<\/p>  <p>  I have listened to many stakeholders, including health trade unions and advocacy groups.  Over the past week alone, I have met over 20 groups.  I have listened to what they have to say because they are on the front line advocating for patients across a range of areas.  The one thing that keeps coming up is that this is a temporary plan with temporary sticking-plaster solutions.  While that is in part because of the winter challenge, there was an opportunity to make sure all of the additional beds which are being provided would be provided on a permanent basis.  In our plan, we provided for 609 modular rapid-build units.  The work could have been done during the summer and the beds would then have been ready to be opened in the winter.  We would have them on a permanent basis in our health service, which is what we need.  Temporary solutions do not cut it and are not what was promised in Sl&aacute;intecare.  They are not what any of us were promised when we canvassed for people's votes in the most recent election.<\/p>  <p>  There are no targets in the Minister's plan in terms of staff.  There is no mention of staff in the plan.  In the press conference, that information had to be dragged out of some of the people who were there.  The plan is still lacking in targets.  How many staff will be recruited and how they will be recruited?  Will they be agency staff?  How long will they be employed for?  What type of contracts will they be on?  I refer to doctors, nurses, consultants, medical scientists and so on.  We know the winter plan is only funded to the end of April and will not, therefore, be a medium-term to long-term solution for all of the challenges we face.  In my view, it does not go anywhere near enough to deal with the challenge we have in delivering Covid and non-Covid care.  This is a winter like no other.  This is a winter when we have to deal with Covid and non-Covid care.  However, there should be some opportunity to catch up on all of the missed care.<\/p>  <p>  I have listened to cancer patients who have not had access to their consultants at the times they were promised.  Their appointments, procedures and surgeries have been cancelled.  I put down a parliamentary question to the Minister on children with scoliosis, a matter which he quite rightly raised with other people when he was in opposition.  It is a fundamental issue of children who are in pain and need treatment.  There was a 30% reduction in medical procedures for children with scoliosis for the first eight months of this year compared to the first eight months of last year.  That is obviously because of the Covid restrictions, but it is all the more reason why we need a catch-up plan, investment and resources to ensure children with scoliosis and cancer patients are not waiting longer for treatment.<\/p>  <p>  The plan made no mention of disability services.  It failed to provide additional funding, resources and investment for disabilities and dementia services.  The Minister has since announced a meagre &euro;10 million for these services, which was met with shock and disbelief by all of the advocacy groups representing people with disabilities.  I very much hope that they will see much more from the Minister, and the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, on budget day because this is an area that deserves a lot of our attention.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Cancer Society has said we need &euro;40 million for cancer services.  All the Minister has provided in the winter plan is &euro;2.3 million in additional funding next year to deal with what he called restarting or kick-starting cancer services.  That falls far short of what is needed for us to be able to make sure oncology services are operating at the same levels that they were pre-Covid.<\/p>  <p>  I do not underestimate the challenge, but there is another important area I want to raise with the Minister.  For the past number of weeks I have compiled as much data as I can on dental and orthodontic wait times, which are beyond shocking.  Children are waiting four and five years for services.  I have received emails from the parents of children who are in extreme pain and cannot get the treatment they need.  I do not know whether the Minister has looked at the waiting times recently, but they are shocking.  It is one of the areas where there was a pause in treatment.  I know people who are not even being referred for treatment; they are instead being told a referral cannot be made because of the lack of capacity.  In the Be On Call for Ireland waiting pool of 1,600 staff, there are dentists and dental assistants.  Why are they not being hired and brought into the public system to ensure we can treat people and make sure children get the treatment they need?  That is the point.<\/p>  <p>  We have to live with Covid, as I said, but we also have to live with it in a way that non-Covid-related healthcare can be delivered.  We are saving lives, which we need to do in terms of Covid and taking all of the necessary precautions.  On the other hand, people are waiting far too long for cancer treatment, children are waiting too long for all sorts of medical treatment and across whole range of areas, from cardiology to neurology and many others, we have longer and longer wait times.  Over 600,000 people in the State are waiting to see a hospital consultant.  I can guarantee that by the end of the year, given the lack of urgency in the plan, that will get worse because the Minister has not provided for measures to deal with that.<\/p>  <p>  The plan lacks the detail, ambition and urgency needed to inject the capacity that is needed.  The Minister knows full well that if we are to have any chance of catching up or, if we are to be brutally honest, any chance of keeping up we need far more beds than are being delivered in the plan.  The Minister has put more pressure on acute hospitals to find whatever space they can in their hospitals to open up beds . There are no new builds whatsoever.  There is no reference to modular building, or to medium-term or long-term planning.  The plan is about what can be provided by acute hospitals, which are bursting, and putting them under pressure to get all of these beds in place which will of course all be closed at the end of April.  We will be back to where we were with a lack of capacity in the system.<\/p>  <p>  I want to finish on an issue I have raised several times with the Minister.  It has been raised on the floor of the D&aacute;il with the Taoiseach.  I refer to cardiac services in Waterford and the south east.  There is very real concern about the second cath lab that was promised which will now only deliver diagnostic services.  I attended several meetings with senior officials from the Department of Health, the previous Minister for Health and others where we were promised that the lab would provide interventional and diagnostic care.<\/p> <p>That needs to happen.  <\/p> <p> The final point I will make in the 30 seconds remaining is that I, as a Waterford Deputy, want to work with this Minister for Health, so that he can be the Minister that delivers health equality for the south east, and delivers the 24\/7 cardiac care people want.  He has it within his power to work with those in the Department and the HSE and with others to make that happen.  He knows from his colleagues and others in the south east that this is not just a Waterford issue but that this is needed.  I appeal to the Minister to work with others on this issue and to be the Minister for Health who delivers that facility for the people of the south east.

This winter plan is a wish list which is short on targets, on timelines and on ambition.  I am very fearful of a winter crisis at Portlaoise, Tullamore, and Naas hospitals.  When Covid-19, in particular, is taken into account, the plan is lacking in detail, targets and timelines for staff recruitment and bed delivery.  It falls far short of what is required to safely deliver appropriate care in the coming winter months.  We need a plan that will catch up on missed care and to build capacity.  This plan does not deliver enough ambition to catch up to where we were pre-winter, let alone when the usual barrage of the winter causes our emergency departments to clog up.  When I refer to clogging up I mean clogging up in the normal conditions.  I fear it will be much worse in the socially-distanced world we now live in.  <\/p>  <p>  I spoke last week to a man from Portarlington who attended an accident and emergency department in Tullamore recently.  Despite suffering from chronic pain he stood at the edge of a waiting room as this room was too packed, and despite most people wearing masks, he felt unsafe being in such close proximity to a large number of people given the Covid-19 crisis.  The man was understandably nervous as he injects a biologic monthly to suppress his immune system in an effort to manage his condition.  When he could not stand any more he sat near a window.  He had been sent to the accident and emergency department by his doctor who had immediate concerns for his health.  He spent eight hours in the accident and emergency department on a Friday evening in September.  Imagine how long he might have had to spend in January if he was in that same waiting room.<\/p>  <p>  The Sinn F&eacute;in plan which was launched in early August would deliver 1,100 additional acute and subacute beds and 50 intensive care unit, ICU, beds this year.  It would provide &euro;40 million to kickstart cancer care and bring on an additional 2,500 staff ahead of winter, not after winter but ahead of it.  The Government plan will only deliver 251 acute beds and 89 subacute beds in 2020, and 232 acute beds in early 2021.  The 17 ICU beds proposed is far short of what is needed.  Additional ICU beds in early 2021 will be crucial but no target has been set.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has admitted that the so-called new beds will only mitigate Covid-19-related capacity shortfalls and not meet demand.  There are hundreds of unfilled vacancies across the health service, including many in Laois, Offaly and Kildare.  As the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, have said, without filling these vacancies new beds cannot be opened.  Without clear commitments and rapid recruitment, the burden on existing staff will not be relieved.  They are overworked and have worked hard through this pandemic with little or no relief.  <\/p>  <p>  There is no mention of disability services.  I have spoken with CEOs of disability services as recently as this morning and I can tell the Minister that they are in disarray.  There is no funding for mental health services.  Why is this the case?  There is also no funding to kickstart cancer services this year.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the investment in occupational welfare supports for front-line staff and investments in community care, in community intervention teams and the winter flu expansion.  These were a core part of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s capacity protection programme, but these alone are not enough.  The rest of the plan misses the mark.  It is in another missed opportunity to deliver a proper health service for the people of the midlands I represent.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I am concerned that not enough is being done for carers through the winter plan.  Carers are burned out.  We need to prioritise carers and day care centres.  These need to be reopened and they need this help now.

I welcome the fact that we are having a discussion on this issue this evening.  As with my earlier contribution on the roadmap, I would appreciate if the Minister would take on board some of what I am going to say in the limited time available to.<\/p>  <p>  On the flu vaccine, I understand the international issues.  Last October some of us were advocating that everybody should get the flu vaccine.  We would have had a head start.  Unfortunately, we did not do that.  While there are international factors, we could have been ahead of the game.  Can the Minister, or the Minister of State coming in to sum up, update us on where we are on the roll out of the flu vaccine?  Dr. Nina Byrnes and other prominent GPs across the country have been saying that it has been coming in small doses and some people in my own constituency have said the same thing.  Are we going to be able to get to the target group?  Are we going to be able to get to the over 80s, about whom I spoke earlier and which includes my own parents, and to the vulnerable groups on time?<\/p>  <p>  The second issue I wish to raise is on non-Covid19 healthcare.  I want the Minister - I will be asking the Taoiseach next week and he will probably revert to the Minister - to provide me with a table for January to September 2019 and 2020, showing the number of people diagnosed with cancer per month and the type of cancer and the same for coronary conditions.  I also want the table to show the treatments.  We have to deal with Covid-19 healthcare but we also have to deal with non-Covid-19 healthcare.  It is not a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul.  I appreciate that the Minister for Health has a very difficult job but we have to look after both of these groups.  There is no point saying that, unfortunately, we lost one person through Covid-19 in the past couple of days, if we are losing more people due to other chronic and serious issues like cancer, or heart conditions.  It is as simple as that.  I want the Minister for Health, through the Taoiseach, to ask that question.  It is very rare for the leader of one of the parties in opposition to give the Government a week to get information, and to say that he will ask the same question next week.  We need to know this as does the country.  We have to diagnose proportionately the same number of people, and probably improve in some categories, as we were last year.<\/p>  <p>  We have all heard anecdotal evidence.  I heard of a surgeon in the mid-west who is a specialist in rectal cancers.  He has not been diagnosing the same number of patients as he was last year.  That means that there are many males, in particular, who do not know that they have cancer.  That means delayed outcomes and more mortalities.  Put that in an equation versus what we are doing about Covid-19.  We must then get these statistics.<\/p>  <p>  I remember the Minister sitting beside me here for years, and also in committee, and he always used the phrase that it is all about the data.  Let us find out the data.  I have also tabled parliamentary questions on this and I have asked the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  We need more detail on the beds issue.  I have said here on numerous occasions that the numbers announced in the plan and the real numbers are different.  I will not bother boring everybody by going through it again but the net effect is that there are not as many beds as is being said.  I want to see the detail of this plan.  Where are the beds going?  There is a chronic issue in University Hospital Limerick, UHL.  It has to get that 96-bed block and it has to be built using this rapid-build technology.  Use the Covid-19 emergency legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I will make a positive suggestion to the Minister.  The Covid-19 emergency legislation which allows the Minister to do a whole range of different buildings will run out soon.  It needs to be extended because some of the projects may be outside its remit and may face planning or other issues.  I know about that because there is a &euro;1.5 million outpatients department being put in Nenagh, and in Thurles there is a &euro;2.4 million facility to deal with  elderly members of the community as a hospital prevention measure.  Can the Minister tell us where the beds are going to go?  We are desperate in the mid-west to know what is going to happen there.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome all the hospital prevention measures being brought in across the country.  I have serious questions on staffing.  Some 12,500 staff members were mentioned.  I was here when questions were asked about this and I could have answered them because according to the plan, there will be 5,000 staff provided before Christmas and 7,500 will be provided after Christmas.  I will tell the Minister in a straightforward way that if he can get 12,500 staff members into the health service by next April, I will buy him a good bottle of whiskey.<\/p> <p>If he can even get the 10,000, I will buy him a good bottle of whiskey.  I know we are being flippant, and it is not a joke, but I want to see a plan and I will work with the Minister on where we will get all of these nurses, and particularly specialists and doctors, that he is committed to delivering.<\/p> <p> On cancer screening, I want to see a clinical reason BreastCheck screening has gone to three years.  I have asked that question.  The screening was always every two years but now, because of Covid-19, it will be every three years.  I do not buy that and most people who have knowledge of this do not buy it either.<\/p> <p> I want to raise a couple of other issues.  As regards the funding that has been announced, I have a huge interest in people with intellectual disabilities.  They have been let down.  They are our most vulnerable.  We need to ensure the plan deals with that issue, and obviously with mental health also.  <\/p> <p> I want to see more diagnostics going into the community.  I refer to all the different doctors who are in co-operatives across the country.  We all know they are co-operatives and are private practice but they need extra supports because they are acting in a different way now.  They are acting as part of a different type of network in an emergency.  They need supports so the Minister should target them.<\/p> <p> I have a real issue with what happened with regard to private hospitals.  It is not today or yesterday I said that but I will always stand over it.  At the beginning of this crisis we should have bought one of the two main private hospitals in Dublin, if not both of them.  The Minister will need capacity.  That is the quickest way of getting it.  People are saying the total amount of public and private beds will be the same but we need public capacity.  I believe it would be cheaper in the long term and I still believe the Minister should consider it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100039#OO00400","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601565900,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I have heard many promises made in the House over the years but I never heard whiskey promised before.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100040#PP00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1601565900,"counter":322,"content":"<p>That is how much it means to me and I hope the Minister delivers it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100040#PP00300","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1601565900,"counter":323,"content":"<p>We all might get to share it with him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100040#PP00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1601565900,"counter":324,"content":"<p>Yes, we can do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100040#PP00500","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1601565900,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I call Deputy O'Connor who is sharing with Deputy Dillon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100040#PP00600","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1601565900,"counter":326,"content":"<p>The HSE winter plan will see an additional &euro;600 million invested in the health service.  I want to recognise that our healthcare workers have worked tirelessly throughout this pandemic and that investment will support them as they care for their patients, both those who have Covid-19 and those who have other healthcare requirements.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Home First approach that emphasises reablement in providing extensive home care support packages for those with more complex needs, including people with dementia who are being supported through additional resources that have been allocated towards that area.<\/p>  <p>  The roll-out of community specialist teams to support older people and those with chronic illnesses is also hugely positive.  Those teams will help them to stay at home or, if they need hospital care, to get them home more quickly afterwards.<\/p>  <p>  Under the current programme for Government, the commitment towards primary care facilities and recognising that hospitals are often not the best place for people to be in on a long-term basis is a positive move.  My home town of Youghal, for example, does not have a primary healthcare centre and such developments in communities such as Youghal would be very welcome in the future.  I look forward to working with the Minister to try to deliver that for the people of my constituency.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to raise a point about funding for communication strategies to communicate the message about Covid-19 to young people.  I do so as the youngest Member of this House.  Dr. Mike Ryan of the World Health Organization said that there was an ongoing shift in Covid-19 to younger adults.  The shift in the disease being detected in our younger population is probably because they are the ones who came back into society at an earlier stage as they were returning to work, college and university.  Younger people may suffer a less severe version, in some cases, of the Covid-19 disease but it is not guaranteed that this will always be the case.  There is always a risk of passing it on to older populations and more vulnerable members of society.  Transmission from younger to older generations can occur, especially if younger people are asymptomatic.  If the disease is passed on to older generations again, Dr. Ryan said the hospitals will refill, which is something we do not want to see happen.<\/p>  <p>  I want to highlight the need to target the messaging specifically to young people when it comes to Covid-19.  As a young person, I understand that young people do not consume information in the same way as older generations of our society.  We need to adapt our approach to ensure every section of our society is aware of the ramifications of the Covid-19 disease, not only for themselves but also for others in the community.  I do not want this to come across as young people needing to be specifically singled out and communicated to or, worse, to be lectured but I am conscious that the media consumption patterns have changed so dramatically between generations that this issue cannot be left unaddressed.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the Minister on his hard work, which he has shown since he came into his Department.  As he is aware, I have highlighted my concerns around some of the mental health constraints that Covid-19 is placing on our citizens and young people across this country.  The lives of many young people have been turned upside down because of this pandemic.  They now face very few job prospects in many cases and a very uncertain future, which can greatly impact on an individual's mental health.  The general direction of the winter plan is to ensure that we continue to keep the level of deaths from Covid-19 low and that other illnesses are treated also, but in a time of great change for so many across the world it is important that we do not forget to look after our mental health.  I refer to measures such as reducing our social contacts.  For many young people, not being able to attend university can be draining.  I want to say here today that young people are not forgotten in this fight against Covid-19 and that the Minister's Department is looking to ensure that any person who is suffering throughout this pandemic, or at any time, can get the support they need.<\/p>  <p>  Young people need hope that we can get through this pandemic without our health service being overrun, hope that everyone is doing their best to ensure we have a healthcare system in place that will overcome this pandemic, and hope that the future will be better and that we will get through this together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100040#PP00700","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speech","time":1601565900,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for facilitating this debate.  It is very encouraging to see that the winter plan has strongly accounted for building capacity and service continuity and ensuring pathways of care during the pandemic era.  It is welcome that more than &euro;600 million will be spent as part of the plan, under which the largest spend will be on home support and Home First, totalling in excess of &euro;130 million.<\/p>  <p>  Many of us expressed our support for the healthcare workers on the front line, be it those working in our hospitals, GP services, pharmacies and those providing care at home.  However, I must acknowledge the work done by HSE management during the pandemic.  They had to respond to a national and international challenge beyond any I can think of in living memory.  They have undertaken a public health campaign on a magnitude not witnessed by many.  It is inspiring to see such public service values come to the fore during a time when strong leadership and public confidence was most required.  While our healthcare system has some long-standing weaknesses and legacy issues, it is important to recognise the strong leadership and to be thankful for such in times of crisis.<\/p>  <p>  I am hopeful this pandemic will also present an opportunity to address some of the long-term capacity challenges in our health service, in particular emergency department overcrowding.  I note that the winter plan highlights that in a Covid-19 environment there is a need for zero tolerance of overcrowding in all care environments.<\/p>  <p>  Ensuring the delivery of the long-awaited temporary modular unit planned for Mayo University Hospital is a vital concern for me.  While it is due on site by early November, I believe it is important to keep the issue highlighted until it is operational as we enter the winter months.  I was recently advised by the HSE that a feasibility study is taking place within the Saolta health care group regarding the development of a 50-bed ward block at Mayo University Hospital.  Any further update on that would be most welcome.<\/p>  <p>  In recent months, various other improvement works have been progressing at the hospital, including electrical upgrade works with the provision of a new energy centre along with the installation of additional generator capacity.  Other improvements include the reconfiguration and upgrade to the hospital sterile service department as well as the replacement of existing autoclave equipment and building reconfiguration work to achieve compliance with the latest decontamination standards.  Such investments are most welcome during the Covid-19 era.<\/p>  <p>  An area of concern which I note is mentioned in the winter plan is general practice support.  I am especially conscious of single-handed practices, two-doctor practices and practices with older GPs.  Some of those practices are covering huge areas of incredible rural geography, for instance, Belmullet, the Erris region or Achill.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could provide further detail on the temporary crisis support to ensure the continued provision of local GP services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100040#PP00800","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speech","time":1601565900,"counter":328,"content":"<p>The Minister will be well aware that I have spoken on health issues a number of times, both in this D&aacute;il and many times in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il, so here we go again.  I feel I have to do so because of the constituency I represent, which is Limerick city and includes part of Tipperary.  We have University Hospital Limerick in that constituency.<\/p> <p>I have to speak so often on health because, unfortunately, the issues of overcrowding and low staff levels are ever present in the hospital.  The number of patients waiting on trolleys is nearly always the highest in the State.  A total of 1,146 patients waited on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick in September this year.  The numbers are massive and totally unacceptable.  While they are down on last year, the Minister will be aware that the pre-Covid figures for January and February were much higher than those for 2019, which will be a major cause of concern after Covid.  In February 2020 there were 1,286 on trolleys, by comparison with 973 in February 2019, and in January 2020 there were 1,215 on trolleys, by comparison with 973 in January 2019.  Before Covid, the emergency department was often bursting at the seams and it was clearly unsafe for patients and needed urgent intervention.<\/p> <p> University Hospital Limerick is a fine hospital and the staff, from porters to nurses and doctors, do an incredible job, but they often do so in very difficult conditions.  I hope the Government's winter plan will provide some remedy for the problems faced by the hospital.  These issues will become even more difficult to manage with the onset of the winter flu season, as the Minister is well aware.<\/p> <p> I accept that the winter plan was never designed to be, or going to be, a panacea for all these issues.  I hoped it would provide some solutions and comfort to the people of Limerick.  Unfortunately, it seems my reasonable expectations were overly optimistic.  As my colleagues said, we were not presented with a plan but with a fantasy list.  The Minister knows, or at least should know, the difficulties faced by University Hospital Limerick.  I have spoken about them here often enough and he is well aware of them.  We are presented with offers and no remedies.  What this plan offers is clearly inadequate.  It is inadequate in terms of its ambition to increase the number of beds and, most important, in terms of targets to increase the number of staff needed to deliver appropriate care through the winter.<\/p> <p> The plan aims to improve patient experience times in emergency departments and reduce trolley numbers by 30% compared with the winter of 2019.  These are good ambitions but, quite frankly, the resources needed are not committed to.  The plan proposes to open an additional 251 acute beds and 89 sub-acute beds in quarter 4 of 2020, and a further 232 acute beds in quarter 1 of 2021.  I welcome any increase in available beds but I wonder whether the targets can be met.  There are hundreds of unfilled vacancies across the health service.  I am aware, from speaking to nurses recently, that there are a large number of vacancies in University Hospital Limerick.  Without filling these positions, the new beds promised cannot be opened.  There is construction in Limerick but there seems to be no real plan to make sure the facility will be equipped properly when the beds are in operation.  The plan does not show enough ambition.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in's health plan, Better for Health, is ambitious.  It would require significant and sustained public investment but would deliver results, not short-term achievements of metrics.  It would result in a long-term commitment to move from a two-tier public-private health system to a universal healthcare system.  Our plan targets the delivery of 1,100 additional acute and sub-acute beds and 50 ICU beds.<\/p> <p> I have a difficulty with what is in the Government's plan and with the question of whether it can be delivered, but I wish to highlight what is not in it, that is, a commitment on mental health.  In fact, not only does the plan not make any commitments on this important issue, it does not even refer to it.  Mental health services have been chronically neglected for years.  The winter plan is meant to be a short-term tactical plan but it is outrageous that mental health is absent from it.  The Minister will be well aware that Deputies of all parties have raised their concerns over the number of mental health issues and suicide levels caused by Covid.  Funding and resources for mental health are critical in my city, Limerick.  The Covid committee has heard expert opinion and anticipates an increase in the number of mental illness cases due to the stress of Covid but there is no plan for this.  Throughout the country, there are some wonderful mental health organisations that for far too long have been carrying a burden that the Minister&rsquo;s Department should be helping with.  I commend them on their often unseen and unreported work. The Minister and his Department have a responsibility in this matter.<\/p> <p> There is no reference to disability services and no funding allocated for this year to kick-start cancer services that I can see.  The Minister mentioned funding for 2021.  I welcome the community specialist teams, however.  This is a good idea.  If this initiative is used correctly, it could support older people and help manage conditions outside the hospital setting. Visiting a hospital is daunting enough at any age but this is especially true with the added concerns about Covid-19 transmission.<\/p> <p> I am deeply concerned about what will happen in University Hospital Limerick, especially the emergency department, over the winter.  If I were to grade the Minister's plan, I would give him a low C but I am sure the algorithm of his colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley, would reduce this mark further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100040#PP00900","speaker":"1509","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601566500,"counter":330,"content":"<p>There is no doubting that the headline figure for the winter plan, &euro;600 million, is very substantial and dwarfs any amount set aside in previous winter plans.  It requires and deserves further scrutiny, however.  The small print indicates that only one-third of the amount is to be spent in the current year and potentially two-thirds - the funding has not been secured yet - will require agreement in the budgetary process.  Theoretically, just one third of the amount is to be available for spending this year.  A lot of digging down has to be done into the details of the figure.  It includes expenditure on many services that have been put in place in recent months.  Therefore, there will not be new services to the net value of &euro;200 million this year.<\/p>  <p>  On a very positive front, I very much welcome the considerable allocation made for home care.  Many of us have been looking for that for years.  It makes absolute sense.  It should have happened long before now.  The amount provided, as I understand it, will address the needs of the 6,000 people at home who have been approved for home care but who have been on a waiting list.  Those people, in the main, are in very vulnerable circumstances.  They may be on their own or infirm and they desperately need care.  I hope all the waiting lists can be cleared with the allocation made.  I hope it will ensure that, in so far as it is possible, they will not end up hospital or nursing homes.  That is all the allocation will do, however.  It will not cater for new people who require care.  A very considerable number who are ready to be discharged home from hospital need to be catered for also.  These are the two separate groups.<\/p>  <p>  In the time remaining, I wish to concentrate on what I believe to be glaring omissions.  Three points arise: the lack of any provision at all for mental health services, the lack of any provision for disability services, and the wholly inadequate position on ICU beds.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to mental health services, many of us have been talking in recent months and years about the underlying underinvestment in mental health services.  There are long waiting lists for children, in particular, and adults.  I provided the figures here a couple of weeks ago.  Thousands of children are on waiting lists for community services, whether child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, or community psychological services.  That was the situation before Covid.  We are aware that A Vision for Change was not funded adequately.  There has been a shortfall of &euro;50 million in funding in recent years for the implementation of A Vision for Change.  Sharing the Vision has finally been published, and it has a price tag attached to it.  It has not been provided for in the winter plan.<\/p>  <p>  That was the pre-Covid position.  With Covid, it is significantly worse.  We heard the very good contribution of Deputy Lahart, who very eloquently described the circumstances in which people find themselves as a result of the major psychological impact of Covid.  Isolation, depression, anxiety, grief and loss are all taking a very significant psychological toll.  More than ever, we need to put in place significant funding to address the major mental health problem we are storing up, which is at the point of exploding.  Most Members of this House have referred to it as a crisis coming down the tracks very quickly owing to inadequate services.  It is just shocking that no provision was made for mental health services in the winter plan.  I cannot understand it.  I cannot understand what the Minister has been doing, nor can I understand what the Minister of State has been doing.  It is deeply disappointing.  I urge the Minister to make this a priority in the budget in a couple of weeks.<\/p>  <p>  There is a major omission in respect of disability services.  There is no mention of these in the winter plan.  There was an announcement of &euro;10 million last Sunday but the Minister knows that falls very far short of what is required.<\/p> <p>We now have a situation where large numbers of family carers are looking after their loved ones at home because many services closed during Covid.  At this point, some of them are opening, but only gradually and for approximately one day per week or, at most, two days per week.  There is a huge level of need in this area.  There are 1,250 primary carers over the age of 70 caring at home for somebody with an intellectual disability, 400 of whom are carers aged 80 or more.  This is shocking and it has been going on now for over six months and is taking a huge toll on people.  Many children with disabilities for whom timely services are essential in order to meet their milestones are being denied access to essential therapies that should be provided at community level, including speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and so on.  Many respite services are closed or severely restricted.  People with intellectual disabilities are experiencing severe mental health challenges as they struggle to cope in the current circumstances.<\/p> <p> The Minister is aware of the cost of addressing the huge gaps in services.  He is also aware of the cost of putting in place the additional services that are required as a result of Covid and meeting all of the requirements under public health advice.  What he provided last Sunday was a small fraction of that cost.  It is not good enough.  These are the most vulnerable citizens and they must be catered for and looked after in the upcoming budget.  <\/p> <p> On intensive care beds, we knew pre-Covid that we were hugely underprovided in this area.  We had less than half the recommended number according to European standards.  There has been some small number of additional ICU beds provided.  The fear last March was around the low level of ICU beds.  We had so much catching up to do.  What is provided for in this plan in terms of net additional beds is 17.  Inclusive of all that is funded under the winter plan, we are still more than 200 beds short of the pre-Covid requirement.  I put it to the Minister that this is hopeless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100041#QQ00200","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601567100,"counter":332,"content":"<p>The next contributor is Deputy Murnane O'Connor, who is sharing time with Deputy Alan Farrell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100042#RR00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1601567100,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  The winter plan seeks, in part, to protect services and patient care delivery.  I am concerned about the lack of services in the community for those in need of palliative care.  Palliative care teams are fantastic but there is not enough of them.  People could die without this care because of under-resourced services.  This winter more people will die but we cannot allow their families to spend precious last days fighting for care for their loved ones.  It is imperative that the Minister properly staffs this resource.  We cannot have a family sharing a palliative care team with another family and have one patient die while the team is attending the other patient.  This happened in my constituency this week.  The family concerned was devastated.  I have been working with them since.  No family should have that experience because of a lack of resources.<\/p>  <p>  Today marks the beginning of breast cancer awareness month.  When will breast screening services resume?  I have been told that there is a waiting list of 12 to 14 weeks.  While cancer can in some cases be slow to move, anxiety is not.  Patients were not able to access screening because of Covid and in some cases they were too afraid to discuss their symptoms with their GPs or they could not access a GP because of Covid.  Adding to their anxiety by extending waiting times is not acceptable.  I know that this is a priority area for the Minister and I ask that he provide me with an update on it.<\/p>  <p>  I want to comment on the current restrictions in Dublin and Donegal.  I think restrictions might be imposed on more counties soon on the basis of the current figures.  As things stand today, will restrictions have an impact on services in counties?  In other words, if restrictions are imposed on more counties will services be affected?  Will people be told to not attend services?<\/p>  <p>  I also want to speak about the impact of Covid-19 on our mental health services.  It concerns me that this pandemic exposes the huge gaps in our services.  Many more people are seeking to access supports during this difficult time.  We know that our mental health system was under serious pressure prior to the pandemic and it is even more stretched now.  Our communities are in dire need of funding to support them through this tough time.  Mental Health Reform, the national coalition of 70 plus different organisations, launched its pre-budget submission seeking an increase in staffed mental health services, the development of an out-of-hours crisis service to give people quick and easy access to services, investment in primary care mental health and talk therapy to enable prevention and early intervention, support for the community and voluntary sector to continue providing essential mental services , investment in individual placements and support to help people get back to work.  We need to resource these services.<\/p>  <p>   Earlier, the Minister spoke about the excellent work being done by our paramedics.  I compliment the service in Carlow.  We have excellent paramedics who are going to houses to carry out testing.  We are two or three days behind.  I raised the following issue at the recent meeting of the Covid committee but it is important to raise it again now.  For three years now, I have been raising the Department's promised investment of &euro;350,000 for a building to house this service.  Currently, it is housed in a prefab with one shower to cater for a number of paramedics.  It is important that funding is provided.<\/p>  <p>  My other concern is in regard to staffing in general.  It is brilliant to have ambition for the plan.  I believe this winter plan is ambitious but I have concerns.  Who will staff these beds?  How will those staff be paid?  Will our student nurses be paid, as our student doctors are paid?  How will we pay for these resources in the middle of the pandemic?  Are we represented on the national doctors training and planning, NDTP, medical workforce speciality review specific to each area of medicine in Ireland?  I am conscious of glaring gaps in our medical workforce.  For example, in the south west for a population of over 500,000 there are only 2.4 public health specialists, which is not near enough.  I welcome the announcement yesterday that 250 more specialists are to come on stream nationwide.  Is the HSE actively recruiting and to what areas will staff be deployed?  It is important we know this.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the &euro;138 million for home care supports and additional hours.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has been working hard on this provision.  I welcome that provision.  It is so important.  When will the funding be made available and will the Minister of State provide a breakdown of the allocations, in particular for CHO5, which is my area?  I also welcome the ten new dementia advisers.  When will these jobs be taken up and, again, will any of them be deployed to CHO5?<\/p>  <p>  This is a &euro;600 million plan.  We have to welcome it.  How we use that money is important.  I know from interactions with the Ministers of State, Deputies Butler and Rabbitte, in regard to disability services that a lot of services will get funding, although I note it was mentioned earlier there is nothing much in the plan in regard to disability services.<\/p>  <p>  The flu vaccine was mentioned.  We will be living with Covid for a long time and we are heading into the winter, which will be a difficult time for young and old.  We are living in a different world.  We will probably never see anything like this again in terms of the recession and the changing times.  Families are trying to watch out for each other and people are afraid to go outside in case they catch the virus and pass it on to someone else.  We have to be careful.  Do we have enough flu vaccine and, if not, do we have a plan if we run out of it? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100042#RR00300","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1601567100,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I welcome this debate.  As we are all acutely aware, 2020 has presented a monumental challenge for our health services.  We have demanded huge sacrifices from our nurses, doctors, paramedics and all of the staff who keep our hospitals and all medical facilities running safely every day.  This winter, unfortunately, promises to present even more challenges for our health infrastructure and front-line staff.  It is imperative that we prepare in the right way to ensure we have the ability and capability to deal effectively with the obstacles that we will be faced with in the months ahead.<\/p>  <p>  Members of this House will be acutely aware that Covid-19 will remain with us for some time.  We will likely see spikes in infection and hospitalisations.  We know also that during the pandemic other illnesses do not cease.  People still require hospitalisation for a myriad of conditions and we must have adequate resources in place to manage these risks and prevent our health services being stretched insofar as we can.  I am pleased that we have a commitment to a significant increase in spending, staff and beds.  These will be much needed as our front-line staff endure what is no doubt going to be a difficult winter.<\/p> <p> As we continue our fight against Covid-19 in the months ahead, testing will become an important feature for us to understand the direction in which the virus is heading.  We must remain ambitious in this endeavour and put in place operational capacity to avoid the development of backlogs and other associated pitfalls.  In the early stages of the pandemic there was a large reduction in the number of people attending emergency departments, as has been mentioned during this debate.  There have also been reductions in the number of people presenting with other non-Covid related illnesses for fear of contracting the virus.  We do not yet know the full extent of the ramifications this will have for the long-term health of the population.  Successfully overcoming many conditions requires timely intervention.  Providing confidence to the public will be an important feature of avoiding a repeat of this situation, along with the implementation of improved access to healthcare through technology, remote clinics and improved community care, which will be greatly appreciated in my constituency of Dublin Fingal and is included in the winter plan.<\/p> <p> It is also vital that there is a significant take-up of the winter flu vaccine, as my colleague just mentioned.  Historically, we struggled to have large take-up of the vaccine, even among healthcare professionals.  This year, however, there is an obvious need for maximum engagement.  The expansion of free access to the vaccine was a very positive step in this regard.  As the vaccine is available now, we must encourage as many people as possible to get it, through information and communication campaigns across all media platforms.  By doing so, we will avoid the potential for increased pressure on the health services as a result of a bad winter flu season.<\/p> <p> I wish to refer to a comment made by Deputy Shortall in a previous debate on a previous day when she spoke about the need for political parties and none to engage collectively in promoting the message of engaging with the health services for ailments that might be worrying people.  She referred to influencers and the like.  There should be some unity of purpose in the House in terms of the political leadership that is shown to promote the uptake of a winter flu vaccine by collectively messaging the public.  Perhaps it could be through a single video to show the unity of purpose of this House and the Seanad.  It could also relate to the messaging on Covid-19.  It is worthy of our consideration.  Success in respect of the availability of the winter flu vaccine may also enhance our ability to encourage take-up of the Covid vaccine, should one be developed and approved for use in the near future.  This afternoon, RT&Eacute; published a poll showing that 32% of people expressed an unwillingness to take up the first vaccine for Covid when it becomes available and a further 12% were unsure if they would take up the vaccine.<\/p> <p> The winter plan, correctly, focuses on protecting as many vulnerable people as possible.  This is the challenge for all of us.  We must come together as a nation to protect vulnerable people, their families and friends, our neighbours and even strangers we may never meet.  We will survive the pandemic due to the individual sacrifices of people.  The Irish people are ready and willing to protect these people again.  It is our job to ensure we can provide a strong and capable health service that will have the ability to cater for the demands of this winter and, indeed, repay the sacrifice of front-line workers who are at the coalface each day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100042#RR00400","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601567700,"counter":336,"content":"<p>At this point we all accept that the period of time we are dealing with is at least six to nine months.  A number of Members mentioned the necessity for test, trace and isolate capacity.  I reiterate that somebody must examine areas such as Dundalk and north County Louth, which has problems at present with an increase in cases.  However, the test centre is moving to Ardee.  That must be examined.  In fairness, Deputy Munster has been strongly urging that Drogheda also needs a test centre.  These are two major urban areas.<\/p>  <p>  Members referred to the flu vaccine.  We must ensure we have the stocks and the capacity.  This must happen because otherwise we will create a pile of problems for ourselves.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Members have said that the plan has stop-gap fixes and spoke about the need for more long-term planning, particularly on delivering ICU bed capacity.  I hope some of their questions will be answered, be it by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, or the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to deal with a number of issues regarding non-Covid care.  I previously raised the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS.  I have been contacted by a number of people who use these services and also use intellectual disability services.  There are far fewer dental practitioners using the scheme at present.  It is a difficulty for anybody who has a medical card.  It requires action and a delivery plan because there does not appear to be a solution at present.  We have all heard the horror stories about children in very bad circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Today, one of my colleagues raised the fact that St. John of God Community Services says it will cease its involvement in the provision of community services by 1 October 2021.  It currently provides intellectual, disability and mental health services to more than 8,000 children, adolescents and adults and employs 3,000 staff and volunteers in 300 locations across Dublin, Kildare, Kerry, Wicklow, Meath and Louth.  A large number of people will be impacted, including workers.  Families are incredibly worried about whether the service provision will happen.  We must get some type of solution.  I am thinking of the families, the service users and the workers in places such Drumcar and the St. John of God Venegas Centre in Dundalk.  Perhaps we could get an answer regarding a plan.<\/p>  <p>  Like many Members, I am worried that this plan does not deal with mental health services.  I spoke to the Ministers of State, Deputies Rabbitte and Butler, earlier this week about a number of cases of County Louth that are incredibly important and which will require a follow-up meeting with mental health services in the county.  Perhaps the Minister of State would be good enough to meet some of the families to hear about their issues, because it is an ongoing situation and we need to provide some clarity on protocols and a solution that facilitates a service that people deserve.  I would be grateful if that could happen as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I am also curious about another issue relating to St. John of God Community Services.  I understand that a system had been set up whereby a portal was to be opened and services were to put in their requests for what they would require to operate in the present circumstances.  While I accept that, at times, not every request will be delivered, I am confused about how we went from that to a situation where St. John of God Community Services is saying it is ceasing operations.  There should be clarity about that as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>   As this is my last opportunity to speak in the House this week, I welcome the fact that the European Commission has taken legal action against the British Government due to its illegal action with the Internal Market Bill, which is endangering the Irish protocol, the withdrawal agreement, the Good Friday Agreement and business, society and life across Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100043#SS00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1601567700,"counter":337,"content":"<p>You are wandering outside the remit of the subject matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100043#SS00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1601567700,"counter":338,"content":"<p>It is his last time to speak this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100043#SS00400","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1601567700,"counter":339,"content":"<p>Unless I get speaking time from another Member.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100043#SS00500","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1601567700,"counter":340,"content":"<p>The Deputy has clocked up a fair few minutes already.

The conflicting advice, confused rules and regulations and lack of clarity about what needs to be done and what we are doing from the Government are feeding into that fear.<\/p> <p>In this context, I would love to be able to say something positive about the announced winter plan.  I am afraid I cannot because those at the front line of the health service, our nurses, doctors and consultants, have made it clear that this plan is not addressing the crisis.  We could say it is a sticking plaster but in reality it is more akin to a policy of saying a prayer and hoping for the best.  It is said that Covid-19 is ruthless in seeking out the most vulnerable, those with underlying conditions or with a fragility.  That is one reason the fear in this country is so high.  We have over 1 million citizens with underlying conditions and their families and loved ones are also in fear.  This pandemic is also ruthless in exposing the weaknesses and underlying conditions in our economic, social and health systems.  When this crisis started last March, the then Minister for Health acknowledged that a two-tier, dysfunctional health system was not fit for purpose in dealing with a pandemic.  He gave us the impression that the Government was gone all socialist and was going to provide a one-tier system based on need and not on the ability to pay.  It is now clear that no such policy was ever planned.  Even as the virus ploughs ahead, we remain committed to a two-tier health system.  The winter plan will see us repeat temporary purchasing at very high prices from the private sector with no vision of the permanent capacity increase that we need.  Of the 1,500 new beds announced as part of the winter plan, which is to cover us from now until April, there seem to be only 528 actual new beds.  Will the Minister of State confirm that or is it more PR spin that the Government thinks will fool the virus?<\/p> <p> That lack of real vision of a plan to fundamentally change the system is another reason people have real fears.  We must compare these details with what the front-line workers are saying.  The Irish Hospital Consultants Association says we need an extra 2,000 inpatient beds at a minimum and has called for a doubling of ICU beds.  We are getting an extra 17.  The INMO has pointed out that many of the 300 beds opened under last year's winter initiative are now closed due to staff shortages.  If we cannot keep beds open from last year because of staff shortages - one hospital in the east has 400 nursing vacancies - how in the hell can we be confident that we will staff this plan?  In a pandemic crisis such as this we need emergency steps.  We need to take over the private hospitals, end agency staffing and bring workers into the HSE in a permanent capacity on permanent contracts to end this two-tier system and to show everybody that we are indeed all in this together and that there is real social solidarity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100043#SS00700","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601568300,"counter":343,"content":"<p>Last week it was announced that Tallaght hospital has had to cancel elective surgeries and close operating theatres due to the second wave of Covid and the major threat it poses to our entire health service.  This comes on top of the closure of Tallaght hospital's children's accident and emergency department and its rushed downgrade last month.  Decades of Government neglect mean our hospitals have a serious underlying condition, namely underfunding.  Thousands of hospital beds have been closed.  Pleas for more staff have been ignored.  The result is that we have a health service that struggles to cope.  Winter is coming and our health staff and hospitals need urgent support.  We also must learn the lessons of this crisis and vow to reverse the decades of neglect which Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith has spoken about, the entrenched two-tier system which is further and further entrenched, and instead build a one-tier, quality national health service in Ireland.  Tallaght hospital needs immediate relief but it also needs long-term investment.<\/p>  <p>  It is shameful that mental health services have been completely forgotten in the Government's winter plan.  Not a single cent has been set aside in this plan for mental health services.  Even before the pandemic, we had massive backlogs and waiting lists for basic mental health services and supports.  The Covid crisis has made it much worse.  As well as the extra stresses and strains on people resulting in a significant increase in referrals to mental health supports, we have also seen the suspension and delaying of many of those supports.  We need emergency funding for mental health services.  We need to be investing in remote psychotherapy and counselling services for those in need and supporting our mental health services.  <\/p>  <p>  It struck me in the course of the last week with the extra round of announcements of advisers for junior ministers that the Government now employs 64 special political advisers but only 60 specialist public health doctors.  It is a Government that has more spin doctors than public health doctors.  In the midst of a global pandemic, the Government is finally talking about investing in public health but we need urgent action here.  We need significant investment in tracking and tracing in particular.  Despite all of the Government's spin, the reality is that Ireland is still testing at about half the rate of similar sized countries like Denmark.  We are still not testing many close contacts such as those in schools.  We need to invest in public health, testing and tracing as part of a strategy to crush the curve and to eliminate community transmission.

I welcome the Government's decision to invest an additional &euro;600 million in health services this winter.  Healthcare workers the length and breadth of the country have worked tirelessly throughout this pandemic and we are going to ask even more of them in the coming months.  This investment will go some way towards supporting them as they care for their patients.  The plan provides more hospital and community beds and significantly increased homecare support.  Some 34 new beds are to be opened at Cork University Hospital under this plan and additional beds are also due to be opened at Mercy University Hospital.  While this is a welcome and much-needed measure, any extra capacity also requires extra staffing.  I note that the INMO general secretary, Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha, has expressed concern about the lack of detail around the staff planning arrangements.  The success of this plan will be contingent on the recruitment of additional staff.  I would like to ask the Minister of State whether her Department could provide further clarity or detail on how the HSE intends to recruit the 12,500 additional staff to provide this care.  A constituent of mine was due to undergo an assessment in hospital recently but the doctor carrying out the assessment was deployed elsewhere as a result of Covid-19.  A few months later another doctor was assigned.  It is my understanding that a few assessments resumed but were halted again in recent weeks due to the increase in cases.  I would be hopeful that the Minister could put in place a significant and detailed staffing plan to avoid incidents like this over the coming months.  We are all too aware that waiting lists are at record levels and Covid-19 is affecting the overall capacity of the system.  I have been contacted by many constituents expressing concern that their elective procedures may be cancelled.  The winter plan is estimating some 10,000 outpatient appointments, 2,879 inpatient procedures, nearly 18,000 day case procedures and nearly 3,000 gastrointestinal scopes.  I ask the Minister of State to do everything possible to ensure these procedures go ahead.<\/p>  <p>  Cancer services have been mentioned by a number of Members this evening.  I ask that the Minister of State ensure that reduced cancer services do not become the new norm in Ireland as the Covid-19 pandemic continues.  Cancer patients need to be diagnosed and treated at the earliest opportunity.  I ask the Minister of State to commit the necessary funding to cancer services.  As we are all well aware, the three screening services, BreastCheck, BowelScreen and CervicalCheck were cancelled in March.  CervicalCheck reopened in July and BowelScreen in August.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State could provide confirmation of when BreastCheck will reopen.  In respect of all three screening services, I ask that a huge effort is made to ensure that screening and cancer test backlogs are cleared as early as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the &euro;10 million that was made available to disability services last week by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  She met a number of groups in Cork in the past few months including Cope Foundation and various others.  It needs to be acknowledged that the additional funding will make a big difference to day services not just in Cork but around the country.<\/p>  <p>  I was listening to the debate from my office before I came down and wish to respond to some of the adjectives that were used by members of the Opposition.  We are not even in the middle of winter yet.  People are calling for unity on one stage.  I do not think it is the time for ideological battles.<\/p> <p>There are Members on this side of the House who believe in ending a two-tier service in healthcare.  I do not believe now, in the middle of a pandemic, is the time to be talking about ideological differences.  We are facing what will probably be the worst winter in our history in terms of healthcare provision and the people need to get behind the Department of Health, the Minister for Health and the various Ministers of State who have a very difficult task ahead.  As I said, I was baffled by some of the adjectives used, such as \"underwhelming\", \"fantasy list\", \"lacking ambition\" and \"a failure\".  It is a failure and it has not even started.  We all knowledge there are difficulties in the Department of Health and in healthcare provision in this country.  In the middle of a pandemic, however, and facing the worst winter we are likely to face in terms of flu and with Covid-19, the people need to get off the stage and get behind the health services and the Ministers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100044#TT00300","speaker":"1521","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601568900,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I am here behind the Minister but I have his back, so it is okay. He need not worry.  I very much welcome the plan.  It is unprecedented in scale and funding of &euro;600 million.  We have never seen the likes of it previously for a winter plan.  Clearly, the Minister's fingerprints are all over it with, I believe, close to five million hours of home care.  That is huge and it is significant.  It is something previous Governments and previous Members, including Opposition leaders, have been calling for consistently, and that is something we will deliver on.  I congratulate the Minister on that because it will make a huge difference to families, to communities and, most importantly, to the elderly people who this was intended to help.  I congratulate him on that and fair play to him.  He came into this role with a lot of passion and fair play to him for fighting for that allocation.  It is incredibly important.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, the winter plan was never going to be all-encompassing.  There were elements that all of us, Government Members as well, would like to have seen included.  Perhaps, therefore, the following could be seen as much as a budget plea as a plea to have it included in the winter plan and that it could be included in aspects of the health budget.<\/p>  <p>  The first topic I wish to touch on is disability services.  I appreciate from the announcement that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, fought tooth and nail for funding towards disability services.  She managed to secure &euro;10 million in conjunction with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly.  Unfortunately, in terms of the overall scale and the overall picture for disability services, it is only the tip of the iceberg and only scratches the surface.  The truth of the matter is that because of chronic underfunding in previous years, the reality is that disability services need a budget of in or around &euro;100 million to bring them up to an absolute acceptable standard.  That is just the reality.  While I appreciate that &euro;10 million will go some way towards that, we certainly need more allocated towards disability services.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, was briefed by the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers during the week.  I believe the picture and the story the representatives painted for her was pretty bleak and told a story of where we are at.  There are approximately 26,000 users within the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers.  Of that figure, for 400 of the families the main carer is in his or her 80s.  I believe it was alluded to earlier in the House.  That has massive implications.  Obviously, because the carer is elderly, it completely limits the amount of services the actual service user, which is a child in this situation, can avail of.  That is worrying.  Obviously, the person cannot go out into the community because of the fear of the elderly carer contracting coronavirus, which we know is devastating for people in their 80s and upwards.<\/p>  <p>  A further non-Covid related issue is the fact that many of these children and servicer users are well into their 40s, 50s and 60s.  There is a fear and anxiety that goes with the fact that their parents and main carers are becoming elderly and there is no service coming in to replace that.  That is a pretty stark reality.  There are some users with primary carers in their 90s, so it is pretty stark.  That goes further, because another group is coming up behind where the main carers are in their 60s.  Unless we put the residential care facilities and day care facilities in place, there will be serious concern and anxiety and those vulnerable groups will be left exposed.<\/p>  <p>  Services obviously have had to be greatly reduced during Covid-19.  They are only running at approximately 40% capacity from what I can gather.  I know first-hand of a fantastic voluntary service provider in west Cork called CoAction West Cork, and I have spoken to the Minister about this previously.  It is fantastic and I have seen first-hand the difference it makes for its service users.  The interaction between the staff and the service users is phenomenal.  Obviously, over the past six or seven months there has been an absolute void and it has been running at a very reduced capacity.  That will have an impact going forward.  With that said, to make the disability service sector work properly, it needs significantly more funding, and budget 2021 is an opportunity to do that.<\/p>  <p>  Another aspect of health that could have been more strongly represented in the winter plan, but again this can be taken as a budgetary plea, is the whole area of mental health, which has been touched on a lot here.  Historically, it has been chronically underfunded but now, for the first time, perhaps, in the past five or six years we have started to open up and talk about mental health and our own mental health experiences within the family and the community.  That is important.  However, that conversation exposes the fact that the whole service has been chronically underfunded.  As a Government, we now need to step in and address that because so many families and people nationwide are impacted by this.  That has been stressed all day in the Chamber during this debate.<\/p>  <p>  I must make a plea for Bantry General Hospital in my constituency of west Cork.  I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, on several occasions about this and he is well aware of it.  I wish, however, to make this plea in the D&aacute;il.  There is a 24-hour acute emergency access service in Bantry hospital at the moment.  It is vitally important when one thinks about the geographical nature of west Cork and how big it is.  The journey from somewhere like Castletownbere to Cork University Hospital takes hours, so Bantry provides a really important service.  There is 24-hour acute emergency access there at the moment.  That is underpinned by the provision of an anaesthetist but we need support anaesthesiology there to ensure the service remains.  The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, is aware of it but I wanted to take this opportunity to highlight it in the D&aacute;il Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100045#UU00200","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1601568900,"counter":347,"content":"<p>A previous speaker from the Fianna F&aacute;il Party suggested that we should all put our differences aside and simply get behind our health services and the Ministers.  I would like nothing more than to do that.  It is very difficult, however, to just simply get behind our Minister and our health services when dealing daily, as I do and, I am sure, as other Members do, with sectoral interests, people who are at the coalface and people who are in need of services and treatment, none more so than those reliant on our disability services.<\/p>  <p>  The failure of the Minister to include additional funding resources or investment provisions for disability and dementia services in the winter plan is astounding.  His subsequent announcement of a meagre &euro;10 million for disability day services and home support six months into the pandemic has been met with shock and dismay by the sector.  To say it falls short of the urgent needs of the 643,133 people with disabilities in the State today is an understatement of the highest order.<\/p>  <p>  Disability services, as the Minister will be aware, submitted their Covid-related costs to the HSE in June, so the Minister knows that the moneys that were announced on Monday past are just a fraction of the funding needed to deliver services.  I should not have to remind the Minister of his Government's commitment under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I cannot overstate the personal toll and long-term impact of the withdrawal of care and supports for people with disabilities, their families and carers.  I am calling and pleading again on the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, to address the funding crisis for disability services in budget 2021 and to bring their funding resources and capital investment needs on a sustainable footing going forward.<\/p>  <p>  On that note, I wish to raise this issue again with the Minister, because every time I try, unfortunately, for one reason or another, I cannot eyeball him across this Chamber, the issue of the group home for people with disabilities in Carrickmacross.  This group home was accepted as a very important resource that was warranted back the early 2000s.<\/p> <p>From that point on the families of the people who will reside in this group home had to fight tooth and nail every step of the way.<\/p> <p> The building was finally completed in 2016 and then disgracefully and remarkably the HSE announced it had no money to run it.  Every year we have been told that it will be considered for the following year's Estimates.  Unfortunately, at a political level during the terms of several Ministers, the response has been to say that this is a HSE matter.  I ask the Minister of State to bring this message once again to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly.  This is a political issue and we need political accountability.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, responds to my request.  He should bring together the relevant officials in his Department and in the HSE along with representatives of any other bodies involved, such as the Respond housing agency, Monaghan County Council and whoever needs to be brought around a table to resolve this issue.  These are young adults with very profound physical and sensory disabilities.  Their needs have been assessed and the health services have decided that they are best placed in the long term in this group home.<\/p> <p> The group home, which is finished, is a fine building.  It needs a few bits and pieces to be changed, but it is essentially ready to become operational.  Unfortunately, the HSE has decided that its operation will be outsourced to a private company if it can get somebody to tender for it, which is incredibly disappointing because there was no reference to that before the building was completed.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, to convene that round-table meeting as I have suggested, after which I will be the first to commend the Minister and get, as the Minister of State's Fianna F&aacute;il colleague asked us to do, behind the Minister and the health services because we want the winter plan to work.  Those at the coalface of the disability services need the cash, the resources and the infrastructure to do it.  A key part of that infrastructure in the south Monaghan and surrounding area is the group home in Carrickmacross.  I again plead with the Minister of State to ensure it becomes operational without delay. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100045#UU00300","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601569500,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I want to put on record my support for any measures that will help beat this virus.  The Government plan is framed under a number of headings including: building capacity; service continuity; pathways to care; PPE; testing and contact tracing; public health; and e-health.<\/p>  <p>  I agree that we need to address the building capacity in the current climate.  The proposal to open an additional 251 acute beds and 89 acute beds from now until December and a further 232 acute beds in the first quarter of 2021 is to be welcomed and supported.  It is stated in the plan that we can increase efficiency levels by 30% to 40% through new ways of working.  If this can be achieved it will be welcome, but I would be interested to know how exactly this efficiency can be achieved and if successful why it has not been implemented prior to this.  I welcome the that intermediate care capacity is to be expanded.<\/p>  <p>  One of the measures being undertaken is the repurposing of some centres through refurbishments and extensions.  I ask the Minister to expand on this and give a timeline for these measures.  I am concerned that we need the measures now and when I hear that extensions and refurbishments are involved, I fear that these will be drawn out and not delivered on time.  However, I welcome the plan for an additional 530 new rehabilitation beds to be operational by April 2021.<\/p>  <p>  I note also that the HSE will once again enter into an arrangement with private hospitals should a surge in Covid cases happen.  Again, I would be concerned at the costs involved.  Can we be sure that we are getting full value for money?  With regard to the service continuity section of the plan, I note that a restoration of services in the community is necessary for the continuation of support of people in maintaining health and well-being and to avoid activity being directed to acute settings.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister knows I have constantly advocated for the restoration of services to Louth County Hospital in Dundalk.  The hospital in Dundalk is a fantastic facility and needs to be supported.  Now is the perfect opportunity to increase the services at the hospital with this winter plan.  Furthermore, any investment in the hospital is a long-term investment and not just for the winter season.<\/p>  <p>  The Louth County Hospital in Dundalk has the potential to make a real difference to the north east.  It can act as a real support to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, which as we know has suffered from capacity issues in the past.  The investment at the Louth County Hospital will show real results immediately.  I once more urge the Minister to consider the potential of the Louth County Hospital to make a real difference in this current crisis.  I invite him to visit the hospital and see for himself the real difference it can make.<\/p>  <p>  I note from the pathways to care section of the plan that it is planned to have a total of 20 hubs available from the period January to April 2021 and I welcome this.  However, I am concerned that it is anticipated that only 70% of pre-Covid-19 productivity can be achieved with regard to emergency department pathways for non-Covid presentation.  We must be aiming for 100% and more.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately waiting lists have now reached record numbers standing now at 704,000 in total.  This is unacceptable and must be properly addressed.<\/p>  <p>  Cancer treatment services have also been reduced during the Covid crisis.  While I understand the pressures that were placed on the health services, it is simply not right that those requiring cancer treatment or diagnosis were left untreated.  This cannot be allowed continue.  We must prioritise those who require urgent treatment.  Cancer treatment must not suffer.<\/p>  <p>  The plan notes that many centres are now struggling to deliver pre-Covid levels of service and this needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  The plan contains many proposals, but we need real action now.<\/p>  <p>  In the section on PPE, testing and contact tracing, the plan states that the HSE is in the process of developing a sustainable Covid-19 test-and-trace service and that the new service model being developed will strengthen underpinning processes to ensure that the service is sustainable and of a high quality into the winter months and beyond.  It also states that the detailed design for the final model is still a work in progress, which is unacceptable.  How can a final model still only be a work in progress at this stage?<\/p>  <p>  It is important that the HSE gets value for money in its purchasing of PPE.  I am glad to note that this is mentioned in the plan although it only states that the HSE expects to achieve price reductions.<\/p>  <p>  There is little mention of the flu vaccine in the plan other than stating it is to include two to 12 year olds.  It is vital that we get the flu vaccine right.  Many GPs are complaining that they do not have supplies of the vaccine now.  We must not create a new problem with the flu vaccine in our fight with Covid.  It is important for the Minister to make a statement on the availability of the flu vaccine and give clarity on the availability now.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the publication of the winter plan and while I agree with a substantial part of it, it is important that the Minister addresses the issues I have raised today.  We need clarity on the value-for-money element of the plan to work with private hospitals, clarity on the continuing treatment for cancer sufferers to ensure that they do not become a victim of this pandemic, clarity on the testing-and-tracing system and why it is still only a work in progress and clarity on the availability on the flu vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  I once more invite the Minister to visit the Louth County Hospital in Dundalk to see for himself the great work that is currently taking place there and the great potential the hospital has for additional services.  I have no doubt once he sees the potential of this hospital, he will see how with some investment the Louth County Hospital will once more have the services that people of the north east deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100046#VV00200","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1601569500,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Since the arrival of Covid into our country a clear and present danger has existed not just to the lives of our elderly and vulnerable, but also to the social and economic cohesion of our State.  Covid-19 is largely a killer of the elderly and those with underlying medical vulnerabilities.  Thankfully our knowledge of dealing with and treating this illness has advanced greatly over the past six months.  Despite its dangers, Covid must not be allowed to sideline the many other significant healthcare areas in which patients need support, particularly cancer, trauma, disability, mental health and chronic disease.<\/p>  <p>  The recent Government announcements of increased funding for the winter plan and the overall healthcare sector include the addition of &euro;600 million to fund more front-line staff to develop additional ICU and HDU bed capacity, to provide additional hospital beds and to ramp up to 4.7 million additional home care support hours, which are greatly welcomed.  While the funding is welcomed, along with these resources, health service managers must seriously look at how they can reorganise and innovate to deliver increased efficiency in hospital throughput.  In our acute care hospitals, the issues of Covid planning pathways must be reviewed with respect to daily case scheduling.  We need innovative thinking such as expanding diagnostic services, particularly in scanning and scoping to address the backlog of cancer patients awaiting access to care and treatment.  We need increased radiology, diagnostic scoping and biopsies to address the significant waiting times which are emerging in symptomatic and prostate cancer services.<\/p>  <p>  Medical needs extend to my constituency of Waterford, where, as the Minister of State will know, waiting times for diagnostic angiograms have extended up to 12 months again.  We must consider the use of the National Treatment Purchase Fund in both public and private hospital settings to support extending these service opportunities.  Our first priority must continue to be to secure the health of our elderly, particularly those in residential accommodation.  We need to ensure ongoing randomised testing of healthcare workers and strict visitor infection protocols particularly over the winter months.<\/p> <p>Rapid diagnostic tests, though shunned by NPHET to date have shown a pathway to increasing random testing elsewhere in the world, and it is to be hoped we will see their use authorised here as soon as possible.  The announcement of the additional 700 swabbers and contact tracers is welcome given that is should allow health staff to return to their jobs where they are so badly needed.<\/p> <p> The focus in the winter plan on keeping people with physical health needs out of hospital is welcome.  However, patients with ongoing mental health and disability issues appear to have been bypassed in the plan as no money has been provided to address their needs or how they can be cared for in the community.  This is an area of healthcare that must receive additional priority and allocation of resources.  The Government has given us a winter healthcare plan, and although it is extensive in comparison to previous years, the health care needs of our nation have never been greater.  We must continue to rely on the truly great legions of healthcare workers in our State who look after our citizens as well as they can.  We must persevere in calling all in our community to continue adhering to all of the Covid rules that we have learned in recent months so that, despite intermittent cluster outbreaks and lockdowns as months elapse, we can repair our economy and health services and, it is hoped, steer a path from this global pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100046#VV00300","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601570100,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I will make a number of points with respect to the winter plan.  First, I welcome the additional funding across a number of areas.  The reality is that this must, out of necessity, be a dynamic process as it is responding to a situation that is changing almost daily.  However, there are a number of challenges that come with that uncertainty and the need to respond quickly.<\/p>  <p>  I draw attention to those requiring services on a long-standing basis who have found the last number of months incredibly difficult.  It is very encouraging that extra funds for homeless supports have been included in the measures.  This is an issue that impacts the whole country but is keenly felt in my own constituency.  Services were already under pressure from increased numbers in 2019.  Dublin Simon Community saw an 18% increase in demand for homeless healthcare services last year and provided access to treatment for more than 1,200 people.  There was also an increase in waiting times for access to related services over the previous year.  For example, for access to detox services the wait time increased by 84%.<\/p>  <p>  The same organisation has now also warned of a health crisis in the homeless population in the capital due to the pressure on funding and a shortage of suitable accommodation.  Covid has brought the entire system for homelessness and addiction supports to the very brink of capacity.  I am aware in my own constituency that the constraints of the pandemic mean that many service providers need additional space.  They need more sanitation facilities in particular.  A lack of facilities has not only impacted the people who need this most basic human right but it also has a knock-on impact in the local community as service providers spill out.  I would urge the Minister for Health to consider capital funding and confirmed multi-annual funding for the provision or lease of buildings to those groups to accommodate the increase in need along with the constraints that Covid represents in terms of delivering those services.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, I very much welcome the inclusion of considerable funding for home care, for community health networks and for GP diagnostics.  I am very aware though that Covid has put immense pressure on people's mental health and has had a huge impact on persons with disabilities and their families.  I would urge the Minister for Health to consider the long term impact of poor mental health and a lack of disability services within the community and to bear this in mind when making decisions around the budget in the next few days, as the sector needs far more than has been announced or included in the winter plan.<\/p>  <p>  Second, I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the report this week from the Parliamentary Budget Office on expenditure undertaken this year and its concerns around transparency and accountability.  Again, I am aware from my own constituency that private hospitals in many cases provided absolutely vital capacity to the public sector during the Covid-19 crisis and they facilitated the continuation of care in other medical specialties.  This was really important and worthwhile.  However, the winter plan document outlines that almost 10% of the total winter plan spend of &euro;604 million is going to go to private hospitals.  There is, however, scant detail provided on what we are getting for this other than that some of it will be used for elective procedures, which is not in itself a bad idea if it increases capacity in public hospitals, but again we do not really have enough detail.  None of it is being used for surge capacity and this would need to be provided separately.  If we were going to spend taxpayers&rsquo; money with private hospital operators, we need to be clear right now on what exactly we are getting for the amount we are spending and what outcomes we are expecting as a result of that spend.<\/p>  <p>  Covid has changed us and our communities irrevocably, and no winter plan will paper over the cracks of a system that needs reform.  The pandemic has been a shock and awe event for our health service.  The leadership of clinicians and front-line staff has never been more meaningful or more impactful, and the reality is that our health service for years has focused on servicing the needs of organisations, not always the needs of patients.  Covid has allowed us to cut through some of that.  We need Sl&aacute;intecare and we should seize this moment because we need it now.  Let us allow our time of adversity also be our moment of clarity.  Let us begin the active implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Let us give ourselves a deadline.  I think it should be spring 2023.  That is 30 months.  Let us be ambitious.  The NHS in the United Kingdom was established in 1948 at a time when their public finances were in total disarray and the future seemed incredibly challenging and very uncertain.  That sounds very familiar to all of us right now but they pushed forward towards their vision of universal health care for everybody and we should push forward with ours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100047#WW00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1601570100,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Sadly, it has been announced this evening that another four people have died of Covid-19.  I offer my condolences to their families and to all those that have lost loved ones to Covid-19 here in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  We have known this winter would be a significant challenge since the Covid-19 pandemic emerged here in March.  The pandemic, combined with the flu season, will place enormous challenges on our health service and front-line workers.  Pre-Covid, many of our hospitals were already operating at 90-95% capacity.  I welcome today's announcement of the &euro;600 million financial commitment made by the Government for this winter plan.  In particular, I welcome the plan to provide 892 acute beds with 484 sub-acute beds.  The extra capacity will be crucial this winter.  The extra 500 isolation beds will provide reassurance that capacity exists if Covid cases continue to increase.<\/p>  <p>  At the heart of the strategy to combat Covid is the strong testing and tracing infrastructure.  Extra funding to bring our public health teams to in excess of 3,000 professionals is welcome, as is the commitment to bring the capacity to more than 100,000 test per week.  The flu vaccine will be issued to more than 1.5 million people over the coming weeks, starting with front-line workers, schoolchildren and vulnerable members of the community.  I welcome innovative plans to allow pharmacists to inoculate people in their cars and other socially distant locations.  I am sure all in the House are grateful for the flexibility pharmacists have shown.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the additional 4.7 million home support hours.  People with a disability and the elderly have made huge sacrifices during this pandemic.  Many of them lost home care supports during the acute phase of the lockdown in April and May, and this support was gradually reintroduced.  Supporting people at home and helping them avoid the need to attend a hospital is critical in this pandemic, particularly as we head into the winter months.  The extra support for home help hours is welcome and necessary.  Earlier today, we were informed that St. John of God, which provides crucial services not only to my own constituency in D&uacute;n Laoghaire but across south Dublin and indeed the rest of the country to more than 8,000 adults and children with disability and their families, would be withdrawing from its HSE contract.  The announcement has caused great concern worry in the community, and many people have been in contact with my office today.  Covid-19 has been exceptionally difficult for those families, and this is adding an additional stress and strain.  I ask the Minister to intervene directly with the HSE.  We must ensure continuity of service for this cohort.  I hope the Minister can give us assurances this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100047#WW00300","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1601570100,"counter":354,"content":"<p>Deputy Nolan is sharing with Deputy Mattie McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100047#WW00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1601570100,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I wish the Minister of State all the best in her new role.  I am sure she will be fantastic in the role because she has been bringing great energy and enthusiasm, so I wish her the very best of luck.<\/p>  <p>  It is vitally important that we have a sufficiently resourced health service, now more than ever.  What is of equal if not greater importance, however, is that we have a significantly escalated plan to achieve major increases in staffing levels right across the services and specialties.  I made this point recently when I called on the Taoiseach to ensure that sufficient ICU and critical care staff are available to deal with any increase in demand for beds at the Midland Regional Hospital in Tullamore and the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise.<\/p> <p>Staff members at the hospital have told me that increasing staff numbers is the core issue that must be addressed.  I accept what the plan says about providing 1,500 additional staff at national level but they have to be deployed to areas of most acute need.  This debate also highlights how important it is for hospitals and health facilities to be able to engage in future strategic management.  Unfortunately, this cannot be said of the Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise as there is still an absence of clarity on plans for the hospital.  In July, I welcomed receipt of confirmation from the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, that he is emphatically committed to securing and further developing the role of Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise in the Dublin Midlands hospital group.  However, it is still a source of significant concern to learn that no decision has yet been made on the draft action plan for Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise.  While I welcome the statement provided by the Minister because at the very least we now have the outline of a real political commitment to the future of the hospital in Portlaoise, we do need further commitments, especially on the status of the appointment of an independent facilitator at the hospital.  This is urgently needed if local confidence in the process is to be maintained.  What we need to hear from the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, is a substantial level of detail on just what securing and further developing Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise will mean in real terms.  Without that hospital we will not be able to plan for the future and it is affecting the hospital in terms of recruitment of specialist staff and the development of the maternity unit.  It is holding up many developments.  I hope we will have some resolution and a concrete plan and commitment.<\/p> <p> The next issue I want to raise is the absence of mental health facilities and services for children and adults.  This is a huge issue throughout the State, which I know the Minister of State is aware of and very passionate about.

This is the second time today that he has abandoned the Chamber for the later speaking slots.  It is no disrespect to the Minister of State and I thank her for coming to Clonmel to see the mental health issues there.<\/p>  <p>  The youth mental health charity, Jigsaw, saw an increase of 50% in demand for its service in August compared to last year.  There has been a more than 400% increase in traffic to its online mental health platform over the past six months.  Inclusion Ireland, which represents people with intellectual disabilities, has stated day services are running at a rate of 50% of what they were prior to Covid-19.  Many people cannot access these services due to transport limitations.  This is chronic.  It is now crystal clear that mental health needs must be treated as a core element of the response and recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is so unfair on these people.  It is all about Covid and all about instilling fear.  I said this earlier.  The figures need to be explained and the true figures need to be explained.  I will not repeat what I said earlier.  I ask the Minister of State to insist the figures for self-harm and mental health are collated.  The agency stopped collating them in April.  We need to know.  Why hide them?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State's saw St. Michael's unit in Clonmel.  Unfortunately, officials have decided not to give us our beds.  Since it was closed eight years ago it has been a disaster.  We have had more issues and mental health problems.  A Vision for Change did not deliver the community response.  We need beds in Clonmel.  The Department is able to find &euro;700,000 or &euro;800,000 for more beds for Covid.  Mention the word \"Covid\" and money is like confetti or dust falling from the sky.  There is no problem.  However, the Government cannot look after people's mental health.  It is shameful in the extreme.  When there are inquiries into this in ten or 15 years' time the fear that the Government, RT&Eacute; and the whole cabal are instilling will be exposed nakedly for what it is with no research.  A doctor was sacked last week for speaking out.  Dolores Cahill will not be listened to.  All those with a contrarian view are all unpatriotic.  We are all loony bins.  The genie is out of the bottle.  Today I quoted figures from Denmark, Hungary and other places.  They show they have far fewer issues than we have.  They have more borders but our wonderful HSE, which was dysfunctional before this started, is even more dysfunctional now and it is shameful.<\/p>  <p>  St. Bridget's Hospital in Carrick-on-Suir, a wonderful day hospital, which the Minister of State has passed many times, had four hospice beds paid for in the main through fundraising by the people of south Tipperary, west Waterford - the Minister of State's area - and south Kilkenny.  It is closed and has been taken off the people because Covid is more important and to hell with the people who need palliative care.  They are dying in their homes and they cannot get treatment.  It is a shocking indictment of how we have gone down the road like a runaway train with Covid and to hell with cancer patients and stroke victims.  One person an hour is dying of cancer and 27 a day are dying of strokes and heart conditions.  There are also many other issues growing inside of people's bodies that they are unaware of because they cannot get tests.  The Government will be brought to The Hague for war crimes when it is all over because of the abandonment of the people and it is shameful the way they have been treated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100048#XX00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1601570700,"counter":358,"content":"<p>Every time I see or hear the word \"Sl&aacute;intecare\" coming from the HSE, the Department of Health or Ministers I become extremely angry because I know, the Minister of State knows and everybody in here knows the Sl&aacute;intecare report, as a planned approach to achieve a single tier well funded public health service, has been consigned to the shelves to gather dust in the Department of Health.  Sl&aacute;intecare as intended will never be implemented by any Government containing Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael so let us dispense with the pretence.<\/p>  <p>  It would not have taken any great medical expertise to know our public health care system would be overrun by a pandemic of the nature of Covid-19.  The lockdown and public compliance with it prevented a catastrophe and we have to recognise that in essence our healthcare system was overrun with the cancellation of many essential services in diagnostics, screening and elective surgery.<\/p>  <p>  All Deputies have received a particular email and I will read from it because it is important with regard to disability services.  It is from parents of adults with intellectual disabilities who, since the onset of Covid-19, have struggled with a lack of useful help for them and their adult children.  The adult children's day and respite services were drastically cut to the point of being non-existent for most of the time up to September.  They had hoped the promised winter plan would start to address some of the issues but instead they find their adult children and themselves once more ignored and neglected.  They are bitterly disappointed and join Family Carers Ireland and Inclusion Ireland in expressing their dismay.  They state that once again the authorities have let them down and let down the entire disability community.  This email is one example and we could all give further quotes from a range of organisations, such as the Irish Cancer Society, urging emergency action.  The glaring omission of serious funding for mental health services is hugely disappointing and, as has been said already, I hope it will be addressed seriously in the budget.<\/p>  <p>  Having said that, the measures taken were necessary given the underfunding of the health service over decades.  It is also necessary to record the tremendous work carried out under very difficult circumstances by those who work in the public health services, including doctors, nurses, porters, cleaners and all ancillary staff.  In this context, a plan that calls for an injection of &euro;600 million over the next six months is to be welcomed, as are the proposals for 570 new beds, 12,500 extra staff, the extension of community assessment hubs and more home help hours.  Unfortunately, the &euro;4.76 million for home help will not deal with the issue because many people did not have their home help needs met prior to Covid and they are looking for more hours.  There is a huge backlog of people waiting for home help hours.  People who were independent prior to Covid now face the need for home help hours.  It is a question of having 6,000 new staff to deal with this.<\/p> <p>One can only imagine how much better the service would be if the Sl&aacute;intecare proposals for &euro;600 million a year over five years had actually been implemented over the past three years.

The Minister earlier described the winter plan as ambitious but ambition needs to be underpinned by resources, competence, as well as systems which work collaboratively and efficiently.  It also needs to have timelines, not just targets.  Within those targets, there need to be specifics and pathways to achieve those specific targets.  Unfortunately, I do not see this in the plan which is disappointing.<\/p>  <p>  We must ensure CervicalCheck is fully reinstated and resourced in order that it catches up with those women left behind since March 2020.  The waiting time for those who have had their tests and who urgently need biopsies or colposcopies is far too long.  I have a constituent who has been told that the waiting time for her urgent cervical biopsy is eight weeks.  She is beside herself with anxiety and fear.  The service has to be improved.<\/p>  <p>  The winter plan refers to extra beds which is welcome.  However, we need to see the specifics, namely, where, when and how.  In that context, I want to see real progress on the 42-bed unit for Sligo University Hospital.  It has got planning permission and approval in principle.  While it is out of the starting blocks, it is painfully slow.  If the winter plan is to mean anything, we need to see an ongoing timetable which delivers those beds in the shortest possible time.  Four intensive care unit beds are coming to Sligo University Hospital which we are very happy to see.<\/p>  <p>  Every Member has referred to mental health today.  I read the plan but there were only two mentions with nothing specific or definite.  The GRASP Life, a mental health service foundation in Dromahair, County Leitrim, which services Sligo and Leitrim, recently stated that, during Covid, the number of calls to its service increased by 70%.  That is across the board with all kinds of issues.  It stated the local county councils and HSE were supportive but its fundraising has dried up.  Accordingly, it is caught at both ends.  We need to see more supports for mental health.  The Minister of State and I know it.  People are desperately crying out for these services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100049#YY00200","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1601571300,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I thank all Deputies who contributed to this important debate today.  I welcome the opportunity to make the closing remarks to it.  I have taken notes and will pass individual requests back.  The suggestions made and the issues raised will be borne in mind as the winter plan is implemented.<\/p>  <p>  I was disappointed that not one Member today welcomed the fact that &euro;830,000 will be spent on ten dementia advisers.  I sat on the opposite side of the House for the past four and a half years and I championed the appointment of dementia advisers every week.  Up to last year, there were eight dementia advisers in the whole country, meaning getting one could be a postcode lottery.  We finally made the breakthrough last year and we managed to get ten more in the budget.  To get another ten in the winter plan means we now have 28.  The optimum number according to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland is 33.  I fought doggedly for the &euro;830,000 to get ten extra dementia advisers.  I cannot believe I have been in the Chamber for the past 75 minutes but not one Member mentioned it.  Up to 11 people are diagnosed with dementia every day.  I chaired the all-party committee on dementia for the past four and a half years.  It was a committee at which politics was left at the door.  It had members from every single party and none.  We all worked together to raise awareness.<\/p>  <p>  As stated by many Members, as well as the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, this winter will be challenging for our health and social care services.  It is like a perfect storm.  We are heading into the winter.  We do not know what is coming.  We could have the winter vomiting bug and the winter 'flu.  We will have all our usual challenges with capacity, overcrowding and trolley numbers.  Coupled with all that, we have Covid.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, I was delighted to launch the HSE winter plan with &euro;600 million funding, 20 times more than what the plan is normally.  It is an adequate plan.  As I have said many times, the devil is in the detail, however.  We will work as hard as we can to ensure those supports are put in place.<\/p>  <p>  We are dealing with a global pandemic which has disrupted the level and the delivery of healthcare since March, while placing significantly increased demands on healthcare staff.  I wish to pay tribute to all our healthcare staff and carers who have made such efforts to provide care in such difficult circumstances.  I also wish to remember all those, including healthcare workers, who have passed away as a result of Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Members that we need reform.  That is why the winter plan is designed in line with Sl&aacute;intecare principles.  We need investment and reform.  I take on board the point made by Deputy Joan Collins about the &euro;600 million funding.  We need to see more of that if we want to implement Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p>  <p>  The &euro;600 million investment in the winter plan represents a significant commitment from the Government which will allow us to commence the process of pivoting care and the required resources towards home and community care.  As Minister with responsibility for mental health and older people, I am particularly pleased with the emphasis placed on supports for older people and those groups at greater risk in this plan.  This is essential.  Older people are more likely to be admitted to an acute hospital following a visit to an emergency department.  They are more likely to experience a wait on a hospital trolley.  Accordingly, I welcome the additional 47 community specialist teams to support older people and those with chronic disease to stay at home, the 13 additional community assessment hubs, the additional community beds which will allow faster egress from hospital and provide care closer to people&rsquo;s homes.<\/p>  <p>  This was piloted in University Hospital Waterford last year.  Normally, the hospital would have between 20 and 25 beds for people who would be termed as late discharge.  A consultant would have deemed them as fit to go home but, unfortunately, there was no place for them to go.  Capacity was bought in a nursing home at a cost of &euro;1,000 per bed as against an acute hospital charge of between &euro;6,500 and &euro;7,000 per week.  Some of these patients needed respite, others were waiting on home care support packages or on fair deal.  They were able to transfer to a nursing home for two to four weeks care, depending on what they needed.  Up to 530 of these community beds will be rolled out across the country which should free up capacity in the acute hospital settings.<\/p>  <p>  I especially welcome the 4.76 million additional home care hours which will allow people to remain in their own homes.  I welcome the commitment to provide aids and appliances to an additional 5,500 people.  Such simple initiatives can make all the difference to an older person.  We need to keep our older people at home, safe and secure, with the correct wrap-around supports.  There are always waiting lists for those who require home care.  However, these extra 4.7 million home care hours should make a big difference.  Obviously, there are people on a waiting list or whose needs might have changed during Covid.  We want to make sure that the support goes into the home and that somebody does not have to go to an emergency department and wait on a trolley.<\/p> <p> It is important to mention nursing homes and the important role they and their staff have played in the care of our most vulnerable older people before the pandemic and, especially, in the last few difficult months.  The pandemic bore down very hard on our older people.  Unfortunately, 54% of all deaths to date have occurred in the nursing home sector.  Our nursing homes are where many of our older people call home and it is critical that we continue our supports to that sector.  Our plans for winter will be enhanced by the extension of the temporary assistance payment scheme, which will continue to provide funding to private and voluntary nursing homes and to residential care homes to ensure they are prepared for Covid-19 so they are safe for older people who are transferring out of the hospital system.  Enhancements in rehabilitation and home care will also help to ensure that our older people can be cared for in the community, thereby easing the pressure on capacity in nursing homes and providing an alternative care pathway when leaving hospital settings.<\/p> <p> I want to touch on mental health because it has been raised by almost every Deputy in the House and it forms a very important part of my remit as Minister.  The winter plan, with a focus on those actions which will have an impact on winter, and specifically trolleys, is part of the larger strategic plan which the Government asked the HSE to develop for health service delivery to the end of 2021 in the context of the pandemic.  I intend to seek, as part of this strategic plan in the Estimates process, additional resources to implement a number of the short-term recommendations of the mental health policy, Sharing the Vision.  It is important for everyone who has spoken today to note that the 4.7 million hours which will be added to the existing 19 million hours that are already there will not differentiate whether one is older or has dementia, a disability or a mental health issue.  The carer will not stop at the door and say they are only looking after older people.  Those hours are there for everyone: those with mental health issues, those with disability issues, those who are vulnerable, those with dementia and the older generation.  It is important to get the point out tonight that those hours are for anybody who needs support in their home.  For everyone who has said there was nothing in it for mental health or people with disabilities, those hours will not differentiate.  When the carer goes in the front door, he or she will not differentiate whether one has a mental health or disability issue.<\/p> <p> The winter plan is about people.  It enables patients to be seen in the community and to remain in their own homes.  This is the Sl&aacute;intecare principle of the right care, in the right place, at the right time.  However, we have a growing and an ageing population.   This Government accepts that we need more acute beds in our hospital system to provide acute care to this growing population.  This plan provides for a range of additional beds in acute, sub-acute and community settings along with arrangements to work with private hospitals to deal with urgent cases and waiting lists.  I was struck when Deputy Harkin mentioned the four extra ICU beds going to Sligo.  Each extra ICU bed needs six nurses and is at a cost of &euro;750,000, so I am delighted Sligo is getting extra capacity.  It is great to hear.  These additional acute beds and measures to move care to the community will allow hospitals to operate more efficiently and reduce the number of patients receiving care on hospital trolleys.<\/p> <p> Finally, I encourage everyone to do their bit to keep themselves healthy this winter by eating well, exercising, getting the flu vaccine, washing their hands, keeping their distance, limiting the number of people they are meeting and following public health guidance.  I also encourage everyone to seek medical help if they think they need it.  We are doing everything possible to keep our health settings safe for patients and staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100049#YY00300","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1601571900,"counter":363,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100050#ZZ00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1601571900,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Steven Matthews - to discuss proposals by the Changing Places campaign to require changing places in public buildings; (2) Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan - to discuss an application to develop regional rehabilitation services in the South\/South West Hospital Group; (3) Deputy Dessie Ellis - to discuss the expansion of the programme to retrofit older houses to upgrade their energy efficiency; (4) Deputy Alan Kelly - to discuss plans to develop the Dean Maxwell community nursing home; (5) Deputy Paul Donnelly - to discuss the possible closure of level crossings on the new Dart+ line to Maynooth; (6) Deputy Jennifer Murnane O'Connor - to discuss protection against litigation for schools arising from integrating children into mainstream classes; (7) Deputy Louise O'Reilly - the need for additional autism spectrum disorder places in north County Dublin; (8) Deputy John Lahart - to discuss steps to address the crisis facing businesses and traders in Dublin city; (9) Deputy Maurice Quinlivan - to discuss the prevalence of drugs in Limerick city; (10) Deputy Joan Collins - to discuss the dismissal of workers in Spike Island tours; and (11) Deputy Ruair&iacute; &Oacute; Murch&uacute; - to discuss access to public liability insurance in the leisure and community sector.<\/p>  <p>  The matters raised by Deputies Steven Matthews, P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan, Alan Kelly and Maurice Quinlivan have been selected for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100050#ZZ00175","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Saincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Debate","time":1601571900,"counter":365,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100050#ZZ00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Building Regulations","time":1601571900,"counter":366,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100050#ZZ00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1601571900,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, for being here to answer these questions.  I request that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government carry out a review to examine amending the building regulations to include the mandatory installation of adequate toilet facilities for disabled people and their carers, known as changing places facilities.  The Minister will know that while Part M of the building regulations states that new buildings must include standard wheelchair accessible toilet facilities, they do not allow for more severely disabled adults and teens, who may require incontinence pad changing facilities, a larger square metreage floor area to allow for carers and the use of a hoist.  The campaign group Changing Places has established a template for a changing facility that allows equity of access to all.  These are accessible for those who need carer support for sanitary and toilet use.  Changing places rooms have a higher ceiling to allow for a hoist, a larger floor space to accommodate carers, a centralised toilet to allow for carer support and, vitally, a height-adjustable adult-sized changing bench.  At the moment, there are just 15 changing places facilities in the Republic of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  To put this in context, I will tell the Minister of State about Sophia.  I have her family's permission to highlight her situation in the D&aacute;il this evening.  Sophia is a wonderful young woman.  She is 13 years of age and loves her dog, her brother, her sister and eating ice cream.  Sophia also has cerebral palsy and arthrogryposis and has had surgery for scoliosis.  She is non-verbal and requires an adult-sized changing bench for toilet use.  Recently, Sophia and her family visited me in Bray and when I asked where the nearest changing places facility was, her father Aaron told me there were none available in the entire county of Wicklow, and Wicklow is not unique in this regard.  Many parents have experienced the frustration of seeking baby changing facilities, only to find they are not available.  Usually, with a small baby one can make do.  This is not the case for people with certain disabilities.  In Sophia's case, every trip and visit is planned with an adequate toilet facility in mind and there are only 15 such facilities in the country.  Very often, her father told me, they do not bother going anywhere at all because of the lack of access to these facilities.  I believe every person should have access to adequate bathroom facilities.  It is neither reasonable nor acceptable to expect people like Sophia to make do, when making do involves a complete loss of dignity.  Her parents must attempt to change her in the back of their van or limit their trips to one of a handful of locations that can accommodate her needs.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, the UK Government announced that changes would be made to legislation to install compulsory changing places in new public buildings, such as shopping centres, art galleries, sports stadiums, libraries or larger public buildings from 2021.  I believe we should now examine changing the building regulations to ensure planning applications for suitable public buildings include a changing places toilet facility.  As we learn to live with Covid, we must be mindful of the vulnerable, who will look to this Government to act for them in ensuring their dignity, safety and well-being.  I hope the Minister of State and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will work with me to meet the campaigners in Changing Places, who comprise representatives from many disability advocacy groups, and listen to them to ensure young women like Sophia can go about their day with the dignity they deserve.  I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100050#ZZ00300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1601571900,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and for presenting such a poignant case in relation to Sophia and her family.  As the matter stands, new buildings and extensions of material alterations to existing buildings must comply with the legal minimum performance standards set out in the building regulations of 1997 to 2019.  In this context, the Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2010 and the accompanying Technical Guidance Document M - Access and Use 2010, which came into effect on 1 January 2012, set out the minimum statutory requirements a building must achieve in respect of access.<\/p>  <p>  The requirements of Part M aim to ensure that regardless of aim, size or disability, new buildings other than dwellings are accessible and usable; extensions to existing buildings other than dwellings are, where practicable, accessible and usable; material alterations to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings, where practicable; certain changes of use to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings, where practicable; and new dwellings are visitable.  Part M of the building regulations aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment.

Since I was elected as a councillor in 2014, I have encountered strong, resilient people and families and have had the privilege of getting to know them.  Many of those people have suffered acute brain injuries and spinal injuries resulting from farm and road accidents and so on.  It is with admiration that I look upon both those people who have suffered those traumas and their families.  It takes much work, not just medically but also mentally, to get people's lives back on track.<\/p>  <p>  I have brought this Topical Issue matter to the floor of the House because a number of reviews and reports have been compiled since 2012 in relation to the South\/South West Hospital Group.  The group is responsible for approximately 1 million people in its catchment area across counties Cork, Kerry, Waterford and south Tipperary, more than 20% of our country's population, but, unfortunately, it has no access to the full range of rehabilitation services akin to what is provided in the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It is difficult to get a place in that rehabilitation centre, as the Minister of State knows.  Many can be waiting for six to 12 months to get a place in that unit.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, Dr. Andrew Hanrahan undertook a review of rehabilitation services within the South\/South West Hospital Group.  A further review was taken in May 2019 and outlined the requirements for rehabilitation services in the area.  In 2012, a regional specialist rehabilitation unit was first proposed for the South\/South West Hospital Group to provide for patients with high to moderate intensity inpatient rehabilitation.  This unit was to support patients with moderate to severe physical, cognitive or communicative disabilities, or a combination thereof.  Services would be provided by trained rehabilitation staff and rehabilitation medicine consultants, supported by consultant neurologists.  The review also recommended the development of a full range of rehabilitation services in the South\/South West Hospital Group.  That was in 2012.<\/p>  <p>  We are now eight years on and I am asking that the Minister of State makes the aspiration a reality for the people of the south and the south west.  I welcome, in response to a parliamentary question, a letter from Mr. Gerry O'Dwyer, chief executive officer of the South\/South West Hospital Group.  He stated that discussions are progressing about the development of a rehabilitation unit in Cork and an announcement will be made in the next few weeks.  That is most welcome, especially for those families in Cork, Kerry, the Minister of State's native Waterford and south Tipperary who heretofore have been waiting up to 12 months for admission to the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  People should be cared for in their own region, particularly in the context of Covid-19.  It makes no sense that patients from the southern region would continue to travel to Dublin for specialist treatment that can be provided locally.<\/p>  <p>  While I welcome the announcement that the rehabilitation unit is being progressed, I urge the Minister of State in the meantime to accede to requests made by consultants in Cork University Hospital for the provision of the required specialists who deal with trauma to be sanctioned.  They are looking for additional rehabilitation consultants, speech and language therapists and physiotherapists, among other specialists.  If this team could be put in place before the construction of a new rehabilitation unit, we could make a considerable difference to the lives of people who suffer from such debilitating diseases and serious traumas.  There is currently an application with the HSE for the provision of that team, which is distinct from the application from the unit.  I hope that the HSE would look favourably on that application.<\/p>  <p>  I will share my remaining two minutes with Deputy O'Connor after the Minister of State has replied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100051#AAA00500","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1601572500,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to provide an update to the House on the development of regional rehabilitation services in the South\/South West Hospital Group.  This is an important issue for all of those who live in the area.  Rehabilitation is a critical component of any modern healthcare system and is essential if patients are to regain or maintain their quality of life after serious illness or injury.  Rehabilitation improves health outcomes and reduces disability.  There is a growing body of evidence that rehabilitation in specialised environments is not only effective but also cost effective.  This has been demonstrated in a variety of settings such as inpatient units and community teams, and in different diagnostic groups such as trauma brain injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis and acquired brain injury.<\/p>  <p>  The demand for rehabilitation services is growing and is anticipated to continue to grow with changes of population and the advances in healthcare, new interventions and technology.  The model of care under the national clinical programme for rehabilitation medicine was launched in 2018 and presents, in line with National Policy and Strategy for the Provision of Neuro-rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011-2015, an outline for future provision of specialist rehabilitation services in Ireland.<\/p> <p>The model of care proposed is a hub and spoke model consisting of a tertiary centre linking at least four managed clinical rehabilitation networks, each one serving a population of about 1 million people.  The network will connect acute and post-acute rehabilitation units and community specialist rehabilitation clinicians in a formal governance structure to allow the delivery of co-ordinated rehabilitative care for patients across all levels of complexity.<\/p> <p> The HSE has advised that a review of rehabilitation services in the South\/South West Hospital Group was, as the Deputy said, undertaken in February 2017 and was further updated in May 2019.  The review outlined a number of recommendations in regard to the development of rehabilitation services in the South\/South West Hospital Group.  The HSE also advised that, in line with the model of care for the provision of rehabilitation medicine in Ireland and the neuro-rehabilitation strategy, the review recommended the development of a regional specialist rehabilitation unit for the South\/South West Hospital Group to support patients with moderate to severe physical, cognitive and communicative disabilities.<\/p> <p> The HSE has further advised that the review recommended the development of a full range of rehabilitation services in the South\/South West Hospital Group, including hyper acute rehabilitation as well as associated specialist post-acute inpatient rehabilitation units.  The HSE has advised that these units will operate in a hub and spoke model with the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dublin, through managed clinical rehabilitation networks, which is consistent with the model of care for rehabilitation medicine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100051#AAA00600","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601573100,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on her appointment.

I am sure it has been raised with her before.  The Dean Maxwell Community Nursing Home in Roscrea is something that is cherished by the people of Roscrea and its surrounds.  It has looked after its residents for a long time.  It provides care that is second to none.  It is an incredible unit based in the centre of the town.<\/p>  <p>  There have been an awful lot of promises made about the unit.  In the northern part of Tipperary there is a fantastic state-of-the-art public elderly care unit in Thurles, Community Hospital of the Assumption.  In Nenagh a new 50-bed unit is being built, St. Conlon's Community Nursing Unit, beside the hospital.  Work is commencing soon and it will be a fantastic facility.  Roscrea is the other major town that has a public unit which needs to be rebuilt.<\/p>  <p>  There is a history in regard to this.  The people of the town have had enough.  We need to get this sorted.  HIQA has done inspections, which the unit has passed.  I have all of the details, but on top of that we also need to ensure there are long-stay beds.  It is not good enough to say that it will be turned into a short-stay facility.  The people of Roscrea and surrounds will not tolerate that.  I, as a public representative, will not tolerate that because those who are resident now and who will be resident there in the future want it to be a long-stay facility.<\/p>  <p>  The building is very similar to St. Conlon's in Nenagh.  It needs to be completely redone.  It does not meet HIQA requirements in terms of single bedrooms, space, facilities and everything else.  It is on a site in the middle of the town beside a church and is within walking distance of many people.  The site can be rebuilt on.  The council is willing to work with the HSE to build on the site if necessary.  Before the last general election another public representative made a commitment that a new nursing home would be built in Roscrea.  That seems to have disappeared.<\/p>  <p>  We need to draw out a plan.  We need more public beds and capacity in Tipperary so that we can look after the elderly.  We need a plan for the home.  I must commend the Minister of State's predecessor, Jim Daly.  He was the first person to say that we will deal with the units and make sure it is a long-stay facility.  I and other Deputies met him on 17 December in Government Buildings.  He visited Roscrea with a local community group on 27 January.  He gave assurances that under no circumstances would the unit be closed and that consideration would be given to how it would be funded.  He gave assurances which were the most comprehensive assurances we had ever been given.  To be fair to him, he was quite a good Minister.<\/p>  <p>  We need to chart a plan for the nursing home because the community of Roscrea will not tolerate anything else.  To be honest, neither will I.  Other public representatives feel the same.  We are all united in this.  This has been going on for too long.  The town has been let down in many ways.  It has lost industry.  No other issue unites the people of the town as much as this nursing home and its future.  I ask the Minister of State to look at her funding capacity.  We do not mind waiting as long as there is a plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100052#BBB00500","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1601573100,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of the Dean Maxwell Community Nursing Home.  I heard about it recently.<\/p>  <p>  A key principle underpinning Government policies is to support older people to live in their homes with dignity and independence for as long as possible.  In recent years there has been a shift in healthcare provision focused towards home care.  Home support services are key in facilitating older people to remain at home, and with our ageing population, they will become even more important in the future. <\/p> <p>While our stated objective is to promote care in the community so that people can continue to live with confidence, security and dignity in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, we also have patients who are in genuine need of residential care, either on a long or short-stay basis.  Their safety and well-being is of paramount concern.<\/p> <p> Residential care is provided through a mix of public, voluntary and private provision.  It is worth highlighting that the budget for long-term residential care in 2020 is in excess of &euro;1 billion.  The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as Dean Maxwell Community Nursing Unit.  There are 27 beds in the unit providing continuing care, respite and palliative care, as the Deputy has said.  The HSE has confirmed that it is committed to ongoing improvements at the unit.  The current capital programme of works is managed and delivered by the HSE&rsquo;s estate division.  I understand there have been extensive works carried out in Dean Maxwell in 2019 and in 2020, which includes the repainting of bedrooms, new lights fitted, rewiring completed throughout the unit, and fire safety works completed in early 2020 with sign-off by fire safety consultants in June 2020.  Further development works were completed in April 2020 with a new nursing office, clinical room, and a hairdressing and activity area.<\/p> <p> Dean Maxwell remains a facility registered under the Health Act 2007 with HIQA for the provision of a range of care services to older people.  The unit is currently registered until March 2022.  The most recent inspection report was published by HIQA on 11 September 2019.  The report was very positive and the facility has complied with HIQA standards.  However, HIQA has recommended that from 2021 the single bedrooms in the unit are unsuitable to meet the needs of the residents due to their current infrastructure.<\/p> <p> There is no capital project in the HSE capital plan to replace Dean Maxwell.  The HSE intends to move the emphasis at the Dean Maxwell facility from long-stay to short-stay care, which is an increasing area of service requirement.  However, it is the intention that this will take place over a number of years and the changes will occur in a seamless fashion to ensure that they will not impact on individual service users.  Were any such eventuality to arise in an unavoidable individual situation, the HSE has assured the Department that the resident or his or her family would be fully involved and included in any plans.  Dean Maxwell services will continue and will be supported by the other community nursing units with increased capacity in north Tipperary.  This will create county-wide access to older person services, which will include long-stay, short-stay, respite care, palliative care and day services.  The HSE has assured the Department that it is committed to engaging in partnership with all of the relevant stakeholders.  This engagement will be key to prioritising the service requirement for the population of north Tipperary and I inform the Deputy that I am also willing to engage on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100052#BBB00600","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601573700,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Dare I say it but the Minister of State&rsquo;s own party members are going to be furious.  This is just not acceptable.  We, collectively, across politics, are going to have to get a plan here.  To say that we are gradually going to move to short-stay and that this will not impact on families is not acceptable.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s own colleague, who is the mayor of Tipperary, Councillor Michael Smith, has done some work with me on this and has worked with the council on a plan to build on the site.  I have spoken to the chief executive of the council on this and the council is willing to give over land for this, such is its importance to the community.<\/p>  <p>  There is going to be a new capital plan.  In that capital plan service provision is going to have to be widened out because we are going to have to look after our elderly in a different way.  Can this unit be put on the capital plan?  In the past three weeks I have seen what can be achieved.  Some &euro;2.4 million is going into the hospital's Assumption grounds for units to look after the elderly in the area.  Some &euro;1.4 million is going into the grounds of Nenagh hospital, which I was pleased to tell people about this week.  That amounts to &euro;3.9 million.  These are all hospital prevention measures and all are designed to look after the elderly in the majority of cases.  Here we have Roscrea, again, not getting any form of Government support.  Some &euro;4 million was given out in three weeks.  I welcome and support this but we have to have a plan.  To say that this unit is just going to close to long-stay patients and will not have any such patients is a regression from the position with the former Minister of State and Deputy, Jim Daly, who had a very good meeting with the representatives down there, including the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague, Michael Smith, and members of the Roscrea Community Development Council, RCDC, and they were very happy with this.

I know that she is relatively new to the role and I hope she will have a better impact than those who preceded her in dealing with the issue of drugs in Limerick city.  It truly needs a cross-departmental response.  Drugs, as the Minister is aware, crosses many Ministries, health and justice, to name just a few.<\/p>  <p>  The drugs crisis in parts of my own city is worsening daily, it seems.  It is an indictment of the priorities of previous governments that the funding for drugs and alcohol task forces was cut each year between 2008 and 2014.  I am also a director of the Mid-West Regional Drugs and Alcohol Task Forum, which I have been a member of for a great number of years.  Despite the escalation in the drugs crisis, funding for many groups has effectively been frozen since 2014.  This lack of proper funding has severely affected the delivery of services for communities and we need to restore that funding to 2008 levels as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to return to an issue in my own city of Limerick.  In recent drug seizures in the city crack cocaine was among the drugs seized.  Crack cocaine, as I am sure the Minister is aware, is a devastating drug.  It has destroyed communities across the world.  It is extremely addictive and is regarded as the most addictive form of cocaine.  There really is a special place in hell for anyone who sells, distributes or benefits from the sale of crack cocaine.  These dealers really are the scum of the earth.  I attended the AGM yesterday, via Zoom, of the Mid-West Regional Drugs and Alcohol Task Forum.  Among issues of concern raised, I was specifically asked to raise the issue of drug dealing in Limerick and the devastating effect it is having on some of our local communities.  After that meeting I wrote yesterday to the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for the national drug strategy, Deputy Feighan, and in fairness his office responded quickly to that correspondence.  I thank him for that and I will be following this matter up with him.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, I mentioned to the Minister of State a Limerick estate which I do not wish to name publicly but which needs urgent intervention from the Minister of State with support from the Minister&rsquo;s Department of Justice and Equality, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and additional resources from the Criminal Assets Bureau, Limerick County Council and other agencies.<\/p> <p>I wish to focus my comments on that one estate in Limerick.  This is an older, very settled housing estate with many wonderful working families living there for generations.  Unfortunately, drug dealing operates in the estate on an almost 24-7 basis.  Taxis often form queues while people from all over the region purchase their drugs.  Many people simply walk into the estate.  It is like a non-stop, 24-7 supermarket.  The vast bulk of the people purchasing the drugs do not live in the area.  This is ongoing 24-7.  It is non-stop.  Many elderly people who worked all their lives are living through this constant criminality.<\/p> <p> While the Garda, in fairness to the force, has made a significant number of arrests and seizures, the local community feels utterly abandoned.  Will the Minister prioritise the work of the courts to ensure that those recently charged are before the courts as soon as possible?  It has been said to me on numerous occasions that the most vulnerable can be brought to court for often minor offences but the drug dealers, many of them facing serious charges, can swan around our city selling their filth while ruining lives and communities.  I have spoken to senior garda&iacute; about that.  They are deeply concerned that they are charging people, bringing them to court, but because the courts are not sitting properly, they are out selling drugs on a 24-7 basis.<\/p> <p> The local drugs gang regularly gives two fingers to everybody.  The Defence Forces were redeployed recently to assist the Criminal Assets Bureau.  The Defence Forces should be called on again, if necessary, to deal with this ongoing problem.  The two fingers from these drugs gangs are not just to me, the local community, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or Limerick council.  They are two fingers to the Minister and definitely two fingers to the entire State.  The Minister is the Minister for Justice and Equality and I am asking her to intervene personally.  I am happy to speak with her in private, if she wishes, at a later time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100053#CCC00700","speaker":"1509","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601574300,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  As he clearly outlined, this is an issue and an area of concern that falls under a number of Departments and Ministers.  The Deputy mentioned particular groups and funding and, unfortunately, while I cannot help in that area, I will outline the area that falls under my remit, which is the work of the Garda, and I certainly would be happy to speak to him afterwards if there is further work that we can do.<\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the impact of antisocial behaviour caused by this type of issue and the impact it has on the quality of life not just of residents within local communities but also of those working in those communities and visiting our towns and cities.  Garda&iacute; are working very hard to try to tackle this and all forms of criminality in our communities and urban areas to try to make them safer for all members of society.  I am assured that the occurrence and the prevalence of crime and antisocial behaviour, including drug dealing, is constantly monitored at national and local level by Garda management to ensure that appropriate policing responses are designed and delivered, as appropriate, given the area or considering what is happening in the area.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the specific area of interest to the Deputy is policed by three Garda stations, all located within the Henry Street division.  It has Henry Street, Roxboro Road and Mayorstone Park.  As at the end of August 2020, there are 453 garda&iacute; assigned to those three stations.  That is an overall increase of 7% since 2015, up from 422.  In addition, these Garda members are supported by 60 Garda staff members representing an increase of almost 67% since 2015, again up from 36.  The Garda staff levels support the redeployment of garda&iacute; from the administrative posts to the more operational policing duties where their training, expertise and ability to engage with the communities on the ground is used to best effect.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to that, the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau leads in tackling all forms of drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs in Ireland.  It is supported by the divisional drugs unit, which tackles drug-related crime on a local basis throughout the country.  I am informed by the divisional drug units that they are now established in every Garda division.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also remains committed to tackling the supply of drugs by supporting local communities through various preventative and detection initiatives and engagement with local and regional drug and alcohol task forces.  There are also the Garda youth diversion programme and projects, the Garda schools programme, the joint policing committees and the community policing forums.  It is not just about the number of garda&iacute; we have but how they engage with the different forums and, in turn, with the communities.  There should be a whole-of-community approach.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that, overall, these Garda measures have continued unabated during the Covid-19 pandemic, the additional demands on policing, and the range of the public health restrictions we have seen over the past six months.  The Garda Commissioner emphasised at the very outset of the Covid-19 pandemic that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's policing measures to respond to Covid-19 would not affect Garda resources assigned to special units, in particular and including the drugs units.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy might also be aware that the Central Statistics Office, CSO, published its recorded crime statistics for quarter 2 of 2020 earlier this week.  Increases in simple possession and drugs for sale or supply have contributed chiefly to the overall increases in certain drugs-related offences recorded by the CSO.  That is the reason the multi-strand Garda response I outlined previously is so important in all of this.  The uninterrupted policing of organised crime at a national level and the strength of divisional drug units at a local level during the policing of Covid-19 has undoubtedly contributed to the recent success in seizing controlled drugs and in the apprehension of those involved in the sale and supply of the substances involved.<\/p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's point and acknowledge the challenges that the courts have been facing, in particular in recent months.  They have made every effort to try to deal with the more severe cases but a backlog has arisen and, since September, there has been a concerted effort to try to reduce that backlog.  There is always a place for me, as Minister, to try to improve the overall structures and the way the courts operate, including the criminal courts.  I will be bringing forward further criminal justice legislation throughout this term to allow us to try to improve the overall ability of people to go through the court process and to speed up that process.  I might come back to the Deputy on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100054#DDD00200","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1601574300,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response and for her comments on the courts.  The garda&iacute; in Limerick are very frustrated because they are arresting people on clear evidence and bringing them to court but there is no follow-up on that and they are back on the streets, often hours later, selling their drugs in the same place where they were arrested.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister will be aware that former Ministers of State who oversaw the national drugs strategy have warned that the delivery of the national drugs strategy plan is in danger of collapse as powers are being centralised under the HSE.  I know that is not the Minister's remit but I want to put it on the record.  The warning must be adhered to and we must ensure that task forces are once again made responsible for drafting and implementing local strategies to combat the drugs crisis locally.<\/p>  <p>  I am contacted almost daily by constituents of mine who have concerns regarding drug use.  They often feel very little is being done to address their concerns.  From my own work in local areas I have spoken to local people, community leaders and workers who have told me how bad it has got, and many of them say they have never seen it as bad, and that is saying a lot.  Drug dealing, unfortunately, is rife in areas of Limerick.  I have raised this issue in many D&aacute;il debates.  I will do so again at the joint policing committee, JPC, in Limerick, and I will raise it in whatever forum I can do so.<\/p>  <p>  We need a specific task force type of set-up in the area that can be modelled on what has been achieved in areas of Dublin.  As I said earlier, I wrote to the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, as the Minister of State with responsibility for tackling the drugs issue.  He needs to visit Limerick to get a fuller sense of the desperate situation on the ground in some of our estates.  I ask him specifically to come to Limerick with me to see the situation for himself.  However, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, is the Minister for Justice and I ask her, please, not to ignore the clear evidence I am presenting as, unfortunately, people did in the mid-2000s when Limerick needed massive Government intervention but people did not listen.  I am pleading with the Minister because we are on the cusp of going back to where we were at that time.  That intervention ultimately led to the Limerick regeneration programme.  We do not want to return to those days.  As I said, I am happy to meet the Minister later to discuss the issue in private.  The residents need some assurance that they will not be abandoned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100054#DDD00300","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1601574300,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Again, I appreciate the urgency with which he is raising this issue.  We have seen in the past in Dublin, as he mentioned, that where not just the Garda but the community, the local councils, the education bodies and the community groups come together, a huge amount of work can be done in tackling this very issue.  We have a project under way and a scoping exercise in Drogheda, the town next to mine, for that very reason.  That is the approach we need to be taking overall.  The introduction and implementation of the Commission on the Future of Policing puts this at the very forefront.  That is the approach we need where garda&iacute; are on the ground engaging with communities but where the sole responsibility is not on garda&iacute; and they can engage, co-operate and work with all of those vital services.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the management of resources and how the Garda deploys the resources is not a matter for me.  It is a matter for the Commissioner.  However, I am assured that he keeps this under continual review, and where there is a need to redeploy, move and engage, in particular with communities, that is kept constantly under review.  I will commit to engaging with the Deputy, and with the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, on this issue to see if we can come together to support the communities even further.  A lot of work is being done to try to address this, but it is to see where we could support them even further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100054#DDD00400","speaker":"1502"}]
