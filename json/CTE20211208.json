Joining me are council members, Ms Dawn Holland, Professor Michael McMahon, Dr. Adele Bergin and Mr. Alessandro Giustiniani, as well as our chief economist and head of secretariat, Dr. Eddie Casey.  We value our engagements with the Oireachtas and see these opportunities as an important part of our work.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is an independent body established under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.  Its mandate is to endorse and assess the Government's macroeconomic forecasts, the budgetary projections, compliance with the domestic fiscal rules and the fiscal stance.  Its focus is on the overall fiscal stance, rather than on individual tax measures or spending items.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman noted, last week, the council published its 21st fiscal assessment report.  The report noted the continued recovery in the economy from recent lockdowns.  Pre-crisis levels of underlying activity were reached in the second quarter of this year, but the recovery is uneven.  Sectors such as tourism and hospitality still show more pronounced effects compared with high-income sectors that have seen little disruption to growth from the current crisis.<\/p> <p>  Looking ahead, the economy is expected to grow at a healthy rate of around 3.5% in the medium term.  Risks around this forecast are broadly balanced.  Growth could be higher if scarring from the pandemic is less severe than assumed, if wages grow faster, or if savings unwind and boost consumer spending more than assumed.  However, there are also adverse risks associated with virus mutations, further restrictions, reduced foreign direct investment, FDI, due to international tax developments, and uncertainties around Brexit.<\/p> <p>  The council welcomes the Government's steps towards developing a medium-term fiscal strategy.  This has three key elements.  First, the spending forecasts are now more credible.  These allow for the cost of maintaining existing levels of public supports amid demographic and price pressures.  Second, the Government has introduced a spending rule that seeks to limit core spending increases to an average of 5% annually.  This covers Exchequer non-interest spending and the idea is to broadly align spending increases with the economy's trend growth rate, and hence with sustainable growth in Government revenues.  Third, the Government has set out public investment plans to 2030 in the new national development plan published in October.<\/p> <p>  A sharp narrowing of the deficit is anticipated this year.  As set out in the budget, a deficit of 5.9% of GNI* in 2021 looks achievable.  The deficit could ultimately be narrower due to higher revenue and less spending than anticipated.  For 2022, the Government stuck to its planned &euro;4.7 billion budgetary package.  This provides approximately &euro;1.6 billion to maintain existing public services, &euro;1.5 billion in new current spending and an increase of &euro;1.1 billion in public investment.  The budget forecasts that as a reserve, a deficit of 3.4% of GNI* will be achieved in 2022, but it could be lower.<\/p> <p>  Keeping to the planned package means that the Government is striking an appropriate balance between supporting the economy and keeping the public finances on a sustainable path.  The plans would allow public investment to increase to record levels and should be sufficient to maintain existing levels of services.  The budget deficit would close by 2023 and the debt ratio in gross terms would fall to below 90% of GNI* by 2025, declining at a steady pace of around three percentage points each year.  This would comply with the domestic fiscal rules.<\/p> <p>  To help achieve the strategy set out, the Government should reinforce various elements of it.  First, departmental spending ceilings should be set out, as is legally required.  Second, the spending rule could be linked more closely to the domestic fiscal rules; expanded to cover non-Exchequer spending and tax changes; and given legislative backing.  Moreover, the Government needs to clarify how major commitments around Sl&aacute;intecare and climate actions fit into these plans.  Sl&aacute;intecare costings have not been updated since 2017.  There is no estimate of the budgetary cost of implementing the climate action plan.<\/p> <p>  The space left over for additional current spending implied by the Government's plans will be limited in the years ahead unless there are offsetting spending cuts elsewhere or tax increases.  The budget suggests approximately &euro;1.6 billion per year on average of new current spending remains to be allocated, while the council's estimates suggested that only approximately &euro;500 million would remain once standstill costs are met.  Any additional spending beyond this level would require either tax increases or reduced spending in other areas to be consistent with the Government's strategy.<\/p> <p>  The Government's over-reliance on corporation tax receipts to fund public services must also be addressed.  Last year, one in five euro of tax receipts came from corporation tax, and more than half of those receipts were from ten corporate groups.  This concentration, coupled with the ongoing volatility of receipts and their vulnerability to international tax developments, is a source of serious concern.  To deal with these risks, the council assesses that the Government should allocate corporation tax receipts above what is forecast for a given year to the rainy day fund.  This would potentially include any increase due to the rise in the minimum corporation tax rate to 15%.  This would help to reduce the reliance on volatile, unpredictable, and potentially finite resources in much the same way that Norway treats its oil revenues.<\/p> <p>  The Government must also contend with the challenge of an Irish population that is rapidly ageing.  In October, the Commission on Pensions set out a package of reforms that would restore the long-run sustainability of the pensions system, including through raising the retirement age with life expectancy and a significant increase in PRSI contributions.  The Government now needs to set out how it will respond.  The proposal to delay raising the retirement age to 2028, however, raises questions about the willingness of future Governments to impose the kinds of measures recommended by the pensions commission.  Setting out a plan to phase in any PRSI increases over the coming years could help to make those measures more credible.<\/p><p>To summarise, the Government's medium-term strategy is appropriate and allows a large increase in public investment while bringing debt to safer levels, helped by expected growth and low interest rates.  However, some major questions need to be answered and decisions taken to ensure that the strategy is delivered.<\/p><p> We stand ready for the committee's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barnes.

It is an issue of consistency between the macroeconomic forecasts for compensation, namely, wages and the like, and what we see on the income tax side.  I will ask Dr. Casey to speak in more detail in a moment.  It is a difficult environment to predict taxes in because the unevenness in the economy means that some higher-wage sectors have continued to grow quickly in terms of employment and people have, on average, been getting wage increases.  We then see the reverse of the coin in the more service-oriented sectors where wages tend to be lower, there has been a significant shortfall in employment and wage prospects have not been as good.  The question is, when those two elements recover, to what level will that recovery take us.<\/p> <p>  We have been surprised by how robust income tax receipts have been.

By this we mean that, when the amount of income taxes being collected is divided by the amount of income that is forecast to be generated over the coming years, there seems to be a step change whereby every euro collected in tax was a bit higher than it normally would be for that level of wages.  We thought that looked unusual.  There could be any number of reasons driving it.  When we assessed the issue, it looked like the wage forecasts themselves were a bit low and potentially needed upward revisions whereas the actual tax forecast, which drew on more recent data and was available much closer to now, seemed to be okay and incorporated many of the positive developments that we saw in the middle part of the year and in recent months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eddie Casey"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Regarding an issue that we have been dealing with for some time, that being, the standstill costs, I note IFAC's work and that the Department is getting closer to the council.

The good news is that the Government has essentially moved towards an approach where it forecasts current spending as increasing in line with how one would expect it to increase.  Whichever measure is used, one can see that current spending is expected to grow a bit faster than even our estimate of the standstill costs.  That was not true in the past, which was implausible.  There has at least been a big step forward in producing credible forecasts because there is enough money there.  Unfortunately, the Government has not produced a great deal of information for the later years.  It has for 2022, but for the medium term, it has not set out its thinking on matters.  It has set out an allocated amount but what that amount covers is not clear.  There is no economic sense of what the allocation is.  It is just a decision taken by the Government to allocate this amount.  In some other publications, for example, the mid-year expenditure review, the Government included higher numbers in those years that were more similar to the fiscal space numbers.  It is a conceptual difference.  In this instance, the Government has used some concepts of allocation without spelling out what that allocation means.  The standstill costs are well defined and the Deputy can read our work on it.  Over the summer, the Government was using numbers that were more detailed and similar to ours.  Obviously, there are methodological differences but the gap is quite large and, therefore, it is not a methodological issue but a conceptual one and the Government is not including the full standstill amount.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#B00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>The Deputy was correct to point out that figure.  The way to view it is that we start with what the budget sets out as the cost of maintaining the existing level of services, which is &euro;2.2 billion in 2023 and 2024 and then &euro;2.5 billion by the end.  If one fully accounts for what we believe will be the cost of just standing still, allowing for demographic and price pressures in those years and bearing in mind that we fully index everything to wages, in which context we assume that welfare payments and pensions will rise in line with general economy wages, then we believe that the space that will be absorbed will be greater at perhaps &euro;500 million to &euro;1 billion.

Some of the comments he referred to were mine and he is correct that I would not have put them in the public domain.  The underlying background to it and the element that is most frustrating for most economists is that the process of forecasting is one where nobody ever gets it right all of the time but forecasts should really be judged by the information they are based on at the time they are done.  Again, the context was not given in the articles but it was well known to us.  The comment \"not forecasting Christmas\" goes back to the old issue of not putting Christmas bonuses in even though they are perfectly predictable, so we get these repeated errors on the spending side.  When they can be forecast, they definitely should be included.<\/p> <p>  We said at the end of 2019 that the economy looked like it was starting to run a little bit hot.  At the time, that was the right judgment to have.  Absolutely, we were wrong in that we did not forecast Covid but I do not think anybody did.  Again, the comment without context looks a little more snarky but the underlying issue is that when doing forecasts, what we want to see is a credible forecast process that takes into account all of the information.  It turns out that there were occasions when we were predicting worse outcomes where, of course, historically the Government got better outcomes but those were on the back of over performance in corporate taxation or other things that could not be forecast or were risky.<\/p> <p>  We will make mistakes and get forecasts wrong, as will the Department of Finance and every other forecaster, but the key point to recognise is that our core role in the Irish policy process is to assess those forecasts, determine where errors are made and assess the credibility of forecasts so that policies can be set on a sustainable footing.  Taking account of what we think of as excessively large corporate tax gains, even though they have been persisting, seems like a riskier strategy and one which we do not think is advisable.  That is setting the record straight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Michael McMahon"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I appreciate that; it is helpful.

We have been trying to pursue this with the Ministers for quite some time now, since the deal was struck because that number feels wrong.

Does the council believe the &euro;2 billion figure is credible or could the number be lower?  Could it even be neutral at the start?

In fact, it is a number of important changes in terms of the package internationally.  As has been said, there is a lot of uncertainty about what will happen.  A lot of the revenue is coming from a very small number of international companies that have very complicated businesses and which look at tax in very sophisticated ways.  We do not have the information to understand how they might make decisions so there is a lot of uncertainty.<\/p> <p>  There are two parts to this.  The first is the estimate from the Department of Finance that the changes to the tax base would cost &euro;2 billion.  That estimate has not been updated for a while so we do not know if that is still the Department's view, particularly given that a lot of the recent growth in corporation tax is probably due to international companies.  Offsetting that is the raising of the rate but the Government has not provided an estimate on that.  Mechanically, if the number of companies does not change very much, that is, if the base stays the same, we could be looking at a big increase in revenue from corporation tax.  Also, to be fair, corporation tax has increased a lot in recent years because a lot of the companies involved are making a lot more money than they were previously.  This is partly because of the pandemic and the shift to digital.<\/p> <p>  There are lots of moving parts to this.  Our concern is the uncertainty but also if we lock in higher levels of corporation tax, which may persist for some time, that is a big risk down the line as we become more and more exposed to a volatile source of revenue that could go away over time if companies change their strategies.

The overall approach the Department of Finance takes is pretty much in line with international practice, subject to the many limitations of forecasting.  Ireland has always been quite a difficult economy to predict but if we focus more on domestic issues, perhaps we get a better measure of it.  It is also the case that we are in a very challenging environment.  There has not been anything like the Covid crisis ever.  A lot of the uncertainty relates to the evolution of the pandemic, which is very difficult to predict.  It depends on mutations of the virus, how it spreads and many issues that are very hard to understand.  We are living in a particularly difficult moment.  There are some issues that are not related to this where there could be more progress in the Department of Finance.  One area, for example, is on the spending side outside the Exchequer area.  Providing more information on that would be very helpful to understand what is going on.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's question on inflation, which is very timely, is a good example of the uncertainties we now face.  For the last couple of years, inflation has been very low.  People thought about why it was so low but they did not think about inflation picking up.  We have seen this shock and coming out of it, inflation has picked up a lot.  That is partly due to higher energy prices and the factors behind that are fairly complex.  It is also to do with supply constraints, both in Ireland and externally, as there has been a shift between different types of activity.  Supply has been disrupted by a number of different factors.  There are lots of things going on and there is a very active debate as to whether what we see with inflation is a temporary catching up or boost to price levels following the recovery from the pandemic or a more lasting phenomenon, whether the constraints are bigger where there have been shifts in the labour market and whether people's expectations on inflation are going to change.  There are many big questions out there.  We explore them a little bit in the report but there are no easy answers.<\/p> <p>  I invite my colleague, Mr. Casey, to share his thoughts on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>On the forecasting side, an interesting way of dealing with this is to look at why we got it wrong this year and why the deficit will be much better.  There are always two sides to the deficit - tax and spending.  On the tax side, we know that income tax and corporation tax will do a lot better.  Corporation tax has been such a volatile and unpredictable tax head that one would say there is a much better way we can forecast that with great certainty.  On the income tax side, what the Department seems to be doing, which we would encourage, is looking at ways of forecasting this tax head by individual sectors.  It involves looking at what are the high-, middle- and low-income sectors and forecasting in respect of those areas.  We generally forecast what overall wages are doing but this would not have helped us with a shock like Covid because many of the low-paid sectors, where taxes were not very high, were hit worse than any other sector and so the overall hit to income tax was not as large as we would have expected.  What we really need to do is look a bit more carefully through that tax head.<\/p> <p>  On the spending side, a very useful thing for the committee that we would love to see next year is a clear split so that when this is looked at on a monthly basis, we know what the core spending is doing, everything outside Covid and the buffers for it.  We could not see that this year and we still cannot get a clear picture of what is happening with core spending whereas we know what probably happened this year is that a lot of buffers built in for various Departments for Covid-related spending just have not been needed, which is a good thing.  This is one of the reasons we are seeing a better deficit but it is very hard to track.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eddie Casey"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Regarding that issue and the forecasting, there is an underspend in capital and grants whereby works could not be carried out or moneys were there to be spent but were not.

It is very difficult to say what a tax change will yield if we cannot tell how it will feed through each of these sectors individually.  This is something that should be looked at in the modelling.

This could be seen spread across loads of Departments.  It was approximately &euro;600 million in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage while it was &euro;300 million in the Department of Transport.  It is laid out fairly clearly in the fiscal monitor.  We can really see a very broad spread across all areas.  It looks to be a problem.  This year, it was difficult to undertake a lot of the projects people wanted to but I would caution that in December last year and to a lesser extent in other years as well, we would have seen a big ramp up in capital spending in that month.  Very often, if we look at the past five or six years, we can see that the ratio of spending on capital that takes place in December versus every other month is about four to five times higher on average.

We should have a system where if a Department has committed to a job, at least it is reported that the contract is in place and funding is committed and will be spent by the end of the year.  While one can see what has been given out from each Department, one will also see what is committed in terms of what will be spent before the end of the year, for example, if there is going to be an underspend because the Department have not met its commitments, for example, the contract did not happen within the timeframe.  We need to shake up that a bit more and bring a more commercial sense to it.

I am interested in reading some of the documentation.  I will start with the chestnut of corporation tax.  The witnesses mentioned again the reasons we need to be careful about it because it is volatile and not 100% dependable.  The council has said this for five years and Mr. Barnes's predecessor made a point of saying it as well.  I refer to what Seamus Coffey said because it is worth putting it on the record.  He said that the whole idea behind the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is to institutionalise the memory of the crash.  There is a thing about the boy who cried wolf about the council and the volatility of corporation tax.  People looking on said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tOh my God, but sure look at the figures.  They've risen exponentially.  Now the base rate is rising.  It ought to result in a windfall. <\/blockquote> <p>I am of the same view as Mr. Barnes.  I believe anything over and above what is anticipated in corporation tax should be put in a rainy day fund.  The council is saying that and more.  This leads to my first question because I did make this point to the Minister for Finance.  He said that to have allocated the amount due to have been allocated to the rainy day fund in 2022 would have put undue pressure on the public finances given the situation we find ourselves in.  What is the council's view on that?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#D00700","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>The Deputy made a number of good points.  First, we are aware of the danger of crying wolf but, of course, our experience and the institutional memory of what happened are that these things can build up over a long time but one must not give up what one thinks one's analysis will be because eventually it will be true and one needs to make sure one is protected.<\/p><p>In some ways, regarding what has happened, the dynamic we had before 2019 was fairly unhealthy in the sense that we had repeated health overruns that were essentially being financed by the corporation tax excess.  Had we not had those health overruns, one can wonder what might have happened, but we might not have built in this reliance that we have.  We are partly locked into it because of past policy mistakes.  Looking at where we are now with the recovery, it is true that corporation tax over the past couple of years has helped us a little.  It helped us well during the crisis.  It was fortunate that it was strong but it could have gone the other way too.  We had a tailwind but I do not think that should lead us to be complacent.<\/p><p> The past couple of years were not an ideal time to put money in a rainy day fund because we were spending billions of euro to support the economy.  Maybe that is a reasonable point.  Money is fungible.  That is the circumstance where one would want to draw down from a rainy day fund.  It is fine that it has not been a priority in the last couple of years.  Looking ahead, we expect the economy will grow quickly.  That is a period when one needs to get one's house in order.  That is why we think that not increasing the over-reliance on corporation tax will be a priority for the years ahead.  That is a period when you want to build up the rainy day fund.  That is why we think it is important to put the rainy day fund back on the table.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I have an aside for Dr. Casey, which I hope will be taken the right way.

I will not consult with Wilson, the ball in here with me.  I am in the south of Ireland.  I was recently asked if I was at the South Pole.  On that point, much of the coverage was taken out of context, which the Deputy will not be surprised to hear me say.  They are probably not that far apart if a full discussion was had.  The ESRI did some analysis.  It said that if Ireland's debt ratio is looked at relative to GDP, it seemed lower than other countries, and because interest rates have fallen, which most economists would view as a long-term thing, there is probably more space over the coming decades to invest in things like housing.  In its responses, the Department of Finance suggested that this was somewhat unhelpful and pushed towards much higher deficits after a period of heavy deficits due to Covid.  The debt ratio was actually quite high when measured against national income and ignoring distortions of GDP.<\/p> <p>  Our own view is that Ireland still has a fairly high debt ratio.  We think the right way to measure these things is national income, which is GNI*.  That is the best measure we have of tax revenue, of what the underlying economy is doing and what is really driving the public finances.  It is not GDP.  When we look at it and think that the debt ratio is high, we think that some scope is given by lower interest rates to run slightly higher deficits over the medium term, but it is not enormous.  When one is starting from a high debt ratio already and is a small, open economy, it makes things harder.  We think that the Government should be targeting a reduction in the debt ratio over time.  We have to be cautious about how much spending we are talking about and how large a potential deficit we want to run to fund things like additional public investment in housing.  We said that the Government's current plans are appropriate in the medium term.  The discussion should start from such a baseline.  We would assess any change to those forecasts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eddie Casey"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I do not know if it is appropriate to bring in Mr. Giustiniani on the ageing profile.

Looking at my case and the other issue that was discussed recently, there is a question of income tax and how lower income is shielded, in the case of pensions.  This is a topic of discussion there.

A few points come to my mind.  On the last subject raised, people are going to, and will wish to, work for longer.  They will need to do so because they are living longer.  The natural corollary is that they will continue to work.  It would be difficult to sell to the people who are the voters - the voters count - the notion that we are all going to retire at 55 years and be looked after for the rest of our lives.  It is not going to be that way, nor should it be.  It will involve the other route.<\/p> <p>  We always look over our shoulder to make sure we are not going in the direction of the financial crash ever again.  When it occurred, the then Government and Oireachtas Members were given advice of every kind known.  We were told to default and that nobody could do anything about it.  We were told we owed too much money and that, as a consequence, we should default.  Well-meaning economists told us this.  Others told us that there would be a second bailout equal to, or nearly equal to, the first.  Fortunately, we did not take account of that either and decided not to proceed in that way.  By \"we\", I mean the Government and Oireachtas.  A lot of pressure was exerted when the IMF took over Government Buildings.  It was deciding what was going to happen.  We had a choice.  One option was to default, in which case we would be swinging in the wind with no support from any quarter, no banking and no credit, credibility or credit rating.  We should remember all the worries about the credit rating going from bad to worse, or downhill all the time, with obvious consequences for the future.  However, we recovered fairly quickly.  We did so for a number of reasons.  A couple of the basic industries, such agrifood and pharmaceutical, doubled up very quickly and carried the responsibility of driving the economy forward through exports.<\/p> <p>  It will be different in the future.  I fell foul of many economists during the period in question.  Before the crash came at all, I raised on several occasions in the House questions that needed to be answered at the time.  I mentioned this previously.  I had one answer to one question before the whole thing closed down.  The answer was an honest answer, given by the then Minister for Finance, a constituency colleague.  He told it as it was.  Action needed to be taken then but none was.  The question and its implications were pushed aside.<\/p> <p>  At this stage, I feel we need to have people with good judgment who do not panic and plan based on what is happening and might happen in the best- and worst-case scenarios.  Our economy has grown as our population has grown.  In the past 30 or 40 years, our population has almost doubled.  We had underdeveloped country before our membership of the EU.  We went well ahead from the time we became a member state, and we have lots of pace ahead of us still and many jobs for people born here and those who want to come to live here, because that is how our economy is going to grow.  At this stage, we must be astute.  We need to do the things that work well in achieving fiscal value.  We need to invest heavily in infrastructure because we did not have it in the past.  The Industrial Revolution did not come to us until after we joined the EU.<\/p> <p>  Those are the points that come to my mind based on my simple observations.  They need to be borne in mind for the future.

The council participates in a network of other fiscal councils across Europe with 32 members.  It so happens that last week, the network put out a report on the future of the fiscal rules which touches on some of these issues.  As regards the conclusion of the report, which would partly reflect my own view, the design of fiscal rules is an extremely complex subject.  Countries are in very different situations.  There are some with very high debt ratios and some with very low debt ratios, some with reasonably high growth such as Ireland and some with very low growth in recent years such as Italy.  It is, therefore, highly complicated.  There is a whole system of existing rules and problems, which means there are no particularly easy answers to any of these questions.<\/p> <p>  We discuss the 3% in the report.  There is a current view and debate that the 3% should be replaced with something more sophisticated.  There is another view that the 3% is the only part that anyone on the street has ever heard of and while it is a blunt instrument, it might be the only sort of brake in the system, so maybe we should not mess around with it.  Those are the two views.  Across Europe, the fiscal councils do not particularly take a view on that question.<\/p> <p>  The final point the Deputy made was very important.  There are two aspects of the report worth mentioning here.  The first is that we talk a little about the role of independent fiscal institutions such as the council.  We think they have more to offer, probably in a European context, in making sure that we can have a system that is rules-based but where there is some discretion to use overrides to avoid serious mistakes and promote the debate at national level.  We think the role of fiscal councils could be increased in that respect and the report discusses that more.<\/p> <p>  The second aspect is that we talk about the need to test the fiscal rules.  One of the mistakes made in the past is that people had relatively abstract discussions about what type of rule may or may not be good.  However, we need to look at what would actually apply when the rules kick in.  For example, the debt rule in certain circumstances could be very constraining in a way that is suboptimal.  In other circumstances, it might be absolutely fine.  One needs to look at the world as one expects it to be across all the different countries of the European Union or in the euro area.  One needs to look at the risks that things will not pan out as expected.  One also needs to evaluate whether the rules will work properly or not.  For example, some of the problems we saw in the enforcement of the debt rule in recent years would have been avoided had people done simulations and realised that this would be a problem for some countries.  That approach, based on testing and on evidence, is a bit of a shift from the way it has been done in the past.  That is very much in line with the way the council approaches many problems, which I think would be really helpful.  For this reason, one must always think about what something will actually mean.  Many rules sound quite nice but when one figures out what they actually mean for countries one realises that, for perhaps not all countries but for a small number of countries, it poses massive problems and that will undermine the whole framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis.

It is, therefore, topical and submissions need to be in by the end of the month.<\/p> <p>  The report also notes the Commission on Pensions package of reforms and the council's concern with delays in raising the pension age and PRSI increases.  I am interested in hearing IFAC's views on employer PRSI evasion through so-called bogus self-employment.  The Committee of Public Accounts heard recently that more than &euro;1 billion in PRSI is lost as a result of this practice every year.  The Sinn F&eacute;in view on the pension age is quite clear.  It seems unfair that we would force people to work longer while certain employers are allowed to shirk their tax obligations in this regard.  We heard that bogus self-employment arises in particular in the construction sector.  If we are hoping to ramp up construction, the practice should be looked at.

We welcome anything that strengthens that.<\/p> <p>  On the pensions question, there are issues such as the one the Deputy mentioned.  Over the next decades, there will be a significant increase in pension spending if we do not change the pension age to take account of the fact that people are living longer and the cohorts that will be reaching retirement in the next ten or 20 years are much bigger than previous cohorts.  The number of people reaching retirement age will be far greater.  Those two effects each account for half of the increase that we will get in pensions costs as a share of national income.  Those costs are very big.  There are not many alternatives and that is what the Commission on Pensions has found.  It has concluded, as we did in our long-term report, that the current system is not sustainable.  It recommended various approaches for dealing with that.  It made a recommendation that basically would involve indexation, which would cover 40% of the overall increase in the share of national income that would need to go into pensions, with the rest coming from taxation and also the Exchequer.  There are not many ways of avoiding these sorts of measures.  Obviously, there are some other things one can do that would help to adjust the cost but, underneath, those two drivers are very big and need to be addressed directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I also note IFAC's focus on the pension age and PRSI increases, but there does not seem to be much focus on the significant tax expenditure that occurs on private pensions.

I would be interested in the council commenting on why there is a lack of focus on this as well.<\/p> <p>  I want to go into something else before my time is up.  I noted in IFAC's opening statement - this is something the council has probably raised on every occasion it has been in front of this committee or the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach - the concern about the concentration of our corporate tax base, largely within ten companies.  It is something the council and others have been noting for some time.  What progress has the Government made in mitigating that kind of concentration or relocation risk arsing from an industrial strategy that places all our eggs in one basket?  Would it be prudent to begin weaning ourselves off this by ring-fencing large unexpected corporation tax receipts?  I note the council mentions that it should be ring-fenced into the rainy day fund but I refer to an alternative industrial strategy because that is something that we need to focus on as well given the changes in international taxes.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, we see that the climate advisory council is telling us that we need to use fiscal opportunities such as low-interest loans for the front-loading of public investment to reduce emissions within the next ten years.  What is the council's view on this?  I note Mr. Barnes touched on that.  We look at the risk because of climate change compared to the balance sheet risk and I would be interested in Mr. Barnes's view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#G00500","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":54,"content":"<p>There were two questions.  The first related to the concentration of the corporate tax base and risks around that, and the second was on climate.<\/p> <p>  On the corporate tax side, as the Deputy will be aware, this is something we have been highlighting for a long time.  As time has passed, that revenue has increased quite fast.  Reliance on it has increased, not through any Government policy but because the companies in question pay more tax in Ireland on the basis that they are doing more taxable activity in Ireland.  As the Deputy will be aware, we are concerned about the risks around that, as we have been for a long time.  We are perhaps getting a little more certainty on the policy side of that but we are increasingly reliant on a small number of companies.  That revenue can be volatile and we think we should reduce reliance.  That is why we think the rainy day fund would be a good way of ring-fencing that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the wider strategy for the economy, investing in education and infrastructure and continuing to ensure Ireland remains competitive are all very important, irrespective of what happens on the international side.<\/p><p>Those things might attract international companies and they may help domestic ones to develop.  Encouraging the economy is good for many reasons.  It provides people with good jobs.  It provides additional revenue that can be used to finance increased public activities too.  All that makes sense.  It is not something that we look at in great detail but it is important. <\/p><p> On climate, we have all become much more aware in the past couple of years of the seriousness of the climate problem and the scale of the action we will need to address it.  In fairness, there has been progress on that.  We had a new climate action plan this year that sets sectoral targets, and the targets have been made more ambitious over the past year.  There has been a lot of progress but we are still catching up.  The fact that there is no assessment of the budgetary impact of climate is a serious concern.  We just do not know how much it will cost.  It could cost quite a lot.  A big question is how much of the burden will fall on the private sector and how much on the public sector.  Another issue that has not been tackled is that some of the mitigation or transition measures may impact heavily on low-income families.  That might require changes to the welfare system or some kind of compensation which, again, could be very expensive.  Measures such as retrofitting could be very expensive.  These things just are not factored into the Government's budgetary plans because there is no overall assessment of how much it will cost.  We know that some of the necessary investments are in the national development plan.  It is not that it is not spending any money on this; there is a sizable commitment there.  However, it is not clear how things like retrofitting and a massive switch to electric vehicles will be funded.  The Government needs to make progress on that very quickly because it could be very expensive.  The additional spending available under its current plans is quite narrow.  Most other countries in the same position have not fully worked out how much it will cost and how it will work.  The Climate Change Advisory Council's report was published earlier.  As its chairman said, 2030 is tomorrow in terms of the kinds of investments and timescale of making these changes.  We really do need to work on this as fast as possible.  It needs to be a massive priority. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Like Deputy Farrell, I am conscious of votes coming through.

What we can say is that we do see through the national development plan a big increase in public investment in housing.  To look at how that is being accommodated, a growing economy, falling interest rates and a not massively fast increase in current spending are all coming together and they are creating a space to undertake that investment while, at the same time, bringing the budget towards balance and bringing debt down.  The Government has been able to tackle those two objectives at the same time to restore the public finances to a safer place and to have a significant increase in the amount for public housing investment.  It is important to underline that it is doing those two things.  We produced a new analytical note just before our fiscal assessment report came out on public investment.  One of the big things there is the supply constraint.  We estimate that it will need another 30,000 working in construction to deliver the plan the Government now has.  That might be quite difficult to find.  There are very few unemployed construction workers.  Migration is a bit more complicated than it was previously.

There is a risk.  There were excess savings through lockdown where people were constrained from being able to spend rather than choosing not to.  We know these are very unevenly distributed across the distribution of households.  They tend to be focused in households towards the higher end of the income distribution that did not see disruptions to their work and earnings.  The unwinding of those savings could provide a stimulus to the economy.  The risk is that at a time of supply constraints, as we have seen, those excess savings could result in inflation.  Part of what we are seeing around inflation, not only in Ireland but in many advanced economies, is that the combination of the increased demand as restrictions ease - this remark may be impertinent as we start to see restrictions and lockdowns reintroduced - people got out and spent but they did so in sectors that were constrained.  Some elements of the inflation we have seen are driven not by demand at all but by supply constraints.  Let us take energy and the oil and gas prices, which have gone up and stayed reasonably high for many months.  Now we have entered winter and it has started to get cold, they have become more of a burden.  In some ways, some households having excess savings will be a useful way for them to pay for these higher costs.  That is not so advantageous for the economy because it ultimately feeds out into the energy producers.  However, there are differences across sectors where these supply constraints means more or less.  It is quite a complex picture and one that we will watch.  Taking the view of the European Central Bank, a concern is that the higher inflation that we are seeing would become baked in and live in inflation expectations and, therefore, lead to higher interest rates.  We have discussed how low interest rates help the Government and households to deal with the current situation.  It is something to watch but the ECB has so far been very explicit that it views these increases in inflation as transitory.  It will stand ready and watch.  However, at the moment, the best guess is that unless we see something very marked, we should expect inflation to come down albeit not immediately and certainly not next year.  It will definitely be a strain on the recovery but probably helped by the excess savings that the Deputy mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Michael McMahon"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>What lessons does IFAC feel can be learned from the pandemic so far?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#H00600","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>That is a very good question.  In terms of the budgetary issues we look at, the Government support mechanisms have overall been very successful.  At one time early in the crisis we really feared there would be massive lasting damage to the economy.  We have not seen that partly because some sectors were not affected in the end but also because Government supports were so strong both in Ireland and internationally, they really protected people's incomes, jobs and businesses.  That has not been the case for everyone but overall the size of the measures has been very successful.  It shows how important it is to start with public finances in good shape so that governments can afford to do that.  Some countries were not able to be quite so generous, particularly poorer countries, including even in Europe, because their finances did not go into this in such good shape.<\/p> <p>  There is another positive message that comes back to the earlier question about modelling.  Technically, we have learned quite a lot.  Earlier Dr. Casey was talking about looking at sectoral patterns to look at income taxes.  That is probably something we should have done anyway but we never did because it was never a huge issue.  Now we have developed those techniques we can look at it.  It is the same with much of what we call nowcasting, with the credit card data that is being used to monitor the economy, for example.
