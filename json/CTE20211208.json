The timing of this meeting is good in that the December meeting of the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council starts on Sunday, 13 December.  This is an opportune time to have this discussion.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of issues I want to address without going through all of the opening statement I have submitted in five minutes.  The first of those is very important, in that the clout of the Council of Fisheries Ministers has been diminished in the light of Brexit and the trade and co-operation agreement, TCA.  As we sit here today, the EU-UK bilateral negotiations have not been completed.  Until they are completed, the council will not be able to, in essence, rubber-stamp the TACs and quotas for next year.<\/p> <p>  The key message I want to get across about the setting of TACs and quotas for next year is that the EU-UK bilateral agreement, which is part of the TCA, is critical.  From an Irish point of view, approximately 58 of the 60-odd stocks in which we have an interest are covered in the TCA.  If the TCA were to be taken out of consideration, the council will be left with two stocks to deal with.  That is not going to apply only for this year.  This is the new scenario in which we live, in light of Brexit and the TCA.  We, as industry representatives, feel isolated, even aside from Covid, which is causing problems in terms of physical briefings.  We feel we are being isolated and do not have the same input to the Fisheries Council, where all of these decisions were made in previous yeas, because of the EU-UK bilateral arrangement.  We are emphasising to the Minister and to the committee that it is important a process is put in place to deal with the stakeholder involvement on the EU and UK ends.<\/p><p>When it comes to the total allowable catches, TACs, and quotas for next year, the one thing that will not happen either at the EU-UK bilateral discussion or, indeed, the Fisheries Council is a look at the relative stability percentage shares that member states have.  That will not be dealt with at the December Fisheries Council.  It will be dealt with, hopefully, by the Commission's report at the end of next year.  We are demanding that there is a full review and change in those relative stability percentage shares.  In terms of today, I have stuck rigidly to the TAC and quota proposals for next year.<\/p><p> There are a few big items that stick out and that I want to highlight.  Something the Commission in bringing forward its proposals - it cannot put in figures at this stage until the EU-UK bilateral is finalised as such - seems to continually provide for is that the Common Fisheries Policy requires that not alone do you look at the biology and the sustainability of the stocks but that you must look at the socioeconomic effects as well.  The Commission consistently failed to do that in its proposals as such and leaves it to the Council to do that even though the Council really does not have any power this year as they EU-UK bilateral will be looking at it.<\/p><p> One issue we really want to highlight is the mackerel situation and what Norway and the Fareo Islands did this year.  Norway increased its quota by 55% or a whopping 100,000 tonnes.  I am not getting the figure wrong here.  It is 100,000 tonnes of extra mackerel.  The Commission has been sitting on its hands here and preaching to us about sustainability.  We have been after them over the past six months, that they need to bring in sanctions.  They have the legal mechanisms to do this.  We are calling on the Council, on Sunday and Monday next, to address this issue and instruct the Commission that this Norway and Fareo Islands reckless and irresponsible behaviour has to stop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120800002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Donoghue.

I will move on to decommissioning.<\/p> <p>  As far as the Irish fish producers are concerned, the decommissioning was agreed at the task force.  While it is unfortunate and it is not something that our industry was hoping to achieve, it is something that was foisted upon us.  We have a situation where we have a mismatch between the available quotas for our demersal fleet and the size of the fleet, and in that instance we would be tasked also by the European Commission to decommission.  Unfortunately, it is a necessary evil.  We would like to see the Department think outside the box and find some way to bank some of this tonnage so it would leave an opportunity for young fishermen coming into the fleet in future years to be able to get tonnage.  An unfortunate situation is created by decommissioning.  Once this capacity is taken out of our fleet, it is gone forever and we cannot get it back.  This is something that I would like to see the committee take on board.<\/p> <p>  I reiterate the comments that my colleague made about the mackerel situation.  It is critical for Ireland in future years that the Commission acts by taking some steps against these countries which are declaring unilateral quotas.  They will effectively destroy this mackerel fishery which is so very important to Irish fishermen.<\/p> <p>  The results of our recent task force should have empowered the Minister to seek some resolution from our European partners about the inordinate price that Ireland has paid for Brexit.<\/p> <p>  We, as an industry, are concerned that while in the past the European Council that happens in Brussels later this month was an opportunity for the Minister and his officials to barter and negotiate with our European partners on each others priorities, we now have a situation where most of the stocks that we are concerned about must be agreed, primarily with the UK in the EU-UK bilaterals, and we are very concerned that we have limited input to this process.  It is something that we as an industry have to be very concerned about.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to talk to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Ward"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Ward.

Two of the key topics, as identified by my two colleagues, are decommissioning and the total allowable catches, which, to explain how critical this is, is the amount of fish that each country is allowed to catch under the Common Fisheries Policy to ensure that the stocks remain healthy, that they are not overfished and that they would be there again the following year.<\/p> <p>  The fly in the ointment now is that Brexit has happened and the UK has taken away its waters from us.  Under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, TCA, deal that was negotiated, the UK got to catch and retain 75% of the fish in its waters, leaving 25% for the European Union countries.  They also retain some entitlements for quota outside of their waters, within ours and other countries' within the EU.  We are left with 15% of the pie - the best way to describe it - giving away 85% to the other countries which have access to these stocks.<\/p> <p>  We have been hit by Covid in the past two years.  Our markets, our market share and the prices have been decimated.  You will have seen only this week what fishermen are up against - the storms and gales that hit our coastline.  If you are not out fishing, you are not earning.  On top of that, there is this TCA deal that we feel we got very badly treated in.  On top of this coming this year, the science is not very good for the total allowable catches and we are seeing our opportunities being decimated further and the stocks that are so important to us being cut.  That will heighten the problems for our industry to try to earn a living.  We are governed by a great many regulations, such as the landing obligation.  If we fall foul of them in a mixed-stock fishery we find ourselves in problems and difficulties as well, which we learned yesterday during one of the meetings with the European Commission.<\/p> <p>  All these events have overtaken our industry and we are talking then about one of the solutions that seems to be presented to us, and that is decommissioning.  We have seen decommissioning introduced into our fleet in the past number of years.  This is the third such decommissioning scheme.  Where I see fleets on the Continent modernising and building new boats to come to our waters to go fishing, we, on the other hand, are now seeing a proposal being presented to the Minister where 60 vessels will be decommissioned out of an active 180 vessels.  On top of that, there is also off-registered tonnage to be decommissioned.  At a rate of &euro;5,000 per tonne, if that is what it will make, that is another six boats that will never enter our fishing industry, bringing us to a total of 66 boats.<\/p><p>This is what our industry is facing.  We sit on the continental shelf.  When I was growing up, I was taught that Ireland had the richest fishing grounds in the world.  This is where fish come to spawn and breed.  It is very hard for me, as a representative of my industry, to tell my fishermen that we are facing an unnecessary evil.  We should be looking for more fish.  The reason we should be doing so is that the Common Fisheries Policy is to be reviewed next year, as my colleague, Mr. O'Donoghue, pointed out.  Before this review, when we will have a chance to get more fish, we are instead looking at getting rid of a third of our fleet.  I find that very hard to take.  <\/p><p> As the committee has seen in our presentations, as a member of the task force, our group pointed out the cost on the open market of entering the industry right across the different sectors.  There is evidence of this on page 18 of the report where it states that it would cost more than &euro;20,000 per gross tonne to get a tier 1 polyvalent vessel out of the industry.  Despite this, the proposal is still on the table.  We have an enormous problem in the south and west of Ireland with the amount of money that has been set out and the terms and conditions attached to the decommissioning scheme.  We made sure this was included in the task force report.  We are completely and utterly against these kinds of reductions, such as changing vessels because of their age or condition.  Once a vessel meets the standards in the code of practice, it should be allowed go to sea and have the same opportunities as any other vessel in the sector, regardless of age.  <\/p><p> The easiest way to explain this to listeners and to those looking in on the meeting is to say that, if you got into a taxi in Dublin and it took you 50 miles down the road, there would be no difference between taxis with different number plates.  One taxi would not charge you more than another with an older number plate.  It is the same for fishing vessels.  Once they are capable and once the Marine Survey Office, MSO, signs off on their ability to go to sea to fish under the code of practice, they should be given the same opportunities.  We see boats being bought for up to &euro;7 million.  As set out in the report, their gross tonnages, GTs, would value them at perhaps &euro;1.5 million to &euro;2 million.  This is not right.  It does not take into consideration the loss of the business or the goodwill that would be shown to people in other businesses for leaving the industry.  It does not take into consideration the loss of this industry to these people for a minimum of five years.  As we state in our submission, we find some of the terms and conditions relating to decommissioning a vessel crazy such as that the owner is responsible for breaking up and destroying the vessel.  We do not know how much this will cost.  That is unknown.  We have had no indication.  We have had guesswork and people have come in to us but we have seen no paperwork.  We know how important it is, in this day and age, to make sure that all materials are disposed of correctly.  This comes at a cost.  On top of that, we see that crews are to be paid out of this.  Again, we do not know what this will cost.  <\/p><p> It is the same for the total allowable catches, TACs.  It is very hard for our members to understand why we are at this juncture.  They did nothing wrong.  They followed the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy.  They are fishing and working with agencies such as Bord Iascaigh Mhara to develop new technical measures and gear to actually avoid fish.  There are a great many measures to avoid fish.  There is nearly less of a net to catch fish than to avoid them.  This is the reality of the industry we are working in.  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to discuss this further and in greater detail through questions from the Deputies and Senators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120800002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to speak at this evening's meeting.  It is much appreciated.  I support what my colleagues have said.  They have covered most of the subjects we want to deal with very well.  On the process of setting the fishing opportunities for 2022, as Mr. O'Donoghue has pointed out, the whole landscape has changed after Brexit and the trade and co-operation agreement, TCA.  We are now dependent on EU-UK negotiations.  Our input is probably late at this stage.  We feel that the process needs to be somewhat changed for the future, perhaps starting with stakeholder involvement at an earlier stage.<\/p> <p>  On the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, we feel that a full review and reform is needed.  The last time we were in this meeting room, we were looking for burden sharing in light of the effects of the TCA and the loss of a great amount of quota in that agreement.  To this day, we have not had one kilo of fish returned to Ireland through burden sharing by our European partners.  This is really a big concern for the industry in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  With regard to negotiations on total allowable catches, TACs, and quotas, in the statement I sent to the committee, I pointed out the species in respect of which the science is quite good or, in some cases, very good.  I will not go through them all here because there is no point.  Despite the science, the TACs for these species are down for relatively large and, in some cases, very large reductions.  We have signed up to follow the science but the science is not being followed if account is not being taken of the scientific information available that shows positive indicators for stocks and if the Commission is still seeking reductions in TACs.  That should be adjusted to correctly reflect the scientific situation.<\/p> <p>  On decommissioning, as my colleagues have mentioned, this issue was discussed at length in the task force.  We have a problem with the discounts for the age of vessels because all vessels now have to have a safety certificate signed off by the MSO, as Mr. Murphy pointed out.  This requires vessels to be kept up to a very high standard so all vessels going to sea in Ireland are of a very high standard.  This is absolutely correct.  The vessels are of a high safety standard, which is exactly what we want, but this should be reflected in the moneys being paid for decommissioning.  These people are giving up their livelihoods through no fault of their own.  It is because of the loss of quota under the TCA that we are told this has to happen.  As we pointed out, we would much prefer to have our quota returned or our share adjusted under the relative stability principle to reflect fairness in fishing opportunities, but that will not come until after the proposed decommissioning programme.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of Norway unilaterally declaring a quota for mackerel in 2021, we have been arguing over this for many months now.  We support the Killybegs Fishermens Organisation's position.  The Commission needs to take action to resolve this or it will continue or even get worse.  It may also expand to other countries.  I will finish on that.  I thank the Chairman very much for this opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120800002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests who have come here today to speak about the continued crisis in fishing.  It is something I have spoken on at great length in the D&aacute;il.  Serious errors were made in the run-up to the Brexit negotiations, which have cost us dearly.  The Government failed to get a deal for the sector during Brexit negotiations and the only option it is now putting forward is a decommissioning plan.  At the heart of this plan is an agenda to allow foreign vessels to take more fish from Irish waters while Irish vessels are forced to be decommissioned or remained tied up in ports.  I have a few questions to ask on decommissioning at the end but I have a statement to read out first.<\/p><p>It appears &euro;63.5 million will be paid to those families who are being forcefully removed from the fishing industry.  This sum is to be deducted from &euro;400 million in funding given to the Government from the &euro;1.1 billion fund paid to Ireland by the EU.  I might ask a further question on that later.  We appear to be on the lower end of the scale as regards the funding we will get from the &euro;1.1 billion fund.  We have ended up with &euro;63.5 million but our industry will probably be the most affected.<\/p><p> In summary, under the Brexit deal, Ireland contributed about 15% of the total value of our total 2020 fisheries quota to the agreement.  Proportionately, that is substantially more than that of any other member state impacted.  This was a disastrous deal for Irish fisheries.  The Minister and the Government completely failed to protect the interests of the sector during the negotiations.  Regardless of how much I pressed in the D&aacute;il for other options to be put forward, they were not put forward by the Minister or the Government.  It was extremely important that every option was considered.  For example, even the task force report noted the case being made by some member states that if the transfers to the UK were evenly divided across each member state with fishing rights, it would involve a 5.8% transfer per member state.  The Minister utterly failed to negotiate such a deal.  Arguably, this was the worse ever deal negotiated by any Minister on behalf of the State.<\/p><p> The Irish seafood economy is estimated to be worth &euro;1.22 billion.  Approximately 16,400 people are employed by the industry, which includes ancillary services such as production, the servicing of fishing boats and net manufacture.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Ireland's seafood development agency, states &euro;400 million is generated through domestic consumption and &euro;263 million through exports and imports.  Some 2,030 fishing vessels were registered in Ireland as of 2020.<\/p><p> I could go on.  The representatives of the industry know all about this.  They held peaceful demonstrations in Cork and Dublin recently and got great support from the people.  When I raised this issue in the D&aacute;il the response I received, that there will be quota discussions in 2023 or later, effectively kicked the can down the road.  It was as if to say those in the industry would be given some bit of compensation now to get rid of them and that would be the handiest way out of it.<\/p><p> While some of those in the industry agreed with the task force report, one fishing organisation did not and I completely support it.  Are Mr. Murphy from the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation and the other representatives happy with the findings of the task force report?  Do they consider &euro;63.5 million to be a fair payout given that decommissioning seems to be the only answer the Government has?  In the 12 months since the disastrous deal was signed, have there been any discussions with the industry on the next quota negotiations?  I assume negotiations will start to see we can put up a fight to win something back.  I would appreciate if the witnesses could answer those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120800002#C00300","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I will bring in Mr. Murphy as the first question was addressed to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120800002#D00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Collins for understanding the dire consequences that lie ahead of us.  To put this in simple mathematical terms, this decommissioning scheme is based on the gross tonnage, GT, on board a vessel.  There is power on board a vessel.  One parameter that could indicate an overall value of a boat was chosen.  For example, if we take the case of a boat with 200 GTs where the fisherman gets &euro;10,000 per GT, by multiplying 200 by 10,000, we can calculate the figure that will be paid for the decommissioning of that boat.  The report states that the decommissioning of 8,000 tonnes is being sought.  If we multiply that figure by 12,000, the monetary figure would be up to &euro;96 million.  That leaves a shortfall of &euro;31,800 million, which is the figure I put in the report.<\/p> <p>  To return to the reason we think this scheme is detrimental to our country, it will affect not only our fishing industry but every man, woman and child who lives on the island.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara does an economic study on the industry every year.  If we are set to lose one third of our boats and one third of our income from those boats, I believe the loss will be much more than the 15% figure the Deputy cited.  We have lost access to areas of the English coastline and, for example, Rockall where we had a very important squid fishery worth &euro;5 million.  The sums keep adding up.  Species are being lost to us and they have not been included in the figures.<\/p> <p>  To bring it down to figures, we have 16,420 jobs in the industry.  If we lose one third of our earning power, it follows that we will lose 5,500 jobs.  We have &euro;560 million worth of exports.  If we lose one third of that &euro;560 million, all of which comes into the country each year from fishing, we will be down &euro;180 million a year.  That is large amount of money to be lost to the Exchequer and the economy as we come out of the Covid-19 crisis when money is being sought to support people.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked if the figures added up.  They definitely do not add up.  We submitted papers to the task force with respect to vessels and vessel owners gave me permission, if needed, to name them.  They agreed to appear before the committee to outline what they paid for boats.  They could prove what they had paid to get into the industry.  The average amount paid was &euro;14,500 and for the larger boats, the tier 1 vessels, the average paid was more than &euro;25,000.  It is not correct for those people to be told they can take less and  go.  No society should allow that to happen.  The report indicates that &euro;12,000 is the maximum that will be paid.  Given there is only a budget of &euro;63 million, we can see the intent from the outset.  Those figures indicate a figure of less than &euro;8,000 per GT.  That is a poor reflection on our country, which has the richest fishing grounds.  <\/p> <p>  We are going to see a third decommissioning scheme to allow, as the Deputy said, boats from other jurisdictions to increase their fishing efforts in our waters, make a living here, land catches all over the country and take Irish fish home to benefit their coastal communities, as is already happening.  Having been a fisherman all my life, I find that incredible.  In my village of Baltimore, from where I fish, I saw the industry being decimated by previous decommissioning schemes.  Given the position I am, it would kill me to look back in the history books and see that our fleet had been decimated in such a manner again.<\/p> <p>  The crux of the matter is this.  The report states &euro;38 million worth of fish will come back into the fishery if we get what is being sought and all these boats are taken out.  What happens if we do not get that?  We will still have a shortfall.  As I said, &euro;38 million is not enough.  We are short much more than that.  We can see from the figures in the Marine Institute's stock book published in recent weeks that we are down &euro;184 million.  Adding &euro;38 million to &euro;84 million does not bring us up to the &euro;250 million figure we had last year.  There is still a shortfall.  That means boats still do not have the opportunity to stay viable on the water.  This leads to difficulties in a mixed stock fishery where they will be up against it to try to remain legal.  There is no such thing as stop lights to tell one fish it can go in a net and the another it cannot.  We are doing our best with technical measures to leave out all the small fish and allow the juveniles to escape through the T90 nets.  We have escape panels, selector panels.  We are working very hard to make sure we have a sustainable industry for the future.  However, the toughest thing to accept is that this will benefit foreign fleets more than our own people at home.  Fishermen will be told to leave the industry and to do so with less money than they put up to get into the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Doherty wish to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120800002#D00400","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to be here today.  Everybody is seeking the figures for the Brexit deal and trying to find out how Ireland ended up in the position we are in.<\/p><p>It is very simple.  A transfer to the UK of &euro;183 million is going to happen annually and the Irish industry is on the hook for &euro;43 million of that.  How we ended up in this position is not the issue.  We are where we are but we have control over what we can do going forward in terms of trying to get something back on burden-sharing.  It is very easy to see how Ireland was thrown under the bus on this by Europe.  In the context of mackerel, for example, the Irish industry is paying 40% of the transfer to the UK on pelagics alone.  This 40% is on an annual basis and it will end up costing between &euro;26 million to &euro;28 million per year.  Over a ten-year period, about &euro;260 million to &euro;300 million will be sucked out of the economy in Ireland, and that will have a massive impact on jobs in the coastal communities in which we live.<\/p><p> It is imperative the Government goes back to the EU, outlines the facts and figures to our European colleagues and gets some burden-sharing back for our industry.  The amount of money that is being taken out of the industry is unsustainable.  If the white fish industry as well as the pelagic sector is included, approximately &euro;25 million of the &euro;43 million is being sucked out of Donegal alone.  I do not want to focus solely on Donegal though because the prawn men have lost on the east coast and all of the coastal communities in the south and west have lost as well.  We are talking about hundreds of millions of euro being lost to our coastal communities over the next ten years.  If there was an announcement tomorrow that companies were coming to the coastal regions to set up new industries that would put hundreds of millions into the economy over the next five to ten years, it would be a big story.  Indeed, it would be a great story if it materialised.  We have an industry that has been existence in these regions for decades and all it needs is support to continue.<\/p><p> Burden-sharing demands should be coming from our Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There should be a joint effort at European level to outline the facts and figures, to try to rectify the situation, and to get some quota back for Ireland.  The situation with regard to mackerel in 2021 in the north Atlantic and the coastal states amounts to a smash-and-grab of the quota.  It cannot be dressed up in any other way.  It is a smash-and-grab and that has been the case since 2010.  We in the industry are disillusioned, to say the least, given what has happened in 2021.  On the back of the Brexit fallout, we have given away 21,000 tonnes of mackerel or 40% of the mackerel transfer from the EU to the UK.  Countries like Denmark have only given away &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million while we have given away &euro;27 million.  Countries in the north Atlantic have increased their quota this year by 55% but there has not been one statement from the Taoiseach on fisheries matters.  Compare this with countries like France, where President Macron regularly speaks for the French fishing industry.  It is time for the highest politicians in the land in Ireland to start speaking up and highlighting what went on in 2021 as regards mackerel, which is the main fishery in Ireland.  The 55% increase for certain countries, as Mr. O'Donoghue said, equates to 100,000 tonnes.<\/p><p> By the time this Brexit transfer is over in 2026, Ireland's quota will probably be somewhere south of 50,000 tonnes in total.  In 2010, Iceland only had a quota of 2,000 tonnes of mackerel but now it is fishing between 160,000 and 170,000 tonnes of mackerel per year.  The Faroe Islands has a quota of 145,000 tonnes, Greenland has a quota of 60,000 tonnes, Russia has a quota of around 100,000 tonnes, while Norway has a quota of 300,000 tonnes, but we cannot even get the European Commission to make a statement on the matter, call these countries out and use the tools at its disposal, like sanctions, to stop them.  There is a wall of silence on this.  This will have a direct effect on our industry going forward.  This reckless behaviour in 2021 will have an effect on future quotas for Ireland because the stock will not take this level of overfishing.  Everything they do in the north Atlantic has a direct effect on us in Ireland.  What is ironic from our perspective is that the mackerel stock actually spawns in Irish waters, migrates north and then comes back annually, and yet we will have the smallest quota of all of the coastal states.<\/p><p> All of these states, by the way, catch mackerel in international waters.  It is imperative that our Government works with its European colleagues to get these coastal states to catch only 10% of the quota in international waters because that is where they are catching all of this quota.  They are not catching any mackerel this year in their own waters but they are catching hundreds of thousands of tonnes of the stock and putting it at risk, which will have a direct effect on our industry on the back of Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120800002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciaran Doherty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Doherty and call Deputy Mac Lochlainn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120800002#E00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>The submissions make for very sober reading.  My view of the task force report, which advocates reducing our fishing fleet over a certain size even further, down to only a percentage of what it was in 2006, is that we have waved the white flag of surrender in relation to our interests.  The submission from the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation draws our attention to the stock book, a very voluminous document.  The data, which I have seen myself, indicate we have 15% of the fish in our own waters under the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  I read out some of the percentages we get in certain areas.  There is one body of water where we have 29% of it but we have percentages of species ranging from 3% up to around 6%.  The French have less in that particular area but they have percentages ranging from 40% to 60% of the allocation.  That is the context.<\/p> <p>  The point has been made about mackerel and the failure of the EU to stand up to those countries that are clearly defying all of the international rules around sustainability, total allowable catches, TACs, and quotas.  The difficulty in all of this, which is heartbreaking, is that some of the producer organisations felt they had a gun to their head.  They knew there were people who would not be able to sustain a future and they took the opportunity to decommission.  That is what this was - a gun was put to their head.  There was no sustainable future and there was no fight from the Government.  The Government did not even try.  As I said, the Government did not even stand outside the Berlaymont and speak over the heads of the ministers and officials who refuse to do what is right.  It did not try to speak to the ordinary, decent people in Spain, Belgium, France, Holland and so on, and ask them if they would tolerate a situation where 85% of the fish in their own waters, a precious natural resource, would be given away.<\/p><p>With this precious natural resource, 85% will be handed away.  Worse still, such a high percentage of boats would be decommissioned that those communities would be devastated again and again.  The white flag is being flown.<\/p><p> The difficulty for producer organisations which signed up to the task force is that they are dealing with people whose lives have been destroyed.  They had a gun to their head and we should call it what it was.  They had to do a deal for them.  I appreciate that this was unbelievable pressure.  I understand why the body from the south and west did not sign up to it and I have sympathy for those who did.  This is an absolute tragedy and we should not dress it up as anything else.<\/p><p> We are being forced to decommission such a high percentage of our fleet while French and Belgian governments are investing in strengthening their fleets because of the abundance of stock they have under the Common Fisheries Policy.  I just do not see the strategy.  I can see the unification of the fishing industry and the protests in Cork and Dublin were good for the heart.  I appeal to all of the groups here today to stay united.  Of course, they have differences and there are matters of division but they should stay united to challenge the injustice of what we were given under the Common Fisheries Policy.<\/p><p> Mr. Doherty rightly asked the question regarding how President Macron can stand up for his French fishermen, challenging, as he did, the UK Government recently.  Why do other countries assert their rights, even aggressively at times in the case of Norway, the Faroe Islands and Iceland when it comes to mackerel?  Why do we find ourselves in this position?  I know all this commentary from me is not a particular comfort but we must say it out loud.  By signing up to this task force and approach, we have waved the white flag.<\/p><p> There clearly has not been burden sharing, which would have been eminently fair.  It should have been expected that there be equal burden sharing of losses arising from the EU-UK trade agreement.  There are suggestions but this must be first and foremost in the Minister's mind now.  I want to get the views of the witnesses on this.  When the Minister goes out to negotiate, do the witnesses agree that there must be a levelling-up approach?  Whatever is agreed in the forthcoming quota allocation, I know from the submissions it will deal only with a fraction of what must be dealt with.  Now is the moment for our Government to make a stand on the disgraceful failure to ensure burden sharing after the EU-UK trade agreement.  It must demand that levelling up in these negotiations.<\/p><p> The problem has been put to me that because we have signed up to decommissioning using EU money, we may have damaged our own case.  Burden sharing is an immediate responsibility and the witnesses mentioned the failure of the EU to stand up to states in which they are in a partnership.  These include Iceland, the Faroes and Norway.  There has been a failure to deal with the mackerel question.  Ultimately, there is the question of the 15% figure.  For Christ's sake, we are talking about fish in our own waters, and, in some cases, the proportion is even more derisory.<\/p><p> Will the groups stand united despite their differences on the task force?  I am seeking to get their view.  Will they demand that the Government does not allow the fact that EU money is being used to decommission more of our boats as part of a deal where we would not stand up and fight for our rights to fish?  The IFPO submission talks about leaving aside opportunities while the decommissioning is proceeding.  Some will take up the offer to voluntarily step aside but we should be able to reopen it for people to avail of that opportunity in the future.  We should not absolutely wave the white flag, take those vessels out of the fleet and never allow people to go back at it again.  What is the point of fighting for additional quota and our fair share of the fish in our waters if we cannot go back to the question of vessels in our fleet and some strategy on the updating and reinvestment for that fleet?<\/p><p> I appreciate that all the witnesses are at this a long time.  They are weary and have heard this all before.  At some point this must change and the dam must break and the water of freedom and righteousness should flow through.  What is happening to our country?  I want to get the ideas from the witnesses about what they want from the Taoiseach and the Minister responsible for the marine in these upcoming negotiations and going into next year.  What change in approach do they need to see?  How are we going to stand up for the rights we have absolutely been screwed over on for so long?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120800002#E00300","speaker":"1463","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The Deputy has put a question to the four chief executive officers.

On the design of decommissioning, it is the policy of the Irish South and East Fish Producers Organisation not to have any decommissioning.  We did not support it on the previous two occasions and we do not support it this time.  However, people on the ground are short of quota and the availability of fishing opportunity.  They do not see a way out and they are asking that we would at least negotiate a price.  We are not altogether happy with the formulation or the discounts and we are not happy that premiums were not offered for ring-fenced sectors and vessels with exclusive fishing rights.  There was no premium offered.<\/p> <p>  We are also not happy with the tie-up scheme money possibly being deducted from the decommissioning money next year, when decommissioning is to be paid.  The tie-up scheme was to help alleviate the issues for 2021 and it is proposed that this be deducted from the decommissioning scheme if people take it up, in 2022.<\/p> <p>  We are absolutely not in favour of decommissioning and would go to any lengths to stop it.  The only reason we got involved with negotiating the price of decommissioning was that it is a voluntary scheme.  As people have rightly pointed out at this meeting, the figures do not add up.  It is &euro;63 million and 8,000 gross tonnes and it does add up with the &euro;12,000 top-up premium that has been offered.  Even offering &euro;10,000, it does not add up.  We are definitely not happy with it but we were on the task force and we got involved with designing the scheme because people on the ground would like to take it.  Having said that, we remain opposed to decommissioning in the Irish fleet.  It is our objective to get a fairer share of those quotas that the Deputy mentioned.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about unity among the organisations.  The four organisations represented at this meeting work very well together.  As the Deputy said, we do not agree on absolutely every matter, although we respect each other's individuality.  From time to time, we make different points but overall we support each other and back each other up at meetings.  Ultimately, we all have the same objective, which is to get the best deal possible for the Irish fishing industry.  We will work as hard as we can to get there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120800002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Lynch"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I am thankful again for the opportunity to speak.  I had a good opportunity at the start and I thank Deputy Mac Lochlainn for his questions.  I will follow up where Mr. Lynch left off.  Another producer organisation was recently formed and we also work with processors, including the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association and its new chief executive, Mr. Brendan Byrne.<\/p><p>I do not want to leave out the aquaculture sector and the fisheries local action groups, FLAGS.  When we are on the task force, yes, we definitely work together.  We started off with a figure of 6,500 for GT.  Can you imagine?  I am sorry for laughing, but that is comical because we knew that the reductions were coming.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn asked how we can do things and what the positive things we can do are.  We use the tools that are there for our country.  There is the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, STECF.  Like the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, the STECF also gives reports and has to do evaluations on the fleets and the performance of the fleets across Europe.  As I pointed out, the figures have now changed and, unfortunately, they come very late, so it might be a year or two before we can look at what is happening.  It is the same with Covid.  We have to move forward in time.  We cannot wait.<\/p><p> Yesterday, we were at a committee meeting on the funding for the fisheries and aquaculture and for monitoring and our control agencies.  We were told there could be another infringement opened against Ireland and more money deducted from our funds because of issues with the landing obligation.  We do not want to move away from what we are talking about, but there are more complications there.  We have been before the committee about this before.  We lost the right to send our fish to a factory to be weighed.  We had to do it on the pier and take the ice off it.  There is a lot against our industry but there are definitely mechanisms there for it.  There is the Fish Database of European Streams, FIDES, which shows the record of what each country catches in the various quotas throughout the year.  If we had access to those data in real time, we could see the fishing patterns of the different countries and we might be able to arrange swaps better with the countries that have more quota that they could not use or carry forward to the next year.  We could talk to them about that and see if we could get more of that fish under the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy.  One of the pillars of the Common Fisheries Policy is that there are coastal communities that depend on the industry.  This is our resource, as Deputy Mac Lochlainn pointed out.<\/p><p> Of the pie we get to take from, we have 15%.  I keep putting forward this analogy.  Can the committee imagine if we started at zero and the European fleet went to the shores of Africa and came back to Europe and the fleet said it had 85% of the fishing rights and that all the African people were left with was 15% because now they can sell the fish in the European market?  There would be a human cry heard across the globe, but it seems to be okay for the Irish people.  It is these simple facts that our Taoiseach should take to Ursula von der Leyen and the rest.  He should point them out to them and use the examples that are there.<\/p><p> As for the Irish Sea herring, the clue is in the name: the Irish Sea.  We are left with 1% of that fishery and the UK has 99%.  If any European can stand over the argument that the latter is right and just, they should sit before me and tell it to my face because I do not agree with them at all.  I keep saying this: we are told we have to lose on a third decommissioning scheme one third of our fleet.  The figures in my presentation were designed and drafted not by me but by scientists within the Marine Institute.  I am only copying their work so I am taking that what they have done is correct.  We had hundreds of boats in our fleet not so long ago, in 2006, not even halfway through the Common Fisheries Policy, and we are going to be told that if they are successful with this decommissioning scheme, we will be down to a third.  That is a third, a third and a third from 2006.  I ask the committee to look at the figures.  When we go to our Taoiseach and speak to our Minister tomorrow, the committee should tell him it has looked at the figures.  The &euro;39 million set out in the task force report that will come back into the fisheries will not make up the shortfall.  What will we do?  Do we go back to Europe again and look for a fourth decommissioning scheme?  We cannot make fish appear from nowhere.  The fish are there; we need the quota.  It is all about quota to be able to keep our coastal communities going.  We have the skill set.  We brought the boats to Dublin peacefully.  We did so because we just wanted to show the Irish people the condition of the modern fleet we have built up and the families who have worked and risked their lives going out in weather such as has been seen in recent days to earn a living to pay for these boats.  The committee has seen the pictures I have sent of two of our members who have spent hundreds of thousands in recent years on boats that are over 30 years of age to keep them compliant with the code of practice so the men can go out and catch fish and compete with the foreign fleets visiting our shores.  We are being told to get rid of one in every three.  That is stark.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120800002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Mac Lochlainn for his contribution.  I find it difficult to disagree with anything he said.  Ours was one of the producer organisations, POs, which stated that it supported the decommissioning scheme.  We supported the scheme on the basis that we had members within our organisation who have become so disillusioned with what is happening and our fishing industry that they have lost all confidence and they think it is time to get out of it.  The analysis that was done at the task force was provided by BIM, which drew up the proposals as to how many vessels needed to be taken out of the fleet.  The figures that were produced to us came from both the Department and BIM.  We did not put forward the figures for what should be paid for GT.  We have no argument that it should be much more than what was agreed at the task force, but it was made very clear to us by the officials from the Department that if we were to go out looking for crazy figures for GT, we would not get a decommissioning scheme.  It would not be approved on the levels that were being proposed by the industry.  We were between a rock and a hard place and we settled.  There are lots of rules that are there that we do not necessarily agree with, as was articulated by my colleague, Mr. Lynch, in particular the idea that if the owner of a vessel is taking money for the tie-up scheme in 2021 and if he takes decommissioning in 2022, he has to pay it back.  This is an EU rule as part of another EU scheme, but there is nothing in the TCA compensation fund that says that this rule should apply for decommissioning.  However, our Department is insisting that it should be the rule.  I will confirm that we in the POs always work much more closely with our colleagues in the other POs than many people feel is the case.  As Mr. Ward said, we respect our individual positions on various issues but we do our damnedest to do the best we can for our members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120800002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Ward"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I will address Deputy Mac Lochlainn's questions.  The easiest one is the one about unity.  I think there is considerable unity with the POs and the other organisations that are not here today.  This has been built with 20 others in the field.  I can understand Deputy Mac Lochlainn's comments about raising the white flag, but I can tell him that there is absolutely no way we, as a PO, will accept that this is raising the white flag.  He rightly asked what needs to be done at the forthcoming council.  The task force is not just about decommissioning; there are 16 other schemes there.  The number one priority that was identified by the task force was burden sharing.  There are 13 different recommendations from the task force that deal with burden sharing.<\/p><p>The reason this is so important is because Ireland has been disproportionately hit by Brexit.  It is not just the analysis that we have done exhaustively on this.  I am glad to tell the committee that the Commission&rsquo;s scientific body, referred to by Mr. Murphy in terms of fleets, the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, produced a report about six weeks ago that confirmed the figures we have been preaching from the rooftops about since it happened on Christmas Eve which is, when one considers the real quota uptake, the effect on Ireland is that we are taking a 40% hit.  All the others are taking 60%.  There is an opportunity at the Council to start the internal process on burden sharing.  There is also the external process at the coastal states and next year is an important year for that.<\/p><p> The third element of this is the CFP review.  I wish to put on the record that everybody on this call was fully behind the burden sharing.  The easiest thing of all for the Ministers, the Government and the Department to do is to kick the can down the road and say that it will be part of the CFP.  There is absolutely no way that we will accept that.  The burden sharing has to be addressed here and now and over the transition period of the Brexit adjustment reserve fund, BAR.  We have been told there have been other Councils that it has come up in.  Starting in December, there will be an opportunity to start doing something that could affect 2022.  We need to put a huge effort into the CFP review but, with the best will in the world, one is talking about two years hence.  We are not prepared to wait for that.<\/p><p>It is fair to say that all the organisations, very reluctantly, came to the table on decommissioning.  I know the figures do not stack up here but, as far as I am concerned, if there is to be a voluntary decommissioning scheme, which the task force recommended and we were all party to that, the minimum payment has to be 12,000 tonnes.  What if the figure does not add up?  The task force figure is &euro;423 million.  Ireland has received more than &euro;1 billion so I see no problem in getting additional funds if need be.  One issue a number of people have mentioned is that it is not right that some people who get temporary cessation money could be taken off decommissioning money.  I know Mr. Ward mentioned it.  That is part of the Commission&rsquo;s guidelines.  I checked the BAR regulations that were recently published, and it does not actually require that.  The regulations specifically state that it should not have to be repaid.  That has to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120800002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I welcome the guests.  A lot has been said but, at the end of the day, Ireland has been hardest hit by the quota transfers to the UK and contributes approximately &euro;43 million of the total estimated &euro;199 million.  That amounts to a 15% reduction compared with the overall value of the 2020 Irish quotas, and is proportionally more than the other EU member states.<\/p> <p>  The task force was established to address the implications arising from the EU-UK trade deal but under decommissioning alone, we will lose one third of the fleet again.  At what stage will it stop before we have nothing at all or no fleet left?  In recent days, we have seen what these fleets and fishermen have to go through to make a living.  I do not think anyone of us would like to see their livelihoods taken away when they have to go out in those conditions.  With a review of the Common Fisheries Policy planned for next year, I imagine the industry wants the Government to fight and stand up for it.  That is the least people expect and deserve when it comes to going to Europe and fighting for a better deal for our fishing fleet.<\/p> <p>  The term &ldquo;burden sharing&rdquo;, which has come up in the meeting, indicates that by having arrived at this point the industry has been significantly let down.  As Mr. Ward said, the fleet is disillusioned, and one could not blame them when one hears what is going on.  This is especially the case, and must be taken into account, in the context of what the Killybegs Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation said in its opening statement about the disproportionate cost to Ireland in the transfer of quotas to the UK under the TCA, which it noted is 40% of the entire cost of the EU quota transfers when one considers the catches.  Will the witnesses tell us how they are pursuing this and what advice they have for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and, indeed, the whole-of-government approach that was referred to?  Have there been encouraging signs from member states that matter in this regard?<\/p> <p>  I refer to the Irish Fish Producers Organisation.  I said earlier that this is a deeply uncomfortable matter to be talking about.  What is essentially under discussion today is how we can mitigate the impacts of the fish quota share reductions, which in my view is deeply unjust and is a blot on the EU&rsquo;s attitude towards the Irish fishing fleet.  There is a big question to be asked of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in how we have arrived at this situation in which drastic measures such as these are even being asked of the sector.  I hope a hard stance will be taken by the Department in the review of the Common Fisheries Policy.<\/p> <p>  I wish to stay on the issue of decommissioning for now.  In what has been said in relation to decommissioning and looking forward to future generations, Mr. Ward said that he would like to see the Department bank some of the fishing capacity that would be given up.  He also said that the Department is not interested in this proposal, which I find hard to swallow.  Will he tell the committee of the mechanics of that proposal and what communication he had with the Department on the matter?  Will he say a few words on the outlook of fishing for future generations and younger people coming into the industry, who were referred to earlier?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120800002#H00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I will go back to the chief executives.

Obviously, other member states have to come on board but there are ways and means of doing that.  It cannot wait for the CFP review because, with the best will in the world, that is kicking the can down the road and not addressing what has happened, and should not have happened, in that Ireland has taken a disproportionate hit with costs.  We produced the figures that have now been verified by the Commission&rsquo;s technical and scientific body.  This is not just coming from us.  There is now a document published on it.<\/p> <p>  On decommissioning, I have already said that, reluctantly, everybody came to the table on this.  There are people out there who are, as Mr. Ward rightly put it, totally disillusioned.<\/p><p>People will need some avenue to be able to get out of the industry without ending up in bankruptcy.  This is why we all came to the table, reluctantly, on the decommissioning.  The levels have to be right.  A question was asked about a tonnage bank.  With regard to off-register tonnage, there needs to be provision for people who want to renew their boats, whether they be second hand or new.  Off-register tonnage is one way of looking at this.  Perhaps rather than decommissioning all of it, which is what the Department is planning to do, a certain portion should be kept.  If we get our burden sharing, and as far as I am concerned it is not if but when we will get burden sharing, and there is a further review of the CFP we will need to be able to modernise our vessels.  We will need to have a certain amount of tonnage banked to do this.  This was discussed by the task force but no concrete proposals was put forward other than recognition by everybody that all of the off-register tonnage could not be decommissioned and then have nothing to allow for new vessels or modernisation of vessels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120800002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Browne.  With regard to leaving the door open for young people to come back into the fishing industry, it will be impossible for people to come into the industry for the first time unless they have a lot more than the bank of mum and dad behind them to allow them to buy their way into it.  We were not the only people who put forward a tonnage bank at the task force.  As far as I remember, the idea was first mooted by the fishing co-operatives in Ireland.  We were told EU funding and the trade and co-operation agreement scheme could not be used for it, and that the demands on the national Exchequer were such that the Department felt it would never be able to bring such a scheme forward.

He is speaking about the future of our industry and this is what we are here to discuss.  My colleagues have pointed out we are united on many of the points being raised today.  Mr. O'Donoghue is correct that the producer organisations accepted the reality that there would be some sort of decommissioning scheme.  The Irish South and West Fish Producer's Organisation did not sign up to the terms and conditions, which were presented to us less than 24 hours before we were to decide whether or not we agreed.  My directors were online and said the south and west producers would not sign up to them and I was glad they did not do so.  They are totally inadequate as we have seen and as we have pointed out here today.<\/p> <p> I agree with what Mr. O'Donoghue has said.  Here is the agreement that everyone is looking for.  The trade and co-operation agreement Brexit adjustment reserve fund was brought to Ireland because it was recognised in Europe, for the first time in the history of the European Union, that Ireland is the most disproportionately affected of all countries.  How do we know this?  The proof is in front of us.  We got one fifth of the entire Brexit adjustment reserve fund.  One of the smallest countries in Europe got one fifth of it.  Out of &euro;5 billion we got &euro;1.1 billion.  It was also acknowledged that the most disproportionately affected industry, where we will see people losing their jobs and livelihoods, is the fishing industry.  Absolutely we should get the proper funding for people who have fished all their lives, who are in families who have done so for generation after generation and who, unfortunately, as my colleague Mr. Ward has clearly pointed out, are disillusioned.  I would strengthen this word.  I would say they have given up all hope.  Morale is on the floor.  This is why we took the boats to Dublin and Cork.  Our fishers have given up.  Imagine an entire industry on its knees not just from this but because of Covid, bad weather and regulations.  They are being put in an impossible situation.  The figures state they cannot survive.  The only way for some was to take decommissioning.<\/p> <p>  To add insult to injury, we are forcing people out of the industry and devaluing their assets.  It makes no sense for us to allow this to happen.  This is why we hope the committee will speak on our behalf to the Minister and the Taoiseach.  This is where it needs to go, as was pointed out by my colleagues.  The biggest powerhouses in Europe have no problem standing up for fishers.  We have seen President Macron stand up.  The French people are willing to turn off the power to the English people.  They are willing to cut off food supplies to the English people to get across their point.  We need the same level of determination from the people who represent us at the highest level in Europe, as Mr. O'Donoghue has said.  We are not waiting two years.  We want this now.  We want our country to go to Europe and tell people these are the facts, that they agree with the facts and ask them to do something about it.  We need parity in our industry throughout Europe.  We united at the start to get this parity.  Now we have been cut adrift.  This has to be addressed by our Taoiseach, our Minister and our Minister for Foreign Affairs.  If it is not then we are wasting our time.  We will keep saying the same thing to the committee but we need it to carry this message for us.  I thank the committee and I thank Deputy Brown for highlighting the fact it will be virtually impossible for young people to come into the industry because there will not be an industry there for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120800002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Browne for his questions and comments.  I will begin with burden sharing, which was covered very well by Mr. O'Donoghue.  We absolutely need the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government as a whole to push to have this burden sharing in Europe.  There is a 40% loss to Ireland in the trade and co-operation agreement.  This needs to be readjusted to a proper share.  We respect that every processor state would lose something but out of eight states Ireland should not have taken 40% of the burden.<\/p> <p>  Another way we are disadvantaged because of Brexit is the Hague preferences.  This is complicated.  We have to apply for Hague preferences every year.  When some of the quotas are reduced Ireland gets a small percentage of an increase from other states because the fishing territory lies around the coast of Ireland.  Unfortunately, most of the Hague preferences we received came from the UK.  With the UK no longer a member of the European Union the Hague preferences are not as advantageous to Ireland as they were in the past.  Some compensation for our small share was achieved through the Hague preferences but since the UK left this is no longer the case as we used to get most of the preference from it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to decommissioning, as I said earlier to Deputy Mac Lochlainn, the decommissioning scheme being brought in is voluntary.  We believe the premium being paid per tonne should be the full &euro;12,000.<\/p><p>We do not agree with the discounts, particularly the discount on the age at investment.  We do not and cannot agree with that.<\/p><p> The off-register tonnage is an absolute requirement and the fleet must have off-register tonnage to survive.  Some of the other POs at the task force, which we supported, looked for a tonnage bank paid for by the State.  John Ward has already noted that European funds cannot be used to store tonnage, so if we were to have a national tonnage bank, it would have to be from the national Exchequer.  We believe this would be worthwhile and that we could use it again in the future, when we get burden sharing and get a fairer share of quotas.<\/p><p> Off-register tonnage is needed for the future development of the fleet.  Any time a vessel is changed or even if an engine is changed inside a vessel, kilowatts and tonnage are altered so, up and down, we need tonnage and we need off-register capacity to allow for this.  We also need it for the building of new vessels.  When new vessels are being built at the moment, for a similar type of vessel the tonnage is way higher because of the new regulations in shipbuilding.  Given the rules being applied for safety reasons by the Marine Survey Office in the Department of Transport as regards the building of fishing vessels, the vessel requires a lot more tonnage for the same lame length of vessel when compared to the previous position.  For that reason, we need off-register tonnage.<\/p><p> I will leave it at that because all of the items have been well covered by the other speakers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120800002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I welcome the four CEOs.  To be fair to the four of them, they are all on the one hymn sheet, which is very important.  I know it is four organisations but it is good to see they all have the one agenda.<\/p> <p>  I want to make a few points.  Mr. Murphy spoke about fishermen and the dangers and difficulty of the job.  I come from north Mayo and there are a lot of fishing people there.  It is a very difficult life, a hard life, and any money they earn is earned very hard.  I have to say they did not get protection from previous Governments in respect of their quotas, particularly given what they do for our food stock in the world.  They have never got that respect.  Brexit has created a big problem.  When I was in Cabinet, this was one of the issues that was left until last because those involved knew that the whole fishing industry was going to be a difficult issue in light of the situation with fishing quotas, decommissioning and everything else.<\/p> <p>  The task force was set up to assist fishermen and to help to identify the problems.  When a task force is set up, it is set up because there is already a problem.  There is already a problem with the industry, there is already a problem with jobs being lost and there is already a problem with people leaving the industry.<\/p> <p>  There are two things that worry me in regard to fishing and agriculture.  We have people who do not want the production of cattle in this country and they do not want to produce food.  We have people who do not want fishermen to fish.  Then, we have a problem where boats are going to be coming in from all over Europe.  Do we have the protection we need from the Government and from whatever services are there in order to protect the fishing rights we have?<\/p> <p>  Deputy Mac Lochlainn was correct that this has been talked about for a long time.  This industry has gone through a very difficult time and it was sacrificed for other industries in the past.  The time has come to take care of this industry and the few people we have left in it, as I know from my county.  It is a very difficult situation.  Like any family business or for anyone involved in any industry, they would love to see some of their family members continuing on in it and being able to make a living in it.  That is not happening because sons and daughters of the people who are in this industry see how hard their parents have worked, see how difficult this life is and see the way those involved have been treated by Europe and the Government.<\/p> <p>  The time has come.  I will be supporting the Minister but I will be pointing out to him that we need to be very strong.  If you do not ask, you are not going to get.  The Minister has to make sure that he gets out there and puts the pressure on Europe this time.  He needs to say that this industry is on its knees and it needs its quota.<\/p> <p>  I do not like talking about decommissioning, which is like redundancy when jobs are lost.  The witnesses are correct and the four of them have been very honest.  It is a scheme that has been put there to help people who no longer want to be in the industry because they cannot make a living out of it.  Just as when someone is taken out of any job, we have to give them a decent payment if they are being decommissioned or taken out of work.  They should not be fighting over a few thousand euro in respect of tonnage and they should be given it gladly.  If Europe wants to get rid of quota and wants to get rid of fishermen, it should be paying them.<\/p> <p>  What I will be saying to the Minister tomorrow is that we have to be strong in these talks.  This is the first time we have had Brexit as a background to the negotiations.  I hope the rest of Europe will be generous to the Irish fishermen because the Irish fishermen were generous to the rest of Europe in the past.  I want to offer the four POs my support and I hope the Minister and the Government do the same.  The witnesses are right.  This is not just about the Taoiseach, the Minister with responsibility for the marine or the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Government as a whole has to be out there this time, fighting in Europe for our industry, which is on its knees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120800002#K00200","speaker":"1500"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Thank you.

My view is that decommissioning is a last resort but, unfortunately, in some instances we have to go down that road.  I live in a place called Schull, which is quite close to where Deputy Michael Collins is from.  I am probably the oldest around here.  I remember a day when there were probably ten trawlers fishing out of Schull and there is now one small one left there.  Coastal communities, whether in the Beara Peninsula or, as Patrick Murphy said, at places like Union Hall and Baltimore, have seen the signs.  Decommissioning, in one sense, might be an easy buck for some people who want to get out of it but the damage to the coastal communities is very real and substantial.  The compensation package I have looked at and studied, in simple terms, is not adequate and is not enough.  It is the end of an era for families and for communities, and I believe that should be seriously looked at.<\/p> <p>  The area of quotas under the Common Fisheries Policy, going back historically to 1973, has been an issue.  I was elected a councillor in Cork in 1985 and I worked with others to set up a coastal management committee.  Se&aacute;n O'Donoghue and myself go back a long way.  What I am hearing today from the POs is something similar, except it is more sophisticated now.  Unfortunately, the fishing industry has contracted.  I hate to see more damage done to the fishing communities around the country.  I must put my hand up on some of the representations I made.  I always spoke up for fishermen but we did not have the success that I would like to have seen over the years.  We are now at a crisis point and, unfortunately, unless we put up a brave fight in Europe, whether it be the Taoiseach or the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as somebody said, we are showing the white flag or, to use another term or train of thought, we are throwing in the towel.<\/p><p>That is what I wanted to say.  I have listened to many POs.  I heard most of it before I had to run for the vote.  I do not want to delay the meeting further.  It was informative and I have no doubt that the POs will lobby together on this issue.  I do not doubt that and I wish them success.

It is greatly received that they understand what is here.  To try to be helpful, I will explain our viewpoint and I hope my colleagues would agree with me on this.  Brexit was an extraordinary event.  Nobody believed that it was going to happen.  Even when it did happen, people believed that there was going to be another referendum and that they would overturn it.  The rule book, as far as we saw it, had to be redesigned.  The previous rules that had been set out for a decommissioning scheme were set up for a completely different purpose.  It is no longer relevant to us.  That is what need to bring to our Minister.<\/p> <p>  To assure the committee, we raised this with the EU Commissioner when he visited Killybegs.  He agreed with us.  He said that the Brexit adjustment reserve, BAR, funding was there to be flexible.  Therefore, as my colleague, Mr. Ward, pointed out, we felt that we were getting miscommunication and confusing messages whereby on the one hand, we were told that this is the way that it has to be written.  We kept pointing out that Brexit is an extraordinary event.  It is accepted that it is an extraordinary event.  It is accepted that we suffered the greatest burden.  Surely, on the basis of that, even if we do all totally and utterly hate the idea of decommissioning, we are not going to envisage even more pain for these families.  They might have entered the industry, as I said, in the last number of years, paying &euro;15,000 per gross tonnage.  There is going to be a shortfall there.  I know that my colleagues are saying that the ones that want to go out might have their boats bought and paid for.  They just want to leave the industry.  They are just distraught by it.  We understand the complications of that.  We have to take cognisance of the way the scheme and the terms and conditions - which we disagreed with - are set out.  They are not appropriate.  They do not address the issue or the crisis that we are in at the moment.  There is not enough money there.  It is not high enough.  We are not asking for people to make millionaires out of themselves.  We just want their debts covered and for them to leave with some dignity.  I point out to the committee that a fisherman came up the stairs to my office.  He had been in the job for 30 years.  His father had been a fisherman for 50 years.  They told me that if they left the industry, and if they had &euro;70,000 each leaving the industry after that amount of time, they would be happy.  This is the stark reality that we are at.  They will not get that.  They will be in debt with the figures that are presented to them.  Even if this happens to only one fisherman, it is a wrong.<\/p> <p>  We have to tell our Minister that this is an extraordinary event.  Europe agrees with us.  The Commissioner agrees with us.  We need to rewrite the rule book.  We saw during our time in the task force that the French got much further leeway in their actions under the Brexit adjustment reserve than we were told we were allowed.  This is a reality.  For us, it is a necessary evil, as Mr. Ward pointed out.  Please do not make it worse for our people who have given their lives to this industry.  At the end of it, they are disillusioned.  Then they will get a second kicking, but not from Europe.  If Ireland does this, it will be us doing it to our own people.  We have to make sure that they are properly compensated for the lives that they have given to this industry.

I will briefly make some points as we are coming to the end of the meeting.  I want to highlight two or three key points.  I know we have dispersed but it is worth reiterating them again.  I cannot overemphasise that the burden sharing should be addressed at the forthcoming December Council.  It should also be addressed by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.  We cannot be fobbed off by saying &ldquo;Ah, we will wait for the Common Fisheries Policy review&rdquo;.  That is not an adequate answer.  We need to do that.<br\/><br\/>I fully agree with Mr. Murphy on decommissioning.  As far as I am concerned, the modalities and the criteria of the decommissioning have not been decided yet.  This was addressed by all the organisations here today.  We need to make sure that when the final scheme comes out and gets state aid approval, that it has addressed issues.  There is nothing under the BAR funding regulation that I can see that stops that from being done.<br\/><br\/>We have not mentioned one other thing about the BAR funding.  Mr. Murphy is quite right that when Commissioner Sinkeviius was in Killybegs, he indicated to us that there would be maximum flexibility on the BAR funding.  One of the areas, which would obviously make direct sense because we are only talking about a three-year period, is that there is direct losses compensation for the fish loss.  This is being pursued by a number of member states.  As I understand it, the Commission is amenable to looking at that.  The task force made recommendations of &euro;423 million.  As far as I am concerned, if that figure ends up to be &euro;600 million, then so be it, because we are the ones who were affected under the scheme.<br\/><br\/>The final thing I want to say is that because we are facing into this Council, which has lost its clout because of the EU-UK bilateral agreement I am concerned that when we come to the midnight time again - as always happens with these Councils - it will be a <i>fait accompli. <\/i>I just will take one stock as an example, which is haddock in the north west.  Scientists tell us that this is in a healthy state.  We are expecting a 125% increase.  Because of these bilateral negotiations, as I see it, we will end up with just a 5%.  I am concerned that the whole role that the Council had on setting tax and quotas for the following year is no longer what it is.  We have no influence whatsoever in relation to this.

Since the beginning of last year, the economy has had to deal with the impact of both the Covid-19 pandemic and the departure of the UK from the EU.  Following the restrictions that were put in place to protect our public health, businesses have seen huge shifts in trading patterns, as well as difficulties in supply chains and increases in the cost of energy and materials.  In addition, we have seen huge disruption in the labour force which has caused the displacement of labour in many sectors and a lack of availability of skills in other sectors.  The issue has been raised in a range of the committee's discussions in the past year, particularly in recent months.

In developing its work programme, the EGFSN always seeks to align with and support the delivery of key national policy objectives.  In its recent work, the group has examined some of the major themes of the economic recovery plan, for example, the structural shifts created by digital transformation and the decarbonisation of Ireland&rsquo;s economy; the need to enhance the performance of Ireland&rsquo;s SME sector; the creation of an innovative knowledge economy; the expansion and diversification of Ireland&rsquo;s international trade post Brexit; and the need to address Ireland&rsquo;s housing and infrastructural requirements.  As detailed in the background briefing document provided to committee members, a range of skills has been identified by the EGFSN as key to delivering on these objectives.<\/p> <p>  To enable and effectively exploit the spread of digital transformation across all sectors of the economy digital literacy and skills need to be a core workforce competency.  They are also needed to support broader social inclusion.  Older workers in particular will need to be assisted in acquiring these skill sets.  Further enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s pool of high-level ICT talent will also be central to driving digital transformation.  This includes the skills involved in designing, building, implementing and maintaining the integrity of high-level ICT systems.  Measures to enhance the pipeline of students from second level, in particular female students, are needed to secure a greater domestic supply of these skills, which are currently complemented by a pool of international talent.<\/p> <p>  To address Ireland&rsquo;s climate action targets, there will also have to be an increase in technical decarbonisation skills as well as broader environmental knowledge across the enterprise base.  In its most recent report, the EGFSN has forecast a significant increase in demand for skills across wind and solar energy generation as well as residential retrofits.  Employment will have to triple in wind and solar power projects and quadruple in residential retrofits.  This will create demand across engineering, environmental science and legal-professional roles, as well as in construction, retrofits and electric vehicle maintenance.<\/p> <p>  Our climate action commitments will in turn create further demand for skills across built environment activities in order to deliver on our infrastructural and new housing requirements.  To meet the Housing for All targets, by 2025 the workforce involved in new builds will have to increase by 70% over 2020 levels and double by 2028.  This level of demand emphasises the need for the construction sector in particular to address issues around its attractiveness to new entrants and the acute gender imbalance in its workforce.<\/p> <p>  The expansion and diversification of Ireland&rsquo;s international trade, at least from a goods trade perspective, will heighten the demand for logistics and supply chain management skills.  These are needed to ensure the orderly and competitive distribution of trade between Ireland and overseas markets.  Again, however, a poor and unattractive image of the sector, as well as a lack of awareness of its employment opportunities, need to be addressed to meet this demand.<\/p><p>The third pillar of the economic recovery plan, that is, rebuilding sustainable enterprises, addresses the supports and polices needed to make enterprises more resilient, particularly in the SME sector.  Improving productivity is one of the most important issues for SMEs in Ireland.  The EGFSN analysis has demonstrated how management development and the adoption of world-class management practices are key levers for achieving that.  This research has highlighted some of the barriers, but also the opportunities that exist for Irish SMEs to improve their performance through greater investment in targeted, high-quality management training and development. <\/p><p> The economic recovery plan also highlights how disruptive macro trends, including accelerations in automation and digitalisation, are redefining business models.  In 2017, the EGFSN acknowledged that design thinking is critical in dealing with disruption, adding strategic value, creativity and innovation from the earliest stages of development through to the final delivery of products and services.  Since then, the group has developed, and is helping to implement, key recommendations on digital, product and strategic design.  Meanwhile, the ability of Irish enterprise, and Ireland more generally, to operate and advance its interests in an increasingly globalised world, rests on the languages agenda and the greater cultural awareness skills that accompany it.  The importance of enhancing Ireland's pool of language skills from a comparatively low base, as identified by the EGFSN, directly resulted in the development of Ireland's ten-year strategy for foreign languages, Languages Connect.<\/p><p> Apart from these key skills areas, there will also be a need for a range of transversal or so-called softer skills to be embedded across the workforce development programmes to support the resilience of workers in the labour market, their readiness for ongoing engagement with lifelong learning pathways and their adaptation to changes in job roles as digital transformation and decarbonisation progress.  These include the capacity for critical thinking and analysis, problem solving, and communications and leadership, which are attributes that are critical in a constantly evolving and increasingly blended working environment where teamwork and communication are key. <\/p><p> I welcome any questions and I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss the important issue of how, from a skills perspective, we can deliver on the economic recovery plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120800002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Donohoe.

I ask him to elaborate on the following.  Have targets been set?  Are they linked specifically to jobs and, if so, to what types of jobs are they linked?  Enhancing a foreign language skills base is a good idea.  I am not disputing that, but if the purpose of that is only to educate people for low-wage jobs in call centres, I would question that somewhat.  Is it a value added thing?  What is going on there?  Have targets been set and specific languages identified and are they linked to particular jobs or growth areas?

I will make some general comments before inviting in my colleague, Dr. Power, who represents the group on the languages strategy implementation group.  Generally, there are targets.  There are targets in terms of leaving certificate attainment and the number of graduates coming out of higher education.  In regard to the question around value added, when it comes to languages it is often a case of we do not know what we do not know.  They are critical for our industrial strategy.  In a Brexit context, most of our SME indigenous companies tend, or have tended, to be reliant on the UK in particular and English speaking markets.  Owing to the trade diversification challenges, we will have to go out and look for much broader languages.  Companies might purchase in their own language, but they sell in their customers' language.  This is a key competitive advantage.  It is sometimes difficult to quantify.  We know that in call centres and, to an extent, in foreign direct investment, FDI, languages are in demand.  Often, FDI companies tend to use their own global networks to recruit language specialists and native speakers.<\/p> <p>  In terms of our industrial strategy, it is a question of diversification of markets.  We do have some graduate programmes.  IBEC has a global graduates programme, as does Enterprise Ireland, where young graduates with language skills go out and develop new markets.  Dr. Power may have more to say in terms of direction or targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120800002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Mr. Donohoe has pre-empted much of what I was going to say in terms of the key graduate programmes out there, in particular the IBEC programme.  Enterprise Ireland has the GradStart programme, under which it provides 70% subsidisation for the hiring of a person with language skills to put into firms so that Ireland can focus directly on internationalisation.  When Languages Connect was being developed, Enterprise Ireland informed the target languages that would best serve Ireland's trade interests.  There are a range of languages, including the traditional modern languages in a European sense such as Portuguese and, also, Korean, Japanese, Mandarin, Arabic and so on.<\/p> <p>  It is particularly important for the indigenous firms that are more regionally dispersed and more focused on the UK market to expand their horizons.  That is very much in tandem with the eurozone strategy that Enterprise Ireland is trying to promote at the moment.  In terms of those firms in the Irish economy that are more globally focused, they would tend to be in the foreign direct investment sector.  They need levels of language competency that are very much of native level proficiency and so they tend to import that level of proficiency indirectly.  The last survey that was done in Ireland in early 2010 showed that only 20% of the Irish population are comfortable speaking another language other than English.  It is with a view to expanding that pool.<\/p> <p>  I am sure Mr. Donohoe will agree that many firms do not know what they do not know, especially in the SME sector.  Enterprise Ireland is actively trying to promote the adoption of languages as a key skills set.  In certain surveys that we are conducting at the moment, it is coming up as a key issue as these firms are trying to expand further into the eurozone market and into markets further afield.  It is the old adage as well that one can have a first meeting in English in overseas markets, but one will not necessarily get a second.  One needs to show that respect and to have the cultural awareness and recognition of those nuances, which one only really gets through having somebody who has the requisite kind of languages in the firm.<\/p><p>There is a lot of promotional work ongoing at present, but we are dealing with a significant cultural issue.  Traditionally, in terms of our emigration outlets, it has always been to the English speaking world.  We are expanding more in the context of the destinations people go to now.  It will be a slow burner, but work is actively going on at present to try to expand the enterprise base.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120800002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alan Power","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>Mr. Donohoe referred to Brexit.

We are seeing the statistics in terms of slower exports to the UK in particular.  From a skills perspective, we have a logistics and transport supply chain group.  One of the most remarkable development over the past two years of the pandemic is how robust our supply chains have been, particularly to supermarkets.  Apart from early blips, when people decided they needed to buy pasta and toilet rolls, we have managed to keep supermarkets very well stocked.  That is a testimony to existing supply chains.  This is not about trade voids as such, but it is the challenges around skills.  Something that has been well publicised in the UK and that we identified in recent years is shortages of heavy goods vehicle, HGV, drivers.  It is an ageing occupation and it is difficult to attract younger people into it.  More generally, we have classified 14 different occupations in logistics and supply chains.  There is a big job of work to be done to make this sector more attractive and to develop awareness from an earlier age.  That is the challenge.  It is not only going out and finding new markets; it is also ensuring our inward supply chains are functioning efficiently.  Dr. Power might want to add something to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>The most topical issue is probably the shortage of HGV drivers.  That has been impacted.  This is an issue the EGFSN identified as far back as 2015.  It has been impacted by Brexit and the recurrence of growth in eastern Europe, with many of the drivers who would have fulfilled those roles have gone back home, as well as the Covid pandemic.  The key thing is that we always differentiate between a skills shortage and a labour market shortage.  It is not necessarily a shortage of people with the skills necessary to do it.  Essentially there are not enough people who want to fulfil these roles.  Prevention is vitally important but at the same time it is a tough sell and that feeds into some of the negative stereotypes that exist around transport occupations.<\/p> <p>  A lot of work needs to be done to professionalise the sector.  That is one of the key ambitions of the logistics and supply chain skills group, which is chaired by the Department of Transport and includes industry representation.  There have been a number of skills initiatives taken to expand the pool.  There has been the traineeship for HGVs which has been delivered by the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, and, importantly, a new commercial drivers apprenticeship programme will come on stream that has been co-ordinated by Freight Transport Association Ireland.  They are about the longer term in trying to change perceptions around that role.  As it stands, we will be reliant on migration to fill that skills gap.

Wages are a big issue in that sector.  It is not necessarily that the employment is unattractive.  At various stages in the recent past it was a very attractive role.  People say the money would not pay them.  Lowering the bar and widening the pool and changing the rules around what licences are acceptable is a sticking plaster.  If we have a long-term problem, we need to ensure those workers are paid decent wages.  Nothing else will attract and retain workers beyond that.  We can fix everything else but if that is not dealt with, we will have an issue.

An area where we have other challenges is getting people to build these houses.  We are looking at 33,000 housing units in the Housing for All strategy.  We currently have approximately 40,000 workers on new builds.  We need an additional 25,000 units in the next five years and that will peak at 80,000 by the end of the strategy.  Apart from its overall impact on the economy, on the Deputy's previous point around wages, it feeds into higher wages ultimately and thereby a serious competitiveness issue.  There is the other issue of finding workers to build this stock and this will be exacerbated by our very necessary climate action plan.

It was published in 2020.  It is relatively early days to see how many SMEs are engaging.  There is a multitude of programmes, which is part of the challenge.  There is an issue with motivation because SMEs do not necessarily have the time or resources to engage with training.  They also might not see the point of training.  Those of us who are involved in skills or education see upskilling as a necessary good.  SMEs are preoccupied with meeting the challenges facing companies and looking for opportunities to develop.  Their customers and staff are their primary concerns.  There is a challenge with inserting upskilling into their considerations.  Multinationals tend to understand this and have fairly sophisticated strategies in place.  It is a matter of getting busy owner-managers in particular to engage with this.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Senator's question, we have an SME skills task force, which is chaired by the representative groups.  It is addressing the matter of awareness.  The first tangible work from it is an online benchmarking tool.  Skillnet has been working on it.  An SME can benchmark and get a basic training or skills need analysis for the business and link it to business strategies.  This is the first step on that journey.  Later, it can be linked to the appropriate training interventions.  This is a cultural shift as much as anything else.  The education and training sector has not helped itself with the language that it uses about upskilling, learning outcomes, and other technical language.

There is much rhetoric around them but defining them and making them a reality is more of a challenge.  As the Senator suggests, this goes back to the education system.  All education and training are part of a continuum.  The competences that employers are looking for are developed in the education system.  As the Senator said, the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science was looking at leaving certificate reform last week.  We provided evidence at it.  We think that an over-reliance on a terminal examination, which is the leaving certificate, does not give the space or motivation to develop these soft skills, including creativity, analytical thinking, empathy, communication, teamwork and so on.  The most important one of all is learning to learn and developing an appetite for learning.  If a school experience is dictated by a high-stakes terminal examination, it is more likely to extinguish that appetite for learning.<\/p> <p>  Why do employers and businesses more generally look for this?  We are in a world of ongoing upskilling.  This, and reskilling, will be a fact of life in the workplace.  That appetite and spirit of inquiry is developed at a leaving certificate level.  We do have surveys.  The most recent was published in 2019 by the Higher Education Authority and SOLAS.  It was about employers' views of graduates, which are favourable, by and large.  Some 84% of employers were either satisfied or very satisfied with graduate quality, however quality can be defined in the context of education and training.  That survey highlighted the potential absence that the Senator alludes to with regard to employability and softer skills.  Employers also pointed out that 20% had occupations or roles coming up in the next five years that they were not confident that they could fill, which would require much reskilling within their workforces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120800002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation.

How effective are the policy tools now in place to shift the shape of that to provide these new skills?  It seems to me that the people who decide what gets taught are not people like the witnesses who are scanning the horizon for skills.  How do we change that?<\/p> <p>  I think Irish enterprise is hopeless at having skills training in its four walls or sponsoring it.  While Mr. Donohoe says we need a cultural shift, can significant policy changes also be made?  We had 1,300 graduates three years ago and the Minister for higher education is now looking for 10,000.  With regard to traineeships, we are again looking for more.  General upskilling by enterprise is in its own interest.  Surely we can do more than wait for culture to change in this arena.

First, I will speak on supply capture by the education system.  All education systems across the globe are to a degree driven by supply.  They tend to be slow in response, sometimes for legitimate reasons.  In business we tend to be impatient at the seed of change and the flexibility displayed by the education system but the supply capture is inherent.<\/p> <p>  That is being addressed at different levels through Government-supported incentives.  I offer some examples which I think are particularly interesting and good.  There is the technology skills action programme, where numbers are put on the annual outputs of graduates required in high-level areas and what needs to happen under that programme to encourage it.  That includes increasing the female supply, as the Deputy mentioned, particularly at second level, where girls have tended not to go into programmes like computer science.  Incentivisation through programming will encourage schools and, particularly, higher and further education.<\/p> <p>  The human capital initiative funded through the national training fund has some interesting, innovative new programmes.  One which I am familiar with is the introduction of microcredentials.  One way in which the education system has tended not to respond is that education has tended to be available at fixed times of the year, on fixed days of the weeks, for fixed hours in the day and programmes have been of fixed length.  The introduction of flexibility and the acquisition of learning in smaller amounts at a time which suits the learner and the employer is probably urgently required.  Microcredentials are now the commonly accepted way to do that.  Longer courses are divided into bite-sized pieces of learning.  All the Irish universities are part of a project to introduce microcredentials.  I think that is an exciting development but there are others.  There are skills conversion programmes, Springboard, etc.  These are sometimes on the margins in the context of the numbers of graduates the Deputy referenced, but they are important interventions.  <\/p> <p>  On skills training in the workplace, it is the motivation and making the case, as I mentioned in our SME conversation, for employers to provide the skills.  I do not think we can talk about business in a generic sense here.  It is much more a small, medium-size company issue.  Larger companies with more sophisticated HR strategies tend to do this.  With regard to making this available, members will be aware of and we are a supporter of the Skillnet programme.  It is an example of best in class and something I have spoken to international audiences about.  It is where groups of employers come together, define their skills requirements as a sector, usually, or sometimes in a region, and then source training.  They are co-funded, which means employers have skin in the game and are quite engaged.

There is a new set-up in place with the interdepartmental group on economic migration whereby for the biannual review of the employment permits lists, an interdepartmental group meets, including representatives of various Departments.  Submissions come in via private submission by industry representative organisations or are made by the Department which is the lead for the sector.  They make the case and provide the evidence to say something is urgent and certain measures have to be introduced.  Liberalisation of the list would help enhance that.  To ensure it is firmly and robustly evidence-based and responding to an economic need, it is good that, for instance, the Department of Health will be there for certain construction submissions or the Department of Transport for anything in the logistics field.

I thank our guests for being here and for their presentation.  They have covered so much.  I noticed that recently they had a paper on climate change, much of which had to do with technology, electric cars and so on.  Have they looked at all at the challenges posed by rising sea levels and the kinds of skills we might need in the future to deal with that?  I have here a book by John Englander, <i>Moving to Higher Ground<\/i>.  I am not sure if I can show it.  It is frightening reading in that it shows that in the next 30 or 40 years the seas will rise one or two metres, depending on what happens, no matter what we do.  I put it to the witnesses that we will need a whole new set of skills to deal with that, whether to put up all kinds of sea defences, to move to higher ground or whatever else.  They might comment on that, please, because it is one of those things that is put on the long finger and that people are not talking about, although I know that the Dutch are doing a lot of work on this area.  They would, of course.  They recognise the danger and the challenges.  If the seas rise by a metre in the near future, that will lead to much of cities such as Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Wexford being under water, and there is nothing we can do about it.  No matter what we do now regarding the warming of the earth, the damage is already done and the sea is already rising.  That is what I have read in many publications.<\/p><p>Has the expert group any interaction with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment?  A lot of the debate up to now has been about education.  I agree with Mr. Donohoe when he says we have to start very early on.  Have the witnesses looked at the way in which maths is taught in schools?  Have they any knowledge of a whole new concept being pioneered in Stanford, PolyUp mathematics?  If not, I ask them to have a look at it and come back to me with a reaction at some stage if that is in order.  This whole approach involves critical thinking and analysis, problem solving, innovation, teamwork - all the skills the witnesses have been talking about in their various reports.<\/p><p>I notice that in Finland they have a Committee for the Future in the parliament.  I am not sure if Mr. Donohoe or Dr. Power has come across its work.  It looks ahead 30 or 40 years to see what kind of challenge will face Finland in that time, reports to parliament every year and holds hearings.  It is quite an interesting provision they have in their parliament.  Maybe it is something we should suggest we do in our Parliament as well.  I do not think our committees are doing that at all.<\/p><p>Could the witnesses comment on career guidance and counselling?  I know that Mr. Donohoe is also involved in the Apprenticeship Council and we have spoken about apprenticeships this morning.  Quite a lot of apprentices take up their apprenticeship roles and leave quite early on.  I think up to a fifth, maybe more, of them leave and do not follow through.  I am concerned as to why that is happening.  Is it that they pick the wrong job initially and it is not what they expected it to be?  Are they guided the wrong way at the start?  What is going on?  It seems to be a huge waste of time and energy, especially when we need people in the various apprenticeships.<\/p><p>If somebody from 30 years ago - a number of us were around at that time - were transported to our time, with the language used, they would not know what cloud hosting, consumer relationship, marketing software, web apps or VPN means.

We have picked a good day to talk about rising sea levels.  I cannot claim that I am aware of any work being done on that.  It strikes me that it is something that would feed into general construction skills requirements, planning, the environment, etc.  While I give Dr. Power a few moments to reflect on that, I will take up some of the Deputy's other questions, which I probably know a little more about.<\/p> <p>  Regarding mathematics, in a previous life I represented a business lobby on Project Maths.  I was on the Project Maths steering group and I still bear the scars from that experience.  Reform of the mathematics curriculum was one of the most emotive subjects.  I remember three days of phone-ins to radio shows on it.  That highlighted the challenges surrounding the leaving certificate because this was an attempt to move from a highly predictable paper implementing a very predictable formula to using maths in real-life environments.  They were set up as problems and the emphasis was on problem solving.  The business community was pushing for it.  Eventually, the reforms went through.  I have read some reviews since then that are not completely definitive on the success of the programme.  Many of these questions go back to the fact that no education system can be more effective than its teachers.  The big challenge there was that a cohort of teachers who were used to teaching to the test were now being asked to transform to problem solving etc.  Having said that, in fairness, at the time the mathematics teachers did engage with retraining and reskilling.  That is definitely the direction in which we need to move.  I will definitely have a look at that Stanford programme because maths is critical as an underpinning of a whole broad range of subjects.  It is a basic literacy that we need.<\/p> <p>  As for Finland's Committee for the Future, Finland is always cited in our world as top of the class in skills development and education.  It tends to do education well.  Taking the PISA rankings, Finland consistently comes in the top three in mathematics and literacy and has a long tradition of innovation and planning in this area.  We used to have similar foresight bodies to that committee in Ireland.  It is probably something we should look at again.<\/p> <p>  Career guidance comes up consistently across all the EGFSN reports as something that needs to be addressed.  To respond to the Deputy's question about apprenticeships, the challenge there has been that apprenticeships have been traditionally in those 27 craft areas and, at particular times in the economic cycle when workers, particularly construction workers, could get better paying jobs, they tended to switch out of it.  Since then, the reform of the apprenticeship model has tried to broaden the number of apprenticeships and we have over 60 now.  I think the essential attractiveness of these newer apprenticeships will be their progression opportunities.  It is less likely that people will opt out of them, as the Deputy suggests, but this is taking quite a long time.  So far this year we have about 6,500 apprenticeships.  Only 20% of them are in those new areas.  This is a critical policy challenge - it is an implementation challenge now - to encourage the availability and take-up of these new apprenticeships where there will be these progression opportunities where one can move from a level 5 course right up to doctorate level.  It seems a bit counter-intuitive to think of an apprenticeship at PhD level, but University of Limerick is offering one now.  Principal engineer is a level 10 qualification.  I am not suggesting that everyone wants to attain those levels, but those progression opportunities have to be there if we are to make apprenticeships more attractive.<\/p><p>Perhaps Dr. Power wants to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120800002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":82,"content":"<p>The time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120800002#G00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Dr. Power has breathed a sigh of relief.

There does not appear to be any reference to public transport in the very long report about skills for zero carbon. The only mention of \"bus\" in the report is an approvingly cited case study of how electric car take-up in Norway was enhanced by allowing them to use bus lanes.  It is pushing towards electric car use as opposed to the significant modal shift away from cars and into public transport promised by the climate action plan chapter on transport.  Why is it the case the expert group did not include, for example, the need for more skilled train, tram and bus drivers, support staff, a massive expansion of our public transport network and jobs within public transport as part of green jobs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120800002#G00400","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I will also throw in another issue that may be covered by the next item.  This is the inclusion of what are known as care jobs as green jobs.  These are jobs in childcare, healthcare and education.

I have to confess I have not seen care jobs thus classified but I take his point.  Demographic factors will drive the demand for healthcare employment at a huge rate and childcare to a lesser extent.  Childcare is a much broader labour market issue that has to be addressed.  It is our failure in childcare that has fed into some of our other labour market shortages in encouraging female participation.<br\/><br\/>I will take the issues separately.  Dr. Power mentioned earlier that sometimes these are labour market shortages, sometimes they are skills shortages and sometimes they are a combination of both.  There is a challenge in encouraging people into healthcare <i>per se<\/i>.  A new healthcare apprenticeship is just about to be launched.  It has taken a number of years to get it across the line.  To encourage people into the sector we need to provide formal training opportunities and progression routes.  It goes back to my previous point on why apprenticeships are so important.  Healthcare is a very important example.  People might come in at a particular level but if there are training and progression opportunities we are more likely to encourage people into the sector.  Obviously there are debates about pay but this is not the remit of the expert group.  It is really the skills agenda, which is particularly pertinent in healthcare.  For similar reasons, with regard to the professionalisation of childcare there is the potential to advance child development opportunities.  These are my reflections on these two particular sectors.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy came in on the definition of &quot;green jobs&quot; and what green jobs are out there.  It would be nigh on impossible to produce a report on every potential occupation that would be disrupted or newly created because of low carbon targets.  We have to be relatively specific, as he said.  This was a large report looking at these three areas.  We always try to measure the supply side and the demand side.  We try to put numbers on the demand side.  A particular focus of the EGFSN, for example, is to see that we need X number of ICT specialists, ask how many does the education system produce and try to match up this supply and demand.  If the remit of any one research project is too broad it would lose focus.

We have stepped into an area where on which there is no limit to the discussion that could take place.  Members have touched on different areas this morning.<\/p> <p>  In general, we are talking about a worldwide shift in economic and social patterns and activity.  Globalisation is impacting on the market and we have a demographic in which a bulge is moving through our own population in terms of age, which means Ireland, like many European countries that want to grow their economies, will need inward migration.<\/p> <p>  I have spent a lot of time working in enterprise.  When we look at the economy it is interesting to see the public sector is doing fine because it is underpinned by public sector wages and foreign direct investment, FDI, is doing well because of all the technology and the benefits of working in Ireland and using our skill set.  The SME community is where I see the greatest challenges and they affect all business sectors.  While some sectors are doing better than others, generally speaking, the real economic headwinds I see coming are will affect service businesses and small manufacturers and retailers.<\/p> <p>  The key issues one finds with companies on the ground are those the expert group identified, including education in the broadest sense, literacy and computer literacy.  However, among the elements missing are the ability of small businesses to intersect and network with larger businesses that can teach them so much.  Anyone who gets involved with entrepreneurs will find they have fantastic, forward-looking ideas and an ability to move through the system.  However, they need to leverage expertise, which is generally found at a high level either in Ireland or overseas.<\/p> <p>  The expert group has produced an expansive report highlighting the areas of wind power, electric vehicles, green energy, etc.  What is it doing to give people who may not want to go to college the idea that apprenticeships can provide them with a good quality of life and opportunities throughout their lives?

The earn-and-learn model would be very attractive and would compete with the leaving certificate route if it enjoyed parity of esteem with the leaving certificate.  We have 80,000 people applying for colleges through the CAO system.  There are approximately 55,000 taking the leaving certificate but approximately 80,000 people apply through the CAO every year.  The ambition of the apprenticeship plan is 10,000 per year.  That will give the Deputy a sense of the scale of the challenge here.<\/p> <p>  At the risk of repeating myself, the plan is in place.  It is really a matter of how it is implemented, the speed of take-up and developing new opportunities.  For example, in biopharmaceuticals there are apprenticeships for laboratory technicians and in financial services the Insurance Institute has run a successful apprenticeship to encourage people in.  They are attractive because they have progression opportunities and they are mapped through.  Traditionally, Irish society puts a huge premium on education.  It is part of our DNA.  That is part of the reason the leaving certificate and entrance to higher education is an aspiration at nearly every socioeconomic level.  That is what we are faced with in coming up with an alternative model that is attractive.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Shanahan's question around linkages and international competency, I completely agree with his analysis of where the main challenges are.  They are in the indigenous SME sector.  It has always been thus since the 1970s when the FDI sector started to take off.  It is a recurring challenge.  Perhaps Dr. Power will be able to talk about what Enterprise Ireland is trying to do in that space.  I remember that in the 1980s there was a formal business linkages programme between the IDA and the indigenous sector.  Maybe that is something that should be revisited.  As the Deputy suggests, it is well worth considering.

In terms of the implementation and monitoring, that is now being carried on by F&aacute;ilte Ireland in connection with the industry groups through the forum that is currently active.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120800002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alan Power"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":101,"content":"<p>We can ask that group to outline where they see the future skills gaps and we can consider it as part of our work programmes, along with a long list of others, as I said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120800002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I can certainly appreciate the demands on the finite resources of the secretariat.  However, we have to acknowledge that since 2018, when it finished that phase and it was handed over to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, there has been seismic change in this sector.  Every member of this committee will be aware of the anecdotal information we are getting that a large number of those who were in the hospitality trade simply have not returned after the pandemic and the restrictions.  Particularly among older people, given the isolation of the pandemic, not being able to work and not having that social dimension to their lives, they simply would not go back to hospitality afterwards.  There is a huge crisis in this sector, much more so than in retail.  Retail is challenged but I do not think it faces the same challenges that hospitality faces.  I plead with the witnesses to try to prioritise an updated report on this sector.  In terms of the suite of measures that we need to give the hospitality sector, we need to give them financial supports but we also need to give them the bricks and mortar to rebuild this sector, and this is a key part of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120800002#J00500","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  I have read the report.  I have been engaging with Seamus Hoyne and a number of other people.  My background is in education, including environmental education.  I have worked with the HETAC model and used FETAC over the years, as well as mainstream physics and maths teaching.  Therefore, I understand the system, the layering of it, apprenticeships and the challenges apprentices face.  I also have friends who are guidance counsellors and others who are apprentices.<\/p> <p>  We already have an alternative to the leaving certificate, although it is not really recognised or known about, and that is the HETAC system.  The junior certificate is equivalent to level 4 and the leaving certificate is equivalent to level 7.  This system has been used successfully by students to not do the leaving certificate but instead to go into apprenticeships and attend third level universities.  Therefore, there is an already existing system and I strongly recommend that the witnesses get their heads around that HETAC system.  Seamus Hoyne would be well-placed to tell them about it.<\/p> <p>  George O'Callaghan is the chief executive officer of the Clare and Limerick Education and Training Board.  The education and training boards are located all over Ireland and that is the model they use.  I have used it to develop certification, for example, for a group of Traveller men who were illiterate but who could still write a module on copper work for which they were able to get certificates.  It is a very good model of learning because it has specific learning outcomes as opposed to academic three-hour exams, which we see everybody is moving away from now.<\/p> <p>  The other thing to flag is that apprenticeships are not on the CAO.  If we want to value apprenticeships, we need to start looking at how we do the apprenticeship programme, and I have raised this with the Minister, Deputy Harris.  We have a lot of work to do to get people into apprenticeships and there are some challenges with the fact they start at different times of the year.  As the witnesses rightly said, we value education in this country but, if it is not quite a judgment or snobbery, there is a bit of a thing about saying &ldquo;Oh, my son is in college.&rdquo;  If people do an apprenticeship, they are in college because they study and they do practical stuff, which is the exact same as what people do in college.  We have to look at the language we use around this.  I believe strongly that apprenticeships should start in September-October at the same time that college starts, so that when people are leaving school after leaving certificate or fifth year, they all go off in September-October, whether it is to an apprenticeship, to third level or otherwise.  There is a lot of work to be done around that.<\/p> <p>  The HETAC system is very good.  We need to stop calling it the leaving certificate and call it HETAC level 6.  People can do post-leaving certificate courses, PLCs.  I have a friend who did not do a junior certificate or leaving certificate, and she did PLCs and is now doing an honours masters degree in University College Cork, despite never having sat an exam in secondary school.  That is from 15 or 20 years ago.  The model is there and we just need to bring it out of the dark.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the whole conversation we are having today, I have flagged and put it in as a suggestion for our work programme that we deal with the whole area around SMEs and the solutions and supports needed.  For example, Padraig O&rsquo;Reilly and Seamus Hoyne are doing great work in this area, in particular on the Speedier project and DigiEco.  We got funding from the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, in the last budget, with &euro;22 million for digitalising and decarbonising the SME sector.  That is something we have to deal with as a committee and it is something I know Mr. Donohoe and Dr. Power will be involved in.  The funding is there; we need to figure out the how as soon as possible.<\/p><p>That is why I put it on our work programme that we invite Mr. Padraic McElwee from the local enterprise offices. They have done considerable work through the green for micro initiative but they need help with giving mentors and employees the skill set and knowledge to encourage SMEs to decarbonise.  We have secured funding from the T&aacute;naiste, so there is nothing stopping us from doing this.  I am flagging this matter with the witnesses.  The expert group highlighted it in its report.  We are ready to go.  As a country, we could initiate it now.<\/p><p> I was speaking to Business in the Community Ireland.  The witnesses referred to the need to link up with big businesses, even if only philanthropically.  Businesses are raring to go.  I plan to hold a session of this committee with Business in the Community Ireland, Mr. Seamus Hoyne, Mr. Joe Leddin, who advises businesses on grants and training to upskill employees, including digitalising and decarbonising the SME sector, and Mr. Padraic McElwee of the local enterprise offices as well as the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, on the circular economy.  We have all the knowledge and funding we now need to help the SME sector.  I hope we as a committee will work on this and follow up on the expert group's report.  I have done a great deal of work in this regard.  From speaking with Mr. Tom&aacute;s Sercovich of Business in the Community Ireland, businesses are raring to go and big companies are happy to engage with smaller ones.  They will do this partly for their own sake because they need to figure out the supply chain.  Small companies are struggling to make their carbon evaluations and all the large companies want those evaluations because the latter's carbon footprints must take account of their suppliers'.  This is why we need to help small businesses not just to decarbonise, but to know the value of what they have done and what their carbon footprint is.  This is the only way forward.  I quoted Mr. Larry Fink, the billionaire, to the T&aacute;naiste when making my pre-budget submission to him and when speaking about decarbonisation.  Climate investment is economic investment.  There is no security in business otherwise.  Businesses can forget about it if they are not decarbonising.  That is the only way forward.<\/p><p> I thank the witnesses for their time and their important report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120800002#J00600","speaker":"1659","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":105,"content":"<p>The Senator has a minute left if she wants to ask a question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120800002#K00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":106,"content":"<p>No.  I would rather hear from the witnesses in that minute because they are not allowed to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120800002#K00300","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":107,"content":"<p>They can respond if they want but they will have just under a minute to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120800002#K00400","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I will talk quickly.

I am interested in hearing about DigiEco and how it will help in that regard.  As our report has tried to point out, the decarbonisation agenda will not necessarily create new occupations, although there will be some.  Rather, this has become everyone's concern.

I used to work for HETAC, which no longer exists.  It was subsumed into Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, but the work continues.  A large amount can and should be done around the national qualifications framework and the European qualifications framework.  A framework gives us a route, but not necessarily to putting a label on something, in that it does not have to be a leaving certificate, junior certificate or even an intermediate certificate, as I would have done.  It can just be a level 1 to level 6 qualification or whatever.  We are not making as much as we should be of the fact we have that framework.  When HETAC was subsumed into QQI ten or more years ago, the intention was to streamline educational qualifications, but we still use the outdated system.  We still have a single big exam for the majority of people.  There needs to be a shift in mindsets in this regard.<\/p> <p>  On the recognition of prior qualifications, we are missing a trick.  There are people who are doing work that could be subject to a proper streamlined evaluation process.  I am not necessarily speaking about people with a single large qualification but about people with a series of smaller qualifications that could be added together.  QQI used to do this to a large extent but I am unsure as to how much it is happening at the moment.  Do we have a pool of skills we are not recognising?  Generally, an increase in wages comes with the recognition of skills, but the value is coming from the worker attaining those skills.  Do we have an unevaluated set of skills we could tap into?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120800002#K00700","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Recognition of prior learning, RPL, has been on the agenda.

I agree with the Deputy that RPL is important, not only for the untapped pool but to encourage more people to take up lifelong learning and upskilling.  It is an important motivational factor.  It is a tough situation, though.  In some sectors, for example, hospitality, RPL is easier to achieve on a basic level.  If someone can cook, he or she can demonstrate those skills.  During our research, we heard comments from people in other sectors that they might as well do the courses and exams because that would be less work than having to demonstrate and put together portfolios to show their prior experience.  While I accept that RPL is a challenge, it should be done.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned the human capital initiative and micro-credentials.

I chaired a reform group looking at a new junior certificate business studies curriculum, and it was a really interesting experience.  It demonstrated to me, as someone who has made a living pontificating about the education system, the degree of hard and technical work that is required on the ground to develop something fit for purpose.  The business studies curriculum had not been revised for 30 years and it still covered matters such as double-entry bookkeeping.  That was a learning experience.<br\/><br\/>We are really hooked in to the NCCA.  It is a really important organisation that does tremendous work on curriculum reform.  The gap is in how the education system and teachers assimilate the council&rsquo;s recommendations.  There is always a tension in respect of teachers teaching to the test, as was noted, and the curriculum specifications tend to be very involved and prescriptive in that regard.  In the context of some of the debates on curriculum reform now, the NCCA defines the learning outcomes and relies to a greater degree on the professional competence of teachers and their flexibility in how they deliver that, which suits teachers who have come from training institutions in recent years and would be well aware of the latest pedagogical techniques.  In short, the NCCA is an organisation we are well aware of and work with, and I am a great admirer of it.  Some of the more progressive thinkers in Irish education are under its roof.<br\/><br\/>We have not looked specifically at remote working hubs but reports on digitisation, in general, make passing reference to blended and remote working.  There is much commentary on this at the moment because of the times we are in, but this will have to play out in regard to how we can maximise the use of technology and minimise some of the disadvantages.  We have managed it through an emergency, but this will have to play out much longer such that we will be able to use these remote working hubs and have the skills, and management skills in particular, to manage workers in that context.<br\/><br\/>I will take the final points together.  We have not looked at local training initiatives <i>per se<\/i>but they are referenced in different reports.  This speaks to the Deputy&rsquo;s point about having different ways of learning.  The classroom does not suit everyone.  People have different ways of assimilating knowledge; some are more practical or theoretical, while some learn by doing or by being demonstrated to.  An important area in the context of local training initiatives relates to pre-apprenticeship courses.  I am quite familiar with one such course in the north inner city of Dublin run through Technological University Dublin, and there are others.

As I said earlier, these issues have been around forever, and as the circular economy takes hold, with enterprise having to design out much of the environmental damage from initial product design through to packaging, waste management and how the product is used, prepared and repurposed, we will need much more sophisticated design if our enterprises are to be successful.  I recall Enterprise Ireland producing a report, I think based on McKinsey, that indicated the single greatest step that could be taken to increase prosperity among Irish companies was to strengthen management.  I would be grateful if our guests' group could provide us with a few succinct recommendations, not necessarily today, on how these two very achievable shifts could be made.  They are both manageable, do not cost an arm and a leg and could be done through those sorts of incremental schemes our guests spoke about, such as Springboard, the human capital initiative or even Skillsnet.  We need a succinct proposition, and I would certainly be happy to try to drive it on in any of the departmental circles we can influence as a committee.<\/p> <p>  The main difference in regard to apprenticeship is that it is a jobs contract.  While I take my hat off to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science for including apprenticeships on CAO forms, whereby they can all be seen as options, getting an apprenticeship is a different matter.  Is there any scope for sectors to come together in some way in order that people can sign on without that additional challenge of finding a specific enterprise to take them on as an apprentice?  That seems to be one of the main obstacles preventing people taking on apprenticeships.<\/p> <p>  Judging by what our guests said, it seems we are having to make small changes at the margins, setting up little funds and initiatives, because the system is so resistant to change.  What can be done to make the education system a bit more responsive in its mainstream activities, rather than having to have the human capital initiative, ICT plans or Springboard tacked on at the edge?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120800002#L00600","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":120,"content":"<p>On design thinking, which is what we are talking about here, the prescription is not new, as the Deputy pointed out.  It has been around for a while.  When we produced the Winning by Design report in 2017, we had quite a challenge in getting the education system to understand what we meant by design.  When people think of design, they think of aesthetic design, and people were not thinking beyond that.  Nevertheless, we are making progress.<\/p><p>We produced a follow-up report on digital design, which is very important now.  It is not just about the technology; it is about how people use it.  That has been behind the success of the most successful technology companies.  They often do not have the best technology, but they have design that would encourage people to use it and tap into what people want.  There is also product design and redesign, as well as strategic design and how we look at our businesses.<br\/><br\/>There is an implementation group working on that and we will hear a report from it at the meeting after this.  I will definitely bear in mind what the Deputy is suggesting.  Another group is addressing the specific challenges for SMEs more generally and not just on design thinking.  We can come back to see what part of the journey we are on.<br\/><br\/>I mentioned the benchmarking tool initially.  There are other initiatives encouraging them to take up more formal training.  There tends to be a resistance to formal training.  In human resources management, in its broadest sense there seem to be gaps in recruitment and managing performance.  We can revert to the Deputy on how we might move that conversation on.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy is right about the challenge of how to promote apprenticeships.  The new apprenticeship office should be the single repository to which companies post job vacancies.  We have done this in the past with the much-maligned JobBridge.  I do not want to get into a debate about it; I actually thought it was a good thing at the time.  It had a single repository of internship opportunities that companies could post to.  It had the IT infrastructure.<br\/><br\/>I do not think we should do it on a sectoral basis because many apprenticeships now are more occupationally based than sectorally based.  An occupation in a high-end regulated food manufacturer could also share more or less the same characteristics as in biopharma manufacturing in a highly regulated environment.  By focusing on sectors, we might be missing a trick.  We need somewhere where employers can post apprenticeships where people can access them very quickly.  At the moment it is quite dispersed across education and training boards, ETBs, etc.  I understand there are efforts in that regard with <i>apprenticeship.ie<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>I take the Deputy's point on inertia in the system; it is like moving the <i>Titanic<\/i>.  I would not fully agree that we are just impacting at the margins.  I would have no problems calling out particular sectors.  The institutes of technology, some of which have now become technological universities, have traditionally worked quite well based on my experience with enterprise.  That was part of their DNA and was what defined them from their origins back as technical colleges.  Those interventions, some of which I have mentioned such as skill nets and the human capital initiative, are more than things that are happening around the margins.  The human capital initiative pillar 3 is about innovation in the higher education sector.  This is about making the sector more responsive.  We are making progress.  I have been working in this area for many years and the responsiveness of our education system is better than it was 15 years or more ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120800002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I will try to give the witnesses more time to talk this time.  I always forget about that.  We did not hear from Dr. Power at all.<\/p> <p>  I spoke to a plumber friend of mine who has 20 staff to hear his perspective.  I love listening to tradesman.  When trying to sort out the issue it is always good to talk to the lads on the ground.  He said that the plumbing apprenticeship programme is appallingly stuck in the 1980s.  New plumbers are not getting proper up-to-date training on air-to-water systems or using plastic rather than copper and metal materials.  I have the details in an email from him that I could read out, but the witnesses get the idea.  The plumbing apprenticeship training is not up to speed and as a result the tradesman, the employer, is left paying a private company to do training for the apprentice to learn how to use the new systems, some of which have been around for some time.  I believe my brother got an air-to-water system in his house 15 years ago so it is not that new.<\/p> <p>  My friend said that as an employer, it is frustrating to release an apprentice for block release knowing that most of what they are learning will not be applicable to their actual job.  A complete overhaul of the syllabus is badly needed.  His father went to AnCO in 1971 and much of what he did then is still taught today 50 years later.  That is something I want to flag.  I brought it up previously.  It is great that we have apprenticeships and all that, but what we are teaching them needs to be relevant.  Otherwise, we are putting extra costs on the employer to pay private companies to upskill their apprentices who are not learning it in their apprenticeships.<\/p> <p>  I want to talk about SOLAS.  It is still not possible to get a safe pass online, which is prohibitive.  In England they have been doing safe passes online for years.  I have also been on about this for months.  This is not just related to the Covid pandemic but applies generally.  Why can they not be done online?  It is costly and time consuming if someone needs to travel.  I was told that somebody from County Clare needs to go to County Roscommon for the next available one.<\/p> <p>  The prior learning is not completely clear to me.  I have been trying to get the information from SOLAS.  It appears that people are required to send in a portfolio or something.  I do not know if anybody here is aware of that, but it is still not clear to me.  I have failed after months trying to find out how the prior learning actually works.

Joining me are council members, Ms Dawn Holland, Professor Michael McMahon, Dr. Adele Bergin and Mr. Alessandro Giustiniani, as well as our chief economist and head of secretariat, Dr. Eddie Casey.  We value our engagements with the Oireachtas and see these opportunities as an important part of our work.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is an independent body established under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.  Its mandate is to endorse and assess the Government's macroeconomic forecasts, the budgetary projections, compliance with the domestic fiscal rules and the fiscal stance.  Its focus is on the overall fiscal stance, rather than on individual tax measures or spending items.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman noted, last week, the council published its 21st fiscal assessment report.  The report noted the continued recovery in the economy from recent lockdowns.  Pre-crisis levels of underlying activity were reached in the second quarter of this year, but the recovery is uneven.  Sectors such as tourism and hospitality still show more pronounced effects compared with high-income sectors that have seen little disruption to growth from the current crisis.<\/p> <p>  Looking ahead, the economy is expected to grow at a healthy rate of around 3.5% in the medium term.  Risks around this forecast are broadly balanced.  Growth could be higher if scarring from the pandemic is less severe than assumed, if wages grow faster, or if savings unwind and boost consumer spending more than assumed.  However, there are also adverse risks associated with virus mutations, further restrictions, reduced foreign direct investment, FDI, due to international tax developments, and uncertainties around Brexit.<\/p> <p>  The council welcomes the Government's steps towards developing a medium-term fiscal strategy.  This has three key elements.  First, the spending forecasts are now more credible.  These allow for the cost of maintaining existing levels of public supports amid demographic and price pressures.  Second, the Government has introduced a spending rule that seeks to limit core spending increases to an average of 5% annually.  This covers Exchequer non-interest spending and the idea is to broadly align spending increases with the economy's trend growth rate, and hence with sustainable growth in Government revenues.  Third, the Government has set out public investment plans to 2030 in the new national development plan published in October.<\/p> <p>  A sharp narrowing of the deficit is anticipated this year.  As set out in the budget, a deficit of 5.9% of GNI* in 2021 looks achievable.  The deficit could ultimately be narrower due to higher revenue and less spending than anticipated.  For 2022, the Government stuck to its planned &euro;4.7 billion budgetary package.  This provides approximately &euro;1.6 billion to maintain existing public services, &euro;1.5 billion in new current spending and an increase of &euro;1.1 billion in public investment.  The budget forecasts that as a reserve, a deficit of 3.4% of GNI* will be achieved in 2022, but it could be lower.<\/p> <p>  Keeping to the planned package means that the Government is striking an appropriate balance between supporting the economy and keeping the public finances on a sustainable path.  The plans would allow public investment to increase to record levels and should be sufficient to maintain existing levels of services.  The budget deficit would close by 2023 and the debt ratio in gross terms would fall to below 90% of GNI* by 2025, declining at a steady pace of around three percentage points each year.  This would comply with the domestic fiscal rules.<\/p> <p>  To help achieve the strategy set out, the Government should reinforce various elements of it.  First, departmental spending ceilings should be set out, as is legally required.  Second, the spending rule could be linked more closely to the domestic fiscal rules; expanded to cover non-Exchequer spending and tax changes; and given legislative backing.  Moreover, the Government needs to clarify how major commitments around Sl&aacute;intecare and climate actions fit into these plans.  Sl&aacute;intecare costings have not been updated since 2017.  There is no estimate of the budgetary cost of implementing the climate action plan.<\/p> <p>  The space left over for additional current spending implied by the Government's plans will be limited in the years ahead unless there are offsetting spending cuts elsewhere or tax increases.  The budget suggests approximately &euro;1.6 billion per year on average of new current spending remains to be allocated, while the council's estimates suggested that only approximately &euro;500 million would remain once standstill costs are met.  Any additional spending beyond this level would require either tax increases or reduced spending in other areas to be consistent with the Government's strategy.<\/p> <p>  The Government's over-reliance on corporation tax receipts to fund public services must also be addressed.  Last year, one in five euro of tax receipts came from corporation tax, and more than half of those receipts were from ten corporate groups.  This concentration, coupled with the ongoing volatility of receipts and their vulnerability to international tax developments, is a source of serious concern.  To deal with these risks, the council assesses that the Government should allocate corporation tax receipts above what is forecast for a given year to the rainy day fund.  This would potentially include any increase due to the rise in the minimum corporation tax rate to 15%.  This would help to reduce the reliance on volatile, unpredictable, and potentially finite resources in much the same way that Norway treats its oil revenues.<\/p> <p>  The Government must also contend with the challenge of an Irish population that is rapidly ageing.  In October, the Commission on Pensions set out a package of reforms that would restore the long-run sustainability of the pensions system, including through raising the retirement age with life expectancy and a significant increase in PRSI contributions.  The Government now needs to set out how it will respond.  The proposal to delay raising the retirement age to 2028, however, raises questions about the willingness of future Governments to impose the kinds of measures recommended by the pensions commission.  Setting out a plan to phase in any PRSI increases over the coming years could help to make those measures more credible.<\/p><p>To summarise, the Government's medium-term strategy is appropriate and allows a large increase in public investment while bringing debt to safer levels, helped by expected growth and low interest rates.  However, some major questions need to be answered and decisions taken to ensure that the strategy is delivered.<\/p><p> We stand ready for the committee's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barnes.

It is an issue of consistency between the macroeconomic forecasts for compensation, namely, wages and the like, and what we see on the income tax side.

It is a difficult environment to predict taxes in because the unevenness in the economy means that some higher-wage sectors have continued to grow quickly in terms of employment and people have, on average, been getting wage increases.  We then see the reverse of the coin in the more service-oriented sectors where wages tend to be lower, there has been a significant shortfall in employment and wage prospects have not been as good.

We thought that looked unusual.  There could be any number of reasons driving it.  When we assessed the issue, it looked like the wage forecasts themselves were a bit low and potentially needed upward revisions whereas the actual tax forecast, which drew on more recent data and was available much closer to now, seemed to be okay and incorporated many of the positive developments that we saw in the middle part of the year and in recent months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eddie Casey"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Regarding an issue that we have been dealing with for some time, that being, the standstill costs, I note IFAC's work and that the Department is getting closer to the council.

There has at least been a big step forward in producing credible forecasts because there is enough money there.  Unfortunately, the Government has not produced a great deal of information for the later years.  It has for 2022, but for the medium term, it has not set out its thinking on matters.  It has set out an allocated amount but what that amount covers is not clear.  There is no economic sense of what the allocation is.  It is just a decision taken by the Government to allocate this amount.  In some other publications, for example, the mid-year expenditure review, the Government included higher numbers in those years that were more similar to the fiscal space numbers.  It is a conceptual difference.  In this instance, the Government has used some concepts of allocation without spelling out what that allocation means.  The standstill costs are well defined and the Deputy can read our work on it.  Over the summer, the Government was using numbers that were more detailed and similar to ours.

If one fully accounts for what we believe will be the cost of just standing still, allowing for demographic and price pressures in those years and bearing in mind that we fully index everything to wages, in which context we assume that welfare payments and pensions will rise in line with general economy wages, then we believe that the space that will be absorbed will be greater at perhaps &euro;500 million to &euro;1 billion.

Some of the comments he referred to were mine and he is correct that I would not have put them in the public domain.  The underlying background to it and the element that is most frustrating for most economists is that the process of forecasting is one where nobody ever gets it right all of the time but forecasts should really be judged by the information they are based on at the time they are done.  Again, the context was not given in the articles but it was well known to us.  The comment \"not forecasting Christmas\" goes back to the old issue of not putting Christmas bonuses in even though they are perfectly predictable, so we get these repeated errors on the spending side.  When they can be forecast, they definitely should be included.<\/p> <p>  We said at the end of 2019 that the economy looked like it was starting to run a little bit hot.  At the time, that was the right judgment to have.  Absolutely, we were wrong in that we did not forecast Covid but I do not think anybody did.  Again, the comment without context looks a little more snarky but the underlying issue is that when doing forecasts, what we want to see is a credible forecast process that takes into account all of the information.  It turns out that there were occasions when we were predicting worse outcomes where, of course, historically the Government got better outcomes but those were on the back of over performance in corporate taxation or other things that could not be forecast or were risky.<\/p> <p>  We will make mistakes and get forecasts wrong, as will the Department of Finance and every other forecaster, but the key point to recognise is that our core role in the Irish policy process is to assess those forecasts, determine where errors are made and assess the credibility of forecasts so that policies can be set on a sustainable footing.  Taking account of what we think of as excessively large corporate tax gains, even though they have been persisting, seems like a riskier strategy and one which we do not think is advisable.

We have been trying to pursue this with the Ministers for quite some time now, since the deal was struck because that number feels wrong.

We do not have the information to understand how they might make decisions so there is a lot of uncertainty.<\/p> <p>  There are two parts to this.  The first is the estimate from the Department of Finance that the changes to the tax base would cost &euro;2 billion.  That estimate has not been updated for a while so we do not know if that is still the Department's view, particularly given that a lot of the recent growth in corporation tax is probably due to international companies.  Offsetting that is the raising of the rate but the Government has not provided an estimate on that.  Mechanically, if the number of companies does not change very much, that is, if the base stays the same, we could be looking at a big increase in revenue from corporation tax.  Also, to be fair, corporation tax has increased a lot in recent years because a lot of the companies involved are making a lot more money than they were previously.  This is partly because of the pandemic and the shift to digital.<\/p> <p>  There are lots of moving parts to this.  Our concern is the uncertainty but also if we lock in higher levels of corporation tax, which may persist for some time, that is a big risk down the line as we become more and more exposed to a volatile source of revenue that could go away over time if companies change their strategies.

What is the Department of Finance not doing?  Should we be monitoring progress on a monthly basis in terms of income and expenditure?  Are there formulas?

The overall approach the Department of Finance takes is pretty much in line with international practice, subject to the many limitations of forecasting.  Ireland has always been quite a difficult economy to predict but if we focus more on domestic issues, perhaps we get a better measure of it.  It is also the case that we are in a very challenging environment.  There has not been anything like the Covid crisis ever.  A lot of the uncertainty relates to the evolution of the pandemic, which is very difficult to predict.  It depends on mutations of the virus, how it spreads and many issues that are very hard to understand.  We are living in a particularly difficult moment.  There are some issues that are not related to this where there could be more progress in the Department of Finance.  One area, for example, is on the spending side outside the Exchequer area.  Providing more information on that would be very helpful to understand what is going on.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's question on inflation, which is very timely, is a good example of the uncertainties we now face.  For the last couple of years, inflation has been very low.  People thought about why it was so low but they did not think about inflation picking up.  We have seen this shock and coming out of it, inflation has picked up a lot.  That is partly due to higher energy prices and the factors behind that are fairly complex.  It is also to do with supply constraints, both in Ireland and externally, as there has been a shift between different types of activity.  Supply has been disrupted by a number of different factors.  There are lots of things going on and there is a very active debate as to whether what we see with inflation is a temporary catching up or boost to price levels following the recovery from the pandemic or a more lasting phenomenon, whether the constraints are bigger where there have been shifts in the labour market and whether people's expectations on inflation are going to change.  There are many big questions out there.  We explore them a little bit in the report but there are no easy answers.<\/p> <p>  I invite my colleague, Mr. Casey, to share his thoughts on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>On the forecasting side, an interesting way of dealing with this is to look at why we got it wrong this year and why the deficit will be much better.  There are always two sides to the deficit - tax and spending.  On the tax side, we know that income tax and corporation tax will do a lot better.  Corporation tax has been such a volatile and unpredictable tax head that one would say there is a much better way we can forecast that with great certainty.  On the income tax side, what the Department seems to be doing, which we would encourage, is looking at ways of forecasting this tax head by individual sectors.  It involves looking at what are the high-, middle- and low-income sectors and forecasting in respect of those areas.  We generally forecast what overall wages are doing but this would not have helped us with a shock like Covid because many of the low-paid sectors, where taxes were not very high, were hit worse than any other sector and so the overall hit to income tax was not as large as we would have expected.  What we really need to do is look a bit more carefully through that tax head.<\/p> <p>  On the spending side, a very useful thing for the committee that we would love to see next year is a clear split so that when this is looked at on a monthly basis, we know what the core spending is doing, everything outside Covid and the buffers for it.  We could not see that this year and we still cannot get a clear picture of what is happening with core spending whereas we know what probably happened this year is that a lot of buffers built in for various Departments for Covid-related spending just have not been needed, which is a good thing.

This could be seen spread across loads of Departments.

It is laid out fairly clearly in the fiscal monitor.  We can really see a very broad spread across all areas.  It looks to be a problem.  This year, it was difficult to undertake a lot of the projects people wanted to but I would caution that in December last year and to a lesser extent in other years as well, we would have seen a big ramp up in capital spending in that month.  Very often, if we look at the past five or six years, we can see that the ratio of spending on capital that takes place in December versus every other month is about four to five times higher on average.

We should have a system where if a Department has committed to a job, at least it is reported that the contract is in place and funding is committed and will be spent by the end of the year.  While one can see what has been given out from each Department, one will also see what is committed in terms of what will be spent before the end of the year, for example, if there is going to be an underspend because the Department have not met its commitments, for example, the contract did not happen within the timeframe.  We need to shake up that a bit more and bring a more commercial sense to it.

The witnesses mentioned again the reasons we need to be careful about it because it is volatile and not 100% dependable.  The council has said this for five years and Mr. Barnes's predecessor made a point of saying it as well.  I refer to what Seamus Coffey said because it is worth putting it on the record.  He said that the whole idea behind the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is to institutionalise the memory of the crash.  There is a thing about the boy who cried wolf about the council and the volatility of corporation tax.  People looking on said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tOh my God, but sure look at the figures.  They've risen exponentially.  Now the base rate is rising.  It ought to result in a windfall. <\/blockquote> <p>I am of the same view as Mr. Barnes.  I believe anything over and above what is anticipated in corporation tax should be put in a rainy day fund.  The council is saying that and more.  This leads to my first question because I did make this point to the Minister for Finance.  He said that to have allocated the amount due to have been allocated to the rainy day fund in 2022 would have put undue pressure on the public finances given the situation we find ourselves in.  What is the council's view on that?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#D00700","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":177,"content":"<p>The Deputy made a number of good points.  First, we are aware of the danger of crying wolf but, of course, our experience and the institutional memory of what happened are that these things can build up over a long time but one must not give up what one thinks one's analysis will be because eventually it will be true and one needs to make sure one is protected.<\/p><p>In some ways, regarding what has happened, the dynamic we had before 2019 was fairly unhealthy in the sense that we had repeated health overruns that were essentially being financed by the corporation tax excess.  Had we not had those health overruns, one can wonder what might have happened, but we might not have built in this reliance that we have.  We are partly locked into it because of past policy mistakes.  Looking at where we are now with the recovery, it is true that corporation tax over the past couple of years has helped us a little.  It helped us well during the crisis.  It was fortunate that it was strong but it could have gone the other way too.  We had a tailwind but I do not think that should lead us to be complacent.<\/p><p> The past couple of years were not an ideal time to put money in a rainy day fund because we were spending billions of euro to support the economy.  Maybe that is a reasonable point.  Money is fungible.  That is the circumstance where one would want to draw down from a rainy day fund.  It is fine that it has not been a priority in the last couple of years.  Looking ahead, we expect the economy will grow quickly.  That is a period when one needs to get one's house in order.  That is why we think that not increasing the over-reliance on corporation tax will be a priority for the years ahead.  That is a period when you want to build up the rainy day fund.

On that point, much of the coverage was taken out of context, which the Deputy will not be surprised to hear me say.  They are probably not that far apart if a full discussion was had.  The ESRI did some analysis.  It said that if Ireland's debt ratio is looked at relative to GDP, it seemed lower than other countries, and because interest rates have fallen, which most economists would view as a long-term thing, there is probably more space over the coming decades to invest in things like housing.  In its responses, the Department of Finance suggested that this was somewhat unhelpful and pushed towards much higher deficits after a period of heavy deficits due to Covid.  The debt ratio was actually quite high when measured against national income and ignoring distortions of GDP.<\/p> <p>  Our own view is that Ireland still has a fairly high debt ratio.  We think the right way to measure these things is national income, which is GNI*.  That is the best measure we have of tax revenue, of what the underlying economy is doing and what is really driving the public finances.  It is not GDP.  When we look at it and think that the debt ratio is high, we think that some scope is given by lower interest rates to run slightly higher deficits over the medium term, but it is not enormous.  When one is starting from a high debt ratio already and is a small, open economy, it makes things harder.  We think that the Government should be targeting a reduction in the debt ratio over time.  We have to be cautious about how much spending we are talking about and how large a potential deficit we want to run to fund things like additional public investment in housing.  We said that the Government's current plans are appropriate in the medium term.  The discussion should start from such a baseline.

It is not going to be that way, nor should it be.  It will involve the other route.<\/p> <p>  We always look over our shoulder to make sure we are not going in the direction of the financial crash ever again.  When it occurred, the then Government and Oireachtas Members were given advice of every kind known.  We were told to default and that nobody could do anything about it.  We were told we owed too much money and that, as a consequence, we should default.  Well-meaning economists told us this.  Others told us that there would be a second bailout equal to, or nearly equal to, the first.  Fortunately, we did not take account of that either and decided not to proceed in that way.  By \"we\", I mean the Government and Oireachtas.  A lot of pressure was exerted when the IMF took over Government Buildings.  It was deciding what was going to happen.  We had a choice.  One option was to default, in which case we would be swinging in the wind with no support from any quarter, no banking and no credit, credibility or credit rating.  We should remember all the worries about the credit rating going from bad to worse, or downhill all the time, with obvious consequences for the future.  However, we recovered fairly quickly.  We did so for a number of reasons.  A couple of the basic industries, such agrifood and pharmaceutical, doubled up very quickly and carried the responsibility of driving the economy forward through exports.<\/p> <p>  It will be different in the future.  I fell foul of many economists during the period in question.  Before the crash came at all, I raised on several occasions in the House questions that needed to be answered at the time.  I mentioned this previously.  I had one answer to one question before the whole thing closed down.  The answer was an honest answer, given by the then Minister for Finance, a constituency colleague.  He told it as it was.  Action needed to be taken then but none was.  The question and its implications were pushed aside.<\/p> <p>  At this stage, I feel we need to have people with good judgment who do not panic and plan based on what is happening and might happen in the best- and worst-case scenarios.  Our economy has grown as our population has grown.  In the past 30 or 40 years, our population has almost doubled.  We had underdeveloped country before our membership of the EU.  We went well ahead from the time we became a member state, and we have lots of pace ahead of us still and many jobs for people born here and those who want to come to live here, because that is how our economy is going to grow.  At this stage, we must be astute.  We need to do the things that work well in achieving fiscal value.  We need to invest heavily in infrastructure because we did not have it in the past.  The Industrial Revolution did not come to us until after we joined the EU.<\/p> <p>  Those are the points that come to my mind based on my simple observations.  They need to be borne in mind for the future.  I am not an expert but have met many experts in my time here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#F00100","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Do members of IFAC want to respond to any of those points?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#F00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":185,"content":"<p>People have many different issues.

The council participates in a network of other fiscal councils across Europe with 32 members.  It so happens that last week, the network put out a report on the future of the fiscal rules which touches on some of these issues.  As regards the conclusion of the report, which would partly reflect my own view, the design of fiscal rules is an extremely complex subject.  Countries are in very different situations.  There are some with very high debt ratios and some with very low debt ratios, some with reasonably high growth such as Ireland and some with very low growth in recent years such as Italy.  It is, therefore, highly complicated.  There is a whole system of existing rules and problems, which means there are no particularly easy answers to any of these questions.<\/p> <p>  We discuss the 3% in the report.  There is a current view and debate that the 3% should be replaced with something more sophisticated.  There is another view that the 3% is the only part that anyone on the street has ever heard of and while it is a blunt instrument, it might be the only sort of brake in the system, so maybe we should not mess around with it.  Those are the two views.  Across Europe, the fiscal councils do not particularly take a view on that question.<\/p> <p>  The final point the Deputy made was very important.  There are two aspects of the report worth mentioning here.  The first is that we talk a little about the role of independent fiscal institutions such as the council.  We think they have more to offer, probably in a European context, in making sure that we can have a system that is rules-based but where there is some discretion to use overrides to avoid serious mistakes and promote the debate at national level.  We think the role of fiscal councils could be increased in that respect and the report discusses that more.<\/p> <p>  The second aspect is that we talk about the need to test the fiscal rules.  One of the mistakes made in the past is that people had relatively abstract discussions about what type of rule may or may not be good.  However, we need to look at what would actually apply when the rules kick in.  For example, the debt rule in certain circumstances could be very constraining in a way that is suboptimal.  In other circumstances, it might be absolutely fine.  One needs to look at the world as one expects it to be across all the different countries of the European Union or in the euro area.  One needs to look at the risks that things will not pan out as expected.  One also needs to evaluate whether the rules will work properly or not.  For example, some of the problems we saw in the enforcement of the debt rule in recent years would have been avoided had people done simulations and realised that this would be a problem for some countries.  That approach, based on testing and on evidence, is a bit of a shift from the way it has been done in the past.  That is very much in line with the way the council approaches many problems, which I think would be really helpful.  For this reason, one must always think about what something will actually mean.  Many rules sound quite nice but when one figures out what they actually mean for countries one realises that, for perhaps not all countries but for a small number of countries, it poses massive problems and that will undermine the whole framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis.

It is, therefore, topical and submissions need to be in by the end of the month.<\/p> <p>  The report also notes the Commission on Pensions package of reforms and the council's concern with delays in raising the pension age and PRSI increases.  I am interested in hearing IFAC's views on employer PRSI evasion through so-called bogus self-employment.  The Committee of Public Accounts heard recently that more than &euro;1 billion in PRSI is lost as a result of this practice every year.  The Sinn F&eacute;in view on the pension age is quite clear.  It seems unfair that we would force people to work longer while certain employers are allowed to shirk their tax obligations in this regard.

Over the next decades, there will be a significant increase in pension spending if we do not change the pension age to take account of the fact that people are living longer and the cohorts that will be reaching retirement in the next ten or 20 years are much bigger than previous cohorts.  The number of people reaching retirement age will be far greater.  Those two effects each account for half of the increase that we will get in pensions costs as a share of national income.  Those costs are very big.  There are not many alternatives and that is what the Commission on Pensions has found.  It has concluded, as we did in our long-term report, that the current system is not sustainable.  It recommended various approaches for dealing with that.  It made a recommendation that basically would involve indexation, which would cover 40% of the overall increase in the share of national income that would need to go into pensions, with the rest coming from taxation and also the Exchequer.  There are not many ways of avoiding these sorts of measures.  Obviously, there are some other things one can do that would help to adjust the cost but, underneath, those two drivers are very big and need to be addressed directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I also note IFAC's focus on the pension age and PRSI increases, but there does not seem to be much focus on the significant tax expenditure that occurs on private pensions.

I would be interested in the council commenting on why there is a lack of focus on this as well.<\/p> <p>  I want to go into something else before my time is up.  I noted in IFAC's opening statement - this is something the council has probably raised on every occasion it has been in front of this committee or the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach - the concern about the concentration of our corporate tax base, largely within ten companies.  It is something the council and others have been noting for some time.  What progress has the Government made in mitigating that kind of concentration or relocation risk arsing from an industrial strategy that places all our eggs in one basket?  Would it be prudent to begin weaning ourselves off this by ring-fencing large unexpected corporation tax receipts?  I note the council mentions that it should be ring-fenced into the rainy day fund but I refer to an alternative industrial strategy because that is something that we need to focus on as well given the changes in international taxes.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, we see that the climate advisory council is telling us that we need to use fiscal opportunities such as low-interest loans for the front-loading of public investment to reduce emissions within the next ten years.

The first related to the concentration of the corporate tax base and risks around that, and the second was on climate.<\/p> <p>  On the corporate tax side, as the Deputy will be aware, this is something we have been highlighting for a long time.  As time has passed, that revenue has increased quite fast.  Reliance on it has increased, not through any Government policy but because the companies in question pay more tax in Ireland on the basis that they are doing more taxable activity in Ireland.  As the Deputy will be aware, we are concerned about the risks around that, as we have been for a long time.  We are perhaps getting a little more certainty on the policy side of that but we are increasingly reliant on a small number of companies.  That revenue can be volatile and we think we should reduce reliance.  That is why we think the rainy day fund would be a good way of ring-fencing that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the wider strategy for the economy, investing in education and infrastructure and continuing to ensure Ireland remains competitive are all very important, irrespective of what happens on the international side.<\/p><p>Those things might attract international companies and they may help domestic ones to develop.  Encouraging the economy is good for many reasons.  It provides people with good jobs.  It provides additional revenue that can be used to finance increased public activities too.  All that makes sense.  It is not something that we look at in great detail but it is important. <\/p><p> On climate, we have all become much more aware in the past couple of years of the seriousness of the climate problem and the scale of the action we will need to address it.  In fairness, there has been progress on that.  We had a new climate action plan this year that sets sectoral targets, and the targets have been made more ambitious over the past year.  There has been a lot of progress but we are still catching up.  The fact that there is no assessment of the budgetary impact of climate is a serious concern.  We just do not know how much it will cost.  It could cost quite a lot.  A big question is how much of the burden will fall on the private sector and how much on the public sector.  Another issue that has not been tackled is that some of the mitigation or transition measures may impact heavily on low-income families.  That might require changes to the welfare system or some kind of compensation which, again, could be very expensive.  Measures such as retrofitting could be very expensive.  These things just are not factored into the Government's budgetary plans because there is no overall assessment of how much it will cost.  We know that some of the necessary investments are in the national development plan.  It is not that it is not spending any money on this; there is a sizable commitment there.  However, it is not clear how things like retrofitting and a massive switch to electric vehicles will be funded.  The Government needs to make progress on that very quickly because it could be very expensive.  The additional spending available under its current plans is quite narrow.  Most other countries in the same position have not fully worked out how much it will cost and how it will work.  The Climate Change Advisory Council's report was published earlier.  As its chairman said, 2030 is tomorrow in terms of the kinds of investments and timescale of making these changes.  We really do need to work on this as fast as possible.  It needs to be a massive priority. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Like Deputy Farrell, I am conscious of votes coming through.

What we can say is that we do see through the national development plan a big increase in public investment in housing.  To look at how that is being accommodated, a growing economy, falling interest rates and a not massively fast increase in current spending are all coming together and they are creating a space to undertake that investment while, at the same time, bringing the budget towards balance and bringing debt down.  The Government has been able to tackle those two objectives at the same time to restore the public finances to a safer place and to have a significant increase in the amount for public housing investment.  It is important to underline that it is doing those two things.  We produced a new analytical note just before our fiscal assessment report came out on public investment.  One of the big things there is the supply constraint.  We estimate that it will need another 30,000 working in construction to deliver the plan the Government now has.  That might be quite difficult to find.  There are very few unemployed construction workers.  Migration is a bit more complicated than it was previously.

There is a risk.  There were excess savings through lockdown where people were constrained from being able to spend rather than choosing not to.  We know these are very unevenly distributed across the distribution of households.  They tend to be focused in households towards the higher end of the income distribution that did not see disruptions to their work and earnings.  The unwinding of those savings could provide a stimulus to the economy.  The risk is that at a time of supply constraints, as we have seen, those excess savings could result in inflation.  Part of what we are seeing around inflation, not only in Ireland but in many advanced economies, is that the combination of the increased demand as restrictions ease - this remark may be impertinent as we start to see restrictions and lockdowns reintroduced - people got out and spent but they did so in sectors that were constrained.  Some elements of the inflation we have seen are driven not by demand at all but by supply constraints.  Let us take energy and the oil and gas prices, which have gone up and stayed reasonably high for many months.  Now we have entered winter and it has started to get cold, they have become more of a burden.  In some ways, some households having excess savings will be a useful way for them to pay for these higher costs.  That is not so advantageous for the economy because it ultimately feeds out into the energy producers.  However, there are differences across sectors where these supply constraints means more or less.  It is quite a complex picture and one that we will watch.  Taking the view of the European Central Bank, a concern is that the higher inflation that we are seeing would become baked in and live in inflation expectations and, therefore, lead to higher interest rates.  We have discussed how low interest rates help the Government and households to deal with the current situation.  It is something to watch but the ECB has so far been very explicit that it views these increases in inflation as transitory.  It will stand ready and watch.  However, at the moment, the best guess is that unless we see something very marked, we should expect inflation to come down albeit not immediately and certainly not next year.  It will definitely be a strain on the recovery but probably helped by the excess savings that the Deputy mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Michael McMahon"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":202,"content":"<p>What lessons does IFAC feel can be learned from the pandemic so far?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021120800002#H00600","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>That is a very good question.

It is a pleasure to be with the committee today to discuss matters relating to insurance.  As the Chairman said, I am joined by my colleagues, Dr. Mark Cassidy, director of economics and statistics and Mr. Donal Cullinane, director of insurance supervision.<\/p> <p>  Under our mandate the Central Bank seeks to ensure that the financial system operates in the best interests of consumers and the wider economy.<\/p><p>In our recently published multi-year strategy we have again made clear that securing the best interests of consumers and citizens is at the heart of what we do.  In regulating insurance we seek to ensure that customers and the economy are served by a well-functioning and resilient sector that policyholders can rely on to treat them fairly and to pay out on relevant cover when required.  We perform this function as a committed participant in the European system of financial supervision in respect of an insurance market that it is multifaceted and integrated in the overall EU insurance market.<\/p><p> The Central Bank prudentially supervises almost 200 insurance and re-insurance companies operating in the life, non-life, health and reinsurance markets.  Most of these firms are foreign owned and more than 70% of their business is written outside of Ireland.  At the same time approximately 30% of non-life insurance provided in Ireland is provided by companies located elsewhere in the EU.  The sector has a very important role to play in the economic life of the State.  While it has delivered, and continues to deliver, many benefits for policyholders, at times the performance of the domestic non-life sector has been called into question.  As regulators, we view confidence in the sector as very important.  The topics we will be discussing today, including differential pricing, business interruption and recent reports from the Central Bank&rsquo;s national claims information database, provide good examples of how we are seeking to deliver on this, having regard, of course, to the limits of our mandate and powers.<\/p><p> In our review of differential pricing, where customers with the same risk profile are charged different premia, we found that certain pricing practices can lead to materially unfair outcomes for car and home insurance consumers.  In particular, we found the practice of price walking, where customers are charged more upon renewal of their insurance simply for being loyal customers, to be one where the interests of the customer are unfairly subjugated to the interest of the firm.  In our consultation paper published in July, therefore, we proposed to ban this practice of price walking.  Banning the practice will remove the loyalty penalty on consumers who remain with their insurer for more than the short term.  We also propose to introduce new customer consent and disclosure requirements to ensure that any automatic renewal process is more transparent and more clearly agreed to by the policyholder.  In order to maintain the benefits of competition for new customers, we propose to allow insurers to maintain new customer discounts as long as these are clearly flagged as such and the likely renewal cost is also set out.  The consultation on our proposals closed on 22 October and our team is currently reviewing and analysing the submissions received.  We believe that these requirements will have an important impact in themselves and make clear that in a well-functioning financial sector there is no room for practices which take unfair advantage of consumer behaviours and habits.<\/p><p> An important initiative and area of focus for the Central Bank in recent times has been the development and ongoing enhancement of the national claims information database, NCID.  The establishment of the NCID was one of the recommendations made by the cost of insurance working group, which was established by the Minister for Finance in 2016 as a key element in understanding the drivers of the costs of insurance and of underpinning policy measures to address them.  One of the issues identified by the cost of insurance working group and the reports produced on motor and employer and public liability insurance was the lack of credible and accessible data relating to premiums and claims costs.  The establishment of the NCID and the annual reports produced have served to significantly improve transparency in the Irish insurance market and to support data-driven analysis, which is contributing to addressing the issue of high costs of insurance in a number of areas.<\/p><p> The classes of insurance that are in the scope of the NCID are private motor insurance and employers' and public liability insurance.  Aggregate data are collected from insurers, including trends in the premiums, the cost of claims, how claims are settled, how costs vary depending on how claims are settled and an analysis of the various types of cost that make up settlements.  Among other things, the data have highlighted the percentage of premium that is paid out in claims, the considerable legal costs and significant time period associated with settling injury claims through litigation and the performance of the sector since 2009 and the profit making and loss making periods.<\/p><p> We are acutely aware of the difficulties faced by policyholders where there are significant increases in and high costs of insurance premia.  Rates are to a significant extent driven by the overall cost of claims.  As a financial regulator bound by European law, we have a strictly limited role relating to the pricing of insurance products.  We seek to ensure, first, that insurers are not treating customers unfairly, as in the context of the price walking practices that I mentioned, and, second, that the pricing and underwriting practices of firms underpin a sound and sustainable business.  The detailed transparency provided by the NCID and our reports allow for a much clearer understanding to underpin analysis and to assess the effects of wider policy actions.  For example, in our most recent motor insurance report we provided analysis of the costs associated with different claims settlement channels.  Between 2015 and 2020, 94% of injury claimants had total claim costs of less than &euro;100,000.  For claims settled directly, average compensation was &euro;13,111 and legal costs were &euro;1,414.  For claims settled through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, average compensation was &euro;21,845 and legal costs were &euro;665.  For claims settled through litigation, average compensation was &euro;23,454 and legal costs were &euro;15,235.  What we see from these data is that the very significant differences in legal costs greatly outweigh the differences in compensation outcomes.<\/p><p> Policy actions that result in a reduced level and uncertainty of claims are likely to contribute to reducing average premium levels.  In this context, the personal injuries guidelines adopted by the Judicial Council have the potential to lead to greater stability and certainty in the claims environment and reduced volatility of claims, and to reduce legal costs and in time create a more stable reserving environment for insurance firms.  This in turn should contribute to an increase in the availability of insurance and a reduction in premium levels, provided the insurance industry passes on the benefits of these changes to policyholders.<\/p><p> Turning to business interruption insurance, the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent business closures that were mandated on public health grounds focused attention on business interruption claims.  This has been an enormously difficult and challenging time for many businesses as well as for society.  From the outset of the pandemic, the Central Bank identified the significance and potential impact arising from business interruption issues on businesses across Ireland and made it a priority area of focus.  We took a proactive approach to ensure that firms fulfilled their obligation to prioritise the interests of their customers. We focused on identifying all groups of policies where, in our view, the relevant contractual provisions provided cover for Covid-19 related interruption or interference to businesses or provided a strong or reasonable basis for such an interpretation.  We made clear our expectations to firms in this regard, including, importantly, our expectation that ambiguous language be interpreted in favour of the policyholder.  We engaged intensively with firms to ensure delivery on these expectations.<\/p><p> We identified 27 firms that were actively providing business interruption insurance cover for infectious diseases across more than 200 individual policy wordings.  By the end of this process, we had identified the policies that we considered responsive to Covid-19.  We engaged with the relevant firms throughout, making clear our expectation that firms identify and contact potentially affected policyholders and assist policyholders in making a claim, and were operationally ready to deal with claims and have adequate governance and oversight of the process.  As a result of our supervisory interventions, a number of insurers accepted and commenced settling valid claims early in the process.  Others sought legal confirmation and clarification.  When the decision of the High Court was published, from February 2021, the remaining firms accepted that cover existed for these policies.<\/p><p> We directed all the relevant firms to contact all the policyholders who, in our view, held a policy which was responsive to business interruption, along with details of how they could make a claim if they believed their business suffered an interruption or interference related to the outbreak of Covid-19 in Ireland.  At the end of October 2021, more than &euro;146 million has been paid to policyholders through settled claims and interim payments.  This figure includes 3,929 claims that have been fully settled and 868 that have received interim payments.  For the material number of claims that remain open, mostly awaiting further information, we are monitoring progress on a monthly basis and are generally satisfied that such claims are being progressed appropriately.<\/p><p> As I said at the beginning of this statement, the insurance sector has a very important role to play in the economic life of the State and the economic well-being of citizens.  This is even more true when we consider the current context of rapid change and significant uncertainty due to, among other things, the speed of technological innovation on the one hand and the urgent need to address climate change and the transition to a net-zero economy on the other.  To play its full role in this regard, the insurance sector needs to be well run, financially sound and resilient, and trusted to act in a way that prioritises the interests of its customers.  At the Central Bank, we are committed to seeing this achieved.  I thank members for their attention.  We look forward to their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cross","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte go dt&iacute; an coiste roimh an Uasal Cross agus a chomhghleacaithe.  I welcome Mr. Cross and his colleagues to the committee.  There were fine words from the Central Bank at the end.  There is definitely a lot to do regarding the insurance market.  I will delve into that.  I have a lot of questions.  I will try to get through them as quickly as possible, as time permits.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the engagement I have had with the Central Bank on the issue of the loyalty penalty, dual pricing, differential pricing or price walking.  Many different terms are used in this regard.  Back in October 2019, over two years ago, I made that major complaint to the Central Bank and, in fairness, the Governor met with me.  We can see the work that has flowed from the initial reports, the final reports and the consultation that is now complete in the Central Bank's decision to ban that practice, which is a victory for consumers.  It has been outlined well in the different reports the Central Bank has issued that, for example, if you renewed your motor insurance with the same provider seven times, you would be paying 20% more than the technical premium, that is, the actual cost of insuring you under the policy.  For someone paying a premium of &euro;1,000, the actual cost of the policy would be about &euro;800.  It is actually worse in respect of home insurance.  This is the message that needs to go out from this committee because it will be a while before this is banned.  If you have renewed your home insurance six times, you are likely to be one of those paying 24% more than the actual cost of your policy.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the way in which the Central Bank is going to ban price walking, Mr. Cross will be conscious that, in just over two weeks, dual pricing is to be completely banned in the North of Ireland and in Britain.  The way in which this practice was going to be banned was tweaked following the consultation the Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, undertook.  Is the Central Bank considering any changes to the way in which it is going to ban price walking on the basis of the submissions it has received so far?  Will Mr. Cross give us any information on that?  I made a detailed submission to the Central Bank as part of that process.  As part of this question, will Mr. Cross also confirm the Central Bank has all the legal powers necessary to ban this practice and that it does not need any further legislation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#C00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Doherty.  As he has said, this work has been under way for quite a bit of time for a number of reasons.  One is that, with an intervention of this kind in the market, which is very important and which will yield very significant benefits for consumers, it is very important to have a good understanding of what is happening in the market.  I refer not only to how competition is working and what the practices within firms actually are but to how consumers are both understanding and reacting to the situation.  For us, a key piece is that what was at the heart of this practice was firms observing a habit and a behaviour, that behaviour of loyalty, and taking advantage of that to their own benefit rather than to the benefit of the policyholders.  We see that as unfair and, therefore, something to be proscribed.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy has said, we have, in some respects, taken a different approach from that adopted by the UK in this regard.  In particular, when we looked at the importance of stopping this harm and the way to do so, we could also see there were some benefits for new customers.  New customers who shopped around and looked for better pricing could get a better deal.  We discussed very closely among ourselves the question of how to retain that benefit, and we have ended up with a proposal in which the ban on price walking effectively kicks in from the second year, thereby allowing discounts for new customers.  However, very importantly, it must be extremely clear that a price reflects a new customer discount and that the renewal price will be somewhat different.  This addresses the question of behaviours being taken advantage of.<\/p> <p>  We believe we have the legal powers necessary for this.  We set that out in our consultation paper.  We can implement these requirements effectively and well through our consumer protection code.  We have received a number of high quality and very valuable responses to our consultation paper.  We are going through those and looking at whether there are aspects of our proposals that might be tweaked or improved.  It is very important to say the substantive thrust of where we are going with this is not changing.  I do not envisage that changing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cross"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cross for that response, which brings me on to my next set of questions.  I note the language Mr. Cross is using as we look at this practice.  I am very clear I do not trust the insurance industry.  I would not send it out to get a pint of milk for me.  That is the reality.  We know it has been the subject of dawn raids and European investigations and that what is happening here is price gouging.  It is very important that, until this practice is banned, we inform people that they should shop around as renewals come in.  This affects 3.5 million policies between motor insurance and home insurance.  The analysis the Central Bank itself has carried out provided that figure as to the number of those renewing at a higher cost than the actual premium.  Has the Central Bank been able to calculate the additional costs charged to customers every year as a result of this rip-off practice?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Cross mentioned a different approach from that of the FCA.  In developing its view on banning this practice, the FCA considered the pricing policy the Central Bank is putting forward, which differs from the legislation I drafted.  My legislation is more in line with what is happening in the North of Ireland.  Unfortunately, that legislation was stalled for nine months by the Government parties but it just passed Second Stage last week.  The question now is whether the Central Bank has overtaken that Bill, which is what we intended it to do when we made that first complaint.  The Financial Conduct Authority looked at the Central Bank's proposal and said it \"did not consider these options to be appropriate as they would also still allow firms to price walk, only limiting the extent to which they could do so\".<\/p> <p>  That takes me back to my first point, which is that I do not trust this industry.  The issue here is we know the percentage of people renewing motor insurance and home insurance annually is in the region of 80% over all the categories.  No matter what and how much advice is given, for different reasons people will just renew.  They may be too busy, they may forget or they may mean to get to it but not have time.  That is why, as politicians and as the Central Bank, which has a role in consumer protection, we need to step in.  The problem is price walking can still happen, although the duration is shortened.  The increased premium may now only apply in the first year.  We are going to allow insurance companies to charge a reduced premium for the first year to try to hook the customer but they can then substantially increase it in the second year.  I am sure the Central Bank's argument is people should shop around, but the problem is, as I have said, that even though we know the industry is price gouging, 80% of people do not shop around.  Is there therefore not a danger the insurance companies will just do what they have always done but just make the increase more heavily felt in the first-year renewal, resulting in this measure not being of any real benefit?<\/p><p>There will still be a dysfunctional market because there is a legal requirement for people to have motor insurance but what is basically being stated is that every single year they will have to go through this rigamarole.  Discounts are important.  In the North, in three weeks' time people will still be able to get a discount as a new customer.  The only thing is that renewing customers must be afforded the exact same discount.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#C00400","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  There are two or three aspects to that.  One is specifically on the proposal, the reasons for it and whether it is the right one.  The second, which is the heart of the matter, is how we make sure it works and is not circumvented.  That is a really important question.  The third aspect goes to the overall culture within parts of the insurance sector.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the data.  We looked at the data in great detail, as he is aware.  Many of the figures and details on that are set out in our consultation paper and the final report accompanying it.  It shows that although there are definitely significant benefits to policyholders from this ability to get discounts, they are, on balance, outweighed by this aspect of, as we described, price walking.  The benefits are less than the detriments.  It is very important to allow discounts to continue to be effective.  What is crucial, and this goes to the Deputy's point in respect of prices being hiked up in the second year, is that in purchasing their insurance, customers are not tempted in by a misunderstanding of what they are buying or a misunderstanding of the reality of the premiums.  That is why it is really important that in this new regime in respect of new customer discounts it will be clear what the amount of the discount is and what it will go to in year two.  That is the right balance.  The Deputy is correct that this is not a straightforward equation, but we believe that is the right balance to retain the benefits for new customers while being clear that they are not being misled and do not misunderstand the situation.  That can be addressed.<\/p> <p>  The second part of his question, which is enormously important, is how do we ensure this is working as it ought to work.  Of course, that comes down to the insurers.  There is no question about that.  As I stated at the start of the meeting, the insurance sector and insurance firms need to be trustworthy.  That is crucial to the functioning of any financial sector and it is certainly the case for the insurance sector.  It will be our role to supervise this.  We have introduced requirements in our proposals.  The first is that the board and the company will, each year, assess the pricing practices of the company.  We are putting responsibility on the board to check and confirm not only that it is complying with these rules but that, in general, it is complying with pricing practices that respect and prioritise the interests of customers.  We will be supervising that.  We have designed the regulation to be clearly worded in what it demands.  We will be supervising it to ensure it is implemented in spirit and more generally to ensure the interests of customers are prioritised.<\/p> <p>  Third, there is the broader issue of the overall level of behaviour and culture in the insurance sector.  I will be happy to come back to that issue.  It is very high on our agenda and I am happy to say more about how we have supervised and will continue to supervise it and how we are enforcing it.  Ultimately, it is the issue here.  It is one thing solving the price walking issue, which is an important aspect, but, more generally, we wish to ensure the behaviours of the industry are in the interests of policyholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cross"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Cross to address the issue of the overall quantum of price gouging or additional charging that is going on, affecting 3.5 million customers per annum.  Has the Central Bank carried out analysis on that?  The Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, in the UK , in the context of its ultimate ban, which does allow for discounts but no price walking from any year, estimates that a benefit to consumers of up to &pound;11.2 billion as a result of that ban.  Has the Central Bank carried out any type of analysis on that issue?<\/p> <p>  I would not oversell the benefits in terms of the discount, particularly in the context of the motor insurance sector.  The Central Bank's own analysis has shown that the actual premium compared with the technical premium is 0.98, which means it is a reduction, on average, of 2% on the actual premium or the cost of the policy, and that is recouped immediately in year one.  It is a bit more beneficial in the context of home insurance.  My key point, which relates to the last thing Mr. Cross mentioned about behaviours, is that I do not believe that is where people are at.  I do not believe that if a person gets an insurance policy today that is &euro;300 but the company is kind of flagging that it will be &euro;550 next year, the person will be deterred from taking it.  He or she will take it because it is a good offer today.  Unfortunately, we have this behaviour whereby people renew.  We have the same issue in the context of financial institutions, where not enough people are switching and so on.  That is a problem.<\/p> <p> That takes me to the core issue.  These insurance companies are looking at the behaviour of customers.  They are using artificial intelligence and machine learning.  They are doing so in two ways.  One is to try to retain the 20% of customers who switch every year, but they are also looking at pricing levels for the other 80% of customers.  Does the Central Bank have sight of those pricing models, which are repeatedly run through using machine learning to ensure they hit the pinch point or the sweet spot at which the companies can charge at a certain level without losing custom?  Has it been able to go deep into those models?  Can our guests assure us that those models do not discriminate against the elderly, those with disabilities, those who have low levels of financial literacy or those with learning difficulties, for example?  Has the Central Bank done that?  This is an ongoing and very common practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#D00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":232,"content":"<p>My colleague, Mr. Cullinan, may wish to come in on that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cross"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  As part of our deep dive into the differential pricing practices in recent years, we have looked into the so-called propensity models that insurers were using.  We are satisfied that what we are planning to do now will take that kind of discriminatory element out of it.  As the Deputy pointed out, if you renew with the same firm for seven years, you will be charged a higher amount, not necessarily by design but certainly as a result.  That will often discriminate against people who are less in tune with digitalisation.  Where these things work in the main part is on what we call the flow business, that is, where there are high volumes of 3 million policies, as the Deputy pointed out, and as that flows through the system.  There is a need to have those large numbers to really make those propensity models work.  Although we are taking very seriously the representations that have been made to us as part of the consultation process, we believe the proposals we have put forward will strip out many of those practices and ensure the insurers themselves have the responsibly to make sure that any models or artificial intelligence are used appropriately and are ethically sound and in the best interests of customers.

This is how it works.  Perhaps this is not being put into the equation, but undoubtedly what is spitting out from this machine learning is that the sectors I outlined are being targeted with higher premiums.  The problem is that by allowing the first renewal premium to be price-swapped to allow that to happen, the Central Bank is not protecting customers in that regard.<\/p><p>The committee will look at that in a later session.  Time permitting, I would like to come back in on the issue of public liability insurance.  If not, it will be picked up by my colleagues.  I will make two final points now.<\/p><p> The legislation I produced, namely, the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019, was unanimously agreed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 5 of that Act mandates the Central Bank to come forward with a code of practice.  This code of practice would be used by the courts and by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman in regard to cases that would be taken against insurance companies.  When will the Central Bank produce that code of practice?<\/p><p> On business interruption, I have made the point over and over again that the Central Bank has done the bare minimum on business interruption.  We are late to the game here.  Again, I am comparing the Central Bank with what has happened within the FCA.  We are speaking about hundreds of individual policies across Britain and the North of Ireland.  A business person can look at any of the companies and the policy number and identify that this or that policy is affected or has an element of business interruption in it and so he or she would have a valid claim.  The FCA has put a calculator on its website.  When people insert their postcode, it provides information, for example, that there was a Covid case within 25 km, to satisfy the making of a claim.  In Ireland, business people who are fighting all of the different issues in terms of the pandemic are left to fight on their own.  There is no publication by the Central Bank in regard to policies that are covered under business interruption.  In fairness, the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman has anonymised cases and that helps, but the Central Bank has done nothing of that nature.<\/p><p> I would strongly urge the Central Bank to up its consumer protection and to assist these businesses.  It needs to be providing that type of support and level of assistance to businesses.  Why has the bank not done that?  The witnesses are obviously aware of what is happening across the water and in the northern part of this island.  Perhaps they would update the committee on the number of businesses that have been compensated as a result of the interruption caused by the pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#D00600","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Doherty.  On business interruption, I share the Deputy's sense that this is an enormously important issue for businesses, in particular businesses that have been struggling, as we know only too well, with a huge amount of challenge and disruption to their business over the past two years.  Not only do I share that view, we moved very early to ensure our powers and resources were deployed to achieve the optimal outcomes in that context.  On the point regarding the wording, we very quickly engaged across a very large number of types of policy, wording, firms and cover.  We engaged with the firms to see how they were assessing the situation and, on the Deputy's precise point, we looked at the different types of policy wording to consider which policies we thought were clear in their cover and which policies were either strongly supportive of cover or could be considered to be reasonably supportive of cover.  We also identified those which were thought were not supportive of cover.  We engaged with firms very directly in that regard.  We required them to be in contact with their customers and to be acting in line with our expectations.<\/p> <p>  On whether they had the possibility of going to the court on the wording to see whether we were right and the court supported our view, they did.  What we do not have in Ireland, but which does exist in the UK, is the ability for the Central Bank to take a test case in that manner.  We not only provided that level of clarity around the wording, we also made it clear that where cases were being brought, there should be a supportive approach from the insurers and the costs of those bringing those cases should not be in question.  That has been taken through.  As a result of our interventions, some insurers simply fell into line with what we were saying should happen but others, as I said, went to court.  When the court judgment came down in the first part of this year, then all of the insurers fell in line with that and implemented it.  That has resulted in a significant number of payouts.  My colleague, Mr. Cullinan, may have those here and we are happy to share them if the committee so wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cross"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I do have them.

Some 1,809 cases remain open and no payment has been made, and in a further 868 cases an interim payment has been made.  The total amount paid in compensation thus far is &euro;146 million.  We anticipate that the number of claims notified will probably not go up.  We insisted the insurers write to all policyholders to inform there was potential for a claim to be made and that they should submit a claim if they felt they had suffered a loss.  At this point, we do not feel that those 8,642 claims, in terms of numbers, will go up significantly.

The Central Bank has done this work privately with the insurance companies.  That work is to be welcomed.  I recognise there has been a shift since the Central Bank stepped onto the pitch.  The FCA has published and has gone through the courts.  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman has published its findings, which informs business persons of whether they have a valid claim.  I acknowledge the witnesses have recognised this, but we are in the middle of a pandemic that is causing great difficulties for businesses in terms of the continual restrictions on opening and closing.  Many businesses wonder if they will be open in 2022.  It is very difficult for a business to have to make an interruption claim against an insurance firm in a situation where the Central Bank has not pointed to the policy wording that is in scope.  The Central Bank needs to step up in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I also ask that the witnesses come back to me on the issue of the insurance contracts and when the Central Bank proposes to bring forward the code of practice.  One of the provisions of the aforementioned legislation, which is crucial in business interruption, is that the terms of a contract, if ambiguous, have to favour the consumer over the insurance industry.  That is one of the issues the Central Bank is pressing.  That is important legislation, but there is a specific role there such that the Central Bank can assist consumers in their dealings with the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman and the courts but, to date, the Central Bank has not done that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#E00400","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Cross like to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#E00500","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>On the points regarding the business interruption insurance and publication, this is always a tricky area.

First, I would like to know the attitude to companies from outside this jurisdiction coming in here and offering insurance that is often at cut prices and is detrimental to the industry.  In more than one case, companies have returned to their homelands when the damage has been done.  What is the attitude of the Central Bank to that kind of thing?  What is the it to counteract this type of activity?  On the one hand, such activity might be referred to as competition but, on the other, it is not competition if these companies are predatory and decide to leave the jurisdiction afterwards.  What are the effects or perceived effects of this activity and are of these firms left?  Also, is it quite clear across the business sector that business interruption is clearly defined so that everybody knows what it means and if they make an application that they can then assured of a fair and early hearing?<\/p> <p>  In terms of online applications for life cover, I have seen questions that asked the applicant whether he or she had an illness, is being treated for an illness or is visiting a doctor.  Let me outline the problem.  There are cases where an applicant answers the question to the best of his or her ability.  He or she may attend a doctor occasionally and the doctor may have information that he or she has not made available to the patient for a variety of reasons.  There is no variety in the way in which insurance companies react, however.  It is quite clear that because people do not provide the information sought - that is, whether they suffer from a particular illness - and even though a diagnosis might be pending and might not have been conveyed to the patient, the fact that a doctor was involved and knew the nature of the illness means that the spouse of the patient does not get cover.<\/p> <p>  Does the ban on price walking infer a possible increase in insurance cover for motorists or anybody by way of retaliation?  Those are my questions for the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#F00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":243,"content":"<p>My colleague, Mr. Cullinan, will respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cross"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  In terms of passporting in from other jurisdictions, any firm that is licensed within the European Economic Area, EEA, is entitled to passport into any country within the EEA.  That is a matter for the home state regulator.  As indicated in our opening statement, we supervise 200 insurance and reinsurance companies and 70% of their business is actually done outside of Ireland.  So firms operating here have a passport into other jurisdictions.  Equally, there are many firms that passport into Ireland from other jurisdictions.  The vast majority of firms, not in terms of cover provided but certainly in terms of the number of firms, passport in from other jurisdictions.  All of those firms, regardless of whether they are prudentially supervised by the Central Bank or by a counterpart of the Central Bank in another one of the EEA member states, are subject to all of the consumer protection measures, especially the consumer protection code that operates here.  As a result, every policyholder has an equal amount of protection from the local conduct of business rules, as we call them.<\/p> <p>  From a prudential perspective, the Solvency II directive introduced in 2016 is a maximum harmonisation directive.  It sets very high bar in terms of the capital and governance arrangements, etc., that all firms right across the EEA must have in place.  The prudential regime that operates throughout Europe and the local conduct of business rules that operate within Ireland apply to all firms regardless of whether they are prudentially supervised here or in another member state.  That is slightly different from the position that existed prior to 2016, when there was a minimum harmonisation regime and certain minimum standards yet member states were still free to subject entities to different levels of prudential supervision.  However, a complete new risk-based solvency regime was introduced in 2016, which has seen far greater results.  The whole purpose of which is stated in the legislation.  It is there for the protection of policyholders and beneficiaries.  It has brought a new level of protection from the perspective of making sure that firms do not get into difficulty and policyholders can have a degree of confidence with the regime regardless of where a firm is prudentially supervised.<\/p> <p>  In terms of business interruption, as I mentioned earlier, we initially thought that 145,000 policies might be covered.  We whittled the figure down to 31,000.  It would be better if there was a very strong definition for business interruption.  Our understanding is that most firms have now gone out.  I mean that since the crisis happened, firms, when they sought renewal, clarified exactly what is covered under a policy in order to remove any ambiguity that might have existed before that.<\/p> <p>  I must admit that I did not quite grasp the question on life policies, but I will mention a couple of things.  Our understanding is that very few applications for life cover are declined within the jurisdiction.  Some may be deferred or postponed for a period because if somebody is under investigation for a particular sickness, disease or whatever else it might be then the insurer will not put them on cover until such time it has been decided whether there is some risk to mortality for that person.  Our understanding is that even at that, numbers would be quite low.  We will examine the matter if the Deputy supplies further information.  I ask the Deputy to forgive me for not grasping his question.  I am quite interested in hearing about the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Domhnall Cullinan"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan's microphone is on mute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#F00500","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Our guests might comment on price walking and the possibility of an increase in insurance premiums as a result of the ban.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#G00100","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":247,"content":"<p>This is a very important aspect of this.

Our data show that is not an even balance, whereby one goes up and the other goes down in the same ratio, but it is certainly a possibility there will be some increase in the price for new customers, for example.  That is why we have retained the ability to provide discounts for new customers and it is also why it will be very important we continue, as we will, to analyse the impact and effects of this new set of requirements.  It is not only about how firms are implementing it, and this goes back to Deputy Doherty's concerns about it being implemented in spirit and not in a technical way, which is important, but also to assess the overall market impact, given that, clearly, the aim is to ensure the market is not only working fairly but also working well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cross"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":248,"content":"<p>My next question relates to the rangers, as I call them, that provide services from outside the jurisdiction.

As we know in this jurisdiction, it has been problematic at times.  Firms here have been doing precisely as the Deputy described and it has ended badly, as we have seen continuing over a number of years where firms failed and policyholders were left in bad circumstances.  We have seen, for example, the adjustments to the compensation arrangements, which I discussed with the committee at a previous meeting.<\/p> <p>  Nevertheless, this is one of the reasons our participation with our European counterparts, particularly through the EIOPA platforms, were designed precisely to ensure we would be well joined up.

As a member of the European system of financial supervision, with a very large home market of firms that are resident here doing business throughout Europe, it is very important for Ireland, the economy and all of us that the Central Bank be seen as a very credible, high-quality and successful regulator.  I think, although I speak from my own book here a little bit, that is the perception that exists among our colleagues.<\/p> <p>  One aspect that gives us an enhanced voice among our peer organisations in Europe is the fact we integrate not only central banking and financial regulation but also prudential and conduct regulation.  In our engagement throughout Europe, we are able to say that everything we do in the regulation and supervision of firms' resilience, governance, risk management and soundness, as well as their behaviour, conduct and culture, is about the consumer and the policyholder.  That resounds loudly with our European colleagues.  I appeared before the committee a few weeks ago to discuss the individual accountability framework.  That the Central Bank has played such an important role in the development of that concept is an important aspect in discussions we have with our European colleagues.<\/p> <p>  On the definition of \"business interruption\", one of the challenges relates to the fact insurance policies are not standardised.  Companies will choose to cover different types of risks and to deal with risk in different ways.

I agree with Mr. Cross that we are at the forefront of supervision in Europe.  As he said, we are deeply involved in the European supervisory authorities.  However, that is not just simply a thought process on our part.  We are part of and subject to the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, EIOPA, under which we have what we call peer reviews where we review each other's works all the time.  We always come out very much as best in class as part of those reviews.  EIOPA often comes to us, as a small country that has, as Mr. Cross said, a footprint right across Europe and the world, to see what the best practices are it uses us almost as the base case.  That goes some way towards showing where we are in terms of European supervisors.

This is something into which we now have enhanced insight following the collection of the new database we have, the national claims information database, NCID.  This provides us, for the first time, with very detailed information regarding premiums - the costs of insurance for public and employer liability - and in relation to trends in the costs of settling claims, how claims are settled, comparing the different channels through which claims can be settled and, ultimately, the profitability of firms operating in this sector.<\/p> <p>  I will provide the committee with a little of the flavour of what challenges the sector is facing.  First, it has been the case that premiums for public and employer liability have been increasing over recent years.  In fact, premiums are up across that sector by 24% since 2015.  It is not the case that this has corresponded with a period of profit making for this part of the sector.  Indeed, since 2015, the provision of employer and public liability has been a loss-making activity.  Following a number of successive years of losses, the sector returned a modest profit in 2019, the most recent year for which we have data.  <\/p> <p>  The trends we are seeing in the cost of settling, including the process of litigation, are contributing to the higher premiums.  We know that the cost of settling claims is the key determinant of the level of premiums.  Over the entire period, the average cost of claims has increased.  For public liability, the cost has increased by 16% since 2015, while for employer liability, it has increased by 30%.  There is no doubt that is a very important factor behind the increase in premium costs in that sector.<\/p> <p>  In addition, a key element in the cost of claims relates to legal costs.  In relation to legal costs for this type of public and employer liability, the proportion of cases going through litigation has increased from around half in 2015 to around two thirds in 2019.  Many more cases are going through the more expensive legal route.  The combination of the trends of more cases going through litigation and the high contribution of legal costs to claims, and therefore the increase in the cost of claims, is the main factor driving premiums for the sector and has made it extremely challenging.<\/p> <p>  What we do not have are data on businesses that are not able to get insurance.  Naturally, our data only relate to insurance that is provided.  A key alternative issue is the challenges in some sectors where it is difficult to get insurance for various reasons, particularly due to the high risk associated with them, and the potential costs of premiums.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":255,"content":"<p>My colleagues might follow up on some of those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#H00400","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":256,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe as ucht teacht os comhair an choiste.  Many of the questions I intended asking have already been asked.  I will follow up on two issues.  First, in relation to the conversation with my colleague, Deputy Doherty, I am interested in the powers available to the Central Bank.  In Britain, the Financial Conduct Authority is able to take cases instead of consumers.  Does the Central Bank require additional powers to be able to do that?<\/p> <p>  My second question is on personal injuries guidelines.  Since the guidelines came into effect in April, the data from the board shows that the average personal injury award has fallen by 40%.  However, we have not seen that translated into a euro for euro reduction in insurance premiums.  In Britain, when similar guidelines came into effect with respect to whiplash awards, legislation was passed requiring insurers to provide information to the Financial Conduct Authority outlining the average premium since the whiplash guidelines came into effect, the average premium had they not come into affect and the quantum of that reduction in awards which was passed on to consumers in the form of reduced premiums.  Can the national information claims database provide that same level of information?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#H00500","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":257,"content":"<p>On the first question around whether the Central Bank should have additional powers equivalent to those of the FCA, it is always instructive and valuable to look to what others are doing and have done and to see their achievements.  It is also important to look elsewhere to see where challenges have arisen and things may not always work as well as they should.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas to determine the powers of the Central Bank.  My sense is that there is something important about being focused and clear in the mandates of an organisation.  There is great clarity around the importance of the Central Bank regulating insurance and other financial firms so that they serve customers and the economy.  That is very clearly what our focus is.  There is nothing inconsistent with that in what the Deputy described.  However, we will need to always weigh up whether, if we create more tasks and roles, that would potentially detract from the central focus.  That is as much as I would say on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cross"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":258,"content":"<p>Does the Central Bank require extra powers to do what the FCA does?

That is a power specifically provided in the UK legislation.<\/p> <p>  On the personal injury guidelines, as Deputy Farrell said, the very good news is the data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, showing a reduction in compensation as a result of the personal injury guidelines.  It is, of course, early days.  As my colleague, Dr. Cassidy, explained, the settlement channels that are used give very different outcomes in terms of costs.  I hope what we will see is that the implementation of the personal injury guidelines will result both in the reduction in claims costs and a far more predictable use of non-litigation based approaches.<\/p> <p>  The national claims information database will give us a very significant window into how this is feeding through it.  It is not there yet because the data are simply not there yet.  We think it will give us a significant window into understanding how the reduced compensation outcomes driven by the personal injury guidelines are feeding through.  What the NCID will not do is create a sort of counterfactual scenario, as the UK version does.  We will be able to see what is happening and how the data are driving through but we will not be able to see clearly what the data would have been if something had not been the case because the database is very much based on the reality.

The information that we have published so far goes up to 2020, so it does not yet cover the impact of the personal injury guidelines.  We have some tentative evidence.  The Deputy mentioned the main evidence from PIAB, which suggests an initial average reduction in awards of 50%, which is extremely promising.  These are early days, but the less promising evidence is that there has also been a reduction in the rate of acceptance of awards.  Some of the early evidence is that with reduced awards, some claimants are less likely to accept them.  I think that over time, these guidelines will bring good alignment of litigated and personal injury awards.  These will be extremely useful.  We do not have evidence of the impact on premiums.  It will be a number of years before we can disentangle the impact precisely.  We can look at the overall trend of premiums.  Our data only extend to the end of 2020, but we have anecdotal data and data from alternative sources such as the CSO, which show that premiums continued to decline during 2021.  From our current collection of data, which will relate to 2021, we will be able to compare settlement costs before and after the introduction of the new guidelines.<\/p> <p>  I concur with what Mr. Cross said.  The UK does not have anything similar to the national claims information database, NCID.

It is more difficult to attribute a change in premiums to any single factor, such as a change in personal injury guidelines.  To give a specific example, in 2021, there was a pre-existing trend of declining premiums that we think would have continued regardless of any external factors.  Covid has had a positive impact on the profitability of banks because there have been fewer claims.  We expect this will be passed on to some extent in the form of lower premiums.  There is also the impact of judicial guidelines.  It is difficult to disentangle what part of the decline in premiums is due to a pre-existing trend, what is a Covid effect, and what relates to the personal injury guidelines.

If we are looking at motor insurance, for example, seven out of the eight largest motor insurance providers in the State are the same as seven of the eight largest motor insurance providers in Britain.  When the costs of whiplash were reduced by legislation there, the companies, including AIG, AXA, Allianz, Aviva and Zurich, all the same companies that operate here, were mandated to provide information to the Financial Conduct Authority to state what premium they are charging today and what premium they would have charged the same customer if it was not for the reduction in rewards.  Unfortunately, we will now have to fiddle around with the national claims information database, look at premiums that are reducing, and figure out whether it was because of Covid, trends in increasing investment income as we move out of lower returns, or if it was actually because of awards.  That is the crucial point.  There is no way that that can be determined, unless the insurance industry provides its own algorithms and costings, which have to be independently audited as a result of what happens in Britain.  Is that type of information not the only way that we can really verify that, euro-for-euro, pound-for-pound?<\/p> <p>  The industry came into the room that I am sitting in, sat over there, and told us that it wants us to legislate to cut awards.  We delivered on that.  The Judiciary delivered on that.  The insurance industry is pocketing the money.  Businesses are not seeing any reduction.  Motorists see some reduction but not at the scale that the CEOs of those companies told us they would delivery.  Some of the reduction that is being seen in motor insurance is because there are fewer accidents, since there are fewer cars on the roads with the restrictions that are in place.  Surely we need a new data source that is verifiable and independently audited if we are ever to be able to actually say that the reduction as a result of the personal injury guidelines has been passed on euro-for-euro, or that 90% or 80% of it has been passed on?

As I said to Deputy Farrell, it is possible to say that we will create a new data source, put new obligations on the sector and have new activities in the Central Bank.  That is one option.  All that I would say is that, over the last three years, we have built something unique, the national claims information database, at the behest and valuable impetus of this committee.  It is a rich and comprehensive set of data about the performance of the sector and what is or is not happening.  It is a question for members as legislators.  Is it best to use the existing technique, which will give an awful lot of information, or do we want to create something separate?

Some of the commentary from the Central Bank in the latter part of this is in that space.  I have agreed with much of the assessment.  I really feel for businesses.  If we look at employers' liability and public liability insurance, the cost of claims has reduced substantially since 2015.  It has reduced for the last four years.  The number of people who are claiming has reduced substantially for the last years.  I have the figures here.  There was &euro;203 million in claims in 2015, which was down to &euro;161 million in 2019.  The number of claims reduced from 5,200 to 4,900.  Public liability claims have gone down from 10,000 to 8,700.  Those have reduced but the businesses are not seeing the reduction in awards.  On top of that, we have slashed the awards.  The awards going through PIAB have been slashed by 40%.  There are legal challenges at the courts.  The courts are holding firm.  This was agreed in April.  We are nine months on and businesses are not seeing the reduction.  The Alliance for Insurance Reform is doing a survey.  Nothing is happening with employers' liability and public liability insurance.<\/p><p>These guys are just filling their boots.  The cost of awards and the number of people making claims for the insurance industry are going down.  The industry's profits are going up and the only cost going up is the re-insurance.  Re-insurance over the past five years has gone from 4% in the five years previous to that, to approximately 8% or 9% in the past five years, which is basically paying their mothership or parent company.  It is a way for the industry to shift money and look as though it is not as healthy as it is.<\/p><p> This is very frustrating and where the Central Bank needs to step in.  I would like to know, as I am sure businesses would, what the Central Bank will do about this?  Everybody has delivered, from the Oireachtas and the Judiciary, to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, and all the rest, but the insurance companies are not delivering.  A comment was made about high claim costs and litigation, but it should be remembered that litigation only makes up 3% to 4%, depending on whether one is talking employers liability or public liability that is settled in the court.  Approximately 63% of cases, in one category, are settled outside the court.<\/p><p> The insurance companies are the ones guilty of this.  They settle claims that they know, in some cases, are exaggerated or in others are bogus, but they settle them because it is easier for them.  They can take the reserves they had for that claim back in profitability.  It makes them and their quarterly and annual reports look good and they get more bonuses.  However, who suffers?  It is the people who see their premiums going up because a bogus claim was settled.  We can talk about PIAB and the judgment that judges make, but they are tiny compared to what happens by the insurance industry, either on the steps of the court or settling cases because it is easier to settle than to challenge through the system.<\/p><p> I want to make a last point, because I know the Chair is very generous-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#J00700","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":268,"content":"<p>We have to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120800002#K00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":269,"content":"<p>It is something I will be in communication with the Central Bank on.

I do not have time to turn to my colleague on this, but data from the national claims information database, NCID, on employers and public liability shows profitability is not at a high level and it is a difficult area for the firms.

One of the points we have made in the past, and it is an issue we have worked very hard on, is to ask any constituents or customers listening who are in financial difficulty to please engage with us.  I have previously quoted this figure, but we have found that in four out of five cases we have been able to support customers to get them to a performing basis and remain in a home they can afford to be in.  We have done that very much on an individual basis and by reviewing customers, because they all have very different circumstances, on a case-by-case basis to see how we can come up with something that works for them and the bank.  That has continued.  We have continued to support customers throughout all of this year.  In the majority of cases, we are still finding that we are able to help customers get on to a performing basis and, therefore, take the worry of having a non-performing loan away from them.<\/p><p>We provided the committee with some details more recently on non-performing loans.  Our figures for 30 September give a non-performing loan ratio of just over 4%.  We had roughly 5,300 customers whose loans were categorised as non-performing.  We saw that number reduce throughout 2021 as we moved customers to performing status.  Customers should engage with us because we are keen to help them to get to performing status.  In this way, they can be included in any transaction we are making.  There will come a time when we will have customers whom we cannot move to performing status and when we will have to deal with the non-performing loan sale.

I understand that this is the same as what Ms Howard is saying.  The core processes involve the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, and the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP.

We are not going to start that directly with customers until the new year.  We launched the campaign and began conversations with stakeholders and industry at the end of October.  We want to start having conversations, particularly in branches, with our most vulnerable customers and customers who are reliant on the branch primarily for their banking needs.  Their requirements are possibly longer and more complicated than other customers who may find it very easy to switch digitally or whatever their options will be.  We have started to have those conversations throughout our branch network to ensure our most vulnerable customers, and indeed all of our customers, are aware of what is coming, the changes that are coming and what that means for them.  When our branch colleagues meet these customers, they can have those sorts of conversations and provide that kind of support.<\/p> <p>  In 2022, we will go above the line, for want of a better phrase, with this campaign in terms of marketing and direct communication with customers.  We will be very clear in terms of the timelines customers have.  There will be a six-month window to make the changes that are required.  Currently, the code is 60 days.  We are going to extend that to six months.  We will be making multiple contacts with customers within that window so they are very clear as to what is expected and when.  We will do that on a phased and rolling basis so that we are spreading it out in a logical sense in order that we can continue to serve customers appropriately as we make these changes.

The momentous referendum to repeal the eighth amendment marked a necessary and important shift in how Ireland responds to women&rsquo;s healthcare.  We will be looking at the review of the legislation today.  As many here, and indeed those joining us remotely, will know, the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 commenced on 1 January 2019.  Under section 7 of the Act, a review of the operation of the legislation must be initiated within three years of the commencement of the Act.<\/p><p>As the Chairman said, I am joined today by Ms Geraldine Luddy from the Department of Health.  She is the lead official on this work.<\/p><p>The main purpose of the Act of 2018 is to set out the law governing access to termination of pregnancy in Ireland.  It permits terminations to be carried out in cases where there is a risk to the life or of serious harm to the health of the pregnant woman, including in an emergency; where there is a condition present which is likely to lead to the death of the foetus either before or within 28 days of birth; and without restriction up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.  The review clause was included in the Act in order to facilitate monitoring of the impact, operation and effectiveness of the legislation in practice, as well as of the delivery of services.  I am progressing the review this year in line with statutory and Government commitments.  The terms of reference are published today and, as part of the first phase of the review, I am initiating a public consultation on the operation of the Act.<\/p><p>As I stated previously, an independent chair will be appointed to lead the review.  I know from consultation with stakeholders that this is something that matters a great deal to many people with an interest in the operation of the Act and, therefore, in this review.  Phase 1 of the review will capture information on the operation of the Act from the perspective of women who access the service, healthcare professionals who deliver the service and the public.  There are three strands of work to phase 1.<\/p><p>Phase 2 of the review will be led by an independent chair who will assess the extent to which the objectives of the Act have been achieved, analysing in that regard the findings of the three strands of information from phase 1 on the operation of the Act.  The chair will assess the extent to which the Act&rsquo;s objectives have and have not been achieved and will make recommendations to address any barriers identified.  The chair will also draw on the findings of other relevant peer-reviewed research and consult further with stakeholders and experts as necessary before providing conclusions and any recommendations next year.<\/p><p>It is important to say that, in the first instance, the review will focus on the operation of the legislation rather than on the policy underlying the Act.  It will be informed by three streams from phase 1 to determine whether the operation of the legislation is appropriate and effective.  Most important are women&rsquo;s experiences of termination of pregnancy services and their views on how the system has operated since it commenced on 1 January 2019.  That will be a critical source of information for the review.  The review will draw on the large research study commissioned by the HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme on unplanned pregnancy and abortion care, which is being led by<font color=\"#212100\"> Dr. Catherine Conlon.<\/font><\/p><p>The review will also gather the views of those involved in providing termination of pregnancy services in community and acute settings in across the country.  We will commission independent qualitative research on the service provider perspective through the eTenders Government procurement process.  That tender will issue today and the research will include input from hospitals and GP surgeries providing termination of pregnancy services, from individual medical practitioners, medical colleges, midwives and counsellors, as well as any other relevant service provider stakeholders who may be identified.  I note that the list I have given there is not definitive.  We are going to be as inclusive as possible in all three strands.<\/p><p>A public consultation will also be launched to provide members of the public, interest groups or any other interested parties an opportunity to submit their views for consideration in the review.  The public consultation will be launched today on the Department of Health website.  <\/p><p>Once the review has been completed by the chair, and we will issue a tender for this appointment in the coming days, a final report will be submitted to me, as Minister.  I plan to submit the report to Government with a request that it is immediately referred to the Joint Committee on Health for discussion.  I look forward to hearing and will welcome the committee&rsquo;s views on the findings from the first phase, where a lot of information will be gathered, and from the second phase where we will get recommendations and analysis from the chair.  It will then be for the Government and the health committee to discuss and identify how we might want to proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120800002#A00300","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":373,"content":"<p>Before I bring in the committee members, will the Minister clarify for the committee members and people listening to proceedings at home, his understanding or interpretation of this three-year review of the Act?

I can certainly share some of the facts and figures we have been going through, and I might ask Ms Luddy to come in on this.<\/p> <p>  We have seen a significant reduction in the number of women travelling to the UK.  For those of us who were involved in the advocacy and the Bill, one of the big questions we had was whether this would move provision of service from being mainly in the UK to mainly in Ireland.  The number of women travelling versus the number of terminations provided here suggest that the objective has largely been achieved.  However, there are still a number of women who are travelling and that, for example, would be one of the matters that would be covered in this review.  Why are they travelling?  Why do they feel the need to travel?  Is the legislation operating as well as it should?  Questions will be raised around the geographic coverage because it is the case that not all maternity hospitals are providing the service.  A relatively small percentage of GPs are providing the service and I know there are geographic difficulties, for example.<\/p> <p>  I will get into any detail the Deputy would like, but without trying to prejudge it.  In aggregate, on the main objectives we were trying to achieve, we can certainly point to a huge reduction in the number of women leaving the country.

As I was saying, there are three elements to this.  Element 1 is a public consultation launched today.  The public consultation will provide organisations, stakeholders, advocacy groups working in the area and, indeed, all other interested parties the opportunity to inform the review of the operation of the legislation.  Information on the consultation should at this point be on the Department of Health's website - apologies if it is not.  It will be advertised in newspapers and through digital advertising in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  The second strand of phase 1 is service users - a detailed examination of the views and the experiences of women and their partners.  This is arguably the most important part of the first phase.  Research to inform this strand from service users is being carried out, as I was saying, by Dr. Catherine Conlon.  Dr. Conlon is progressing a large qualitative study to investigate unplanned pregnancy and abortion care.  The study was commissioned by the HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme.  Our intention is that it will generate an in-depth understanding of the experiences of women who have accessed abortion services since the commencement of the Act.  Part of that, which I have discussed with Members of the Oireachtas previously in preparing the review, we all agreed is important is that the voices of women are heard and form part of this review.<\/p> <p>  The third strand of the first phase of the consultation is a tender for service provider research.  Today, a request for tender to carry out the research into the views of service providers is being published on eTenders.  The following are the objectives of this strand.  The first is to examine the arrangements put in place to implement the Act, including, but not confined to, service provision in the community setting and service provision in the acute hospital setting.  The second is to gather and analysis data from service provider stakeholders to describe their experiences and observations on the operation of the service under the Act in order to provide a comprehensive description of providing services under the Act.  The third is to assess the impacts of the Act's operation on access to termination of pregnancy services in the country taking into account the level of service provision before commencement of the Act, figures on Irish women - or women in Ireland rather - accessing termination in this country and in other jurisdictions, service provision in Ireland in comparison with service provision in other countries in Europe and beyond, and any other factors that are relevant.<\/p><p> The fourth objective is to identify difficulties in providing services associated with provision in the Act that have expressed by stakeholders and, critically, to highlight possible solutions to address any such difficulty, for example, approaches taken in other countries as appropriate.  The next objective is to assess from the service provision perspective the extent to which the Act's objectives have not been achieved and to make recommendations to address barriers.  This, for example, would go to precisely the points Deputy Durkan has just raised.  The final objective is to explore and weigh the evidence for and against any proposed change to the Act from the service provider's perspective, to provide conclusions based on the research findings and to draft suggestions and appropriate follow-up measures.  This is the first phase.<\/p><p> The second phase is the appointment of the independent chair who will assess the extent to which the objectives of the Act have been achieved.  The chair will analyse in this regard the findings of the three strands of information and the operation of the Act from phase 1, which I have just covered.  As well as this, the chair will draw on findings of other relevant peer-reviewed research and will consult further with stakeholders as necessary before providing conclusions and recommendations to me next year.<\/p><p> The chair will be appointed following a procurement process.  I have asked the officials to ensure a tender is issued in the next two weeks.  It had been my intent to appoint a chair directly but I was informed a procurement process is necessary for the work.  This is unfortunate as we had identified a number of excellent candidates and I would much rather be announcing a chair today.<\/p><p> There will be some overlap with the terms of reference from phase 1 and the terms of reference for the chair, as the committee would expect.  I will read through them.  The terms of reference for the independent chair are to: assess the extent to which the objectives of the Act have been achieved, analysing in this regard the findings and outcomes of the three strands of information from phase 1; assess the extent to which the Act's objectives have not been achieved and to make recommendations to address the barriers if any are uncovered; assess the impact of the Act's operation on access to termination services in the country, taking into account the level of service provision before commencement of the Act, figures on women in Ireland accessing terminations in Ireland and other jurisdictions, and any other factors that may be relevant; examine the arrangements put in place to implement the Act including but not confined to service provision in the community setting and service provision in the acute hospital setting; and provide a final review report with recommendations as appropriate.<\/p><p> I can also go into the methodology if it would be useful to members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120800002#C02700","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":430,"content":"<p>It would be more useful if we could get a copy of the terms of reference.

I think we spent a lot of time discussing what was meant by the word \"examination\", for example.  During the Covid pandemic, that was relaxed.

It is still not on the website and we have still not received the email.  If the Minister is responsible for posting to the Department's website, the country is in a serious pickle.  The Department has a highly paid Secretary General whose job is to administer this - more highly paid than any other civil servant in the country.  The Minister needs to have a stern conversation when he returns to the plaza.  It is not good enough.  I hold the Minister responsible for it politically.  Everyone will hold him responsible for it.

The Minister had hoped to appoint an independent chair.  He said some very good names had come across his desk or had been identified for the position.  Is it correct that this needs to go to an eTenders procurement?  What is the tender process?  The Taoiseach has asked the Attorney General to review the entire planning law system in the country and has given him and his office the required resources to do it and a timeline in which to report.  Very significant resources have been allocated for that purpose.  What is prohibiting the Minister from doing this.  This is the only issue I see with tenders.<\/p><p>I am not being trite but, for example, with tenders for school buildings it is not necessarily the best builder or contractor who gets the job.  It is the one who comes in with the lowest price.  What criteria are there on the tendering position?  I am a bit flummoxed, as I am sure the Minister is.  He has stated he would like to have been in a position to appoint someone.   I would have trusted him politically with that appointment.

What came back strongly across the board was an ask for an independent chair.  Often the advice I have is that if the operation of legislation is being looked at, typically the line Department would take that on and it would be considered a normal part of its job.  Departments have the competency required to investigate legislation.

We have been looking for this session to take place for some months and it is the eleventh hour in terms of the timescale within which the Minister is legally required to arrange the review.  We are up against it and in the last three or four weeks before the legal deadline.  The preparation for this meeting in terms of the information provided has been unsatisfactory and getting the terms of reference an hour into the meeting makes if difficult to consider them.  Some members had to ask their questions before we got them.  I am unhappy with the way the Department has handled this.  It ties our hands very much.<\/p> <p>  It is a strange way to go about a review where the terms of reference are determined, the first phase of review is under way and the chair of the review is only being appointed to deal with the second phase.  Generally in a well-arranged review, a chair would be identified and consulted on the terms of reference, scope and phasing of the review.  It is a mistake that so many key decisions were taken by the Minister or somebody unknown in the Department.  There is the potential to tie the hands of the review and the independent chair.  That is poor practice.  The chair should have been the first person appointed.  I expected the Minister to announce the name of the chair today and I think most people expected that.  It is hard to understand why he is delaying that until a later phase in the review.  <\/p> <p>  On the appointment of the chair, it is important that person be totally independent and have relevant experience in sexual and reproductive health and a background in human rights.  The Minister has said he agrees with that approach.  Will he provide us with the criteria that will apply in terms of the necessary qualities, experience and expertise of that person, which, presumably, have been set out in the invitation to tender?<\/p> <p>  The other important point is who will be on the selection panel to select the person.  All of these stages are key and essential to know about in terms of the likely outcome of the review and to ensure it is objective.  Will the Minister provide us with details of the selection panel?<\/p> <p>  It is standard practice in a good review process that an independent chair is appointed and there is an advisory panel to support him or her.  It is a long and wide-ranging review.  Who will advise the independent chair?

I share her frustration about this morning.  I do not believe this is how it should have worked.

I accept the committee's frustration on that point.<\/p> <p>  The terms of reference were informed by stakeholder engagement.   If memory serves, the Deputy was on the Oireachtas briefing.

Rather it is my intention the chair would be appointed relatively early during phase 1 and would be able to inform phase 1.

There should be an experienced advisory panel there to support the chair.<\/p> <p>  My next point relates to what the Minister said in his opening statement, namely, that the review will focus on the operation of the legislation rather than on the policy underlining the Act.

Does the same apply to service users?  If service users identify problems with the substance of the Act, will those recommendations be taken on board?  When it comes to a review, the standard practice is that the operation is reviewed and any policy changes recommended that arise on foot of the review.  Is the Minister open to that?

If we get feedback that suggests the operation of it needs to be changed, that regulation or policy needs to be changed or that the legislation needs to be changed, absolutely, that is in scope.

There is much anxiety that the timeline for the review is poor because the Act states a review shall take place within three years.  Therefore, on 1 January 2022 we should have been looking at the review of it.  Given that will not be taken place for some time, starting with the process today, advertising for the chair and publishing the terms of reference, the Minister has said it could be April before the chair is appointed and it could be the summer or the autumn before the results of phase 1 are collated and known to us.  We need clarity on the timeline.  It is all right for us as politicians to sit wondering about these things but in the meantime many anxious women are waiting for changes, support and recognition of the difficulties they face, and the same applies to service providers.  To say the least, this is very sloppy but the timeline is very worrying.  Perhaps the Minister or Ms Luddy could come back to us with a definite parameter of when we will have publication of the review of the Health (Regulation of the Termination of Pregnancy) Act, the finished product.  We should not say it could be the summer or the autumn because then we are saying it could be June or October, given that, technically, October is in the autumn.<\/p><p>That is way too long for people to have to wait.<\/p><p> I wish to return to the issue of the appointment of the chairperson.  It bothers me that there is a need to e-tender because of the costs involved.  For people on the receiving end of the restrictions of this legislation, the human experience and the medical experience and how those can be improved are what really matter.  The Minister stated that the costs involved could be up to &euro;100,000.  I cannot figure out how he has reached that conclusion or decided that those are the criteria on which he has to tender out.  I am very worried that his desire to appoint a chairperson has been interfered with on the basis of the costs.  How are those costs configured or how do they arise as an issue?<\/p><p> An issue I have been asked to raise by all of the groups is that of the appointment an expert panel.  Deputy Shortall touched on this issue.  Would it not have made the whole thing more manageable if the Minister appointed a chairperson and an expert panel with all the necessary expertise on reproductive rights, human rights and the provision of services so that there are experts feeding in to the chairperson rather than the chairperson having to be an amazing person who is an expert on all of these areas?  Could that decision be revisited?  By revisiting it, we would have a better and broader review of the legislation and its operation and we would also have a fairer process in terms of knowing that what is coming out of it will be genuinely dealt with.  To appoint only one person to deal with this is quite cumbersome and it confers on that person a significant number of powers and rights over and above what would be the case if there were to be a group of experts.  It has not yet been mentioned, but the WHO guidelines were part of what we considered in the lead-up to the legislation.  The WHO guidelines and the international experience have to be taken into consideration, so that is another talent this one expert chairperson will need to have, as well as medical, legal and other expertise.<\/p><p> The question of who could be appointed is very open to interpretation.  The explanation given by the Minister in respect of why his choices in the context of appointing a chairperson were prevented from being implemented is a bit weak.  I ask him to go over that again, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120800002#G01900","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  In terms of the timeline, to be clear, the requirement in the Act is that the review is commenced within three years.  It is not required to be concluded within three years; it is required to be commenced in that timeframe.  As to whether it will be April before a chairperson is appointed, it will not.  A chairperson will be appointed early in the new year and will be involved as quickly as possible in phase 1 as well.<\/p> <p>  We are going out to tender because the advice I have from the Department is that there is a legal requirement to do so, given the likely quantum of money involved. <\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked a really important question regarding whether summer or autumn will be too long to wait.  Obviously, there are people waiting for this.  We have to try to strike a balance.  The report has to be meaningful and my view is that for that to happen the consultation must be meaningful and comprehensive.  We need to consult widely with the public and service providers and, most important, with the women themselves.  Doing that in a meaningful manner takes time.  We then need to leave time for the chairperson to absorb all that information and make recommendations.  We are trying to find a balance to make sure there is sufficient time for this to a very meaningful review.  Our estimate is summer or autumn.<\/p> <p>  As regards expertise, I fully agree that the chairperson, whoever he or she is, will not have all the expertise required.  I doubt anybody has all the expertise that is required.  As such, it is my intention that the chairperson will have access to the expertise he or she deems necessary.  Should we call it an advisory panel or an expert panel?  I have no issue with that at all.  The most important thing is that no one is expecting this one person to be able to be across all of these complex issues.  Will we have a multidisciplinary approach?  We will.  Will the chairperson have access to the expertise he or she deems required?  Absolutely, he or she will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120800002#H00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I ask the Chair to bear with me for another few questions.  The issue of whether a chairperson can have access to the expertise or, alternatively, an expert panel is appointed and we know who they are, their background and contribution to this process matters to service providers and users.  We need to review that and consider the appointment of an expert panel.  I am totally dissatisfied with e-tendering for a chairperson.  We should know today who that chairperson is.  My office has been searching for published criteria or an e-tender for the position of chairperson.  The Minister stated that is being published today.  Perhaps the civil servants who are present could circulate that information as well as the documents members have just received.<\/p> <p>  There are issues the legislation has not dealt with that are really important, such as safe zones.  One of the chill factors on doctors providing the services is that of protests and intimidation at doctors' clinics or homes or affecting their families, or, indeed, intimidation of users of the service.  The issue of safe access zones needs to be dealt with.  It has not been mentioned.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, the issue of extending the provision of access to free contraception has not been mentioned.  It is fine that it is coming in for women up to the age of 25, but women do not stop being reproductive or sexually active at the age of 25.  They may still be very poor and unable to afford the type of contraception they need.  That needs to be considered.<\/p> <p>  One of the key recommendations of the committee that is not in the legislation is the consideration of non-ethos-based sex education.  There is no sign of that coming from the State.  It is clearly connected with the question of crisis pregnancy and how we deal with the entire sector.<\/p> <p>  I ask the Minister to address my questions on safe zones, non-ethos-based sex education and the extension of the provision of free contraception to cohorts over the age of 25.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120800002#H00300","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  As regards the e-tender criteria, I will ask the Department to circulate those criteria.  I fully share the frustration in this regard.  There is nothing I would like more than to be able to just appoint the chairperson and get on with the work, so I share the frustration.  However, I am advised that it is a legal requirement for public procurement and, as such, all our hands are tied, unfortunately.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy can correct me if I am wrong but, from memory, three policy areas were discussed that were due to happen as part of the Act.  She mentioned safe zones, free contraception and sex education.  Two of them fall within my remit and one falls within the remit of the Minister for Education.  I can assure the Deputy that the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, is considering that issue and taking it very seriously.  The Deputy will be aware that I am acting on both the issues that fall within my remit.  Legislation in respect of safe access zones has been tabled for priority drafting.  That is happening at the moment.  The heads of Bill are being drafted by the Department.  There is an ongoing conversation with the Office of the Attorney General.  It is my intention to produce the heads of Bill as early as possible, get Government agreement on that, engage with the Committee on Health and legislate to that effect.  I will revert later to the committee with timelines in that regard.  It is a priority.<\/p><p> Free contraception has been spoken about for some time.  As the Deputy will be aware, I have allocated a significant sum to next year's budget to bring this in.  It is historic; this has not happened before.  We are starting with certain age groups.  The advice we have received, and it is what we have seen other countries do, is to start with particular age groups.  It is my intention to phase it for universal access in the coming years, as we increase the budget for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120800002#H00400","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":510,"content":"<p>On a point of information, the legislation states: &ldquo;The Minister shall, not later than 3 years after the commencement of this section, carry out a review of the operation of this Act.&rdquo;  Arguably, the review should have been carried out within that three-year period.

We have no idea what will come out of this, but let us say we were to hear from service providers that they struggled to be able to ascertain exactly when 12 weeks was and, for example, the GPs were nervous about going to 12 weeks and were therefore tending to err on the side of much more conservative judgments in terms of the length of the pregnancy, there might be recommendations emerging from that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120800002#K00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I appreciate that starting point, but I just wished to establish, for people watching and so forth, that if they were to come from this, the Minister is happy to give the commitment that he will be proposing that legislation or that he will lead off on that as the Minister for Health.

From how this process has been talked about from the beginning, many people felt that it was going to go beyond the operational.  I appreciate that the Minister is coming at it as a start point and that it may evolve from that, but I believe that many people were under the impression that it would include policy.  I wanted to put that forward.  I accept that the Minister has his starting point and that is fine.<\/p><p>I have a question about the consultation.  The Minister said the closing date will be 1 April.  What measures will the Department of Health take to ensure the consultation is fully accessible to enable all stakeholders to engage and contribute?  I refer to migrant women, Traveller women and disabled people.  The Minister says there will be advertisements and the like, but will a vigorous and strategic approach be taken?  Not everybody has access and not everybody will be able to engage in the public consultation <i>per se<\/i>.  Perhaps the Minister will speak a little on that.<\/p><p>I will fly through the questions so the Minister can answer them rather than go back and forth.  The Minister said he had to go through the public tender for the chair.  When did he realise the sums of money that were going to be involved?  It seems a little mad that this amount of money is being spent but the chair will not be <i>in situ<\/i>from the beginning.  It seems as if this is not a process that is going to be led by an independent chair.  It appears that it will be more a Department of Health-led process, which is the Minister's prerogative, with the chair being brought in at a later date.  The Minister mentioned that the chair could change or review the terms of reference.  This seems to be a slightly topsy-turvy way to do things, and I appreciate that this is not how the Minister wanted to do things.  However, this process has been known about, discussed and planned for over a year, so at what point did the Minister realise that it was going to have to go to public tender?  How close to today did he figure that out?<\/p><p>I refer to the advisory group.  Many people and groups have called for an advisory group.  To follow up on Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's point, access to expertise is very different from access to an expert advisory panel.  I reiterate that point.  A great deal of pressure is being put on someone so I believe that having that expert advisory panel would be very worthwhile.<\/p><p>There are two brief final points.  How did the terms of reference come about?  For example, the Abortion Rights Campaign and Lawyers for Choice put together suggested terms of reference based on legal international best practice.  How did the Minister arrive at his terms of reference?  It is very important that the terms of reference allow for an open and transparent process because we want our legislation to be in line with international best practice and best practice for pregnant women who will need to use abortion services.<\/p><p>On my final point, the Minister continually refers to peer-reviewed research.  It is worth noting that many voluntary organisations such as the National Women's Council and the Abortion Rights Campaign would not have the same access to peer review panels as academic researchers would.  Similarly, the WHO report is very rigorous but it has not gone through academic peer review yet.  While I am all for academic vigour and peer review, many experts who work in this area in Ireland will not have access to that.  Groups such as the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, and Well Woman Centre have done a huge amount of research and it would be great if that research was not excluded because it does not come through an academic lens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120800002#K00500","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for those questions.

As I said, it is as frustrating for me as it is for all members of the committee, but if we have legal obligations in respect of procurement we must adhere to them.  Will this be led by the Department of Health?  No, it will not.  That is not to say that the Department of Health does not have expert people who can be involved in this.  It does, and it would be normal for line Departments to review the operation of legislation.  It is a core competence of any Department, but as I said earlier, a request was made to me during the initial consultation process and I wanted to make sure that we set this up right.  One of the things I heard loud and clear was that people wanted an independent chair and that they wanted the independent chair to have a rights-based lens.  Obviously, the chair must have some legal expertise as well.  That is what I have acted on.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the terms of reference, they are very much informed by the stakeholder consultation we conducted.  I would have to check to be absolutely sure but I am pretty sure that all the civil society groups the Senator mentioned were represented in the civil society meeting we had.  The terms of reference, the independent chair, the access to expertise and the wide consultation are all being informed by the Oireachtas meeting on that, and the Senator will have been at that and she can correct me if I am wrong.  I hope, because we have gone to a great deal of trouble to try to ensure it, that the Senator, other Members of the Oireachtas, civil society and the service providers will see that what they said to us earlier is reflected in the terms of reference.  Everyone will not see everything.  There were conflicting views on some of them, so we have tried to create the terms of reference that best reflect the conversations we had.<\/p> <p>  As regards an advisory panel, I have no objection to an advisory panel.  The important thing is not so much that there is an advisory panel but that the chair has the best access to expertise that he or she believes he or she needs, be it in constitutional law, genetic screening or whatever it may be, and that we will facilitate that in the way that works best for the review and the chair.<\/p> <p>  I wish to be very clear about peer-reviewed research.

On the first question with regard to the expert panel, I can give the Senator a commitment that I am open to whatever works, be that an expert panel, a formal panel, an informal panel, a domestic panel, an international panel and so on.  We need to make sure that the chairperson has access to the expertise that is required.  That might be partly informed by, for example, the information coming back through phase 1.  There will undoubtedly be issues raised.  There may be issues of constitutional requirements or with regard to legal requirements in the UK, in which case the chairperson would want to find somebody who could provide that expertise, who we might not put on an initial panel.  I am open to it, but more broadly, what I want to give is a commitment that we will facilitate whatever gives the best result.  That might be a formal standing panel, an informal panel with a bit of flexibility in terms of being able to add people, etc., or it might just be informal consultation.

His interpretation is exactly correct in terms of what this review about.  What is not in scope of this review is consideration of whether the three-day waiting period is right or wrong, whether it should be five days, one day or not there at all.  That was a matter that was discussed in detail and ultimately decided by the Oireachtas.  There were very clear heads of Bill published before the referendum so that people knew what they were voting for.  Similarly, the 12-weeks was in the heads of the Bill and when people were voting in the referendum, they were very clear that that is something they were voting for.  It was something that was then decided upon and voted upon by the Oireachtas.  It is not in scope of this review to say that other countries provide for six weeks or 16 weeks and we are recommending a move to that.  That is not in scope.  These are matters that have been decided.<\/p> <p>  What is in scope is how these things are being operationalised.  I will give an example in regard to both provisions.  On the three-days, it was agreed during Covid that an in-person consultation was not possible for infection prevention and control reasons and so remote consultation with the GP was facilitated.  The three-days was not up for consideration, but how it was operationalised was.  This review could, for example, look at that and consider if, operationally, there are ways that the three days is working, is not working and are there potentially changes required.  The policy question as to the waiting period is not in scope.<\/p> <p>  Similarly then for the 12 weeks, it is not in scope for the policy question to be looked at in terms of it being 12 weeks, six weeks or 16 weeks.  What is in scope would be if, as part of the consultations, women or services providers, for example, GPs, said that they were really nervous about the 12 weeks and so what they are tending to do is provide the services where they think the pregnancy is probably around eight or nine weeks, which gives a safety margin in terms of the 12 weeks.  That clearly is an operational issue because the policy position is 12 weeks.  If it turned out that women were not getting the service up to 12 weeks because the GPs were genuinely concerned and were then airing much earlier, then that is an operational issue that could be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120800002#M01000","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":566,"content":"<p>That is fine.

I know it has been said again and again but the teams in all our offices are doing the Lord's work trying to find and parse documents live as the meeting proceeds, which is exceedingly difficult.  I appreciate that problems sometimes arise but it is incredibly difficult for members to do this.  We want to get the best out of this meeting and engage with the Minister.  People are firing in links on WhatsApp messages.  That is not a good way for the Joint Committee on Health to do business on such a serious issue, or any issue for that matter.<\/p> <p>  When I asked about targeting particular groups I meant to ask about how women and pregnant people who have had to travel will be engaged with.  Will there be engagement with maternity hospitals?  They will have spoken to people who have had to travel.  Continuity of care is very different between different maternity hospitals.  Will there be an active attempt to engage with those who have had to travel?  The Minister said he is concerned about the numbers still travelling and that it is a problem.  How will we engage with those people?  We assume people are engaged digitally.  Will it be done through maternity hospitals?  Will there be a direct call to GPs?  Will Well Woman clinics and the Irish Family Planning Association be reached out to directly?<\/p> <p>  This matter has gone out for public consultation and there are terms of reference.  We are circling back to the business of the chair.  Has the decision to that before the appointment of a chair pre-empted, neutered or hampered the work the chair can do?  The questions have gone out for public consultation.  Perhaps the expert, on whom we may spend up to a &euro;100,000, may have a different idea of how it would work or have a different approach.  The chair will now have to work in the framework of the questions.  Will this neuter or hamper his or her work?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120800002#P01900","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":634,"content":"<p>On engaging with women who have travelled abroad, there will be input through various channels.

Ultimately, this is a policy matter driven by the Government, the Oireachtas and me.  We had very extensive consultation in which the Senator and other members were involved.  I engaged with the Oireachtas, civil society and service providers to inform all three strands of the consultation.  Once appointed, the chair can input into that and we can add anything he or she believes is important.

I thank the Minister for his response to the earlier questions.  We have covered a lot of ground.  It would have been better, as I said, had the independent chair been appointed prior to or in tandem with the roll-out of the first phase.  I appreciate the Minister's response but for greater coherence, it would have been much better had the chair been involved from the very start of the process.  The Minister explained the rationale but I still believe that would have been better.<\/p> <p>  I fully understand the Minister's points on the difference between the operation of the Act and policy.  This process will clearly look at the operation of the Act.  I am comforted by his comments that if there is a relationship or link between some issues that may be deemed to be policy issues which overlap or interact with the delivery of services and the operation of the Act, those issues will be looked at in that context and may well form part of future recommendations.  That is an important caveat by the Minister, if I read him correctly, and an appropriate response to those who are listening to this discussion.<\/p> <p>  Many of the matters raised with us could be addressed quite quickly.  We do not need a review for us to see that some of them need to be dealt with.  The Minister has responded on safe access zones, on which a Bill is before the Seanad.  We need to move on and resolve some of these issues.  Other matters such as better or more widespread information on abortion services or counselling supports could be addressed without a review, although the review could be of further benefit.<\/p><p>To me, one of the issues that has come up very strongly is that the telemedicine option has proved very popular and should be maintained.  Again, that could be done by the Minister for Health confirming that he will maintain the service.  I know that he does not want to pre-empt a review but there are issues that would not necessarily pre-empt a review.  We already know that we need better communication.  I mean issues have been raised around access for people who cannot speak Irish or English.  For example, the HSE's booklet is not available in all of the languages and could have more languages.<\/p><p> All of these issues can be done in tandem with the review.  Obviously these are resource issues and I ask for a note to be provided.  We often ask for notes but, as the Minister knows, they do not come.  It is important that we get a breakdown of the figures that identifies which maternity hospitals provide full and partial services.  I also ask for a partial service to be defined because there is a concern that some hospitals do not provide any service or a very limited one.  Such information is important in order for us to understand why that happens.  As the Minister has said, there are geographical gaps.  I would not like to see a situation where there is institutional objection to any of this, which would not be appropriate.  I hope that a note can be forwarded to us and I thank the Minister for his time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120800002#P02100","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":637,"content":"<p>Yes, I, too, would prefer the chair to have been appointed and I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that I must act on the recent advice that I have received.<\/p> <p>  On the point made about policy versus operation, yes, we must take a very common sense approach.

A number of speakers have pointed out the gaps and difficulties in service provision.  It has been pointed out to us that meetings with the HSE and hospitals were happening or began to happen but then there was a problem in terms of Covid.  Straightaway I was struck by the fact that most of us live our lives through Zoom now so was it not possible for hold the meetings using Zoom?  Was there no other way to follow through on those meetings?  Can these meetings resume?  It is important that we find out what problems face the hospitals but also the women who avail of these services.<\/p> <p>  Another area is fatal foetal abnormalities.  Again, the issue has caused huge pain and grief for women across the country.  Some women have said that they have been told that the anomaly has been diagnosed as not fatal enough and does not qualify for fatal foetal abnormality.  We have seen what the restrictive criteria of the law in the hands of medical professions in the past has done in Ireland and that was one of the catalysts for the repeal movement.  Are there plans to review the fatal foetal abnormality sections and allow greater clinical freedom for medical professionals?  Does the issue come under the review that we are talking about or is it separate?<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that there are gaps in services and it is clear that these are not being delivered for women in the way that we thought it would as legislators.  What else can we do outside of this?  The review should not stymie or stop the work of the Oireachtas and the Minister in terms of filling the clear gaps in services.  What plans has the Minister for moving forward, aside from the review on which we are focussing today?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120800002#Q00500","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":641,"content":"<p>We are doing a lot in tandem.  Yes, we are absolutely not waiting on this review to act in ways where we can improve the situation.

We are absolutely not waiting on the review for this.<\/p> <p>  Free contraception was one of the other big service provisions that was discussed at the time.  We are not waiting.  The provision is being brought in next year.  There are numerous other women's health initiatives that are being funded this year and then expanded through next year.  For example, the national maternity strategy, which I recall is a 2016 strategy.  It is a really good strategy.  The strategy got full funding this year and it will get full funding next year.  There is a lot of good work being done with the maternity strategy.  Across the country there are a lot of other investments going on in terms of women's health.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether work can be done.  Earlier it was discussed about engaging directly with the maternity units around the country to see what improvements can be made and what possible capacity gaps.  That work is resuming.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman raised the issue of fatal foetal abnormality and asked whether more can be done.  Yes, and in fact there is a piece of work that has been kicked off by Dr. Peter McKenna, who is the clinical director of the national women and infants programme, in terms of looking at adverse events that have happened when it comes to the termination of pregnancy engaging directly with the patients, women, partners and clinicians involved.  That is something that had not been in placed before now.

I have not come across a situation anywhere else where the Government has gone to tender for a chair.

It is something that I am going to be discussing.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the substance and most importantly, for the people who may be watching, a lot of time has been spent talking about what the appropriate approach is to appointing a chair to the committee.  While I am not saying that is irrelevant, it is certainly not remotely the most important substance of what we are discussing here today.  What we are discussing here today is a really important review.  The review is kicking off.  It has been designed around a pre-consultation we did with service providers, civil society and Members of the Oireachtas.  There was a request for an independent chair.  We are doing that.  There was a request that the independent chair would have a rights-based and a legal background.  We are doing that.  There was a request that the chair would have access to all of the expertise they need.  We are doing that.  There was a request that there would be a very wide consultation.  We are doing that.  There are three strands to it.  I think the most important parts in this have perhaps been overshadowed by a technical conversation around the appointment of a chair.  Ultimately, this is an important review.  I believe that there are gaps in service provision and operational aspects to the provision of these services that can be improved.  This review is going to be a very comprehensive approach to doing that, required under statute, obviously.  It will be very useful.  In the meantime, there is a lot going on in terms of safe access zones, free contraception, the reviewing of adverse events to date when it comes to the termination of pregnancies, unprecedented investment in maternity, gynaecology and fertility services, and many other things.

I remind all members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or place them in flight mode. They can interfere with the sound recording, even though it may not be apparent at the time.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of our meeting today is to have an engagement with a number of stakeholders, all of whom made written submissions to the committee on the general scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (powers) Bill 2021.  All of our witnesses are appearing virtually before the committee today from a location outside the Leinster House precinct, as is becoming the norm now.<\/p> <p>  We are joined by a number of witnesses today.  I will welcome them in turn.  I welcome back Ms Clare Daly MEP, who is known to this parish from previous service.  We are also joined by Mr. Dale Sunderland and Mr. Gary Russell of the Data Protection Commission.  They are welcome to the meeting.  From the Policing Authority, we are joined by Mr. Bob Collins, chairperson, who is a regular attender at our sessions, and Ms Helen Hall, chief executive.  They are welcome.  We are also joined by Ms Rachel Wood, assistant secretary, and Ms Sarah Sheppard, assistant principal officer, from the Department of Justice.  Of course, as per the convention at recent meetings, the representatives of the Department of Justice are here in an observer capacity and will take notes.  If there are questions that can be addressed by them, we will direct such questions to them and they will participate, but they will not be making a submission as such.  I ask contributors to unmute their devices when they are speaking but to mute them when they are not speaking so that we do not have interference.<\/p> <p>  I must make the witnesses aware of the following advice on parliamentary privilege.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they may be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely, there may be some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  They may wish to take their own advice on that.  We are in a hybrid situation and have committee meetings in this format.  Should witnesses have any concerns around the level of privilege that extends to them, I am drawing to their attention the fact it may not be as robust as it would usually be were they physically in the building.  There is no way around that; we are where we are.<\/p> <p>  The format of the meeting today is that I will invite each of the participating organisations to make a three-minute opening statement to the committee. We also have their written submissions in front of us, which members have had the opportunity to read and review in advance of the meeting today.  Following the opening statements, I will go round the members of the committee and take questions.  Each member who wishes to contribute will have seven minutes, including questions and responses from the witnesses.  It is up to each member to decide how they wish to use that time.  If a member wishes to give a speech for seven minutes and not allow for any responses, that is his or her prerogative.  Equally, if a member wishes to ask short questions and leave a lot of time for the answers, that is also perfectly acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021120800002#A00200","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1638921600,"counter":682,"content":"<p>This is probably preferable, but I do not direct members on how they wish to manage their own time.

Extending police powers is a serious matter and it is important we get it right.  In the interest of brevity, I will keep my opening remarks short, and I am happy to expand on any of them.  Mick Wallace would have attended but when he heard that only one of us would get to speak, I won or lost the toss depending on what way you look at it.  I wish to highlight a couple of particularly problematic aspects as we see it.<br\/><br\/>First, simply placing a general obligation to protect fundamental rights is not enough.  That is there already.  There should be a definition contained in the Bill, something that reflects the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  Just saying that it is unlawful to breach to fundamental rights is, again, not enough.  There needs to be a provision that says what happens if fundamental rights are not respected.  Consideration should be given to that being a specific offence with a specific penalty attached.  Consideration should also be given to an explicit provision for a timely investigation when abuses occur, to be compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR.<br\/><br\/>What is especially problematic is the stop and search section, including heads 9 and 16, where there is reference to a computer, which could be a smart mobile device, and it being deemed hacking equipment.  This is the potential catch-all to cover warrantless searches that could capture anybody.  Head 16, which allows the possibility of accessing private information and passwords, is a total breach of data protection norms and fundamental rights provisions.<br\/><br\/>In terms of head 13, particularly when every police force on the planet has been found to be guilty or responsible for racial profiling, when we deal with the area of stop and search, there should be a requirement to record the ethnicity of those stopped and searched to ward against racial profiling.<br\/><br\/>Under head 21, we see no justification whatsoever that a senior garda would issue a search warrant.  This should be left with the Judiciary.  There is no evidence to say it is warranted.  In this field of technology, judges are easily accessible, so there should be no urgent situation that would require that.<br\/><br\/>Briefly, on the question of Garda custody, I was shocked to see head 42 subsections 6 to 8, inclusive.  I am very concerned with clauses that deny the right to legal representation based on the vague ground of disruptive behaviour of the solicitor.  This is unconstitutional.  It is against the charter.  The right to legal representation and the right to a fair trial are key.  Head 52, which refers to taking fingerprints by force, is a bit dodgy as well.<br\/><br\/>The biggest problem is with head 68, which sort of undermines all the other previous safeguards.  It basically states that any evidence obtained by breaching the provisions of the legislation would not be excluded as evidence.  It is a <i>carte blanche<\/i>to ignore all the good provisions in the Bill and to operate in an unlawful or in a way that is abusive of rights and still have the evidence permitted.  We see this as being incredibly damaging and undermining of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>I am conscious of time.  Things were done differently in my day on the committee when the speaker could waffle on for ages.  I hope that is as near to three minutes as is possible.  There was a lot of other matter in our written submission that I did not touch on, but I am happy to answer questions on that or on the points raised today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021120800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":684,"content":"<p>We have Ms Daly's written submission.

While the proposed Bill gives rise to a broad range of issues from both a policy and legal perspective, I will limit my comments to matters relating to the processing of personal data and the requirements of data protection law.<\/p> <p>  As a general observation, I would like to emphasise that the obligations on public authorities and bodies processing personal data for law enforcement purposes flow from EU law and, in particular, from the 2016 EU law enforcement directive, which was transposed into Irish law by the Data Protection Act 2018.  This Act requires that any legislation enacted concerning the processing of personal data for law enforcement purposes must specify the objectives and purposes of the processing and the personal data to be processed.  Legislation must also meet the standards of clarity, precision and foreseeability in accordance with the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights.  In addition, legislation can be in both primary and secondary form to meet those standards.<\/p> <p>  The Data Protection Commission, DPC, has in recent years conducted a number of investigations into public authorities and their processing of personal data, especially in the context of surveillance technologies deployed.  What we found in those investigations was a trend that the legislative underpinning for those bodies and their functions has not been updated to reflect the requirements of the law enforcement directive.  In my written statement, which members have, I referenced Article 8 of the law enforcement directive, which I shall not read but which sets out the standard in the European directive in terms of the legislative requirements of processing for law enforcement purposes.  In the context of this Bill, it is essential the Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Oireachtas carefully consider all elements of the powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that necessitate the processing of personal data and include provision for this processing in the legislation or in the proposed statutory codes of practice.  While we identified a number of comments in written submissions that we have made on the Bill, the DPC is not best placed to identify if all the powers that will necessitate the processing of personal data have been included as required.<\/p> <p>  In the time remaining, I will highlight a few of the observations we made in our written submission.  Part 1 provides for regulation-making powers, including statutory codes of practice.  They will be very important in assisting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to uphold the data protection rights of individuals when exercising powers contained within the proposed Bill.  They will do that by providing further clarity and granularity on the manner in which those powers should be exercised and how the issues around data protection engage with those powers.  We recommend that the codes of practice should, as appropriate, be accompanied by a data protection impact assessment and that the approved codes should be made public in a transparent and an easily accessible manner.<\/p> <p>  With reference to part 2 of the proposed Bill in respect of the protection of fundamental rights, we welcome the objective of this part of the Bill and note that the protection of fundamental rights will also include those rights enumerated by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021120800002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dale Sunderland"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1638921600,"counter":686,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":687,"content":"<p>We have lost the connection to Mr. Sunderland.

It is also an opportunity to reflect on these powers from a variety of perspectives, ever mindful that the powers of arrest, detention, search and seizure can as easily - perhaps more easily - infringe and breach than they can protect and vindicate the rights of persons.  The authority welcomes the fact that many of the observations it provided previously have found expression in the latest version of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  In this brief opening session, I want to emphasise five areas of concern that are relevant and significant from a policing oversight perspective.  The first is the search warrant in urgent circumstances.  Head 21, which enables a Garda member of superintendent rank and above to issue a search warrant in urgent circumstances, is of considerable concern to the authority.<\/p><p>The recommendation of the Law Reform Commission was clear that warrants should be issued only by the courts.  It is difficult to envisage circumstances where judicial approval of a warrant could not be urgently obtained electronically.  This provision should not be retained.  If it is to be retained, its exceptional character should be matched by the seniority of the approving Garda member who should be an officer not below the rank of chief superintendent.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should also be required to report publicly on a quarterly basis, ideally to the authority - by division and perhaps by county - on the number of warrants issued in this manner.<\/p><p> Regarding custody and the member in charge, all persons detained in police custody, in whatever form, are, by definition, vulnerable and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a duty to protect them.  This places a great deal of responsibility on the custody officer or the member in charge.  Therefore, the authority believes the position of custody officer as set out in head 35 should ideally be restricted to an officer not below a specified rank and, in all circumstances to a member with a specified number of years of experience and with the necessary training.  Relevant Garda members should be held accountable for performing their function of protecting the rights of each detainee.<\/p><p> Regarding custody and legal representation, the authority is very concerned by head 42, which allows for the exclusion of legal representation based on a subjective evaluation of possible future behaviour.  Nothing should undermine the right to legal assistance which must be practical, effective and unfettered.  These provisions should be removed from the head.  In head 43, the right to waive legal representation should not be available to anyone under the age of 18.<\/p><p> Arrest without warrant was not covered in our original written submission to the committee.  The authority expresses its strong view that the extension of arrest without warrant represents an excessive extension of police powers.  No adequate justification is offered for such a radical change.<\/p><p> The authority considers that codes of practice should be statutory instruments.  They must be binding and not just exhortations.  Any amendments required to reflect this throughout the proposed Bill should be made.

I will try to be quick with the speech at the beginning of my contribution.  Head 12 relates to the retention of data regarding stop and search.  At the moment, the Bill provides that this will be done as part of the code of practice.  It is not just the code of practice.  The code of practice needs to be rooted in the GDPR and in European Union law on retention of data, which is the subject of the case at the moment.  We need to specify that at the top.  It is not just about the code of practice; it should be put in consultation on the code of practice.<\/p> <p>  I am deeply concerned about search warrant in urgent circumstances.  I am very conscious of the logic of the Demache case that a garda issuing their own search warrant for their own investigation was not good enough and it had to be a garda of a certain rank independent of the investigation.  To achieve true independence, it needs to be somebody outside the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, full stop, and not just outside the investigation.  Mr. Collins and Ms Clare Daly made the point that judges are available.  There is no reason why we should not enforce that independence.  I fully believe that the logic of the Demache case indicates that it should never be given by a garda.  My question is for Mr. Collins.  How many such warrants are applied for?  How many of them are refused?  Is there a 100% acceptance rate or is it a black hole that we do not know the number?  <\/p> <p>  The Policing Authority asked about the usefulness of stop and search, and the negative impact it has in communities.

I do not believe that opportunity has been taken in this proposed Bill.  It is worth reflecting on the effectiveness of it.  There is little, if any, evidence to suggest that it is an effective policing mechanism.  As the Deputy has said, the literature suggests a very small percentage of cases result in arrests and a small percentage of those result in any subsequent action.<\/p> <p>  I was going to make reference to the need for the collection of much more detailed information than we have.  We do not have any information at all on the nature and extent of stop and search, and the age, the gender and ethnic indicators of those who are stopped and searched.  We would be na&iuml;ve and self-delusional if we thought that Ireland was a complete outlier in this respect and that there was a precisely proportional representation of the entire population in people who are stopped and searched.  Certain protections could be included in this provision.<\/p> <p>  This is a good opportunity to introduce a requirement to record ethnic identity or at least a facility for facilitating that.  I can understand that there may be a reluctance in any particular measure to introduce this when it has implications across the whole of Government.  However, this is one area where there is no overspill because no other agency has the capacity or the power to stop and search people.  This begins and ends with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is a real virtue in providing the legislative support necessary for a comprehensive process of collecting ethnic data.<\/p><p>Without that, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have no sense of the composition of the people with whom it comes into contact.  Without that, it will not be possible to set aside the not-unreasonable concern that Ireland will be like other countries and apply this facility disproportionately in respect of particular communities or sections of communities within the population.  That would be a critical opportunity lost.

I will start from head 42.  I am astonished this has found its way into the draft heads of the Bill.  The notion that we would interfere with the right of a person to be represented by legal counsel at the point of questioning is anathema to the system we have.  We have a very delicate balance within our criminal justice system, central to which is the right of a person to obtain legal advice.  I cannot see a circumstance in which it would be justifiable for a garda to decide a lawyer was being disruptive when that is exactly what his or her job is.  A lawyer's job, if it is to be disruptive, is to represent the rights of the person who is being questioned.  To say I am disgusted may be a bit strong, but I believe it is extraordinary that this provision has found its way into the heads.  To my mind, it is unconstitutional.  I am particularly alive to what Mr. Collins said in that I have grave difficulty with this.  I would be very unhappy if it found its way into the Bill, when drafted.  Equally, the notion that a senior Garda could just decide a lawyer is to be excluded is an absolute no-go area.  Therefore, I agree with the submissions made in this regard.<\/p><p>On what Mr. Collins said about the waiver not being available to somebody under the age of 18, I presume he is referring to head 43(4), under which an inspector would step in.  I understand from having read the Bill earlier that someone under 18 cannot waive the right to legal counsel anyway.  That is as it should be.  There should be a right for someone to waive but not in the case of a young person.<\/p><p>On head 21, on a senior garda issuing an emergency warrant, I agree with what has been said.  I do not understand how it could ever be the case that one could not find a District Court judge, peace commissioner or somebody else to issue the warrant.  I do not think the provision is justifiable.  We should not be putting these kinds of powers into the hands of the Garda because, again, urgency will always be found if looked for, or if that is what the Garda decides it wants.  The provision compromises garda&iacute; themselves because it will put enormous pressure on garda&iacute; of certain ranks to find reasons to justify actions under it.  Ultimately, this will create problems further down the line.  When the provisions of this kind of legislation are tested in the context of a criminal trial, judges will be very slow to admit the kind of warrant in question.  It is much better to say to garda&iacute; that they must steer themselves into the parameters of getting a proper authority in order to conduct a search in the normal way.  Therefore, I have real difficulty with head 21.<\/p><p>On head 16, on the authorisation for a search, I have a query.  It may be for the witnesses from the Department of Justice.  A single member of An Garda is authorised in a warrant.  If the correct channels have been gone through to get a search warrant and that warrant is in the name of a particular member, what happens if he or she is not available?  Does that mean the search simply cannot take place?  In the normal course, a team of people would conduct a search.  If a search cannot take place because the person named on the warrant is not available, it is an unnecessary fettering.  There should certainly not be anybody searching the premises who is not named in the warrant but my reading of the head as currently drafted is that the person authorised by the warrant to lead the search must be present for it to take place.<\/p><p>I have a question for Ms Clare Daly on what she said on head 6.  I am not saying I disagree with her, specifically concerning the consequences of the breach of rights under the legislation.  There is definitely a problem.  I would not go so far as Ms Daly has done because my concern is that if nominated penalties or specific sanctions are put in place in respect of a garda who breaks the rules, it might have the effect, unintended though it might be, of discouraging garda&iacute; from conducting the searches.  The garda&iacute; might become concerned about their liability if a search must be conducted in a certain way.  However, the current reality is that if nothing flows from a search that garda&iacute; have conducted illegally, it does not matter and there are no consequences.  No evidence gathered is lost if that evidence is not useful, but that does not discourage the garda&iacute; from conducting the search.  It becomes an issue only if something of evidential value arises during the search and it cannot be relied on in court, although the DPP <i>v<\/i>. JC decision and others have substantially watered down the exclusionary rule, as we would have called it, or the fact that evidence can be excluded when it is illegally obtained.<\/p><p>Having stated my misgivings, my questions are on the issuing of a warrant in the context of multiple members of An Garda and on sanctions for garda&iacute; who flout the rules or choose to go outside the provisions of the legislation.  While the latter question is for the witnesses from the Department of Justice, I will be happy to hear from Ms Daly on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021120800002#D00300","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":703,"content":"<p>Let us go back to the witnesses for some feedback.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021120800002#D00400","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":704,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and Senator for their input.  I am happy to see we are on the same page on many of the headline issues concerning heads 42 and 21.  This is great.  I take Senator Ward's point.  It is a matter that we considered ourselves, but from a different point of view.  It is a question of whether, if we specify a penalty, we are watering down in some way.  I look at this by asking what safeguards we can put in place to achieve what is intended in the Bill, which is to safeguard fundamental rights in the exercise of Garda duties.  My concern is less about the evidence found in a search and more about the safeguards we put in place to ensure the Garda<br\/><br\/>is compliant with its fundamental-rights obligations.  Already we have general statements.  Already we have general penalties for breaches of ethics.  Do we need to consider something more?  I do not know the answer.  I believe the Senator is correct in that there are two sides, but I would like some penalty to be considered to put firmly on the plate of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the seriousness of its responsibility.  It is particularly needed in the context of head 68, which gives the impression that it does not really matter if fundamental rights obligations are breached or if evidence is obtained in an abusive way because that evidence could still be admissible.  I am aware that the DPP <i>v<\/i>. JC decision has provided for that, but I do not think our adding to it is very helpful.  Those are my thoughts on it, but I agree it is not entirely straightforward.<br\/><br\/>On stop-and-search arrangements, the points made by Deputy Costello were good in respect of discussing whether the relevant provision is needed at all.  It probably is but we need a very tight definition.  The aspects on computers as hacking devices and accessing private data are very problematic.

Like Senator Ward, I will start with head 42 since I worked for 25 years as a solicitor in the court in Dublin, in addition to Garda stations in Dublin and Kerry.  I always think back to the introduction of the drug trafficking law with the power to hold people in detention for seven days.  The first person I saw who was held under that legislation was a homeless single mother who was living in the Regina Coeli hostel.  She informed me, and I believed her, that she was told that if she did not tell garda&iacute; about the three or four deals of heroin that she had in her locker, she could be held for seven days and garda&iacute; could talk to the HSE, or whichever the body was at the time, about taking her child into care.  That is what happens on the ground and on the front line.  I am staggered by the tone of each and every section of head 42.  The whole tone seems to be that solicitors are going into Garda stations with no other attitude than to cause trouble, which is complete rubbish.<\/p><p>For example, subsection 1 of head 42 states that a custody officer shall &quot;cause a legal representative to be notified ... as soon as practicable.&quot;  As any solicitor who goes into Garda stations will tell you, that gives an opening to garda&iacute; to say that the detained person never asked for a solicitor, or that he or she asked for a solicitor the first time but never asked for one to come in again, or that the garda&iacute; are too busy at the moment and the solicitor is left standing there.  Nothing seems to have changed there.<\/p><p>The &quot;Garda custody facility&quot; is mentioned throughout head 42; it is actually the Garda station.  It seems to me from reading subsection 2 that the time from when a detained person asks for a legal representative until &quot;the conclusion of such a consultation&quot; will be excluded from the detention period.  Is it proposed to add that time on again?  There are major dangers in that because it would be open to garda&iacute; to say to detained persons that if they talk to this sharpshooting solicitor who is coming into the Garda station, it will only delay their detention even further.  Garda&iacute; already have plenty of time within the massive powers under various legislation, such as the 1984 Act and the Offences Against the State and drug trafficking Acts.  Many's the time I was in a Garda station where someone was arrested late in the evening.  That person was not interviewed at all, possibly for the first 12 hours of his or her detention, before the actual questioning started.  There is potential for blaming the solicitor and I disagree with that.  It is a similar case with the phrase &quot;during the course of questioning&quot; used in subsection 3.<\/p><p>Subsection 4 includes the words, &quot;If a legal representative cannot be contacted within a reasonable timeframe&quot;.  Many's the time I saw, and everybody knows, that garda&iacute; have their own personal favourites they would prefer to have in Garda stations rather than some other solicitors.  There is a difficulty at present, even before any of this comes in, in giving a detainee the opportunity to ask for another legal representative.  It seems to me that it is problematic to codify that.<\/p><p>I am completely opposed to subsection 6.  What is the definition of being &quot;unduly disruptive&quot;?  What is all that about?  I know solicitors.  I spoke to one today who told me that when she indicated to garda&iacute; at the beginning of an interview that her client would be exercising his right to silence, she was nearly put out of the Garda station.  She had asked for something that the garda&iacute; say, which is that &quot;You are not obliged to say anything... but...[anything] you say will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence.&quot;  Let us face it, when someone goes into a Garda station on the ground, the solicitor's chair is behind the eyeline of the detained person.  A solicitor sitting in the interview room who looks across at the detained person will not be able to make eye contact with him or her because of the way the room is designed.  By the way, the chair is nailed to the floor.  Four or five years ago, criminal solicitors had a meeting with the Law Society and a former Garda Commissioner.  We were promised that would be changed but that has not happened.  Solicitors have been asked to hand over their mobile phones.  All of that is going on.  What is the definition of &quot;unduly disruptive&quot;?  Will solicitors be asked, or given something in writing, as to why they are being disruptive?  I am completely opposed to that.  It is rubbish and I do not know where it is coming from.  I would love to know what lobby group suggested that that provision go in.<\/p><p>I have probably spoken enough about head 42.  There are a lot of others.  I agree with much of what Ms Daly said and with what was in Mr. Collins's statement.  Head 9 is about stop and search but &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; are not defined.  That has caused difficulties over the years when people are stopped and searched.  We also saw what happened in areas such as Bristol and London in the 1970s and 1980s, where there were strong ethnic communities.  I agree with Mr. Collins's request that ethnic background be included, but so should the area of town that people come from.  Anyone who is unfortunate enough to have Snapchat can see where people are.  It would be very interesting to have a map indicating the areas of towns or cities where people who are stopped and searched are from.<\/p><p>Head 12 is about keeping a record of a search.  I have concerns about head 16.  Anyone's phone is a computer and many's the time I have had problems when people were arrested for very minor offences.  Let us face it, an arrestable offence is one for which a person can be arrested and held for up to 24 hours in a Garda station.  If someone went into Dunnes Stores and stole a Mars bar, that is an arrestable offence because, potentially, if that person went for a judge and jury trial, or the Director of Public Prosecutions sent it forward, that individual could face a penalty of up to five years.  Those are the types of powers we are dealing with on the ground.  I have had people who were arrested, and possibly questioned for a short period of time, who have a picture gallery on their phone that includes photos of dead children and family members who are now deceased, in addition to lots of other stuff on what is, in effect, their personal computer.  When detainees ask for their phone back, they are told it is in a facility where all detained items are sent and they cannot get it back.  It is very upsetting.  Something has to be done to take that type of scenario into account.  There must be proper oversight of the search warrant in urgent circumstances.  The constitutional right to the inviolability of a dwelling house is very important and we should not throw it away.<\/p><p>The power of arrest for an offence comes under section 23.  I will ask someone from the Department to explain an &quot;offence&quot;.  How will that be defined?  Can an individual be arrested for no tax disc on a car or will it go back to the current situation of an arrestable offence with the possibility of a five-year sentence?  <\/p><p>The citizen's arrest referenced under head 25, and what that person believes to be &quot;reasonable&quot;, is a complete minefield.  Is that <i>carte blanche<\/i>to security guards and bouncers to start holding and arresting people?  I see major problems there.<\/p><p>A number of things are mentioned towards the end of this document that I cannot pick up now.  This legislation will have to be amended.  We will bring something forward.  I ask for an answer to the question regarding what is an &quot;offence&quot; under head 23.  Let us flag here and now that there are major problems with this heads of Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021120800002#E00200","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":708,"content":"<p>I will move on to the next member.

I also thank committee members who have made theirs, some of whom have experience in this field.  I am trying to come at this from the middle of the road.  On one hand, we are conscious of those who are victims of crime and the effect that can have on them.  On the other, one would certainly hope that those who are tasked with investigating and preventing crime would do so in a manner that is lawful and above board.  That should be beyond question.  Ms Daly used the term \"safeguards\" and it is vitally important there are safeguards in place to protect anyone who is under investigation for alleged criminal offences, or any type of offence for that matter.  The discussion we are having about this Bill and the flaws some members have highlighted are useful.<\/p> <p>  I will start by asking Ms Daly and Mr. Collins about the search warrants.  Are there any circumstances that would warrant a Garda superintendent or chief superintendent to issue a search warrant?  I am thinking of someone who received information at 3 a.m. that a shipment of drugs was coming into the jurisdiction.  Do we have any data on how accessible it is for a judge or district justice to issue a warrant promptly in such a case?  I do not know what the turnaround time is for that.  It is an important factor.<\/p> <p>  The circumstances were mentioned when a member of the Garda, whoever he or she might be, of superintendent or chief superintendent rank, would have to account for and be able to stand over what those urgent circumstances would be.  I would not like to think that there would be a delay from trying to get a judge to sign a warrant in an investigation of crime to which urgency was attached, such as a drugs shipment.<\/p> <p>  If there is no delay in getting the necessary search warrant issued and signed by a judge, that is fine.  However, I wonder whether we have any data on that.  Is there any data to show whether this situation has been abused?  That would be important.  Mr. Sunderland talked about data protection and the rights of citizens.  It goes without saying that those should be protected.  Legal assistance was taken as a given and I know Senator Ward was very strong on that and I fully agree with him.  There are no circumstances whereby someone should not be given legal assistance where required and that would be unforgivable.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious of the victims of crime.  Investigating crime is not simple.  It is a tough job.  It needs to be done, but has to be done in a manner that is legal and above board.  That is very important.  Citizens' rights have to be respected at all times.  Does Mr. Collins have any information or is any data available to us where garda&iacute; abuse their powers across any of the issues we have discussed?<\/p> <p>  It is right and proper to discuss this now.  It is right that we review the legislation and highlight shortcomings.  Members have highlighted a number of issues, in particular, where shortcomings are present.  Where shortcomings have been highlighted and proven to be in existence, we have a duty to the citizens of the State to ensure that every safeguard possible is put in place to protect them, while members of the Garda are investigating crime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021120800002#F00200","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":711,"content":"<p>The Senator's points are very good.

That is not the point.  Some of the concerns the authority has about aspects of this measure are out of a concern that it puts Garda members in a very difficult position.  For example, a custody officer who has not been sufficiently trained and does not have sufficient experience is being put in a difficult position to carry the responsibility that being a custody officer entails.  That is as much a concern for the Garda member as it is for the person who is in custody.  There is a mutuality in that.<\/p> <p>  There are many very positive things in this Bill.

If such a difficulty is convincingly pointed out, the circumstances in which such a decision can be taken by a Garda member should be specifically limited and confined to somebody who is a chief superintendent or higher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021120800002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bob Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":713,"content":"<p>Mr. Collins said a moment ago that there were many good things in this Bill.

There is so little time to go through what is good in this Bill.  I recognise its importance and specifically what was said about the codification of this legislation, finally.  It is putting in place what the Supreme Court has said in Gormley and other cases, and that is important.  It is a difficult area to gauge because we rarely get to see inside Garda interviews, but in my professional experience, I have never seen a situation where a solicitor interferes to any significant extent in the interviewing process.  I know that from speaking to my solicitors.  It may well be that the solicitors who are interfering do not brief me.  That might be the case.  However, the solicitors I speak to find they have very little opportunity to intervene during questioning.  I do not think it is an issue, though I am absolutely open to correction on that.  I heard what Ms Woods said about what the Garda has said about the matter.  I acknowledge that, but I think it is problematic in the context of what we are talking about.  I endorse what Deputy Daly said, that one can see in the videos of interviews that solicitors are behind the people who are being questioned.  There is no opportunity for communication other than for the solicitor to render legal advice in front of the garda&iacute;.  That is a difficult situation for a solicitor.<\/p> <p>  I still have difficulties with this because I do not believe there is a substantial element of talking over witnesses or things like that.  I do not think that happens though, as I say, I am open to correction on that point.<\/p> <p>  I do not have the relevant part of the Bill to hand, but the Bill codifies the right of the person to take legal advice out of earshot of garda&iacute; although it can be within visual range of garda&iacute;.  For the most part, that is not an issue but there will be cases of garda&iacute; who are able to lip read although I know that might sound far-fetched.  Some people may be using the benefit of a sign language interpreter.  There is potential there for the confidentiality of that consultation to be compromised.<\/p> <p>  I also wanted to speak to the point about recording the ethnicity of people.  I absolutely agree with the comments that have been made to the effect that the power of search is executed by the Garda in particular circumstances and very often, for example, the power under section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act is used wholesale by the Garda to effect stop and search powers, and not always legitimately.  It is not only me saying that because the courts have found that to be true.  I am wondering about the point around recording ethnicity and whether, in fact, we should be recording more than ethnicity.  Would people acknowledge the difficulties with the subjectivity of that recording exercise by the Garda?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021120800002#H00400","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":737,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for those insightful comments, as always.

I am not sure why that is there.  One should be allowed a consultation with a solicitor in a private room if one has been arrested.  I would be interested to hear the reasoning for that.  Certainly in my time, there were Garda stations, one in particular in Dublin, that routinely would make sure the door of the interview room was open and a Garda member would be sitting down the hall while one was trying to have a conversation in muffled tones with one's client.<\/p> <p>  The Garda seems to be complaining about the talking-over issue.  I am sure that probably relates to a situation in which a solicitor has to remind a client that he or she is not obliged to say anything but anything he or she says will be taken down in writing.  That is probably the complaint, unless there is something else.  All interviews are video recorded.  I would be surprised to see solicitors standing up and doing a song and dance to disrupt the conversation or interview that garda&iacute; are having with the person who has been arrested.<\/p> <p>  One or two of our guests might already have covered the point about finding a judge late at night, rather than a superintendent.  Over the past year, particularly since the beginning of the pandemic, we have moved to a large extent to remote hearings, Zoom meetings and all of that.  People are routinely remanded in custody for further periods without attending court and I do not see why that should not be explored before it is brought to a superintendent, or whoever it is, because of the urgency of the situation.  Judges are on call, just like superintendents and solicitors, over weekends and during the night.  That should be explored before a decision is made to take away the power of the Garda to issue warrants for other garda&iacute;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021120800002#H00600","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":739,"content":"<p>If there are difficulties in finding a judge out of hours, it is probably a reflection of the fact there are not enough judges in the State, quite simply.

The failure of the State to invest in access to justice and to invest sufficiently in the judicial system should not be an excuse to undermine the due process rights of the accused and the general citizen.  I stand by my earlier comments and those of other Deputies.<\/p> <p>  I have a quick question for Mr. Sunderland about the data we are talking about.  The debate about extracting disaggregated data such as a person's ethnicity and other demographic data is being made somewhat complex because of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  A lot of the time, people will quote the GDPR erroneously as a reason not to do things instead of engaging with what the regulation states and does not state.  I would love to hear from Mr. Sunderland as to whether that is true and the complexity of the situation around disaggregated data arising from the stop and search situations we are talking about.  I am thinking not only of ethnicity but also of geographic and socioeconomic data, which are also very important, particularly in relation to certain offences.  On what basis would it be unlawful to collect disaggregated data during a stop, search, arrest and detention?  Perhaps Mr. Sunderland would speak to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021120800002#H00700","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":740,"content":"<p>I will do that, and I thank the Deputy for the question.  He is right to point out that the GDPR is often used as a reason something cannot be done or cannot happen.  However, that is a false premise and basis from which to look at this matter.  This is about how clear the legislation can be and how precise it can be in terms of the purpose for which personal data are being processed.  If there is a desire to capture further data under the written record of a stop and search, the Bill needs to be clear as to the reason for the collection of those data and for what purpose they will be used.  If the data are collected for the purpose of aggregation and looking at the effectiveness of the use or not of the power, the Bill needs to specify that.  The framework should be provided within the Bill and any use of the data outside of that legislative provision would not be lawful.<\/p> <p>  I will also reference the code of practice in that context.  It is also an important part of these considerations that the code of practice needs to set out explicitly all of the requirements and, from a data protection perspective, what data will be collected, how they will be stored and retained, and how a balance is going to be struck between an individual's right for his or her data to be protected and the legitimate uses to which they may be put.  That is the answer.  It can be done but the question is as to how it is done and how specific and clear the legislation will be.  This is not just for the purpose of law enforcement but may also fall under the GDPR in terms of the use of the data.  A little bit of thinking needs to be done as to how those two legal frameworks come together in this context.

I thank all of the Deputies and Senators for a very informative discussion.  In fact, with all of the criticisms, I think we can see the importance of this Bill and its potential problems.  Deputy Costello is right in his points about data protection.  We only have to look at the Graham Dwyer debacle and where the ignoring of advice around data issues has landed the Irish State, and where it has potentially left victims as well.  We need to be very careful on these issues.  There is a balance to be struck.  If we look at head 12, on the one hand, it allows for the destruction of a record after a search and after a particular time, which could be problematic in the context of transparency and accountability going into the future.  At the same time, we have to take into account European and GDPR provisions in terms of people's rights to have data against them not retained.

I thank the witnesses for attending at such short notice.  We regard this meeting as being about giving information to the general public, especially people who will be returning to Ireland over Christmas, which is a special time for Irish people who are coming back to their families and friends.  We want to bring absolute clarity to the matter, given the introduction of PCR and antigen testing just this week.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identified person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it might apply to the evidence they give.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House campus in order to participate in public meetings.  Reluctantly, I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members participating via Microsoft Teams to confirm prior to making their contributions that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.<\/p> <p>  I call on Mr. Towey to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021120800002#B00100","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":842,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear before it to discuss the new Covid-19 testing rules that have been implemented for international travel into Ireland.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. O'Flaherty, who works with me on Covid international travel planning.  This committee has dedicated considerable time to examining and raising key issues for the aviation and maritime sectors in the difficult period since the start of the pandemic and I welcome the opportunity to assist with its further deliberations.<\/p> <p>  We all share a desire to reach a point where international travel can take place without specific Covid-19 measures.  The aviation and maritime industries need to plan and build towards a stable and sustainable recovery.  There is significant direct employment in those sectors but, more importantly, they are critical enablers of economic growth in other parts of the economy.  The impact of Covid on these industries and on the travel and domestic tourism industries has been catastrophic and unprecedented.<\/p> <p>  The maritime sector is essential to the continued movement of goods in and out of the country, accounting for 90% of Ireland's international trade in volume terms.  The sector suffered reductions in freight traffic of up to 40% and passenger reductions of more than 95% during the initial weeks and months of the pandemic.  Passenger figures for 2020 showed a decrease of over 70% compared with 2019.  While the opening of international travel on 19 July saw an improvement in maritime passenger volumes, they still remain approximately 40% below pre-pandemic levels.<\/p> <p>  Globally, aviation is experiencing the most challenging crisis in its history.  The general reduction in passenger numbers has severely impacted air connectivity.  In Ireland, passenger numbers were down 80% in 2020 and 90% for the period from March to December of that year.  Air connectivity is vital for an island economy.  The negative impact on aviation has significantly increased the cost of air freight for the export sector, with significant increases in the cost of doing business.  Many analysts are predicting that it will take several years to return to 2019 levels of activity.  Public health travel restrictions and the introduction of mandatory quarantine meant that, between January and June of 2021, passenger levels were down approximately 80% on all corridors.<\/p> <p>  The Government agreed a range of measures that took effect from 19 July and allowed the resumption of non-essential international travel.  Central to this was the substantial work undertaken to introduce the enhanced passenger locator form and the EU digital Covid certificate.  Under these arrangements, we saw a welcome recovery in passenger numbers.  Throughput at State airports in mid-September was up nearly 200% compared with the week before 19 July.<\/p> <p>  Much of the recovery in passenger numbers was driven by our successful vaccination programme and those of our European neighbours.  In the early stages of that recovery, it was noted by our colleagues in the Department of Health that approximately 90% of incoming passengers completing the electronic passenger locator form were fully vaccinated.  Unfortunately, the Covid-19 situation in Ireland and across Europe remains uncertain and of concern, with added uncertainty due to the potential impact of the Omicron variant.  Across Europe, we have seen the imposition of additional protective measures.  Some of these are targeted at travel from certain locations but others have been applied more broadly.<\/p> <p>  Since Sunday, 5 December, all persons arriving into Ireland from overseas who have been vaccinated or recovered from Covid-19 are also now required to have a negative, or virus not detected, test result.<\/p><p>The test result must be from a professionally administered antigen test taken not more than 48 hours before arrival or an RT-PCR test taken not more than 72 hours before arrival.  Unvaccinated passengers continue to require a PCR test.  The previous exemptions to testing for international transport workers and air and maritime crew have been maintained, which is important in the context of the European Union&rsquo;s Green Lanes initiative and to ensure no additional blockages in the supply chain.<\/p><p> The Department of Transport engaged immediately with air and sea carriers as the announcement was made for these new requirements.  We informed the carriers of the additional requirements to carry out pre-boarding checks for compliance.  The regulations signed by the Minister for Health provide that the carriers are obliged to ensure all passengers have completed an electronic passenger locator form and, unless exempt, have the required negative-not detected test result.<\/p><p> We will continue to engage with carriers to understand any issues arising for them and their passengers.  We will also monitor the impact on the ports, airports and the supply chain.  It is vital the facilitation of passenger and freight traffic is kept as streamlined as possible while ensuring compliance with the new Government travel requirements.  For maritime carriers, freight must remain free-flowing in the busy Christmas season and with the commencement of customs checks into the UK market on 1 January 2022. <\/p><p> We will engage with our colleagues in other Departments on any issues arising.  We also look forward to the review of arrangements at the end of the initial two-week period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021120800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Towey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":844,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Towey for his presentation.

I am assistant secretary in the Department of Health and am joined by my colleague Mr. Keith Comiskey, who leads on Covid travel policy for our Department.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Health has been central in the wider and ongoing national response to Covid-19 and in managing the risk of importation of variants of concern throughout the pandemic.  The Department and the Government have responded to both improving and disimproving epidemiological situations, as appropriate, to support international travel to the greatest extent possible while ensuring the protection of public health is paramount.<\/p> <p>  Throughout 2020 and 2021, the Minister for Health has introduced regulations to support the public health response with respect to international travel.  These statutory instruments cover the requirements for travel to Ireland during the pandemic, the passenger locator form and the EU digital Covid certificates, mentioned by Mr. Towey, which remain key tools for our pandemic response.<\/p> <p>  These regulatory changes are undertaken in consultation with six other Ministers, namely, the Minister for Transport, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  Together this cross-ministerial approach ensures the appropriate response across various sectors of society and the economy, in so far as possible, while protecting people against severe illness or death.<\/p> <p>  This effort seeks to limit and delay the importation of Covid and its variants, understanding that we are part of an increasingly interdependent global community.  In particular, it aims to delay importation of concerning variants such as Omicron while non-pharmaceutical interventions are strengthened and until further evidence emerges relating to its transmissibility and the impact it has on disease severity.  Not enough is currently known about the Omicron variant and the World Health Organization has designated it as a variant of concern.<\/p> <p>  To protect Ireland&rsquo;s healthcare system and economy we urgently and proactively responded in recent times to the emergence of this new Covid-19 variant.  New requirements were urgently put in place for travel from several specified countries where the Omicron variant was circulating in the community.  Since 29 November, any person who has been in a scheduled state in the previous 14 days is not permitted to travel to Ireland, except under certain exemptions.  Those who do travel are required to have pre-departure testing, to home quarantine on arrival, and to undergo post-arrival testing.  There are very limited exemptions to these requirements.<\/p> <p>  The scheduling of these specific countries was made in line with the EU emergency brake mechanism to ensure a consistent EU approach to public health in this instance.  As information on the new Omicron variant is currently limited, additional protection measures were considered prudent to protect the reopening of the Irish economy and society.<\/p> <p>  On 30 November, the Government decided that all travellers into Ireland should be required to present a negative test result, regardless of immunity status.  All travellers to Ireland from overseas are now required to show a relevant test result, either a PCR or antigen test result, upon arrival to Ireland, unless specifically exempted by regulation.  Travellers with proof of immunity have the option of taking a PCR or a rapid antigen test, and those without proof of immunity are required to take a PCR test.  These new measures are intended to be temporary and will be kept under constant review.<\/p> <p>  It was initially envisaged to have this measure operational by 3 December.  However, given the significant change of this requirement for passengers and for carriers, it was decided to extend the implementation of this requirement by two days to Sunday, 5 December.  These measures are being introduced as part of a whole-of-government Covid response.  As more information becomes available about the effects of the Omicron variant, we will continue to adapt.  The Department of Health will continue to work across government on the ongoing national response to Covid-19 and to manage the risk of importation of variants of concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021120800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Muiris O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":846,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connor for that.

I am the consular director at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for international travel.  While the Department of Foreign Affairs does not have a role in implementing the new Covid testing rules for incoming travel to Ireland, the Department continues to assist and advise citizens around the world in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Our current advice to citizens is that there are risks associated with international travel and that this is likely to remain the case over the coming months.  In recent years, the Department has responded to unprecedented requests for assistance and carried out the largest repatriation operations in the history of the State.<\/p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s travel advice pages, which cover 200 countries, are some of the most visited pages on the Department of Foreign Affairs, DFA, website.  Every effort is made to ensure the provision of practical assistance and clear advice to the citizen.  In this regard, the Department&rsquo;s travel advice is extremely significant for a range of stakeholders, and significant thought and resources have been put into ensuring clear, accurate and timely advice to help assist and inform citizens.  Given the rapidly evolving circumstances in recent years, the importance of close co-operation with our diplomatic missions, the EU and like-minded countries, the advice of relevant organisations and, in particular, co-ordinating closely with the Department of Health and the HSE has been paramount.  On a daily basis, the Department ensures the 200 travel advice pages it operates covering all countries in the world are up to date.  Timely and up-to-date information serves citizens in ensuring they make informed decisions before travelling and can help ensure citizens avoid getting into difficulty while they are travelling internationally.  In the current climate, our general advice to citizens remains that travel restrictions are subject to change at short notice and that all passengers should undertake proper research and carefully consider the necessity for their international travel at this time.<\/p> <p>  At present, the Department and its embassy network continue to provide consular assistance to Irish citizens impacted by the evolving travel restrictions imposed across the world in response to cases of the new Omicron variant.  The Department&rsquo;s consular teams are dealing with a high volume of calls and emails from citizens concerned about their travel plans or how restrictions will affect loved ones returning to Ireland.  To respond to these queries, the Department established a dedicated helpline on 2 December to give immediate advice to citizens.  The helpline has taken 1,100 calls, and that number has increased since this briefing was written.  We have also responded to more than 500 emails from citizens.  We will respond to these requests along with the continued assistance we provide in non-Covid or travel-related consular cases. We will also continue to monitor any restrictions abroad which may impact our citizens. <\/p> <p>  While the Department of Foreign Affairs has no direct role in the introduction of inward restrictions on travellers arriving in the State, we continue to co-ordinate with relevant Departments regarding the dissemination of information on travel restrictions and the practical assistance to citizens these restrictions may affect.  This is most recently notable in the restrictions imposed on scheduled states in southern Africa following the emergence of the Omicron variant.<\/p><p>In southern Africa, our embassy network has responded to hundreds of queries and is in ongoing contact with the remaining citizens and dependants who are attempting to return to Ireland following the imposition of flight bans.  The Irish embassy in Pretoria has engaged directly with around 200 citizens and family members who have been attempting to secure flights back to Ireland.  Flights are now starting to resume and many of the affected citizens have returned to Ireland.<\/p><p> On 29 November, the Government of Morocco announced a travel ban on all inward and outward flights.  The Department moved quickly to establish how many citizens were in Morocco and how the ban would affect them.  Following an assessment of the situation, the Department, through our embassy in Rabat, moved quickly to charter a Ryanair aircraft to repatriate stranded citizens.  This flight departed from Marrakech on Saturday, 5 December with 156 passengers on board.  It included predominantly Irish citizens and residents and a number of citizens from the EU and UK.  No other direct repatriation flights from Morocco are planned.  Several airlines are operating special flights to European capitals from where onward flights to Ireland can be purchased.  Our embassy in Rabat is available to provide advice to any citizens stranded in Morocco.  <\/p><p> In 2021, the Department of Foreign Affairs and our mission network continued our mandate in supporting Irish citizens caught up in both major and relatively minor incidents overseas.  From the evacuation of citizens from Afghanistan to the support of citizens who have had their passport stolen abroad, we remain dedicated to this role.  Staff in our consular directorate in Dublin, our 95 embassies and consulates general and our 94 honorary consuls around the world remain willing and ready to provide assistance and support to citizens in need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021120800002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre N&iacute; Fhall&uacute;in","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":849,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Oonagh Buckley to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021120800002#D00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638921600,"counter":850,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for inviting the Department to address today's session.  While the Department of Justice plays a supportive rather than a lead role in the matters being discussed today, we have an important contribution to make to the Government's overall response primarily through the work of our border management unit, BMU, team at Dublin Airport.  The core function of the BMU is to immigrate passengers arriving into the State at Dublin Airport and to decide if a person should be allowed to enter the State and for how long.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na currently undertakes these immigration duties at all other ports of entry to the State.<\/p> <p>  Since the beginning of the pandemic, in addition to its core immigration duties, the BMU has performed an important role in conducting checks of health documentation.  This includes digital Covid certificates, HSE vaccination certificates, NHS vaccination certificates, state-issued vaccination certificates from other third countries and negative PCR test results across all passenger cohorts in Dublin Airport.  The BMU also had a significant role in the operating of the mandatory hotel quarantine system when that was in operation.     <\/p> <p>  All passengers arriving into Ireland were checked for health documentation until 19 July when restrictions on non-essential international travel were eased and passenger numbers rose significantly thereafter.  To avoid lengthy queues at immigration, spot checking of health documentation was implemented.  In recent days, this spot-checking role has been expanded to include PCR and antigen tests in line with the latest public health advice and Government travel restrictions.  <\/p> <p>  The BMU has significantly increased the level of spot-checking of arriving passengers in recent days - both at peak and non-peak times.  Carriers are obliged to check each passenger's health documentation prior to boarding and there are penalties in place for passengers who arrive without the requisite documentation.  It is important, therefore, that passengers familiarise themselves in advance with the up-to-date requirements.  We note that the compliance rate is high and we thank the travelling public for its compliance with that.  Notwithstanding that, we have seen a number of people in recent days being referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by immigration officers for not being in possession of the required health documentation.  In particular, people travelling from the UK should be aware that they are not exempt from the requirement to have a pre-departure test.  Passengers can expect to see higher levels of checking as they travel through Dublin Airport in the coming days and weeks and should leave additional time for their journey both at departure and on arrival.<\/p> <p>  The BMU team works very closely with Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, colleagues, who are responsible for managing the queues on arrival to the immigration hall.  Our shared objective is to ensure that queuing time is minimised and that passengers are immigrated quickly and safely on arrival while also carrying out all of our important immigration and public health functions. <\/p> <p>  A very important part of our efforts to keep a smooth flow of passengers through immigration at Dublin Airport is the operation of the e-gates.  A total of over 730,000 e-gate transactions took place between August and November 2021.  Approximately 30% of these transactions were unsuccessful leading to further checks by the BMU team.  I am happy to answer any queries that committee members may have on the BMU role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021120800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Oonagh Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":851,"content":"<p>I know the Department of Transport was in discussion with the airlines about pre-departure checking of Covid tests - antigen tests taken 48 hours prior to departure and PCR tests up to 72 hours prior to departure.

International travel is very important.  It is important that we keep our borders open and have a robust regime in place to provide oversight.  There is concern in respect of this variant of concern, namely, Omicron.  We have much to learn about it, including its transmissibility and its impact on people.  I note with concern the number of Omicron cases that appear to be present in the UK.  There has been much news coverage in recent days regarding the number of Omicron cases there.  As regards the regime in Ireland and what is asked of people, I ask our guests to take me through what is expected of a person coming into an Irish airport from outside the EU.  What do such persons have to show?  Is there a difference between passengers coming from outside the EU and those coming from within the EU?

Generally speaking, the obligations on passengers travelling to Ireland are not differentiated by region or point of origin of the passenger.  The exception is that in response to the emergence of Omicron in South Africa initially, restrictions were introduced in respect of travel from seven countries in southern Africa, including South Africa, and there are particular requirements that apply in those cases.  The general requirements, however, are not based on the point of origin of the passenger.  Rather, they are based on the health status of the passenger.  Essentially, the current requirement is that every passenger travelling to Ireland must complete a passenger locator form.  There are very limited exceptions to that.  That obligation has been in place since May last year.  It is a long-standing obligation.  It is an electronic form that has been obligatory since earlier this year.  Every passenger must complete it.  It requires passengers to declare their health status, that is, whether they are vaccinated, recovered or unvaccinated.  That is the first requirement that must be met by all travellers.  The second requirement that must be met by travellers is a negative test.  In the case of vaccinated or recovered persons, that can be either a PCR test or an antigen test.  The timeframe within which the test must be administered is differentiated - it is 72 hours for a PCR test or 48 hours for an antigen test.  That is the requirement for persons who are vaccinated or recovered.  For persons who are unvaccinated, the choice of an antigen test pre-departure does not exist.  All persons who are not vaccinated must have a negative or \"not detected\" PCR test.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021120800002#H01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Towey"},{"type":"speech","time":1638921600,"counter":946,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; touched on this issue earlier.

The new regulations have only been in place for approximately two days, but we have not yet seen this arising as an issue.

When Professor Mark Ferguson appeared before the committee to discuss his report, we discussed the possibility of using self-administered antigen testing on a serial basis, pre-departure and post-arrival, as a potentially useful tool.  Regarding the logic behind the professionally-administered antigen tests pre-departure, such testing is cumbersome.  Logistically, it is difficult for people to make their way to get the test done professionally.  It is also more expensive.

I have complimented some of the work done but this needs to be said if anything happens in the future and we need to strengthen pre-arrival requirements in testing for any new variant or whatever.  Leaving it so close to midnight for the airlines to be informed was not productive and it left quite an expense on many people and particularly consumers.  That was unfair.  I appreciate that it is often the case in politics that legal advice can cause impediments to certain measures being implemented, and this is correct as we are talking about the law.  We must point out though that what happened was wrong and it is an area for improvement.<\/p> <p>  Overall, from the capital expenditure point of view, the Department of Transport has moved very quickly to support airports with capital and operational expenditure.  That has been fantastic and I say \"well done\" to everybody on that.  I know many people in airlines and airports will be listening today and they have done fantastic work as well, especially those working very closely with the committee.<\/p> <p>  In many ways the new variant has presented us with difficulties but we must do a strong assessment of the risk involved in travel.  A person on a bus or train may sit next to another person for an extended period and we should have a frank discussion about whether the aviation sector is as big a risk as it is made out to be.  There is no doubt it is involved with the spread of new variants and that is currently in the spotlight.  Once we get a better understanding of the new variant, we should look at withdrawing some of the prerequisites as soon as possible or when we have a full understanding of the efficacy of vaccines in respect of the new variant.  That research will probably be published in the run-up to Christmas and we will have a much improved understanding of it.<\/p> <p>  This is just frustrating for passengers.  People who regularly travel via plane have told me they are almost sick of the process at this stage.  Each country has its own various approaches as well, and that is not very productive.  NPHET should do some self-analysis on its attitude to the aviation sector.  There is a strong argument that air filtration systems on planes make them one of the safest locations for a large gathering of individuals in an enclosed space.  It is a point that is not often made.  Mr. Towey and the departmental officials know that public confidence in aviation has been damaged so much and we need to rebuild that.  In the context of Cork Airport, Dublin Airport and other regional airports, such as Shannon - it is often spoken about passionately by representatives from that area of the country - we have a big job to do to rebuild public confidence in aviation.  I have flown a few times in the past number of months for work and travel.  Everybody is putting in a major effort and that must be acknowledged.

We worked from morning to night each day and there were only two days between the Government meeting and the signalled deadline.  Colleagues from the Department of Foreign Affairs and those in this meeting were sifting through the practicalities involving people in destinations outside Ireland who were trying to come home.  For example, there was consideration of people's ability to access tests.  We regret that people incurred what would they would now regard as unnecessary expenses in getting tests, which were an extra layer of assurance consistent with the Government advice.  We did not want penal provisions in place for people who, with the best will in the world, absolutely could not turn around a test administered by a professional in the time window.  It was a combination of factors, including the feasibility of implementing the regulation and the direct feeds coming through embassies, justice and transport networks.  People genuinely needed time to be able to comply with provisions.  That is why we acknowledged it was not optimal.

Many people have been caught, particularly by one airline that is very well known to most people, for not having passports.  A passport is not a requirement for travel to the UK but the airline requires one.  That is part of its terms and conditions.  Airlines are very used to checking passports and making sure they are not out of date.  They also make sure to check other stuff.  In general, only 10% of passengers are being checked.  The Department has acknowledged that more than 10% are being checked on some flights but, equally, less than 10% are being checked on others, particularly on Sunday nights.  People have spent quite a bit of money.  I know somebody who was in Tenerife last week who spent a lot of time and who was very anxious about complying with these new systems that they did not know anything about when they flew out.  After having spent two days being anxious, finding a test provider and spending money to get one - I think they were &euro;70 each - they discovered the test was not checked when they flew back on Saturday morning.  I know that was a matter of timing and that they could have been checked on the Saturday if the deadline had not been moved.  Most people are going to be very compliant but the people who are being very compliant want to know that those who are not being compliant are not going to get through the system.  That gives people less confidence and makes them ask why they are shelling out money and spending time on this when nobody is checking.

That is not true of PCR test or antigen test results.  Some of those tests are attested by the digital Covid certificate.  That is clearly helpful.  That is a standardised document.  However, other forms of evidence are not standardised.  That may be the source of some of the difficulty.  It is the case that a very small number of travellers have been found to have produced false documentation while others have produced no documentation at all.

People from certain other countries need visas or other permits to get into the country.  Of course, the passport is proof of identity, but it is much more than that.

Can somebody, after watching this committee meeting, decide that, if they turn up and go through the e-gates with a working passport, he or she will not be checked for an antigen test or PCR test?  They may hope the airline will not check.  We are relying on the airlines a lot.  That is fine once we know the airlines are doing what they are supposed to but the checks - and only 10% of passengers are being checked - are finding people who are making it through the system.

No Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, going into the Chamber last week, found this palatable.  It is certainly a measure we want to see in place for the shortest possible time.  If we determine somehow that the Omicron variant is not as volatile as it is now believed to be, that measure needs to be rolled back on immediately.  However, the point I was trying to make was that ten months ago, when mandatory hotel quarantine came in, a hotel quite near to Dublin Airport was selected.  There was probably logic to that because it was largely just Dublin Airport that had inbound and outbound flights.  Obviously, that has now changed.<\/p> <p>  If a passenger were to come through a transit flight, maybe landing in Heathrow Airport, and travelling onwards to Shannon Airport, we would need to have capacity in the mid-west and near Cork and Knock airports.

We need to have that capacity in these regions.<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Towey.

I remember way back at the start of Covid, when very few commercial flights were taking off, private flights were still going between Britain and Ireland.  It would be important to establish what is in place for those flights and for self-flown flights, of which there may be ten or 12 per week.  They do take off and go over and back and it is important to establish whether measures are in place and whether there was a way of verifying it.<\/p> <p>  Digital Covid certification is neat and simplified in that one has it on one's phone and scans it going through the airport.

I ask the witnesses to respond to this because it is also possibly happening in Ireland.  Basically, the issue arose when we went to the baggage screening machines.  There are certain thresholds for liquids and airport security staff very often bin containers with liquids.  I had a small bottle of hand sanitiser but it was taken from me.  I accepted that because that is what happens at airports and it has been standard for years.  However, I found that when I got beyond that point in the airport, I was not able to buy more hand sanitiser and there were only one or two locations in the whole concourse of the airport thereafter that had hand sanitiser.  Has the threshold above which liquids are confiscated changed in any way?  Are there any proposals to change it in light of the fact that hand sanitisers are carried by virtually all passengers now?
