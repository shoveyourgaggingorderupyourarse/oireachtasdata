The Commissioners account for these receipts and transfers in the annual Revenue account.  The account for 2019 was certified by me on 17 April 2020 and received a clear audit opinion.<\/p> <p>  Total receipts into the Revenue account in 2019 amounted to over &euro;84.2 billion.  Revenue made repayments to taxpayers totalling &euro;10.1 billion in the year.  As a result, the net receipts brought to account in 2019 amounted to just over &euro;74.1 billion.<\/p> <p>  Tax receipts payable to the Central Fund amounted to a net &euro;58.3 billion in 2019.  This represented an increase of approximately &euro;3.7 billion or 7%, compared with 2018.  Note 1 to the account provides a breakdown of the receipts for the main tax headings.  Other than capital acquisition tax, which experienced a very marginal decrease, all tax receipts increased year on year when compared with 2018.<\/p> <p>  Non-Exchequer receipts increased from a net &euro;14 billion in 2018 to &euro;15.8 billion in 2019, an increase of 12.9% year on year.  Note 2 to the account presents an analysis of these receipts.  This indicates that pay related social insurance, PRSI, receipts accounted for &euro;12.3 billion of the total in 2019.  These receipts are payable to the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p> <p>  Also included in non-Exchequer receipts was &euro;2 billion received under the VAT mini one-stop-shop, MOSS, scheme in 2019.  This was up 43% from the &euro;1.4 billion collected in 2018.  The receipts represent amounts collected on behalf of other EU member states under place-of-supply VAT rules in place since 2015.  These apply to businesses registered for VAT MOSS in Ireland which provide telecommunications, broadcasting or electronically supplied services to consumers across borders.  VAT MOSS receipts collected by revenue authorities in other member states relevant to services delivered to Irish residents are disclosed in the note on tax receipts.<\/p> <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s administration and operational expenses are charged to Vote 9 - Office of the Revenue Commissioners, rather than to the Revenue account.  The Vote had total gross expenditure of &euro;449 million in 2019.  Salaries totalling &euro;319 million continue to be the largest element of spend for Revenue.<\/p> <p>  The initial estimate for Revenue for 2019 was &euro;446 million.  Subsequently, a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;4.1 million was provided to meet certain costs incurred by the Office of Public Works on behalf of Revenue, relating to new infrastructure it required at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and Dublin Airport in preparation for Brexit.<\/p> <p>  Appropriations-in-aid of the Vote for 2019 totalled &euro;70.5 million.  Over half of this is accounted for by payments received in respect of the agency service provided by Revenue to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection related to the collection and pay-over of PRSI receipts.<\/p> <p>  Net expenditure under the Vote amounted to &euro;378.5 million, and the surrender for the year was &euro;4.2 million.<\/p> <p>  In my report on the appropriation account for 2019, I draw attention to non-compliance with procurement rules.  This is disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111900002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1605785400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I understand that we are not going to deal with Chapter 14 on tax appeals today.  As requested, I will keep my comments brief.<\/p> <p>  I am accompanied today by Brian Boyle, accountant general and Angela O&rsquo;Gorman, Comptroller and Auditor General and committee liaison.<\/p> <p>  In the context of today&rsquo;s discussions, I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the Revenue account, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has highlighted the key receipts, in the interest of time I will move on to the appropriation account.  Revenue&rsquo;s estimate for 2019 was originally &euro;446 million.  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;4.1 million was obtained for Brexit infrastructure.  The final Estimate was &euro;382.7 million net of appropriations-in-aid.  The net outturn was &euro;378.5 million.<\/p> <p>  Pay and associated costs accounted for &euro;319.1 million of the gross outturn of &euro;449.1 million.  There were 6,959 people working in Revenue equivalent to 6,708 full-time equivalents at the end of 2019.  In 2019, we continued to invest in ICT systems, which was the second largest item of expenditure at &euro;57.4 million.<\/p> <p>  In 2019, we delivered a range of measures to support voluntary compliance and implemented a robust response to non-compliance.<\/p><p>We had over 4.2 million customer contacts and supported compliance for 3.2 million employments, 1 million businesses and 1.4 million property owners.  We continued to enhance and improve our range of online services, improving taxpayer experience while minimising the risk of non-compliance.<\/p><p> Revenue continued to engage in extensive and detailed Brexit preparedness and contingency planning.  Our planning is strongly focused on facilitating legitimate trade, enhancing competitiveness and supporting business while managing compliance risks.  <\/p><p> PAYE modernisation delivered the most significant reform of the PAYE system since it was introduced in 1960.  Real-time payroll information facilitates the collection of the right tax at the right time and the enhancement of online services to PAYE taxpayers.<\/p><p> On the tax compliance front, we carried out over 566,000 compliance interventions, yielding &euro;548 million in tax, interest and penalties, in 2019.<\/p><p> The Covid-19 pandemic presents very significant challenges for the economy, both for businesses and individual workers.  Our investment in real-time payroll reporting meant that we were able to quickly re-engineer our PAYE system in conjunction with the payroll software sector to support employers and employees.  The temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, provided more than &euro;2.8 billion in support to 66,500 employers in respect of 664,000 employees between 26 March and 31 August.  The employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, replaced the TWSS from 1 September and to date over &euro;795 million has been paid to over 38,000 eligible employers in respect of 410,000 employees.  Businesses can now also register for the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, through the Revenue online service, and over 10,000 businesses have applied.  The first payments were claimed through the scheme on Tuesday and well over &euro;20 million will be paid out by the end of this week.  The debt warehousing scheme has parked &euro;2.2 billion in tax arrears on behalf of businesses suffering a Covid-19-related trading downturn.<\/p><p> The committee has also expressed an interest in bogus self-employment and I have provided information in advance of this meeting.<\/p><p> Last March, the country faced into an unprecedented and uncertain future.  We responded immediately to support compliant businesses through the uncertain environment.  We also looked beyond our mission, which is \"to serve the community by fairly and efficiently collecting taxes and duties and implementing customs controls\", to see how we could use our operational know-how, technology and systems to support tax-compliant businesses.  In conjunction with our colleagues in the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Social Protection and others we developed legislative and technology solutions and implemented schemes within the tightest of timeframes.<\/p><p> We also supported the HSE and the Department of Health with contact tracing and data analytics assistance, including the temporary deployment of resources.  We have reprioritised our work and shifted to new ways of working.  Our secure and sophisticated ICT framework allowed us to quickly pivot to remote working and today we have over 5,000 staff working from home dealing with taxpayers, taking and making telephone calls about a wide variety of issues such as Brexit preparations and tax repayments, and dealing with complex international tax issues, etc.  There have been almost 3 million customer contacts so far this year compared to 4.2 million for all of 2019.  We have not diluted our role in tackling smuggling as well as countering excise fraud.  The last six months have seen significant seizures of drugs and cigarettes and we continue to work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our international partners in tackling illegal activity.<\/p><p> If the pandemic had not happened the big focus this year would have been Brexit preparations.  However, we have continued our preparations across all fronts in staffing, technology, infrastructure and engagement with business, in partnership with our colleagues in the other State agencies.  There remains uncertainty about the final outcome of Brexit, but it is clear that as the UK leaves the Single Market and the customs union there will be significant change for imports and exports to, from and through Great Britain.<\/p><p> I cannot speak highly enough about how my colleagues have responded to the changed environment arising from Covid-19.  They have developed new schemes, implemented complex systems at unprecedented pace and changed work practices to better assist taxpayers and businesses.  I have no doubt that we have made a few mistakes along the way, but we have also learned a great deal in a short space of time, and we have adapted and shown our resilience as we have gone on.  I am very proud of how Revenue responded to the pandemic.  Our staff adapted very quickly to new ways of working, many using their own devices to work from home.  Our managers and staff at all levels have engaged with and supported each other through a challenging work environment.  I want to take this opportunity to thank them all for their commitment and professionalism in these challenging times.<\/p><p> Finally, I will again draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to section 851A and my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality.  Subject to this constraint, I will try to answer any questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111900002#A00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605785400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cody for his opening statement.

To be honest, towards the end of March some of us had doubts about how all of this was going to be managed.  It was managed, and by and large the feedback from the public has been very good.  I want to acknowledge that.

We started before the referendum result in the UK.  In the 2017 budget we put forward a case to the Minister at the time for funding to facilitate ICT development.  In that budget, we got &euro;2 million in additional funding on the ICT framework to start work before anybody knew how anything would work out.  We then started engagement with our colleagues on the infrastructure side and set up various working groups.  Eventually, the Government - and I do not use the word \"eventually\" the way it sounds there - set up a group chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on infrastructure development.  The OPW was then engaged to develop the facilities in Dublin Airport, Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort.<\/p> <p>  With regard to infrastructure, the OPW figure for 2019 was &euro;36 million on physical infrastructure in those particular locations.  That is what led to the &euro;4.1 million supplementary budget.  The &euro;36 million was apportioned between the various agencies.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine was the biggest element because it has the biggest requirement for physical infrastructure.  That work continued into 2020.

This could throw Revenue's system into disarray.  In essence, what the ferry companies are saying is they will not alter their schedules but they will reduce capacity for trucks on the ferries, which totally throws into disarray the Irish Maritime Development Office's report that states we have sufficient capacity.  The whole problem is that we are only six weeks out and we do not have a significant coherent plan that states Revenue is working with the ships, the ferry operators and the ports.  It seems we are at a very late stage to be trying to say this is all going to work and it has cost so much money.  As Mr. Cody said, 2016 was when we started discussing Brexit.

I do know that we have paid out in excess of &euro;3.6 billion between both schemes.  The TWSS was before the D&aacute;il on 26 March, the Seanad on 27 March and signed into law on 27 March by the President.  On 27 March, we paid out our first amounts under TWSS.  If this was normal times and we were asked to do something like this in our area of competence, we would probably say that it would take from the budget timeframe of early October to January 12 months, or 15 months, to develop a system like it.<\/p> <p>  I was talking to the person who was trying to draft the legislation on the Sunday night before it was brought before the D&aacute;il.  We were chatting and he was telling me how he proposed to draft it and I said to him that there were no final decisions at that point by Government because the Cabinet was meeting on the Monday or the Tuesday.  We implemented a scheme that was complex.  I had intended to use the phrase \"in jig time\" in my opening remarks but my board colleagues would not let me use it.  I think it has been exceptional.  The system, because of the investment in PAYE modernisation, was the basis on which we could do.  We developed PAYE modernisation, which, to me, is one of our biggest achievements over the past ten years, but we had no idea when we were developing it what it would be used for.  It is important to recognise all of the work that was done by the software developers association.  We need them to engage with us to have the systems engaging.  From our perspective, it has worked really well.<\/p> <p>  We have a tail to TWSS.  I mentioned that we made mistakes.  Some were mistakes we knew we were making.  At the introduction, the transition phase of TWSS from 26 March to 4 May, we paid out &euro;410, which was the maximum, to each employee even though we knew all of them were not entitled to the full amount.  The choice was about getting the money paid out to employers or waiting until we had the full system developed.  We decided, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and the Minister, that it was more important that we got money to the employers when they were facing what they were facing.  Now, we are in a process of reconciliation, in respect of which Mr. Boyle is chairing a working group.  I imagine at times when he is at lengthy meetings about this, he thinks that was a terrible mistake and that we should have paid &euro;300 and we would have a lot less reconciliation to do.  We made conscious decisions.  I sometimes think that we forget what it was like on 12, 13 and 14 March.  We really did not know what was going to happen.  We did not know what businesses would be able to do.  I mentioned in my opening remarks that we made mistakes.  For the most part, that is aimed at the Comptroller and Auditor General whose team is already in examining all of the mistakes we made in TWSS and EWSS but they were made for the right reasons.  We will get through them.<\/p> <p>  The system has worked really well.  Our investment in real time has been worthwhile in terms of how we administer the tax system.

That becomes the basis on which a taxpayer can claim additional credits, health expenses and so on or can report non-PAYE income.  In mid-January, employees will be able to look to see what their end-of-year statements look like.  That will incorporate any liability that arises under the TWSS.<br\/><br\/>No liability arises under the EWSS because it is run through payroll and is a subsidy to the employer and PAYE normally operates on wages.  Regarding the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, the feed from the Department of Social Protection will also be incorporated.  This matter is currently under consideration in the Finance Bill, but it is anticipated that, once the Bill is passed, the PUP will be subject to PAYE but not USC, given that social welfare liabilities are not subject to USC.<br\/><br\/>In January, an employee will be able to see whether he or she owes us money because of the TWSS.  If he or she does, the employee will have the opportunity to pay us.  Alternatively, we will collect it over the following four years through a reduction in tax credits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111900002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1605785400,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Will that be done retrospectively?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111900002#E00600","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605785400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>There will be a liability for 2020, which will be collected from 2022 to 2026 by an interest-free reduction in credits.

I wish to raise the delays arising from Covid-19 in dealing with certain issues.  A number of people have contacted me about family members who have loans under the fair deal scheme.  As our guests will be aware, the moneys must be paid back and that is done through Revenue.  The problem now is that because of Covid, there is a delay in taking out grants of probate.  A number of people who contacted me are concerned that they will be charged interest because they cannot complete the probate in time and, therefore, cannot collect the funds to pay back Revenue.  Will people be accommodated in circumstances where there is a genuine delay beyond the control of the executors?<\/p> <p>  The second issue I wish to raise relates to vehicle registration tax, VRT.

As our guests will be aware, none of these vehicles can come in without having being paid for.  Suppliers, therefore, lose a great deal of money and have to wait up to three months before they can get that money back.  My understanding is that some car importers in Cork are having to go as far as Galway, Waterford, Kerry or Limerick to have cars assessed for VRT.

The courier sector is one that has been highlighted to me.  In 2000, the Committee of Public Accounts wrote to Revenue about couriers being treated as <i>de facto<\/i>self-employed people.  The response received at that time indicated that there was a special bespoke tax agreement between Revenue and a group of couriers that were represented by an accountancy firm or group of solicitors.  While the staff involved that the time were listed as employees, they could change their status to a class S PRSI contribution.  I understand what such a contribution is.  This issue was referred to a few moments ago in terms of avoiding the payment of employers' PRSI, which is obviously a major concern to taxpayers and to employers who pay the balance of what is due on the basis of the different income bands.  The agreement to which I refer was discontinued, as I understand it.  How much was lost in employers' PRSI contributions as a result of that special arrangement?

Mr. Cody has commented on the ICT abilities of the organisation and that certainly was not in doubt, particularly for us as public representatives who deal with the Revenue with such a volume of queries.

It is important because the deadline is 10 December and I ask the Revenue Commissioners to show a bit of flexibility there.

The effect is to give fuel launderers the opportunity to raise their heads again.  Equally, the Revenue Commissioners were handed, virtually on a plate, the ability to detect anybody who may be using laundered fuel by virtue of the fact that people would be signing up for the diesel rebate scheme.  Has the Revenue carried out any investigations into the number of operators who were entitled to claim it and those who actually signed up to claim it?  Mr. Cody can come back to me on that.  Ultimately, what this committee is about is value for money.  The objective of that scheme cures one problem while benefiting a sector to stay on the straight and narrow and not give the opportunity to launderers to come back.<\/p> <p>  I have a minute left to go back to what we discussed earlier.  It is, again, about public money and the value that the public gets for how its money is spent.  It will probably be a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer again.  Is it fair to say that the land bridge traffic, as it currently stands, now must operate under the common transit convention, CTC, which causes customs procedures, not only for SMEs but also for Revenue, to be brought into play at minimum unit loads of 150,000?  That could turn into multiples of that when it comes to the common transit convention paperwork.  Given the cost of administering the CTC and the bond that goes in place, which is basically going to clog up ports with traffic of the EU Single Market either on the land bridge or into the UK, would that money not be better spent from a public money perspective providing shipping infrastructure that allows the Single Market traffic to flow freely without being interfered with by customs?  For the small SMEs of this country, it is purported that one customs transaction will take an hour.  That is not feasible for many small businesses.  Does Mr. Cody advise Government in this capacity and would he be in agreement with that statement?  I refer to public money and value for money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111900002#L01500","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605785400,"counter":209,"content":"<p>As we said earlier, the impact of Brexit will increase costs on business and on SMEs.

That is a huge cost on business and will be a big impact.  The extent to which businesses can divert from the land bridge, and that has regard to the nature of the goods, is something that will seriously have to be looked at by business.

If a family brings in someone from abroad to live permanently with its elderly relative and is paying that person a salary, it cannot bring that person in unless it pays him or her &euro;30,000 per annum or more.  Revenue will not take accommodation and food being provided to the person providing care into account.  Revenue makes no allowance for that.  If someone has free accommodation for 12 months, has probably earned &euro;80 to &euro;100 per week and has had all of his or her meals provided, that is not taken into account in coming to the figure of &euro;30,000.  Would Revenue consider reviewing that issue because we will not be able to deal with this problem over the next six to seven years unless there are major changes?  Israel allows people to come in for a maximum of five years.  I ask that Revenue gives serious consideration to this type of scheme, in other words, allowing for accommodation to be taken into account in arriving at the figure of &euro;30,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111900002#L04300","speaker":"1523","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605785400,"counter":232,"content":"<p>We have no role with regard to immigration.

Could I prompt him to examine correspondence that was sent to this committee by Revenue on 9 August 2000?  The reference I am told is PS 3422M\/00.  That correspondence enclosed letters dated 7 March 1997 and 3 April 1997 to K. Ryan &amp;amp; Co, which represented courier firms, an issue we discussed earlier.  The Revenue letter to the Committee of Public Accounts stated that the letters outline the agreement reached for tax purposes.  It might give Mr. Cody an indication of the issue raised by the Chairman and myself.  I reiterate that bogus self-employment is a crucially important issue because of the income that is lost but also because it breaches the social contract in which we are all engaged with significant repercussions.  There has been significant political debate regarding pension age.  If we do not take in enough PRSI receipts, it gives succour to those who want to force people to work longer.  I ask for a tough approach on the part of Revenue.  If ten people working in the same place all have their accounts to Revenue presented by the same company and all have similar working hours and arrangements, Revenue can be fairly sure there is bogus self-employment.  Likewise if somebody is working in a meat factory and earning the minimum wage, Revenue can be fairly sure he or she is not genuinely self-employed.  If somebody coming from eastern Europe finds himself or herself working in a meat factory under a new company and he or she decides out of the goodness of his or her heart to give that company half of his or her wages, there is a problem.<\/p><p>I will go completely left-field in my final question.  An article in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>on appointments within Revenue caught my attention.  It was very strange.  It outlined appointments to principal officer level over the past number of years and indicated that out of ten appointments this year up to September, nine were awarded to female candidates while in 2019, nine were made to female candidates and two to male candidates.  Revenue denied that there was any gender imbalance.  Could Mr. Cody indicate whether all of those appointments are internal or external?  What is the current overall gender balance at principal officer level?  I imagine that like most Departments, there is probably an historic gender imbalance that predominantly affects women.  Will any corrective measures will be taken to ensure we have a correct balance across the Civil Service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111900002#M01300","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605785400,"counter":244,"content":"<p>A total of 63% of Revenue staff are female while 55% of principal officers are female.

We do not engage in discrimination on any grounds.  Our recruitment and competitions are all subject to scrutiny by the Public Appointments Service.  The post of principal officer referred to by the Deputy would have been filled by interdepartmental open competition and internal competition.  The organisation is increasingly reflecting the actual gender breakdown so it is quite a positive story.  I am disappointed that Deputy Catherine Murphy left before this because for the past five years in this committee, we have always had a chat with her and Deputy Connolly about gender.  I would always have to remind them that my predecessor was also a woman.  To put it in perspective, we had an assistant principal conference that was reflected in the article where all the assistant principals would have been here before Covid at which that claim was made to me.  I answered from the stage that there was no discrimination.  We have published the gender pay gap on our website in anticipation of changes that are coming with legislation for Revenue.

Further measures are contained in this Bill.<\/p><p>Article 31 of the directive requires that all member states establish a central register of beneficial ownership of express trusts.  The deadline for transposition of this article was March 2020.  It has been difficult to introduce legislation to provide for the establishment of this register, largely due to the extensive use of trusts in our common law jurisdiction.  Trusts are far more widespread in Ireland than in other civil law member states.  Fortunately, many trusts operate in sectors that are regulated and where the risk of money laundering is low.  As a widely-used mechanism in common law states, the flexibility of the trust is shown by its use for purposes such as pension funds, employee share funds, charities and sports clubs.  Trust are generally not used for these purposes in other members states.  Rather, the legal vehicles used across the EU are contractual arrangements or corporate entitles and as a result they come within the article 30 remit, which has less onerous reporting requirements.  As a result of trusts being used for these purposes in Ireland, Irish individuals could be discriminated against <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>citizens of other member states as they could find their personal information placed on a register merely by virtue of being a member of a pension scheme or in receipt of shares from their employer.  There are also significant data protection considerations, as acknowledged by the European Commission and echoed in advices from its legal services.<\/p><p>It is important to note that there is a requirement for the registers of all member states to be interconnected by March 2021.  This means that access to the information on these registers will be available not only to authorised bodies such as financial intelligence units and national competent authorities but also to the public across the EU where a legitimate interest can be shown.  Extensive consultation has taken place with the Office of the Attorney General, with external counsel and with solicitors both domestic and international to find an approach to transposition that would meet with the spirit of the directive, align us as closely as possible with our member state counterparts and impose only a proportionate and equitable legislative framework on Irish trustees and beneficiaries of trusts, whether institutional or individual.  These amendments are the result of that consultation.<\/p><p>An autonomous interpretation approach has been taken to the definition of &quot;express trusts&quot; and in doing so, similar arrangements in other member states have been considered.  The Attorney General advised that the effect of this interpretation under EU law is that a member state is entitled to exclude from the ambit of the article those trusts that are excluded by other member states by reason of their using a legal vehicle or similar arrangement that is not a trust.  As a result, occupational pension schemes, employee share schemes and the Haemophilia HIV Trust have been excluded from the requirement to register.  With regard to pensions and share schemes, further provisions may be made by regulations to capture beneficial ownership in a similar manner to other member states that do so with reference to article 30.  I am introducing a specific definition of &quot;beneficial owner&quot; for amateur sports bodies and unincorporated charities such that only the trustees, committee, governing body or individuals in control of the trust will have to register rather than every member of a club or every individual who donates to or is assisted by a charity.  Incorporated sports bodies and charities are obliged to register under SI 16 of 2019, which transposed article 30 and established a register of beneficial ownership for corporate identities.  These amendments also provide that I may further prescribe trusts to be included or excluded from the requirement to register under article 31 legislation, having taken into account factors such as the risk of money laundering and the way similar structures are captured in other member states.  For example, if it comes to my attention that there is an issue with a particular trust type, I can, as Minister, include them on the register.  Conversely, if it is shown that there is low risk, the Minister for Finance can exclude them completely.<\/p><p>AML, and counter-terrorist financing, CTF, has become an increasingly high-profile item on the EU agenda.  At the most recent meeting of ECOFIN, a comprehensive set of conclusions were agreed that aimed to strengthen and reform legislation in this area with the aim of publishing legislative proposals in the first quarter of next year.  Two of the most significant proposals concern the introduction of an EU single rule book and single supervisor in these areas.  It is anticipated that these matters will be achieved through the establishment of a stand-alone EU authority in these areas.  Given the uniqueness of our common law jurisdiction following the exit of the UK from the Union, I have ensured that these conclusions require any future developments of frameworks in these areas to take account of common law jurisdictions as well as civil law ones.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2020111900002#B00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Section 2, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":270,"content":"<p>SECTION 3<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1605744000,"counter":271,"content":"<p>There are a number of amendments to this section.

In framing this regime, we have sought to address our EU obligations, as well as the international obligations that arise from our membership of the Financial Action Task Force, FATF.  The FATF is the international organisation that sets global standards to fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Ireland is a long-standing member.<\/p><p> FATF has 40 recommendations, known as standards, which together provide guidance to members on what an effective AML-CFT framework looks like.  Our proposals for the Bill will address the VASPs criteria contained within the standards and therefore further strengthen our financial services framework to shield from the scourge that is money laundering and terrorist financing. <\/p><p> As part of the management and mitigation of emerging money laundering and terrorist financing regimes, FATF recommends that countries ensure VASPs are registered and effectively supervised for AML-CFT purposes.  In addition, the FATF guidance requires a VASP registration regime to allow for the Central Bank's withdrawal, restriction or suspension of a registration, where appropriate.  FATF also advocates for an offence of operating without a registration.  <\/p><p> Furthermore, FATF recommends that five categories of virtual asset service providers be supervised rather than the two specified in the fifth AML directive.  While there is a marked difference between the approaches of the EU and FATF on this issue currently, members should note that the EU has clearly indicated its intention to align EU rules in this area, with the FATF recommendations, as soon as possible.  Therefore our approach, in adopting legislation now that addresses the FATF recommendations, is careful.  It strengthens our financial systems and places us ahead of the curve in regard to EU requirements.  We believe it is in our best interest to construct our regulatory framework to meet both our EU and international obligations at this time.  The proposed chapter 9A addresses the requirements of the fifth AML directive and also the regime anticipated with reference to FATF guidance.  <\/p><p> The new chapter provides for the following: a registration and supervision regime, for AML-CFT purposes, for providers of services relating to virtual assets; enablement of the Central Bank, as competent authority, to undertake a detailed assessment of a firm's policies and procedures before granting registration; a fitness and probity regime to allow the Central Bank to undertake an assessment of the fitness and probity of the beneficial owners of these providers, before granting registration; enablement of the Central Bank to refuse a registration in circumstances where the Bank is not satisfied with the firm's AML-CFT policies and procedures, and-or the fitness and probity of the senior management and-or beneficial owners of the firm; and transitional arrangements for incumbent virtual asset service providers.<\/p><p> The regime proposed will contribute towards maintaining a robust framework in this area for Ireland.  It will need to be updated continuously, however, to meet the ever-changing and emerging money laundering and terrorist financing threats across the world.<\/p><p> As mentioned at the outset, this is a substantial amendment that includes a many provisions.  If members wish for me to speak in more detail about a particular section, I will be happy to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2020111900002#B00900","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1605744000,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 6, to delete lines 24 to 31 and substitute the following:  \t&quot;'virtual asset' means a digital representation of value that can be digitally traded or transferred and can be used for payment or investment purposes but does not include digital representations of fiat currencies, securities or other financial assets;<br \/><br \/>'virtual asset service provider' means a person who by way of business carries out one or more of the following activities for, or on behalf of, another person:<br \/><br \/>(a) exchange between virtual assets and fiat currencies;<br \/><br \/>(b) exchange between one or more forms of virtual assets;<br \/><br \/>(c) transfer of virtual assets, that is to say, conduct a transaction on behalf of another person that moves a virtual asset from one virtual asset address or account to another;<br \/><br \/>(d) custodian wallet provider;<br \/><br \/>(e) participation in, and provision of, financial services related to an issuer's offer or sale of a virtual asset or both; <br \/><br \/>but does not include a designated person that is not a financial or credit institution and that provides virtual asset services in an incidental manner and is subject to supervision by a national competent authority, other than the Bank;&quot;.&quot;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2020111900002#C00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":277,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":278,"content":"<p>Section 3, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":279,"content":"<p>SECTION 4<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1605744000,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 4:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, to delete lines 7 and 8 and substitute the following:  \t&quot; &quot;(ia) a virtual asset service provider,&quot;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2020111900002#C00700","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":281,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":282,"content":"<p>Section 4, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":283,"content":"<p>Sections 5 to 8, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":284,"content":"<p>SECTION 9<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1605744000,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 5 was tabled in the names of Deputies Michael Collins, Danny Healy-Rae, Michael Healy-Rae, Mattie McGrath, Nolan and O'Donoghue.

I thank every member, from the bottom of my heart, for committing to be on this Joint Committee on the Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community.  There is some unfinished work.  In the previous D&aacute;il the committee had a brilliant Chairman, the former Senator Colette Kelleher, who started a great deal of work.  I thank her for all her hard work.  I also thank the Ceann Comhairle for establishing this special committee.  We look forward to tackling some of the inequality and issues that impact on the Traveller community, and I look forward to working with all the members.  I propose that the committee go into private session.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2020111900002#A01100","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":345,"content":"<p>The joint committee went into private session at 2.09 p.m. and adjourned at 2.44 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Thursday, 3 December 2020.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
