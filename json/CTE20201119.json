The Commissioners account for these receipts and transfers in the annual Revenue account.  The account for 2019 was certified by me on 17 April 2020 and received a clear audit opinion.<\/p> <p>  Total receipts into the Revenue account in 2019 amounted to over &euro;84.2 billion.  Revenue made repayments to taxpayers totalling &euro;10.1 billion in the year.  As a result, the net receipts brought to account in 2019 amounted to just over &euro;74.1 billion.<\/p> <p>  Tax receipts payable to the Central Fund amounted to a net &euro;58.3 billion in 2019.  This represented an increase of approximately &euro;3.7 billion or 7%, compared with 2018.  Note 1 to the account provides a breakdown of the receipts for the main tax headings.  Other than capital acquisition tax, which experienced a very marginal decrease, all tax receipts increased year on year when compared with 2018.<\/p> <p>  Non-Exchequer receipts increased from a net &euro;14 billion in 2018 to &euro;15.8 billion in 2019, an increase of 12.9% year on year.  Note 2 to the account presents an analysis of these receipts.  This indicates that pay related social insurance, PRSI, receipts accounted for &euro;12.3 billion of the total in 2019.  These receipts are payable to the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p> <p>  Also included in non-Exchequer receipts was &euro;2 billion received under the VAT mini one-stop-shop, MOSS, scheme in 2019.  This was up 43% from the &euro;1.4 billion collected in 2018.  The receipts represent amounts collected on behalf of other EU member states under place-of-supply VAT rules in place since 2015.  These apply to businesses registered for VAT MOSS in Ireland which provide telecommunications, broadcasting or electronically supplied services to consumers across borders.  VAT MOSS receipts collected by revenue authorities in other member states relevant to services delivered to Irish residents are disclosed in the note on tax receipts.<\/p> <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s administration and operational expenses are charged to Vote 9 - Office of the Revenue Commissioners, rather than to the Revenue account.  The Vote had total gross expenditure of &euro;449 million in 2019.  Salaries totalling &euro;319 million continue to be the largest element of spend for Revenue.<\/p> <p>  The initial estimate for Revenue for 2019 was &euro;446 million.  Subsequently, a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;4.1 million was provided to meet certain costs incurred by the Office of Public Works on behalf of Revenue, relating to new infrastructure it required at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and Dublin Airport in preparation for Brexit.<\/p> <p>  Appropriations-in-aid of the Vote for 2019 totalled &euro;70.5 million.  Over half of this is accounted for by payments received in respect of the agency service provided by Revenue to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection related to the collection and pay-over of PRSI receipts.<\/p> <p>  Net expenditure under the Vote amounted to &euro;378.5 million, and the surrender for the year was &euro;4.2 million.<\/p> <p>  In my report on the appropriation account for 2019, I draw attention to non-compliance with procurement rules.  This is disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111900002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1605785400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I understand that we are not going to deal with Chapter 14 on tax appeals today.  As requested, I will keep my comments brief.<\/p> <p>  I am accompanied today by Brian Boyle, accountant general and Angela O&rsquo;Gorman, Comptroller and Auditor General and committee liaison.<\/p> <p>  In the context of today&rsquo;s discussions, I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the Revenue account, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has highlighted the key receipts, in the interest of time I will move on to the appropriation account.  Revenue&rsquo;s estimate for 2019 was originally &euro;446 million.  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;4.1 million was obtained for Brexit infrastructure.  The final Estimate was &euro;382.7 million net of appropriations-in-aid.  The net outturn was &euro;378.5 million.<\/p> <p>  Pay and associated costs accounted for &euro;319.1 million of the gross outturn of &euro;449.1 million.  There were 6,959 people working in Revenue equivalent to 6,708 full-time equivalents at the end of 2019.  In 2019, we continued to invest in ICT systems, which was the second largest item of expenditure at &euro;57.4 million.<\/p> <p>  In 2019, we delivered a range of measures to support voluntary compliance and implemented a robust response to non-compliance.<\/p><p>We had over 4.2 million customer contacts and supported compliance for 3.2 million employments, 1 million businesses and 1.4 million property owners.  We continued to enhance and improve our range of online services, improving taxpayer experience while minimising the risk of non-compliance.<\/p><p> Revenue continued to engage in extensive and detailed Brexit preparedness and contingency planning.  Our planning is strongly focused on facilitating legitimate trade, enhancing competitiveness and supporting business while managing compliance risks.  <\/p><p> PAYE modernisation delivered the most significant reform of the PAYE system since it was introduced in 1960.  Real-time payroll information facilitates the collection of the right tax at the right time and the enhancement of online services to PAYE taxpayers.<\/p><p> On the tax compliance front, we carried out over 566,000 compliance interventions, yielding &euro;548 million in tax, interest and penalties, in 2019.<\/p><p> The Covid-19 pandemic presents very significant challenges for the economy, both for businesses and individual workers.  Our investment in real-time payroll reporting meant that we were able to quickly re-engineer our PAYE system in conjunction with the payroll software sector to support employers and employees.  The temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, provided more than &euro;2.8 billion in support to 66,500 employers in respect of 664,000 employees between 26 March and 31 August.  The employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, replaced the TWSS from 1 September and to date over &euro;795 million has been paid to over 38,000 eligible employers in respect of 410,000 employees.  Businesses can now also register for the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, through the Revenue online service, and over 10,000 businesses have applied.  The first payments were claimed through the scheme on Tuesday and well over &euro;20 million will be paid out by the end of this week.  The debt warehousing scheme has parked &euro;2.2 billion in tax arrears on behalf of businesses suffering a Covid-19-related trading downturn.<\/p><p> The committee has also expressed an interest in bogus self-employment and I have provided information in advance of this meeting.<\/p><p> Last March, the country faced into an unprecedented and uncertain future.  We responded immediately to support compliant businesses through the uncertain environment.  We also looked beyond our mission, which is \"to serve the community by fairly and efficiently collecting taxes and duties and implementing customs controls\", to see how we could use our operational know-how, technology and systems to support tax-compliant businesses.  In conjunction with our colleagues in the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Social Protection and others we developed legislative and technology solutions and implemented schemes within the tightest of timeframes.<\/p><p> We also supported the HSE and the Department of Health with contact tracing and data analytics assistance, including the temporary deployment of resources.  We have reprioritised our work and shifted to new ways of working.  Our secure and sophisticated ICT framework allowed us to quickly pivot to remote working and today we have over 5,000 staff working from home dealing with taxpayers, taking and making telephone calls about a wide variety of issues such as Brexit preparations and tax repayments, and dealing with complex international tax issues, etc.  There have been almost 3 million customer contacts so far this year compared to 4.2 million for all of 2019.  We have not diluted our role in tackling smuggling as well as countering excise fraud.  The last six months have seen significant seizures of drugs and cigarettes and we continue to work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our international partners in tackling illegal activity.<\/p><p> If the pandemic had not happened the big focus this year would have been Brexit preparations.  However, we have continued our preparations across all fronts in staffing, technology, infrastructure and engagement with business, in partnership with our colleagues in the other State agencies.  There remains uncertainty about the final outcome of Brexit, but it is clear that as the UK leaves the Single Market and the customs union there will be significant change for imports and exports to, from and through Great Britain.<\/p><p> I cannot speak highly enough about how my colleagues have responded to the changed environment arising from Covid-19.  They have developed new schemes, implemented complex systems at unprecedented pace and changed work practices to better assist taxpayers and businesses.  I have no doubt that we have made a few mistakes along the way, but we have also learned a great deal in a short space of time, and we have adapted and shown our resilience as we have gone on.  I am very proud of how Revenue responded to the pandemic.  Our staff adapted very quickly to new ways of working, many using their own devices to work from home.  Our managers and staff at all levels have engaged with and supported each other through a challenging work environment.  I want to take this opportunity to thank them all for their commitment and professionalism in these challenging times.<\/p><p> Finally, I will again draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to section 851A and my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality.  Subject to this constraint, I will try to answer any questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111900002#A00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605785400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cody for his opening statement.

To be honest, towards the end of March some of us had doubts about how all of this was going to be managed.  It was managed, and by and large the feedback from the public has been very good.  I want to acknowledge that.

We started before the referendum result in the UK.  In the 2017 budget we put forward a case to the Minister at the time for funding to facilitate ICT development.  In that budget, we got &euro;2 million in additional funding on the ICT framework to start work before anybody knew how anything would work out.  We then started engagement with our colleagues on the infrastructure side and set up various working groups.  Eventually, the Government - and I do not use the word \"eventually\" the way it sounds there - set up a group chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on infrastructure development.  The OPW was then engaged to develop the facilities in Dublin Airport, Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort.<\/p> <p>  With regard to infrastructure, the OPW figure for 2019 was &euro;36 million on physical infrastructure in those particular locations.  That is what led to the &euro;4.1 million supplementary budget.  The &euro;36 million was apportioned between the various agencies.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine was the biggest element because it has the biggest requirement for physical infrastructure.  That work continued into 2020.

This could throw Revenue's system into disarray.  In essence, what the ferry companies are saying is they will not alter their schedules but they will reduce capacity for trucks on the ferries, which totally throws into disarray the Irish Maritime Development Office's report that states we have sufficient capacity.  The whole problem is that we are only six weeks out and we do not have a significant coherent plan that states Revenue is working with the ships, the ferry operators and the ports.  It seems we are at a very late stage to be trying to say this is all going to work and it has cost so much money.  As Mr. Cody said, 2016 was when we started discussing Brexit.

I do know that we have paid out in excess of &euro;3.6 billion between both schemes.  The TWSS was before the D&aacute;il on 26 March, the Seanad on 27 March and signed into law on 27 March by the President.  On 27 March, we paid out our first amounts under TWSS.  If this was normal times and we were asked to do something like this in our area of competence, we would probably say that it would take from the budget timeframe of early October to January 12 months, or 15 months, to develop a system like it.<\/p> <p>  I was talking to the person who was trying to draft the legislation on the Sunday night before it was brought before the D&aacute;il.  We were chatting and he was telling me how he proposed to draft it and I said to him that there were no final decisions at that point by Government because the Cabinet was meeting on the Monday or the Tuesday.  We implemented a scheme that was complex.  I had intended to use the phrase \"in jig time\" in my opening remarks but my board colleagues would not let me use it.  I think it has been exceptional.  The system, because of the investment in PAYE modernisation, was the basis on which we could do.  We developed PAYE modernisation, which, to me, is one of our biggest achievements over the past ten years, but we had no idea when we were developing it what it would be used for.  It is important to recognise all of the work that was done by the software developers association.  We need them to engage with us to have the systems engaging.  From our perspective, it has worked really well.<\/p> <p>  We have a tail to TWSS.  I mentioned that we made mistakes.  Some were mistakes we knew we were making.  At the introduction, the transition phase of TWSS from 26 March to 4 May, we paid out &euro;410, which was the maximum, to each employee even though we knew all of them were not entitled to the full amount.  The choice was about getting the money paid out to employers or waiting until we had the full system developed.  We decided, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and the Minister, that it was more important that we got money to the employers when they were facing what they were facing.  Now, we are in a process of reconciliation, in respect of which Mr. Boyle is chairing a working group.  I imagine at times when he is at lengthy meetings about this, he thinks that was a terrible mistake and that we should have paid &euro;300 and we would have a lot less reconciliation to do.  We made conscious decisions.  I sometimes think that we forget what it was like on 12, 13 and 14 March.  We really did not know what was going to happen.  We did not know what businesses would be able to do.  I mentioned in my opening remarks that we made mistakes.  For the most part, that is aimed at the Comptroller and Auditor General whose team is already in examining all of the mistakes we made in TWSS and EWSS but they were made for the right reasons.  We will get through them.<\/p> <p>  The system has worked really well.  Our investment in real time has been worthwhile in terms of how we administer the tax system.

That becomes the basis on which a taxpayer can claim additional credits, health expenses and so on or can report non-PAYE income.  In mid-January, employees will be able to look to see what their end-of-year statements look like.  That will incorporate any liability that arises under the TWSS.<br\/><br\/>No liability arises under the EWSS because it is run through payroll and is a subsidy to the employer and PAYE normally operates on wages.  Regarding the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, the feed from the Department of Social Protection will also be incorporated.  This matter is currently under consideration in the Finance Bill, but it is anticipated that, once the Bill is passed, the PUP will be subject to PAYE but not USC, given that social welfare liabilities are not subject to USC.<br\/><br\/>In January, an employee will be able to see whether he or she owes us money because of the TWSS.  If he or she does, the employee will have the opportunity to pay us.  Alternatively, we will collect it over the following four years through a reduction in tax credits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111900002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1605785400,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Will that be done retrospectively?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111900002#E00600","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605785400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>There will be a liability for 2020, which will be collected from 2022 to 2026 by an interest-free reduction in credits.

I wish to raise the delays arising from Covid-19 in dealing with certain issues.  A number of people have contacted me about family members who have loans under the fair deal scheme.  As our guests will be aware, the moneys must be paid back and that is done through Revenue.  The problem now is that because of Covid, there is a delay in taking out grants of probate.  A number of people who contacted me are concerned that they will be charged interest because they cannot complete the probate in time and, therefore, cannot collect the funds to pay back Revenue.  Will people be accommodated in circumstances where there is a genuine delay beyond the control of the executors?<\/p> <p>  The second issue I wish to raise relates to vehicle registration tax, VRT.

As our guests will be aware, none of these vehicles can come in without having being paid for.  Suppliers, therefore, lose a great deal of money and have to wait up to three months before they can get that money back.  My understanding is that some car importers in Cork are having to go as far as Galway, Waterford, Kerry or Limerick to have cars assessed for VRT.

The courier sector is one that has been highlighted to me.  In 2000, the Committee of Public Accounts wrote to Revenue about couriers being treated as <i>de facto<\/i>self-employed people.  The response received at that time indicated that there was a special bespoke tax agreement between Revenue and a group of couriers that were represented by an accountancy firm or group of solicitors.  While the staff involved that the time were listed as employees, they could change their status to a class S PRSI contribution.  I understand what such a contribution is.  This issue was referred to a few moments ago in terms of avoiding the payment of employers' PRSI, which is obviously a major concern to taxpayers and to employers who pay the balance of what is due on the basis of the different income bands.  The agreement to which I refer was discontinued, as I understand it.  How much was lost in employers' PRSI contributions as a result of that special arrangement?

Mr. Cody has commented on the ICT abilities of the organisation and that certainly was not in doubt, particularly for us as public representatives who deal with the Revenue with such a volume of queries.

It is important because the deadline is 10 December and I ask the Revenue Commissioners to show a bit of flexibility there.

The effect is to give fuel launderers the opportunity to raise their heads again.  Equally, the Revenue Commissioners were handed, virtually on a plate, the ability to detect anybody who may be using laundered fuel by virtue of the fact that people would be signing up for the diesel rebate scheme.  Has the Revenue carried out any investigations into the number of operators who were entitled to claim it and those who actually signed up to claim it?  Mr. Cody can come back to me on that.  Ultimately, what this committee is about is value for money.  The objective of that scheme cures one problem while benefiting a sector to stay on the straight and narrow and not give the opportunity to launderers to come back.<\/p> <p>  I have a minute left to go back to what we discussed earlier.  It is, again, about public money and the value that the public gets for how its money is spent.  It will probably be a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer again.  Is it fair to say that the land bridge traffic, as it currently stands, now must operate under the common transit convention, CTC, which causes customs procedures, not only for SMEs but also for Revenue, to be brought into play at minimum unit loads of 150,000?  That could turn into multiples of that when it comes to the common transit convention paperwork.  Given the cost of administering the CTC and the bond that goes in place, which is basically going to clog up ports with traffic of the EU Single Market either on the land bridge or into the UK, would that money not be better spent from a public money perspective providing shipping infrastructure that allows the Single Market traffic to flow freely without being interfered with by customs?  For the small SMEs of this country, it is purported that one customs transaction will take an hour.  That is not feasible for many small businesses.  Does Mr. Cody advise Government in this capacity and would he be in agreement with that statement?  I refer to public money and value for money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111900002#L01500","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605785400,"counter":209,"content":"<p>As we said earlier, the impact of Brexit will increase costs on business and on SMEs.

That is a huge cost on business and will be a big impact.  The extent to which businesses can divert from the land bridge, and that has regard to the nature of the goods, is something that will seriously have to be looked at by business.

If a family brings in someone from abroad to live permanently with its elderly relative and is paying that person a salary, it cannot bring that person in unless it pays him or her &euro;30,000 per annum or more.  Revenue will not take accommodation and food being provided to the person providing care into account.  Revenue makes no allowance for that.  If someone has free accommodation for 12 months, has probably earned &euro;80 to &euro;100 per week and has had all of his or her meals provided, that is not taken into account in coming to the figure of &euro;30,000.  Would Revenue consider reviewing that issue because we will not be able to deal with this problem over the next six to seven years unless there are major changes?  Israel allows people to come in for a maximum of five years.  I ask that Revenue gives serious consideration to this type of scheme, in other words, allowing for accommodation to be taken into account in arriving at the figure of &euro;30,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111900002#L04300","speaker":"1523","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605785400,"counter":232,"content":"<p>We have no role with regard to immigration.

Could I prompt him to examine correspondence that was sent to this committee by Revenue on 9 August 2000?  The reference I am told is PS 3422M\/00.  That correspondence enclosed letters dated 7 March 1997 and 3 April 1997 to K. Ryan &amp;amp; Co, which represented courier firms, an issue we discussed earlier.  The Revenue letter to the Committee of Public Accounts stated that the letters outline the agreement reached for tax purposes.  It might give Mr. Cody an indication of the issue raised by the Chairman and myself.  I reiterate that bogus self-employment is a crucially important issue because of the income that is lost but also because it breaches the social contract in which we are all engaged with significant repercussions.  There has been significant political debate regarding pension age.  If we do not take in enough PRSI receipts, it gives succour to those who want to force people to work longer.  I ask for a tough approach on the part of Revenue.  If ten people working in the same place all have their accounts to Revenue presented by the same company and all have similar working hours and arrangements, Revenue can be fairly sure there is bogus self-employment.  Likewise if somebody is working in a meat factory and earning the minimum wage, Revenue can be fairly sure he or she is not genuinely self-employed.  If somebody coming from eastern Europe finds himself or herself working in a meat factory under a new company and he or she decides out of the goodness of his or her heart to give that company half of his or her wages, there is a problem.<\/p><p>I will go completely left-field in my final question.  An article in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>on appointments within Revenue caught my attention.  It was very strange.  It outlined appointments to principal officer level over the past number of years and indicated that out of ten appointments this year up to September, nine were awarded to female candidates while in 2019, nine were made to female candidates and two to male candidates.  Revenue denied that there was any gender imbalance.  Could Mr. Cody indicate whether all of those appointments are internal or external?  What is the current overall gender balance at principal officer level?  I imagine that like most Departments, there is probably an historic gender imbalance that predominantly affects women.  Will any corrective measures will be taken to ensure we have a correct balance across the Civil Service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111900002#M01300","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605785400,"counter":244,"content":"<p>A total of 63% of Revenue staff are female while 55% of principal officers are female.

We do not engage in discrimination on any grounds.  Our recruitment and competitions are all subject to scrutiny by the Public Appointments Service.  The post of principal officer referred to by the Deputy would have been filled by interdepartmental open competition and internal competition.  The organisation is increasingly reflecting the actual gender breakdown so it is quite a positive story.  I am disappointed that Deputy Catherine Murphy left before this because for the past five years in this committee, we have always had a chat with her and Deputy Connolly about gender.  I would always have to remind them that my predecessor was also a woman.  To put it in perspective, we had an assistant principal conference that was reflected in the article where all the assistant principals would have been here before Covid at which that claim was made to me.  I answered from the stage that there was no discrimination.  We have published the gender pay gap on our website in anticipation of changes that are coming with legislation for Revenue.

In the short space of time available I will make the following points.<\/p> <p>  The challenge is to ensure that schools remain Covid-19-secure and that school communities are safe.  The ASTI remains concerned about the different capacity of schools to implement key aspects of the Covid-19 response plan.  Hygiene and ventilation facilities still need to be upgraded.  Prioritising schools for rapid testing and tracing is absolutely necessary.  There is still a lack of communication protocols in schools where an outbreak has occurred.  This needs to be addressed.  As the colder weather has set in, keeping many classrooms warm while ensuring they are appropriately ventilated has been a big problem in many schools.  Teachers and students are in classrooms in their coats in many instances.  If a period of very cold weather comes in the coming weeks or months, many schools are likely to have to close for its duration.  The ASTI is also anxious that the Covid-19 inspection model being piloted in schools be rolled out nationally without delay.  We remain concerned about medically vulnerable teachers and students.  They are still required to attend schools and no remote or reasonable accommodations have been implemented to allow them to participate in their work or studies in a more appropriate setting.<\/p> <p>  ASTI members recently voted to take industrial action unless the Government addresses key Covid-19 issues in schools.  These include the need for rapid testing and turnaround, resources for schools to ensure continuation of learning where there are school closures, a redefinition of the term \"close contact\" for school settings, and appropriate arrangements for teachers categorised as high-risk.  We want schools to remain open to students during this pandemic.<\/p> <p>  ASTI members have also voted to take industrial action on unequal pay.  We remain absolutely committed to achieving equal pay for teachers who have entered the profession since 2010.  Industrial action would be a last resort but for a trade union, it is vital to have all the tools at our disposal if necessary.<\/p> <p>  Finally, we welcome the recommendation issued by the Oireachtas Special Committee on Covid-19 Response that Covid-19 be designated a reportable disease under health and safety regulations.  We want to see that implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020111900002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Christie"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605744000,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.  Given the time constraints, I will focus these opening remarks on the need to review the Department of Education's guidance on the provision of personal protective equipment, PPE, to school staff.<\/p> <p>  We remain concerned about the lack of clarity on the provision of PPE to school staff, specifically special needs assistants, SNAs, and bus escorts, who cannot maintain the recommended 2 m social distance.  The Department of Education informed schools in its roadmap that the purchase and use of basic surgical-grade face masks was optional, not compulsory.  In September 2020 F&oacute;rsa conducted a survey which received over 4,000 responses from SNAs indicating that approximately one third of respondents had not been provided with face masks and had been provided only with face coverings, which offer minimal protection against contracting the virus.  F&oacute;rsa requested advice on infection control issues for SNAs.  After a considerable delay, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, published that advice in September.  It stated that face masks should be provided to SNAs where they could not maintain social distancing and where they were required to carry out intimate care for students.  This has led to a ridiculous situation whereby an SNA works side by side with a student for over six hours but may then only receive the protection of a basic-grade mask when taking the student to the toilet.  The risks of not maintaining a 2 m social distance do not solely occur when providing personal care to the student as the risks are present when the SNA helps with learning activities.  It is the lack of distance, not washing and changing a student, that creates the risk.<\/p> <p>  The lack of adequate PPE has implications for staff assessed as being at high risk should they contract Covid-19.  These staff have been advised to attend work, with the risks to their health being offset by the use of PPE.  This is clearly contradicted by the HPSC advice that face masks may be necessary only when providing personal care to students.  It cannot be right that an employee working as a bus escort with 20 students in a confined space for several hours is not provided with a basic-grade face mask.  It is simply illogical to state that an SNA working side by side with students throughout the day needs a surgical grade mask only when taking a student to the toilet or when helping him or her to wash and change clothes.  F&oacute;rsa has this week started to provide a stock of surgical masks to SNAs who cannot access this equipment within their schools.  We were able to purchase a stock of these masks at a cost of 20 cent each.  The Department of Education&rsquo;s procurement framework enables schools to bulk-buy at much lower cost.<\/p> <p>  In summary, we believe that the Department of Education started planning for the reopening of schools from the perspective of minimising the use of PPE in schools and has continued to maintain such a policy to the detriment of the staff who have been asked to keep these workplaces open during level 5 public health restrictions.  School staff deserve to have adequate PPE provided to them, as do their colleagues in health and social care services.  The advice on the use of PPE should be urgently reviewed to ensure that equipment is provided to those in our schools who are at high risk and to those who are working every day without being able to maintain the recommended 2 m social distance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020111900002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andy Pike"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605744000,"counter":265,"content":"<p>In the months since we have provided the committee with our submission, issues have been dealt with more efficiently and effectively.

Additional funding must be made available to remedy these and other key deficiencies.<\/p> <p>  A TUI survey of teachers identified more physical space and smaller classes as the measures to counter challenges posed by Covid-19.  The TUI calls for a full audit of each school to establish and quantify the resources needed to keep schools open.<\/p> <p>  Many school buildings are not fit for purpose.  Ventilation and heating problems will occur during the period of colder weather and may force the closure of some schools.  TUI calls for the Department of Education to take the advice of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, and install air quality meters in every classroom.  The measure will ensure that students and teachers are not forced to teach and learn in freezing cold classrooms.<\/p> <p>  We must reconceptualise school design.  The current crisis has taught us the importance of infrastructure that is fit for purpose.<\/p> <p>  ICT infrastructure is deficient.  Many of our students lack access to the technology to engage effectively in emergency remote learning.  The TUI will not countenance a situation whereby students can access education only if they can afford information technology or IT.  The poor and the marginalised suffer the most in such circumstances. <\/p> <p>  We welcome the Minister's stated intention to hold the traditional State examinations, which is something on which the TUI had called for certainty.  However, we believe further adjustment to assessments and curriculum content beyond those already made will be required due to the loss in tuition time.<\/p> <p>  Despite the additional Covid-related work, teachers, principals and deputy principals have made sure that their schools opened safely while they carried out their normal, back-to-school duties.  However, the additional workload is now not sustainable.  Targeted resources are imperative, including the full restoration of middle management structures.<\/p> <p>  The TUI members will continue to operate in accordance with the relevant public health advice but the Government must provide us with the certainty, clarity, information, resources and ongoing investment that is required to keep schools open. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020111900002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Gillespie"},{"type":"speech","time":1605744000,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

We now have sector-specific supports in every HSE area, particularly for principal teachers or principals who made all of the phone calls over their weekends when we sent in our submission.<\/p> <p>  We have weekly meetings with representatives of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, and the Department of Education.  Yesterday, we received a weekly report from NPHET so we can now compare reports.  Most important, we demanded a mid-term review.  We wanted a report by the end of September but got it yesterday.  It is a very full document by NPHET and the office of the clinical director for health protection.  The report contains quite a lot of recommendations and I think it is public since yesterday.  Most of the recommendations emanated from the discourse that we had when we had proper weekly engagement with all of the stakeholders and medical people.  That has all been welcome.  At the beginning of my statement today, I identified a few issues regarding the weekends.  Last Monday, we were just three weeks back after the mid-term break but last weekend there were still a considerable number of principal teachers who had to put in long hours.  The previous weekend I, myself, was in the firing line because one particular school had 16 staff absent due to self-isolating because of a couple of cases in the school, which was the decision taken by the HSE.  We floundered around for the weekend to find substitutes to support the board of management and its teachers.  That should not happen at the weekend so it would be great if the substitution service was available at the weekend.<\/p> <p>  I am particularly interested, as I am sure many members are, in the issue along the Border counties where, unfortunately, including in my own county of Donegal, the numbers have not reduced as quickly.  Many children travel from the North of Ireland to attend school in County Donegal but there is no joined-up thinking between the health services on both sides of the Border.  As members already know, when it comes to schooling it is the principals who are left in a situation where they cannot do contact tracing within the different sectors because they are not joined up and then the principals have the difficulty of deciding whether children should come to school so there is a lot to be done yet. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020111900002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Boyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1605744000,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Does the INTO have a register or know how many schools have closed due to a lack of substitution or supervision?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020111900002#B00600","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605744000,"counter":272,"content":"<p>Interestingly, I do not think that the Department keeps a record of substitutions because public health does not go into that space.

The school only closed for one day because of all of the work that had been done over the weekend to get the supply panel in the area to stand down its teacher appointments for other schools and prioritise this emergency.

However, it is important to note that a great deal more must be done to ensure schools can be safe for school staff and students.  For that reason, I and a number of colleagues asked that this be one of the first issues addressed by this committee.<\/p><p>I have a question for the representative of each union and organisation.  The selection of the union is probably partially arbitrary because my questions could apply to anyone.  My first question is for the TUI and relates to ventilation.  Ventilation has been raised with me in discussions with parents and principals.  We know it is increasingly prominent  in the discussions about the science of this.  Many older schools, built in the 1950s and 1960s, have few options when it comes to ventilation apart from open doors and windows.  That creates difficulties for schools, with hard decisions about asking children to come to school wearing clothing for sitting next to windows, rotation and the like.  That is difficult for schools.  Does Mr. Gillespie believe that the Department must bring forward more guidance on this, since I believe there is a shortage of guidance, as well as dedicated funding for schools that are struggling with ventilation?<\/p><p>My second question is for the INTO representative, and it follows up on the question raised by Deputy O'Sullivan.  The school-specific tracing teams that were recently established are a good idea, but they have to work to correct and realistic criteria and they must have resources and be deployed in the right way.  In my experience, many school staff and parents have been mystified by some of the decisions on who is and is not a close contact.  I have encountered this in my community and across the State.  There was a good article in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>highlighting that.  While the desire to minimise disruption to a school is obviously good, I am concerned that sometimes decisions can be made whereby if it is not dealt with decisively, one could extend the lifetime of the virus in a school and the number of children or school staff affected.  We must deal with that.<\/p><p>My final two questions are for the ASTI and F&oacute;rsa.  One of the issues in the ballot for industrial action relates to high-risk staff.  Many people have found Medmark to be a blunt instrument.  Is the ASTI in any way reassured with the progress being made for high-risk staff?  It sounded from the statement that it is not.  Many people are concerned and very few people in the appeals process succeed in having that revised.  That must be revisited and requires a more tailored approach.  With regard to F&oacute;rsa and its point about medical-grade masks, I agree with its analysis.  There is a misunderstanding of the role and the proximity of SNAs in respect of students.  I do not believe there is a realistic understanding of the role of the SNA in that regard, and that must continue to be highlighted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020111900002#C01100","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605744000,"counter":286,"content":"<p>On the ventilation, there are many old schools in the country and our stock is not great in that regard.  People are depending on common sense such as opening windows.  We all know that air exchange is very important.  Schools on the Continent have invested heavily in heat exchanges and the like and they can also be programmed to change the air.  We are immediately at a disadvantage to the schools on the Continent.  We have not invested in passive buildings in energy, and a side effect of that is the air changes.<\/p> <p>  We called for meters to be put into classrooms.  Cheaper meters can be bought, as the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, said.  The meters would monitor, for example, the amount of carbon dioxide and signal when there could be air change.  It is not an answer to the problem, but it might help.  Ventilation is going to become a crucial issue because we all know this is an airborne virus that is carried in droplets.  Ventilation, clearing out the air and not allowing the air to build up in classrooms are a problem.  I previously said there is not much point in protecting us from Covid-19 if we are all going to end up with pneumonia in January and February in the cold rooms.<\/p> <p>  In addition, heating systems in schools are not fit for purpose.  As soon as one opens windows in Irish schools, the room takes ages to heat up again because the schools are not well insulated.  It shows the lack of investment in infrastructure over the past number of years, and it is all coming to a head because of this problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020111900002#C01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Gillespie"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605744000,"counter":287,"content":"<p>With regard to the inconsistencies people are concerned about in public health risk assessments, far be it from me to second-guess the medical experts.  However, consistency will be the key to this.  I realise they are under a great deal of pressure, but we were forced a number of weeks ago to suggest to our members that if a principal teacher receives a telephone call from a public health expert carrying out a risk assessment, they are not to answer immediately all the questions being asked but at least go down the corridor and talk to the key workers who have been associated with that case.  There is tension between GDPR and public health advice.  GDPR is very important, but people's lives are even more important.  What has been happening in the primary schools is that the principal now takes time to talk to the key workers associated with the particular case in the school.  Mass testing has been carried out in 935 educational facilities, and there has been inconsistency in the risk assessment carried out.  Every place is different, but we must have confidence in the system and that whatever is being doing in school A is being done to the same degree in school B.  At that point, parents, students and staff can have confidence that they are being well looked after.<\/p> <p>  I pointed out to NPHET personnel yesterday that it appears to be a little bizarre that an entire class, the most overcrowded classes in Europe with 35 children, would be sent home, but that the two workers working in the classroom would not.

I read through the witnesses' opening statements.  Turning first to Mr. Boyle from the INTO, I would like to know a little more about the flu vaccine for teachers, which I support.  They are a group that should be considered to get the flu vaccine but it is in short supply at the moment.  I ask also about the increase in the pupil capitation fee of &euro;25.  Why are 1,000 schools outside the substitute supply panels?<\/p> <p>  Moving to Mr. Christie, I acknowledge the tribute to the school boards of management.  They do an awful lot of work in the background.  I was on the board of management for the Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board, GRETB.  Much work has been done by principals, school caretakers and bus drivers.  Everyone is involved and they are all close contacts.  I am very interested to hear just a little bit more on SNAs and PPE.<\/p> <p>  I have a question on space in primary schools, which was not covered in the opening statements.  There will be an extra 1,000 teachers to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.  Where do those teachers and classes go when there is no classroom space?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020111900002#D00300","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605744000,"counter":292,"content":"<p>Perhaps I will begin.  Obviously if the flu vaccine becomes available, there will be a hierarchy and I imagine the high-risk, vulnerable and elderly, as well as healthcare workers, will be at the top of it.  However, the Government has deemed it essential to keep schools open, which indicates that the definition of essential workers includes teachers, SNAs and school secretaries.  I was very disappointed the flu vaccine was not made available to all front-line staff in schools but we are moving on from that now.  The most important vaccine is the new one for Covid-19.  It would give great reassurance to parents and students if they knew teachers were vaccinated.  It would also mean our workers would be much more confident going into the workplace.  This particularly the case when, as I said, a teacher has 35 children in his or her classroom from 35 different families.  There has to be a risk there and many staff in education have been infected, despite the way this issue is being portrayed in the media.<\/p> <p>  On the &euro;25 capitation, I based my sums on the average of 25 children per class.  I know that some classes have many more pupils.  When we multiply &euro;25 by 25 we get &euro;625 per year.  With a school year of 193 days, that amounts to approximately &euro;3.50 per day.  How on earth could any cleaner do enhanced cleaning in a classroom on a daily basis for &euro;3.50?  When they got that money most schools assumed it was for the term up to Christmas and they expected to get at least twice as much after Christmas.  We are calling for that because the money is running out.<\/p> <p>  On the supply panels scheme, it must be acknowledged that 3,150 schools were outside the scheme when the pilot was initiated this time last year.  There are 2,100 schools included this year but why were the other 1,000 not included?  The first reason was the pressure caused by the time needed to organise it.  However, it seems the Government was not prepared to put in the extra 50 or 60 teachers.  The gas thing is it would not cost any money because there is a budget in place for substitute teachers in any event.  There is certainly in the supply panel that a school will have a far better chance of getting a substitute teacher and there is also certainty for the workers and children that it will be consistent, with the same person coming into the school.  The scheme should definitely be enhanced after Christmas to look after the 1,000 remaining schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020111900002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Boyle"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605744000,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her kind words about the tribute to boards of management, principals, teachers and the acknowledgement of the great work that is being done.

Like Mr. Boyle, we have also called for the flu vaccine to be distributed to school staff.  It is unfortunate that has not been the case.  Notwithstanding all that great work, the task remains immense in that there is a very tough and difficult job ahead.  We are still only in November and we have the bulk of the winter to endure.  I mentioned earlier the issue of ventilation and heating in this cold weather.  We could have a freeze this year, similar to the one we had some years ago when, as members will recall, schools closed largely for transport reasons.  They got over that but this time schools would close because they would be too cold and it will not be possible to keep them open.  Considerable thought and effort needs to be put into dealing with classes which may have to be sent home or individual schools that may have to close and the arrangements around that.

That is the point about the use of appropriate PPE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020111900002#D01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andy Pike"},{"type":"speech","time":1605744000,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I thank the trade union representatives for their presentations.  It is timely and necessary that the unions address this committee so I am glad to see it happen.  I have a couple of points which I will mention in passing as they have been addressed.  I echo the concerns around PPE for SNA staff.  It is untenable to claim that an SNA can maintain a 2 m distance from the child he or she is working with.  I also want address the point about the inadequacy of our built school environment and the age of the building stock.  I was struck by a line in Mr. Gillespie's submission about reconceptualising school design.  That would be a very interesting point for this committee to come back to at some point in the future when we could look at how the physical design of our school infrastructure can affect teaching and learning outcomes.<\/p> <p>  We should consider the ventilation issue in a wider context, not just a Covid one, because if we improve ventilation systems in our schools, that will reduce the transmissibility of other diseases.  Thankfully, Covid does not seem to find a reservoir in our younger population but other transmissible diseases do.<\/p> <p>  That brings me to the issue of the flu vaccine, raised by Mr. Boyle.  When I was in the classroom, I used to get the flu jab for exactly that reason, namely, to take five days of sickness out of the equation for myself.  That is not possible this year.  We had 1.35 million doses but the demand has been great.  As I understand it, some of the children's vaccine is still available.  It is very effective and free at the point of use up to 12 years of age.  There is perhaps a role for the INTO in publicising and pushing that because if we begin to break the chain of transmission at a school level, it will be very useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020111900002#D01200","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605744000,"counter":298,"content":"<p>While I thank the Deputy for making that proposal it is ironic that he is doing so.

Nevertheless, we are there for the safety of the children, as well as the teachers.  We will help out but we would like a rethink on the free vaccine for teachers.

We were in a bad place with regard to substitutes in the run-up to Covid-19 because many of our younger teachers, suffering from the consequences of unequal pay, were abroad or elsewhere.  The reservoir was starting off from a very low point.

After a lot of pulling and dragging we now have three supply panels based in the Dublin 15 area, but in Tallaght and Firhouse, we only have one.  Obviously the teachers and the families in that area whose children do not have qualified teachers are very alarmed at the fact that not many of the schools in the area are covered or the cover is insufficient.  Then there are the other 1,000 schools, mostly in rural Ireland.  In north Louth, for example, and in various parts of County Cork there is still a huge demand for additional supply panels to be established.  I believe the Department is looking at it, but then the Departments of Finance and of Public Expenditure and Reform look at the 320 jobs that went into this scheme and are reluctant to give any more.  I believe it is really important for the education of the children that they have a fully qualified teacher every day.  In that regard, sending additional supply panels is actually cost neutral.  Okay, it looks more on the job scene, but at the same time there is a budget for substitution.  Like previous years, if this continues, the budget is not going to be spent.  Who is losing out?

It was a scandal that the class size reductions were not passed on to the most marginalised children, except in the senior DEIS schools.  It appears to me that the reason it was done for the senior DEIS schools was because the school in Bonnybrook had a class size of 24 and now the school in Donnybrook was going to have a class size of 24 or 25 as well and we really could not be having that as it would not look good.  Therefore, we reduced it for the senior schools but not for the vertical or junior schools.  There is a &euro;5 million budget and we will be having a meeting with the officials.

We want to have that meeting soon because we want to make sure additional staffing is put into the most marginalised children.<\/p> <p>  Our President, Mary Magner, made a famous point recently that the best PPE one can have in a primary school is a smaller class.

When the Government needed the schools to open to support the community and provide education for children, it could find &euro;400 million fairly quickly but we were looking for that money for about a decade before that.

There is then a further level, in that a risk assessment is carried out when there is a positive case or contact tracing in a school.  That is working but the HSE is telling us that inconsistencies are sometimes showing up in the way the things in schools are applying.  On a positive note, teachers, parents and students are obeying the rules and that is why the levels of Covid-19 in schools are low.

The classrooms are highly sanitised with people being kept to pods and bubbles and so on but then they are mixing for those activities and we want to make sure that when they are mixing it is done safely.  We have yet to get that guidance.<\/p> <p>  I have to say that I have been really proud since the Easter holidays of our principals, in particular, but also of all our staff members who provide the free school meals scheme and delivered meals to houses.

We had a situation in which lots of families did not even have the devices to access remote learning in their homes, never mind the broadband.  Some 23,779 people from the education sector have had to spend time at home after a Covid-19 test.  That is a lot of people at home, usually for two weeks, and they are missing out on their education.  Sometimes that happens simply because there is no broadband in the area.  We had teachers going into the car parks of county council offices, trying to get enough broadband to download some of the materials the Department was sending out as guidance.  There is a long way to go, therefore.  We have a &euro;50 million ICT grant.

In 2008, one in two teachers had a post of responsibility.  Following the moratorium and the cutbacks, we are down to one in four.  The restorations were promised in 2016 and they have been tiny.

I have a small involvement as chairperson on the board of management of a small rural primary DEIS school.  I have seen over a long period the extra effort made by staff, not just teaching staff, but caretakers, school secretaries and so on.  I endorse everything that has been said about the pay equality agenda.  I emphasise the word mentioned by Mr. Gillespie, namely, \"confidence\".  This is not just people going in to work hard to make sure everything is done right and, as far as possible, complete whatever changes were needed to reopen and keep the schools open safely.  At the same time, morale boosting has to go on as well when working with children with varying levels of comprehension about what needs to be done, and parents.  There is an emotional as well as task-based burden involved.  I am mindful of that.<\/p> <p>  Listening to the witnesses, we note that it is the interplay of the fire-fighting that has to go on, backed up by resources from the State and the downstream consequences of longer term challenges.  This interplay is not least in the area of pay equality, as the witnesses have said.  In terms of a long-term vision for the future, pay equality has been a festering sore.  The generation who struggle most to get the money together for a mortgage, if they can get a house, feel an enormous indignation about the differential between the resources being given to them for the same work.  Very often, these people are at the stage of their working lives where we depend on the extra energy they might have.  Hard questions must be asked about that.  We have to look back and ask how this happened, as does everybody who had a responsibility for the misstep in that area.  It is not a question of blame but of making sure it does not happen again in the long term when crises come.  They will come, because these things are cyclical. <\/p> <p>  On the issues raised by the witnesses, I note and support what F&oacute;rsa and others have said to the effect that if we will talk the language of teachers and school staff being in the front line, then that surely means there needs to be important back-up, not least with the availability of vaccines.  We have to protect our key people.<\/p> <p>  The TUI, among others, have spoke about online learning.  I get that we need to make devices and equipment available but I noticed in my interactions with friends working in schools and so on that there is a culture in this country that children in some schools are better able to adapt to the blended, home-based learning environment than others.  There is an issue of culture as well as resources.  Do the witnesses have any ideas on what might done to push things in a better direction?  There is inequality in the inability of certain cohorts to survive in the blended learning, home-based learning environment.<\/p><p>It is not just about whether they have devices or equipment; I am not suggesting the witnesses are saying that.<\/p><p> A couple of days ago I raised with the Minister the upset and annoyance that was felt in fee-charging schools.  When the Covid-related payments to enable schools to reopen safely were being allocated there was shock in the fee-paying schools that they were to be excluded.  There was a partial concession allowing them to apply for funding on a case-by-case basis.  The Minister pointed out what was and what was not given.  The perspective I heard from fee-charging schools was that they are not all about rich parents.  Many people are making sacrifices to send their children to fee-charging schools.  This is a question of children's safety.  To borrow that phrase - admittedly in another context - in our Proclamation about cherishing all the children of the nation equally, there should not have been a differential.  I heard from some teachers about it.  I believe the ASTI is the main union involved for staff in those schools.  Did the ASTI take a view of that?  Did it hear from its members?  Did it make any recommendation on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020111900002#K01400","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605744000,"counter":380,"content":"<p>Yes, we did.

Arising from this, it is clear that there is nothing better than face-to-face teaching in school, especially for disadvantaged students.  Therefore, it is really only an emergency response.  If there was more joined-up thinking and if the system was more coherent, we could share training and have similar platforms.  We do not want to give any company a monopoly but unfortunately there are monopolies in terms of what is happening with IT.  One of the big problems is that it is not consistent across the system.

It is amazing what good technological programmes can do to help children with special educational needs outside school, but when it came to the lockdown, those were not really available to them because the Department of Education had not prioritised it.  We need more training.  As we all know from the statistics from mobile phone companies, they are adept at using ICT.  To bring it into the education sphere, it needs to be resourced and there needs to be a determination that there will be a better approach to technology in education.

I am not sure if he or another TUI representative appeared on the \"Today with Claire Byrne\" show yesterday.  I got calls from a number of nurses afterwards.  They were horrified about what was said about teachers being required to wear masks.  I absolutely agree that they must wear masks; that is the way it is.  Doctors and nurses are wearing masks from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., in addition to full PPE gear.  I imagine other public sector workers were also horrified.  I had calls from teachers, including TUI members, saying they were not looking for such a change in the school holidays.  Where did that proposal come from?  I ask the other teacher organisations to comment on that.  I should not put one against the other but I would be interested in their views on it.<\/p> <p>  I have a question on the senior DEIS schools for Mr. Boyle.  I understand the Minister will make an announcement imminently on further DEIS roll-out.  The Minister signalled a further announcement after the budget.  I asked the same question of her here the other day because senior DEIS schools, junior DEIS schools and other DEIS schools felt totally left behind.  What proposals are coming from the Department and has the INTO had any input into that?<\/p> <p>  I also asked the Minister about large primary schools with 600, 700 or 800 pupils, which normally have a principal and one deputy principal.  However, a secondary school with 500 or 600 pupils could have a principal and two or three deputy principals.  This issue will require some work.  I asked the Minister to look at this area, which I feel is very unfair.  My constituency has some very large primary schools, including one of the largest, St. Aidan's in Enniscorthy.  The principal there has an enormous job to do with very little backup.  I compliment the people who back him up.  However, a secondary school with such large numbers would have multiple deputy principals.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  I ask Mr. Pike about the availability of PPE for F&oacute;rsa members.  HSE facilities, including nursing homes, have a week's, two weeks' or a month's supply of PPE.  What forward supply do F&oacute;rsa members have?  Will there be challenges in January when schools come back after Christmas, particularly if there is an outbreak of flu, which hopefully will not happen?<\/p> <p>  Considering the work done by the HSE and public health bodies on the reopening of schools, what lessons does Mr. Christie believe have been learned?  Are ASTI members doing their work in a more streamlined way now compared with September?<\/p> <p>  I compliment the principals, teachers and boards of management in all the schools.  They have done a fantastic job and the country should be proud of them.  Teachers have gone up in my estimation because of the work they have done.  Having been off since the outbreak of Covid in March, they all wanted to get back to work.  Over the summer months great work was done by principals, staff and members of boards of management, who are often forgotten about and hold significant responsibility.<\/p><p>Maybe if he answers those questions, I will come back to him.

They are days that traditionally have a lot of things happening that are part of the hidden curriculum, for example, the Christmas show, choir activities, and perhaps religious ceremonies, depending on the school in question.  We said that it might be highlighted that these activities would be missing because of the early closure of schools, and that could upset people.  We know some of our members were upset, and others, like ourselves, said that it was worth considering.  However, we went no further than that.  If one looks at the petition, some talked about the four extra days.  In other words, the petition - not the TUI - was saying that by missing the day and a half - the Monday and Tuesday - with the school closing on the Friday, that would provide the 14 days up to New Year's Day.

However, in the middle of a pandemic, these kinds of standardisations do not always work.  Had there been that little bit of flexibility it would have helped.  I know teachers from the west of Ireland who have not seen their parents since August, and I know many children in schools who have not seen their grandparents.  If the early closure meant that before 6 January, women's Christmas, they could visit these relatives, it might have been worth considering.  However, as I have said, we were very aware that in the health sector, workers there have been working around the clock and will not be off over Christmas, and that debate has passed.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of the DEIS programme, I want to emphasise that I think that if the Government was back where it was on budget day, it probably would not have reduced class sizes in DEIS at all.  It would have left the issue alone for a couple of weeks and made its budgetary statement that there was &euro;5 million over a full year being made available for DEIS, and that that money would be used to try to deal with the staffing differentials, rather than single out the senior schools and not provide any reductions for the vertical schools, in which there are many children up to sixth class as well. <br\/><br\/>On the issue of Enniscorthy and the pr&iacute;omhoide and leas-phr&iacute;omhoide, about three years ago the then Department for Education and Skills had &euro;7 million available to it for school leadership.  We get on really well with ASTI, TUI and F&oacute;rsa, but I do not believe I have ever been angrier than at that particular time because two thirds of the money was given to post-primary schools and one third to primary schools.  The result of that was that St. Eunan's College in Letterkenny announced its new principal and its two new administrative deputy principals on the front of the <i>Donegal Democrat<\/i>, while the school in Enniscorthy, which used to have a support team of about 30 promoted teachers, now only has ten support teachers for the principal because of the moratorium.  That money should have been shared out more equally.  It goes back a long way, probably to 1966, when all the money was put into post-primary schools by Deputy Donogh O'Malley and his Department, and rightly so, but at that particular time, post-primary schools were so far behind that they had to get the investment.  But who lost out at that time?  Primary schools.  That has been the case for some time.  The Chair referred to the case of a pr&iacute;omhoide in Enniscorthy.  I do not know if he is aware of this, but there are two big schools in Enniscorthy, and the principal teachers in those schools earn &euro;15,000 less than principal teachers in secondary schools of the same size with the same number of staff.  That is a gross inequality and I referred to it earlier.  There is a lot to be done yet, and it will not all be done due to the pandemic, but I am glad that the Chair raised the issue and I thank him for his support of primary principals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020111900002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Boyle"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605744000,"counter":392,"content":"<p>Picking up on the questions asked by the Chair, he mentioned the Border counties and asked if there were issues specific to them regarding the running of schools.

However, it is not an issue on which we have received much communication.  Where it was supported, it was on the basis of the question of whether, if this happened, it would it mean that it would be safer for teachers to see 80-year-old relatives or not.  That was the query that members brought to us.<\/p> <p>  On the question about PPE, if we were describing more complex PPE that one would find in an intensive care unit or Covid ward in an acute general hospital, those stocks are very carefully monitored because the equipment is quite expensive.  What we are looking at in terms of schools is the very first rung on the face mask ladder.  We managed to source a seemingly unending supply at a cost of around 20 cent per mask, and we were told by the suppliers that we spoke to, having had to start supplying the masks to our own members, that stocks are plentiful at the moment and the masks are warehoused around the world.  We do not foresee any potential difficulties with the PPE that is appropriate for schools, but that might not be the same in the case of respirator masks that are used in acute healthcare settings, which is a completely different piece of equipment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020111900002#M01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andy Pike"},{"type":"speech","time":1605744000,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I will allow members to speak for one minute, and I ask them to direct their questions to one or two witnesses, who will have one minute to reply.

However, if there were two cases crossing over in a household children should return after the notice of the last case.  I gather from contact with people on the ground, schools and parents, that guidance has been given that a child can return to school, even though there is a positive case in the household, once he or she has done his or her 14 days self-isolation and is symptom free.  It seems there is some confusion around this.  Has the guidance changed and has this been adequately communicated?

The North West Strategic Growth Partnership, NWSGP, led by Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council, was instrumental in the launch of this partnership in February 2018.  The NWSGP is a unique inter-jurisdictional structure endorsed by both Governments through the North-South Ministerial Council.  The agreement is the result of years of successful collaborative working among the four education sector providers &ndash; Letterkenny Institute of Technology, Ulster University, North West Regional College and Donegal Education and Training Board &ndash; with the aim of improving access to higher and further level education and training to students living and studying in the north-west city region.<\/p> <p>  The north-west strategic growth plan identifies that for the north west to remain competitive and at the cutting edge, the education partners must increasingly collaborate and adopt a joined-up approach to attract students to their campuses.  This formal strategic alliance among the four partners provides a conduit for a collaborative project that will harness the breadth of partners&rsquo; programmes and facilitate development of shared services; boost the economy of the north-west region; strengthen the local skills base; and block the brain drain of students leaving the area for what they perceive are better opportunities elsewhere.  The partners work together as \"anchors\" for the economy of the region exploiting the links between research, education, workforce development and economic competitiveness.<\/p> <p>  The project partners are committed to supporting activity that can enable delivery in a value-adding context of the following strategic outcomes that are cited in the Irish higher education strategy: better planning and organisation of programmes allowing for differentiated offerings; greater impact through pooling of effort and development of shared services; more explicit attention to student pathways and progression; and a co-ordinated approach to enterprise and other stakeholders at regional level.  Additionally, the agreement supports work that can contribute to the following outcomes of the higher education strategy for Northern Ireland, facilitate cross-border student mobility, reduce the obstacles to student mobility between North and South, pursue collaboration that is beneficial to the institutions involved and students and facilitate cross-Border co-operation in teaching and learning, particularly where it is geographically advantageous.<\/p> <p>  Funding of &euro;250,000 from the Higher Education Authority, HEA, Landscape Call 2018 was announced in November 2018 to establish a functioning regional cluster, focus on programme mapping and student pathways, develop a regional further and higher education prospectus, identify opportunities for collaboration to better support the innovative industry in the north-west city region and examine opportunities to make the region more attractive to inward investment.  The 2019 proposal to support smart industry in the north-west city region, Smart Industry NoW, received &euro;500,000 from the HEA Landscape Call 2018 recognising that the north-west city region has transitioned over the past decade to become a hub for companies in the smart industry sector with a particular strength in fintech-ICT.  This proposal concentrates on industry engagement, focusing on smart industry sector, delivering on the significant potential of the education partners and better supporting the innovative industry in the north-west city region.<\/p> <p>  This Smart Industry NoW proposal is in line with Future Jobs Ireland 2019: Preparing Now for Tomorrow&rsquo;s Economy and will give students and employees the skill sets that are in very high demand and offer access to exciting and rewarding careers.  The partners collectively have the potential to deliver the key cutting edge skills identified in the report, namely, artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, data analytics, the Internet of things and blockchain.<\/p><p>Further projects from this alliance will aim to leverage the partners&rsquo; ingenuity and flexibility in providing bespoke cutting-edge programmes for innovative industry in the region.  Partners provide research informed education and training via the very significant and developing research assets in this region.  These assets include the WiSAR Lab at LYIT, together with LYIT's INTERREG-funded cross-Border centres, the Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and the Centre for Personalised Medicine, both involving Ulster University, Bryden Centre Renewable Energy and Ulster University&rsquo;s key research strengths at its Magee campus, Cognitive Analytics Research Lab, CARL, Intelligent Systems Research Centre, ISRC and further enhanced through City Deal Innovation projects, Centre for Industrial Digitalisation, Robotics and Automation, CIDRA, and the Transformation for Healthcare Research, Innovation and Value-based Ecosystem, THRIVE.<\/p><p> LYIT&rsquo;s Strategic Plan 2019-2023 affirms that the institute is motivated to seek out collaboration partners that can add value, extend our reach or provide impetus to ongoing activity.  The continuation of the cross-Border cluster engagement is strategically important to LYIT and key to our pursuit of technological university status through the Connacht-Ulster Alliance with our partners IT Sligo and GMIT.  Our partners in the cluster share our understanding of the challenges that Brexit represents and this cluster offers opportunities for a better co-ordination of the further and higher education response to these challenges for the north-west cross-Border region.<\/p><p> Two years of funding via the HEA landscape fund has allowed for a deepening of relationships and provided a glimpse of the future potential of this collaboration.  The initial focus was on the development of the cross-Border further and higher education prospectus to look at addressing impediments to progression for learners in the region.  Funding in 2020 was aligned with the Irish Government's future jobs strategy to give students and employees the skill sets that are in very high demand and offer access to exciting and rewarding careers.  By the end of 2020, the cluster will have a smart industry board in place, actively supporting the growth of employment in the north-west city region and will also deliver further collaboration on education and training programmes including research studentships that will be jointly supervised by the higher education partners.  In addition, the partners will promote the significant strengths in tertiary education in the region and the growing network of innovation centres and digital hubs through a new website and an annual conference. <\/p><p> In June 2019, the education partners presented their plan for 2020, Delivering Economic Growth through Regional Innovation Pathways and Networks at the NWSGP meeting at Dublin Castle.  The coming years clearly offer many exciting opportunities for increased collaboration in tertiary education in the north-west city region, with the significant city deal projects for Derry and Strabane, the commitment from the Irish Government for greater support for cross-Border collaboration in higher education and research, via the New Decade, New Approach agreement, plans to develop the Ulster University Magee campus, including the delivery of the school of medicine due to open in August 2021 and the planned &euro;20 million extension at LYIT.<\/p><p> The close proximity of Letterkenny and Derry, approximately 35 km apart, allows for innovative programme collaboration and the significant history of collaboration on INTERREG-funded research projects will be further leveraged to enhance research collaboration, including opportunities available via the recast Peace Plus programme.  The student services and stakeholder engagement workstream offers great opportunities to capture good practice and there is significant learning to be gained from the strong focus on industry engagement in the north-west cross-Border region, with its significant strengths in international financial services and fintech, advanced manufacturing, renewable energy and medtech.  In addition, the region is home to two large regional hospitals.<\/p><p> The initial memorandum of understanding, MoU, between the partners reflected the higher education strategies of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and regional development strategies on both sides of the Border.  There has been significant ongoing alignment of this project with the changing national policy context and the changing operating environments for each of the partners.  Much has changed since the MoU was signed in February 2018.  At that point, the real implications of Brexit had not been fully grasped and the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, including the Executive, the assembly and the North-South Ministerial Council were not operating as planned.  The inclusion in the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future, of the establishment of a shared island unit recently launched by An Taoiseach is also very welcome in progressing the work of the cross-Border cluster.  The future impact of Brexit on the north-west cross-Border region, the most connected cross-Border region on this island, has garnered significant national and international attention and has both shaped and given greater impetus to the activities of the cross-border further and higher education cluster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111900002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hannigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605744000,"counter":419,"content":"<p>Would Professor &Oacute; Neill like to make an opening statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111900002#B00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605744000,"counter":420,"content":"<p>It is a joint statement, so I concur with the entirety of Mr. Hannigan's contribution.

Collaboration is the way forward. <\/p><p> I thank Deputy Mac Lochlainn, who is from County Donegal, for allowing me, as a Mayo person, to contribute and I will leave him some time.  My main question is for Professor &Oacute; N&eacute;ill and concerns capital investment in the Magee campus.  Is the university working on a business case that will be presented to the Government?  We welcome the shared island unit and the money that has been ring-fenced for its work.  How do we make sure that happens and in a timely way?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111900002#B00800","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605744000,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I welcome both witnesses here today.  I acknowledge, as a Deputy who represents Donegal, the immense role played by both of them in being leaders of education in the region, and particularly leading on the cross-border dimension.  I am delighted that both of them are here today to talk about the practice that they have developed.  As has been rightly said, this collaboration is a benchmark for Departments and certainly in the North-South dimension.  I thank them for all that they do.<\/p> <p>  As both witnesses know, when one looks at the whole picture of the island of Ireland, one can clearly see that all of the universities are located in the cities of Belfast, Cork, Dublin, Galway and Limerick.  Consequently, there is historic frustration and anger because a region with approximately half a million people does not have a dedicated university.  I say that not to denigrate the fantastic education provided at the Magee campus in Derry and the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, LyIT.  Thanks to the two witnesses and others,that frustration and anger is being undone, which is welcome.  I ask them to lay out how that is being undone.  Obviously with the Connacht-Ulster alliance, there will be one technological university for the region comprised of GMIT, Institute of Technology Sligo, IT Sligo, and LyIT.<\/p> <p>  With a cross-border partnership all the elements of a university are finally coming together.  How can the witnesses assure us that the courses provided are complementary rather than competing?  I ask them to please spell out in more detail how they co-operate.  A medical school is on the way for the Magee campus.  How can one ensure that these places of education will provide a full array of education that will attract all the investment and encourage all he matching job creation in the region?  I seek assurance on how all that will work.<\/p> <p>  I have talked about the exciting plans by both educational institutions.  Can the Irish Government do more to co-fund the Magee campus?  Can Stormont and the British and Irish Governments jointly fund projects in both the Magee campus and Letterkenny?  I seek feedback on how Stormont and the British and Irish Governments can improve their financial offering to these educational institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111900002#C00200","speaker":"1463"},{"type":"speech","time":1605744000,"counter":428,"content":"<p>The witnesses can answer all of the questions, including those of Senator Blaney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111900002#C00300","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605744000,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I thank members for their very positive comments.<\/p> <p>   In response to Senator Blaney's comments specifically around the shared island unit, it is a real opportunity for us in this context.  We have had some preliminary discussions with the people who manage the shared island unit to establish where they are coming from and what they are trying to do.  We are very conscious that the Higher Education Authority's funding streams I mentioned in my introductory piece have disappeared because funding is now being put directly into the technological university sector, rather than looking at landscape funding that allowed us to get funding to support the cluster up to date.  The shared island unit is a real opportunity to consider what can be developed or supported across the two institutions and they are open to that.  The majority of the funding from the shared island unit initially probably will be through major infrastructural projects, some of which probably will go to infrastructural projects on both campuses.  At the same time, we envisage that soft supports will be put in place to continue the work we have started in this space.  We are very excited by that in terms of the shared island unit and how we can move forward with that over the next while.  We have started those conversations already.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the city deal and inclusive future funding that is going into Derry, the two councils in the region, namely, Donegal County Council, and Derry City and Strabane District Council, have worked very hard to balance the funding on my side of the Border to ensure there is equivalent funding to support Donegal in the context of the development of Derry in the context of the north-west city region, which must continue.  We have all contributed to the arguments in favour before both councils and will continue to do so.  I give great credit to both councils for the work they have done because they have opened the field for us and gave us an opportunity to get into and move forward in this space, with political support, which is really important to us.<\/p> <p>  In the context of local employment, Professor &Oacute; N&eacute;ill can talk broadly about the situation on the other side of the Border.  In terms of the foreign direct investment in the Letterkenny space, specifically from IDA Ireland, between 4,500 and 5,000 people are employed in that specific area whether it is in fintech or whatever.  We believe that approximately 60% of the people employed in those institutions came from Letterkenny Institute of Technology in one form or another.  While we have graduates going into those programmes, we are also doing significant upskilling for existing staff and in addition, senior management have completed masters programmes etc. with us.  That relationship is really strong and we want to continue to build on that for the further development of the region.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the comments made by Deputy Conway-Walsh about the Connacht-Ulster alliance, CUA.  I know that she is very interested in the Mayo campus and has recently discussed this matter with Dr. Orla Flynn in GMIT.  The development of a technological university, for which we hope to make an application in the next month or so, will be a really important development from our perspective on the west coast.<\/p> <p>  Looking from our specific location in Letterkenny, while engaging with the Connacht-Ulster alliance on the development of the technological university concept, we were always conscious that we could not turn our back on Northern Ireland.  That is why we have been actively involved in this cross-border cluster and we envisage that continuing as the technological university evolves.  At that stage, there will probably be even closer contact between the various different bodies.  Professor &Oacute; N&eacute;ill can deal with the specific questions about capital development at the Magee campus.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the questions asked by Deputy Mac Lochlainn, what is expected from us has been well laid out.  In terms of complementary programmes rather that competing programmes, we are already in that space.  At the launch of this cluster, we were able to profile a young man who started off at the North West Regional College, moved to Letterkenny Institute of Technology to study another programme and is completing a PhD study with us.  He had been to the University of Ulster for some element of his programme and I think he went to school in Donegal in the education and training board, ETB, system.  Therefore, he has availed of four institutions and hit every note.  We saw the potential of people using all of the network within the north west to improve their own educational profile and journey as a result.<\/p> <p>  I have mentioned funding in the context of trying to strike a balance in funding on both sides of the Border.  The cross-border cluster is unique and innovative because it is one of the first times that the Higher Education Authority gave funding to a cross-border project where it could be used on both sides of the Border.  From my perspective, that was a strong endorsement by the Higher Education Authority in the Republic of Ireland that we could be part of the cross-border cluster and part of the technological university because the HEA funded both of them at the same time.  That was a real strong endorsement of the strategy that we have followed in Letterkenny and one that will follow through strongly into the future.  Perhaps Professor &Oacute; N&eacute;ill wants to take up a few specific issues.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111900002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hannigan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605744000,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I thank members for a range of queries.<\/p><p>I will begin with Senator Blaney's point on what we have done to date in collaboration and what kind of impact that has had.  Mr. Hannigan has already spoken of the student journey where a student, perhaps, initiates that educational pathway in post-primary school in County Donegal.   In various junctures on that journey, he or she might experience the provision at North West Regional College for a pre-degree qualification or perhaps a foundation degree at Letterkenny Institute of Technology, in collaboration with a top-up opportunity with us, after which he or she may have an opportunity for postgraduate study or pre-PhD studies with Ulster University Magee Campus or LYIT.  That is a path well-trodden by many members of the population in the north west but it is one we will seek to expedite by making the transition from one institution to another much easier and plain sailing.  That has been the thrust of much of the work we have done since the memorandum of understanding was signed in 2018.<\/p><p> Mr. Hannigan mentioned that we have been supported by the Higher Education Authority through funding and we have been able to use that funding in both jurisdictions.  That has enabled us to carry out significant consultancy to create research posts which will better inform our practices in future.  We are in the middle of a trawl to appoint what we have called a trans-jurisdictional operation officer or, essentially, someone who will look at those specific pathways from Donegal ETB into North West Regional College, LYIT, or Ulster University Magee Campus in any order one may wish to look at.  The main ethos of this is the widening of access and participation in further and higher education and to make sure we can upscale our population of the north west in every way possible.<\/p><p> In terms of our collaboration with LYIT, one example I will give is the epicentre initiative established in 2008.  It was between North West Regional College, Ulster University Magee Campus with our intelligent systems research centre, and colleagues in LYIT in support of electronics engineering, and working with companies and industry in the north west in that regard.  The project led to two of the major city deal innovation projects referred to in our joint statement, one being CIDRA, which is the Centre for Industrial Digitalisation, Robotics and Automation.  That is essentially industry 4.0, in other words, all things robotic and futuristic.  It is about the future of work and how we upskill our population to be able to maximise the opportunities therein.  The other is the CARL initiative, which is cognitive analytics or data analytics.  That is of significant interest to Mr. Hannigan and colleagues in LYIT.<\/p><p> We supported LYIT in upskilling its members of staff through PhD opportunities, but also in shared research initiatives to put both of our institutions in the best possible position to cope with and maximise the opportunities in the data science space going forward.  As a result, we have been able to develop expertise and that has been able to spread into other disciplines.  For example, Mr. Hannigan mentioned the work we have been able to develop with the clinical and translational research centre, CTRC, in the past ten years in developing a world-leading hub in personalised medicine.  Even in the recent pandemic, individuals such as Professor Tony Bjourson have led the way in tackling the pandemic.  Ulster University researchers based at CTRC have been in receipt of significant research funding in recent times from Science Foundation Ireland, which is another example of the kind of cross-Border research collaboration we are driving forward.  Dr. Magda Bucholc has also been co-ordinating the track and trace data-driven approach to tracking the pandemic right across an island-wide basis.<\/p><p> In that collaborative spirit, we have been able to develop world-leading centres of excellence in data science and personalised medicine which have put us in a much better position to develop a kind of ecology which will make a success of our school of medicine.  Again, thanks to the efforts and support of many people in this virtual space, we are in a position to be able to open the doors of our school of medicine in August 2021.  We have had the initial graduate medical school admissions test, GAMSAT, assessment series which, even in these difficult times, we have able to run from our Magee campus.  Obviously, levels of interest are exceedingly high and we look forward to welcoming that first cohort in 2021.<\/p><p> The development of the medical school has been referred to as a game-changer and as totemic in many circles and it is.  It has been mentioned that it is the north-west corner of the island.  When we put forward the case for the school of medicine, we were known to say that if one was to draw a line on the map from Galway to Belfast, one would not find a medical school on one side of it but would find seven on the other.  The addition of our new school of medicine in 2021 will change all that.  It will not only put in place the opportunity to train as doctors and physicians in the north west, but all the kinds of supportive research and spin-off opportunities for local businesses and local researchers in that regard.  That is why the research wing of the school of medicine, which has become known as THRIVE and is another of the city deal innovation projects, is pivotal and such a huge opportunity for the city and region.<\/p><p> In that collaborative spirit, we have been able to develop world leading standards of excellence in data science and personalised medicine that have put us in a much better position to develop a kind of ecology that will make a success of our school of medicine.

We also work with partners, including in Institute of Technology Sligo, particularly in the life and health space.  In terms of the school of medicine, one of our key partners is the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG.  I chair the collaboration group involving Ulster University Magee Campus and NUIG, which collaborates on educational and research areas for the two medical schools.<\/p><p> It is important to note Deputy Mac Lochlainn's point on what is changing in terms of the Magee campus offering.  This is a period of transformation for Ulster University but also for Magee campus specifically.  It is not just through the city deal innovation project, although city deal is a huge part of that.  It is the deliverance of those four projects, the school of medicine, THRIVE, the health research institute alongside the data science hub, which is CARL, and CIDRA in the areas of automation and robotics.  They are four initiatives we have been able to develop and are now in the process of delivering.  They met with the criteria of city deal and the inclusive future fund. <\/p><p> That is not to say we did not have other projects.  For example, my own discipline and background is in arts, humanities and social science, and our Ulster University business school, which is a highly energised department based at Magee campus and probably one of our strongest in terms of collaboration with LYIT and North West Regional College.  There are also projects in both of those areas that we seek to develop.<\/p><p> A nod has been given already by Mr. Hannigan to the conversations with the shared island unit.  There is an opportunity for transformational projects therein.  We welcome the support for Ulster University that was documented in the New Decade, New Approach document, but also the follow-up in governmental terms and by initiating those discussions in which we are now engaged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111900002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Malachy &Oacute; N&eacute;ill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605744000,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I call Mr. Eastwood who will be followed by speakers from the Fine Gael Party and Independent members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111900002#D00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605744000,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

CIDRA, CARL, THRIVE and all the initiatives around the city deal innovation projects are important and welcome.<\/p><p>It is great that the shared island unit and the programme for Government in Dublin have a real commitment to university provision in the north west.  However, we have to be honest as well.  Derry and Inishowen in particular have been absolutely starved of investment in higher education.  It is a scandal that the decision was made in 1965, which we all know about, and it has not really been rectified yet.  It is disappointing that we have more commitment from the Dublin Government than from the Stormont Government.  The many promises over many years to the people of Derry in particular about having a full-scale operational university based in Derry have not been delivered, and that is the reality.  This has had a huge impact in terms of our ability to create employment and create an economy in the north west of Ireland.  Whether it is the lack of infrastructure or the lack of university provision, it has absolutely disadvantaged the people of Derry and Donegal and it needs to be rectified.<\/p><p> While all of this is very good and I want to congratulate Mr. Hannigan and Professor &Oacute; N&eacute;ill for working together and doing all the things they are doing, I suggest we need to be much more ambitious about what the north west needs.

While it is very good and we need to keep pushing the Government in Dublin, we need a real commitment from the Government in Stormont to deliver upon the promises it has made.<\/p><p> There are lots of commitments in \"New Decade, New Approach\" and we will see if we get it delivered.  I, for one, will not be quiet about this until we get a full-scale university in Derry.  My preference is that this would happen on a cross-Border basis.  There is a major opportunity to deliver for the people of Derry, Donegal, Tyrone and the whole north-west region.  However, we have to be very ambitious.  Piecemeal development will not be enough to rectify the problem.  I do not think people should expect anything less.  I thank both the witnesses for the work they are doing.

This is fantastic in supporting start-ups, which is very good for the development of SMEs in Dublin West.  Where is the potential for that in the north west?  How is remote learning going?

Mr. Eastwood was involved in the first meeting of the Derry City and Strabane District Council, and he actually chaired the Derry council group in its infancy and saw things developing from there.  I know he has been a very strong supporter of the university in Derry and very supportive of us in Donegal as well.  We continue to move in that direction in terms of being ambitious for the region and making sure we are not disadvantaged in that space.<\/p> <p>  Senator Currie&rsquo;s comments are very interesting.  Coming from the Blanchardstown area, she knows the impact of having a technological university, given there is a campus of Technological University Dublin there.  From our perspective in the Connacht-Ulster Alliance, we will be making an application for technological university status.  We are completing the submission documents as we speak, and we are in discussions with staff associations and finalising negotiations with them around various different aspects.  It is likely we will have the submission document completed before Christmas, with the negotiations with the staff associations, hopefully, completed at the same time, and with a submission ready to go in probably towards the end of January.  That is the sort of target we are working towards at the moment.  A huge amount of work has been done to develop that.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the incubation units, there is a very interesting story to be told in the north west city region.  We have a centre on campus called CoLab, which has around 60 small companies working in it at the moment, employing over 200 people.  The latest extension of that was an INTERREG project with what was the Northern Ireland Science Park at the time, and is now Catalyst Inc.  There is an equivalent facility in Derry city, which came from INTERREG funding and which is a sister facility to the one on Letterkenny IT campus, and the Ulster university is very involved with Catalyst Inc. as well.  The area around that whole incubation space has been really important for us and we see the benefits of it as we move forward.<\/p> <p>  As we see developments on both sides of the Border, the synergies will only develop even further between the emerging technological university, the Ulster university and the other partners in the further education space.

If we look at the City Deal projects that I mentioned earlier, the health research institute, a cognitive analytics research lab and a centre for industrialisation and digitisation of robotics and automation, there is huge potential for spin-offs and for graduate employment.  There is also the retention of talent, in particular the retention of graduate talent.<\/p> <p>  If we think about the geography of our Strand Road location, with which Mr. Eastwood in particular will be familiar, and our proximity to the North West Regional College, we essentially occupy a shared site and a transition point between FE-HE, or further education and higher education.  The North West Regional College, like Donegal ETB, plays a really important part in this four-piece partnership.<\/p><p>Regarding the education partnership on that Strand Road site aligned to the innovations base, Mr. Hannigan alluded to Catalyst Inc., in particular.  Catalyst is based at Fort George in Derry, which will in time become the location of a major healthcare and medical facility through the development of a Western Health and Social Care Trust facility.  That will, in turn, provide significant opportunities for our community medics and trainee healthcare professionals.  At the moment, our largest student cohort in Magee is in nursing.  Our specialism in nursing is renowned worldwide for consistent outstanding performance in UK and world research terms.  It is consistently in the top five or six in UK research and in the 30s in terms of world-leading research in that nursing space.<\/p><p> From 2021, not only will we introduce medical training, but also the first course of its kind in paramedic training.  In terms of additional student numbers, healthcare is a huge focus for us and will remain so.  By developing that healthcare education piece and supporting it through healthcare research, the capacity for spin-off opportunities is endless in that space.<\/p><p> The question of remote learning came up.  Blended learning is something that Ulster University and LYIT have prided themselves on and pioneered development on in the past couple of decades.  In reality, we have been engaging in blended or remote learning for some time but the pandemic has forced us all into a gear change in how we participate in and attend to various responsibilities.  I am guessing this is the first time somebody has joined a meeting of the committee from Arboe, County Tyrone, and I am delighted to have that honour.<\/p><p> This is a changed world but a world of opportunity and we are incredibly well-placed, speaking in Ulster University-Magee campus terms, in that we have strong representation across all four faculties and each of those faculties is in that period of transition, transformation and development.  It is by working with colleagues in LYIT and other partners that we are doing that successfully.  Life and health will be transformed in Magee and in Derry through the initiation of the school of medicine and the health research institute.  Aligned to that are the paramedic training, the nursing and the successes therein.<\/p><p> I have mentioned the Ulster University business school.  We have an existing 15-year shared programme with LYIT in preparation for working in the public sector.  We are well down the discussion pathway towards introducing a new programme of cross-Border accountancy, taxation and dealing with challenges around export and excise, particularly in the face of Brexit.  That shared approach to business education and business research is well-established at this point.<\/p><p> The cognitive analytics and robotics development will make the north west a powerhouse in research terms and in research-led education in that industry 4.0 space.  As a former UK city of culture, the 1,500-year anniversary of the birth of Colmcille gives us a huge opportunity to celebrate the arts, humanities and social science offering at Magee and to further develop our partnership with the Hume foundation, celebrate the success of the Hume and O'Neill Chair in Peace and develop the presence of research and education in that space.  That is not to mention my own space, Irish studies.

Nobody is in favour of Brexit but the one advantage from our perspective, as I have been saying for a while, is that it brought the political focus back on the cross-Border area.  That had disappeared from the political agenda for a time.  The fact that Brexit arrived meant that, all of a sudden, there was a strong focus on cross-Border issues and what we were trying to do on a cross-Border basis.<\/p> <p>  In setting up this cluster, we were conscious of mitigating Brexit, particularly with regard to student mobility.  There are no physical obstacles to students moving between North and South and we have, maybe, 120 students from Northern Ireland studying in Letterkenny.  However, one would think we should have far more.  Similarly, there are big numbers from Donegal studying in Magee and Dundalk has similar movement of students.  It is more a traditional thing than anything else.  The movement has not been to the Republic of Ireland as much as it possibly should have been and it has mostly taken well-worn paths to Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin in the first instance.  It is only starting to trickle through and develop further into the institutes of technology in the past while.

There is a saying in Irish, &quot;m&uacute;ineann g&aacute; seift&quot;, which is essentially, &quot;necessity is the mother of invention&quot;.  The reality is that we have put in place a strong alliance and a positive partnership that might be looked upon as an antidote to some of the challenges around Brexit.  That shared approach and strategy and working collaboratively puts us in a good place in the north west to develop that.<br\/><br\/>One of the practical challenges that sometimes goes unnoticed is across the island we facilitate a different system of transition from post-primary to tertiary education.

It is strange that a student in Buncrana is unable to apply for a course at Ulster university's Magee campus, some three, four or five miles down the road, through the system most commonly used in her school.  Perhaps, therefore, there is an opportunity to explore a new approach.

The statistics on widening participation show the kind of impact it makes, particularly at Ulster university's Magee campus.  The most recent statistics show that 54% of students at Magee campus originate in the two lowest quantiles in terms of socioeconomic deprivation.

In his introductory remarks, he outlined the importance of LYIT and Derry to the wider north west.  During the last D&aacute;il term, the committee members visited Magee campus and LYIT.  It was very enlightening.  It demonstrated to us very clearly the importance of both Magee campus and LYIT to the broader economy.  It was very much underpinned by the North West Strategic Growth Partnership, whereby the local authorities worked very much together.  At the time of our visit, we met Mr. Seamus Neely, the then Donegal county manager, and his counterparts from Derry.  It was clear that not only did they have a memorandum of understanding but that they were also implementing programmes together, which was important.  We can have strategies and plans but if there is no implementation we are going nowhere.  It was the opposite in the region in question; things were happening through collaboration.  There was a great synergy involving the local authorities, and similarly between LYIT and the Magee campus.  That is very heartening.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted that Mr. Hannigan mentioned that further education is very much an aspect of the partnership.  As we know, the regional colleges were established to lead in the necessary economic development of the regions.  The further education colleges were then developed to meet the needs of the local economy and growing areas with the potential to create jobs.  It is important that the further education element be maintained.<\/p> <p>  Are the industrial promotion agencies, both north and south of the Border, an integral part of the delegates' work and thinking, in addition to the background work they do in preparing programmes?<\/p> <p>  The education architecture is set out regarding Connacht&ndash;Ulster through the proposed Connacht&ndash;Ulster alliance and the technological university involving GMIT, Sligo IT at LYIT.  Mr. Hannigan told us the application would be submitted in January.  When are decisions expected regarding the success, or otherwise, of such technological university applications?  When the alliance is put in place, there will be new demands and challenges.  I am very anxious that we do not sidetrack the impetus that has existed between Letterkenny and Derry and that we emphasise consolidating the new educational architecture between GMIT, Sligo IT and LYIT.  I hope that the parallel consolidation and further development of the important Letterkenny&ndash;Derry framework will be continued.  It is essential.  We all warmly welcome the shared island initiative of the Government.<\/p> <p>  As we know, education and health are two of the sectors identified in the Good Friday Agreement for development on an all-Ireland basis.  What the witnesses have been doing is putting into practice what is reflected in the overall thinking behind the Good Friday Agreement.  Now there is an opportunity to build on that, with specific funding, additional funding, provided through the shared island initiative.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn mentioned that we do not want universities and institutes of technology competing for students.  It is essential to the further development of new programmes in colleges that they be complementary and not compete with those of their neighbours, north or south.<\/p> <p>  I had the opportunity in Letterkenny and Derry to see at first hand the important ongoing work and the determination of both sides to make it succeed.

I missed the actual presentation but I did get a chance to read it in advance.  It is great to have the witnesses at this committee.  I am interested in higher education and in research in particular, which I did some work on as my party's spokesperson in the last D&aacute;il.  Brexit poses many challenges in the educational space north of the Border and in the UK.  European Research Council, ERC, funding and Horizon 2020 funding including FP9 funding is available within the EU but may not be available following Brexit.  That is a challenge for our witnesses and for other institutions across the Border.  Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, had some ideas to address this, as did the Irish Research Council.  The RIA is an all-island body established in 1735 and the Institute of Physics is an Ireland and UK body.  These are quite august institutions that predate independence and hence are organised on an all-island and wider basis and maybe there opportunities there.  One of the proposals that came through was that one way for universities in the North and the UK to continue to access ERC-type funding would be to have joint-chairs.  A proposal could be put together, for example, by the University of Ulster and a university south of the Border for a joint research fellowship, professorship, initiative or team.  That would also combat the risk of a flight of intellectual capital whereby research activity, research teams or research team leaders would move to other EU jurisdictions in order to access European funding.  It seems like a good idea and eminently practical on an all-island basis.  It would probably be a lot easier to run a joint chair between Belfast and Dublin than between Manchester and Dublin or London and Cork, for example.  Has that been progressed in any meaningful sense?  Is that something in which any of our witnesses is involved?  Is it something that might become a reality next year?  Is it something with which we could assist or is it even in the ether?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111900002#H00100","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605744000,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Smith for his contribution.

In response to the question on the State agencies, both IDA and Enterprise Ireland reside in our co-lab facility as I mentioned earlier.  We have very close contact with both organisations in terms of their engagement.  In terms of developing new courses and opportunities around research, real benefit comes from engagement with companies themselves.  We have really strong relationships with many of the FDI and Enterprise Ireland client companies that have been set up in terms identifying their needs and how we can meet them proactively in order to continue skills-based development within the region and to anchor those companies here.  In Letterkenny alone there are approximately 4,500 people in FDI employment and 60% of them are graduates from here.  We are also involved with Enterprise Ireland companies in Killybegs specifically looking at the development of the marine.  There are real opportunities there.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the development of the technological universities, Deputy Smith asked about the timescale.  It is our ambition to submit the application by the end of this year or the beginning of next year and that, having gone through all of the stages, the technological university will be set up by 1 January 2022.  That is the target we have set for ourselves.  We feel that we can achieve that and that is what we are working towards.  We will obviously continue the ongoing collaboration with the University of Ulster.  As I said earlier, the fact that the HEA is willing to fund both initiatives out of the same pot of money for a period of time is a recognition of the importance of both and the necessity to keep both of them going.  That will continue.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Professor &Oacute; N&eacute;ill to address the research question but I would just say that a meeting is being co-ordinated by SFI in the next couple of weeks specifically to look at North-South collaboration.

We very much hope that universities within the UK sector can continue to participate in Horizon Europe beyond Brexit in some way.  In the past four years Ulster university has been able to double its research income through diversification, partnership and collaboration.

I come from a legal background and Professor &Oacute; N&eacute;ill referenced the law school there.

Mr. Hannigan, Professor &Oacute; N&eacute;ill and those advocating and championing this are very firmly focused on the future, while understandably and rightfully acknowledging the very chequered history around the broader proposal of development for third level education in the north west.  In terms of some of the earlier remarks, it is probably the most significant commitment that a proposal has received from an Executive in the North.  That is to be welcomed and encouraged and from the perspective of this committee, we will always try to assist in bolstering and enabling that kind of commitment as opposed to being overly critical of it when it is there.<\/p> <p>  It should not surprise anyone that the Irish Government has made a significant contribution to this because in the first instance, it has more significant economic clout on the island.  It also has an equal responsibility for the well-being, welfare and future development of Ireland as a whole as anyone else.<\/p><p>Sharing Ireland means investing in Ireland.

The most prominent example is the endowed chair in peace, named in honour of John Hume and Thomas P. O'Neill.  It is hugely significant.  It is one of the few endowed chairs in the higher education space.  It also provides the foundation to bring together cognate areas of peace education and research.  Law and social science are huge parts of that.<\/p> <p>  In recent times we have worked with groups such as Foyle Women's Aid to establish a social justice hub at our Magee campus.  Staff at our law school and across the social science faculties have been integral to that.  We have also worked with agencies like the North West Community Network to ensure the impact of this is felt by the community and our students benefit from that kind of community and civic engagement.  As an institution, we pride ourselves on our civic engagement ethos.  I refer to our track record in peace and conflict resolution research.  The work of our researchers, particularly at the International Conflict Research Institute, INCORE, has been used globally.  At the moment we are looking at the development of a graduate academy for peace and justice to bring together the work of those various research fields.

Sometimes when we set up these major bodies a lot of the money can be diverted into very high-level projects that do not have an impact on the people on the ground.  We would obviously encourage investment in research on a cross-Border basis, but we must look at the impact on the people living in the space where the institutions are located.  This cluster was established to support the people in the region.  We would like the focus to be kept on that so that people who live here and go through further and higher education can reap the benefit.  We can work with the organisations that provide employment opportunities for those who wish to stay here and develop the region.

If one looks at Galway, Cork or Limerick, the number of Northern students tails off dramatically and is probably well below 100 in some of those institutions.  When talking about Limerick, it is worth noting the work of J.P. McManus has done with his all-Ireland scholarships which have benefited students with improved access from all parts of the island.  They have been very welcome for many people.<\/p> <p>  On student flows, particularly in regard to the north west, I appreciate this is more on the higher education front, but it is worth recording that there is a particular issue in terms of the further education provision in that area.  The North West Regional College in Derry and Strabane has a very high level of students coming from Donegal.  That is a much bigger flow than one would see in places such as Enniskillen or around Newry.  There is a long-standing issue with regard to Letterkenny's offering around the level 2 and level 3 provision in County Donegal.  This is something that both Governments need to regularise in some form in the coming months.<\/p> <p>  John Finucane made a point regarding peace studies and the work at Magee.  I might clarify something with Professor &Oacute; N&eacute;ill who might say something about the situation relating to the CAIN archives, which were slightly under threat.  I understand some good work has been happening in recent months to try to create a long-term sustainable solution in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On Northern institutions having ongoing access to Horizon Europe, the partnerships that are being developed, particularly between Ulster University and Letterkenny, will be instrumental in giving Northern institutions some type of route back into Europe.  That will be critical into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111900002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Farry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605744000,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I apologise to the committee.

It goes back to Ms Gildernew's point about how areas such as Fermanagh, south Tyrone and the general north west can benefit from that talent development enhancement.  Retention is absolutely game changing for the wider community, not just for the academic community, in quality of life and general healthcare.  The ability, for example, of small rural GP practices to stay open simply because the talent exists in the local population is transformational for urban and especially for rural communities in this part of the world.  That significance is worth identifying.<\/p><p> The same can be said for computing and engineering graduates, other life and health science graduates, social scientists, and graduates from arts and humanities who will make such a huge difference for quality of life going forward.  Retaining all of that talent, along with our business graduates, in the north west would be absolutely transformational.  Having that network of pathway opportunities from one institution to another, and the ability to go from level 2 onwards, from apprenticeships right through to PhD, within one's own region is exceptional.  We as a collective are absolutely committed to delivering on that.<\/p><p> Dr. Farry asked about the conflict archive on the Internet, CAIN, general peace studies and research, and Ulster University's undertaking on that.

A permanent home for the CAIN archive is now confirmed in collaboration with our Ulster University library, which has been transformed and enhanced through a &euro;1.5 million investment in the past year.  It has been transformational and we will continue to develop that, we will continue to develop the international networks around the Hume-O'Neill chair, as well as the CAIN archive.  We are also working on the development of a graduate academy model that will take in those cognitive areas such as law, social science etc. that will further enhance the offering in peace and conflict studies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111900002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Malachy &Oacute; N&eacute;ill","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605744000,"counter":469,"content":"<p>In response to the Chairman's question, which Professor &Oacute; N&eacute;ill has also addressed in terms of brain drain and retention of graduates, the retention of graduates in this region has increased significantly over the past ten to 15 years.

I am aware that some of our graduates are taking advantage of the academies that were set up by Ulster University and the North West Regional College in Derry who have worked with Alchemy Technology Services and FinTrU.  That is a movement of students and graduates that probably was not happening five or six years ago, but the opportunities are there now and people are doing really well because of it.  Our challenge is not to hem people in within the region, if they want to travel and choose to go elsewhere then that is a choice they have.  If we can provide the best we can in the provision we have, it increases the number of graduates who want to stay.  We can see this happening very clearly in the past while.  People are now making the decision that they want to be here.  They look at the quality of life and other issues attending to that, but they would not stay of the education provision was not good enough for them.

Further measures are contained in this Bill.<\/p><p>Article 31 of the directive requires that all member states establish a central register of beneficial ownership of express trusts.  The deadline for transposition of this article was March 2020.  It has been difficult to introduce legislation to provide for the establishment of this register, largely due to the extensive use of trusts in our common law jurisdiction.  Trusts are far more widespread in Ireland than in other civil law member states.  Fortunately, many trusts operate in sectors that are regulated and where the risk of money laundering is low.  As a widely-used mechanism in common law states, the flexibility of the trust is shown by its use for purposes such as pension funds, employee share funds, charities and sports clubs.  Trust are generally not used for these purposes in other members states.  Rather, the legal vehicles used across the EU are contractual arrangements or corporate entitles and as a result they come within the article 30 remit, which has less onerous reporting requirements.  As a result of trusts being used for these purposes in Ireland, Irish individuals could be discriminated against <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>citizens of other member states as they could find their personal information placed on a register merely by virtue of being a member of a pension scheme or in receipt of shares from their employer.  There are also significant data protection considerations, as acknowledged by the European Commission and echoed in advices from its legal services.<\/p><p>It is important to note that there is a requirement for the registers of all member states to be interconnected by March 2021.  This means that access to the information on these registers will be available not only to authorised bodies such as financial intelligence units and national competent authorities but also to the public across the EU where a legitimate interest can be shown.  Extensive consultation has taken place with the Office of the Attorney General, with external counsel and with solicitors both domestic and international to find an approach to transposition that would meet with the spirit of the directive, align us as closely as possible with our member state counterparts and impose only a proportionate and equitable legislative framework on Irish trustees and beneficiaries of trusts, whether institutional or individual.  These amendments are the result of that consultation.<\/p><p>An autonomous interpretation approach has been taken to the definition of &quot;express trusts&quot; and in doing so, similar arrangements in other member states have been considered.  The Attorney General advised that the effect of this interpretation under EU law is that a member state is entitled to exclude from the ambit of the article those trusts that are excluded by other member states by reason of their using a legal vehicle or similar arrangement that is not a trust.  As a result, occupational pension schemes, employee share schemes and the Haemophilia HIV Trust have been excluded from the requirement to register.  With regard to pensions and share schemes, further provisions may be made by regulations to capture beneficial ownership in a similar manner to other member states that do so with reference to article 30.  I am introducing a specific definition of &quot;beneficial owner&quot; for amateur sports bodies and unincorporated charities such that only the trustees, committee, governing body or individuals in control of the trust will have to register rather than every member of a club or every individual who donates to or is assisted by a charity.  Incorporated sports bodies and charities are obliged to register under SI 16 of 2019, which transposed article 30 and established a register of beneficial ownership for corporate identities.  These amendments also provide that I may further prescribe trusts to be included or excluded from the requirement to register under article 31 legislation, having taken into account factors such as the risk of money laundering and the way similar structures are captured in other member states.  For example, if it comes to my attention that there is an issue with a particular trust type, I can, as Minister, include them on the register.  Conversely, if it is shown that there is low risk, the Minister for Finance can exclude them completely.<\/p><p>AML, and counter-terrorist financing, CTF, has become an increasingly high-profile item on the EU agenda.  At the most recent meeting of ECOFIN, a comprehensive set of conclusions were agreed that aimed to strengthen and reform legislation in this area with the aim of publishing legislative proposals in the first quarter of next year.  Two of the most significant proposals concern the introduction of an EU single rule book and single supervisor in these areas.  It is anticipated that these matters will be achieved through the establishment of a stand-alone EU authority in these areas.  Given the uniqueness of our common law jurisdiction following the exit of the UK from the Union, I have ensured that these conclusions require any future developments of frameworks in these areas to take account of common law jurisdictions as well as civil law ones.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2020111900002#B00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":485,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":486,"content":"<p>Section 2, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":487,"content":"<p>SECTION 3<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1605744000,"counter":488,"content":"<p>There are a number of amendments to this section.

The committee will be aware that these amendments propose to add a substantial chapter into the Criminal Justice Act 2010, as amended, along with other amendments to add definitions and consequential changes.  I will provide an overview of the aim of these substantial amendments and, of course, provide further details on each of them if members wish.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of chapter 9A is to create a registration and supervision regime for AML purposes in respect of virtual asset service providers, VASPs.  In general, the purpose of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2020 is to transpose much of the 5th anti-money laundering directive, which requires providers of virtual services to be registered and supervised for AML-CTF purposes.  5AMLD defines virtual assets as \"a digital representation of value that is neither issued by a central bank or a public authority, nor necessarily attached to a fiat currency, but is accepted by natural or legal persons as a means of payment.\"  It is a digital representation of value that can be digitally traded, or transferred, and can be used for payment or investment purposes.  VASP refers to a natural or legal person who, as a business, conducts services involving virtual assets such as exchanges between virtual and fiat assets.<\/p><p>However, the directive is silent on what a registration process for VASPs should look like.  In framing this regime, we have sought to address our EU obligations, as well as the international obligations that arise from our membership of the Financial Action Task Force, FATF.  The FATF is the international organisation that sets global standards to fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Ireland is a long-standing member.<\/p><p> FATF has 40 recommendations, known as standards, which together provide guidance to members on what an effective AML-CFT framework looks like.  Our proposals for the Bill will address the VASPs criteria contained within the standards and therefore further strengthen our financial services framework to shield from the scourge that is money laundering and terrorist financing. <\/p><p> As part of the management and mitigation of emerging money laundering and terrorist financing regimes, FATF recommends that countries ensure VASPs are registered and effectively supervised for AML-CFT purposes.  In addition, the FATF guidance requires a VASP registration regime to allow for the Central Bank's withdrawal, restriction or suspension of a registration, where appropriate.  FATF also advocates for an offence of operating without a registration.  <\/p><p> Furthermore, FATF recommends that five categories of virtual asset service providers be supervised rather than the two specified in the fifth AML directive.  While there is a marked difference between the approaches of the EU and FATF on this issue currently, members should note that the EU has clearly indicated its intention to align EU rules in this area, with the FATF recommendations, as soon as possible.  Therefore our approach, in adopting legislation now that addresses the FATF recommendations, is careful.  It strengthens our financial systems and places us ahead of the curve in regard to EU requirements.  We believe it is in our best interest to construct our regulatory framework to meet both our EU and international obligations at this time.  The proposed chapter 9A addresses the requirements of the fifth AML directive and also the regime anticipated with reference to FATF guidance.  <\/p><p> The new chapter provides for the following: a registration and supervision regime, for AML-CFT purposes, for providers of services relating to virtual assets; enablement of the Central Bank, as competent authority, to undertake a detailed assessment of a firm's policies and procedures before granting registration; a fitness and probity regime to allow the Central Bank to undertake an assessment of the fitness and probity of the beneficial owners of these providers, before granting registration; enablement of the Central Bank to refuse a registration in circumstances where the Bank is not satisfied with the firm's AML-CFT policies and procedures, and-or the fitness and probity of the senior management and-or beneficial owners of the firm; and transitional arrangements for incumbent virtual asset service providers.<\/p><p> The regime proposed will contribute towards maintaining a robust framework in this area for Ireland.  It will need to be updated continuously, however, to meet the ever-changing and emerging money laundering and terrorist financing threats across the world.<\/p><p> As mentioned at the outset, this is a substantial amendment that includes a many provisions.  If members wish for me to speak in more detail about a particular section, I will be happy to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2020111900002#B00900","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":492,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1605744000,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 6, to delete lines 24 to 31 and substitute the following:  \t&quot;'virtual asset' means a digital representation of value that can be digitally traded or transferred and can be used for payment or investment purposes but does not include digital representations of fiat currencies, securities or other financial assets;<br \/><br \/>'virtual asset service provider' means a person who by way of business carries out one or more of the following activities for, or on behalf of, another person:<br \/><br \/>(a) exchange between virtual assets and fiat currencies;<br \/><br \/>(b) exchange between one or more forms of virtual assets;<br \/><br \/>(c) transfer of virtual assets, that is to say, conduct a transaction on behalf of another person that moves a virtual asset from one virtual asset address or account to another;<br \/><br \/>(d) custodian wallet provider;<br \/><br \/>(e) participation in, and provision of, financial services related to an issuer's offer or sale of a virtual asset or both; <br \/><br \/>but does not include a designated person that is not a financial or credit institution and that provides virtual asset services in an incidental manner and is subject to supervision by a national competent authority, other than the Bank;&quot;.&quot;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2020111900002#C00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":494,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":495,"content":"<p>Section 3, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":496,"content":"<p>SECTION 4<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1605744000,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 4:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, to delete lines 7 and 8 and substitute the following:  \t&quot; &quot;(ia) a virtual asset service provider,&quot;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2020111900002#C00700","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":499,"content":"<p>Section 4, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Sections 5 to 8, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":501,"content":"<p>SECTION 9<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1605744000,"counter":502,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 5 was tabled in the names of Deputies Michael Collins, Danny Healy-Rae, Michael Healy-Rae, Mattie McGrath, Nolan and O'Donoghue.

I thank every member, from the bottom of my heart, for committing to be on this Joint Committee on the Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community.  There is some unfinished work.  In the previous D&aacute;il the committee had a brilliant Chairman, the former Senator Colette Kelleher, who started a great deal of work.  I thank her for all her hard work.  I also thank the Ceann Comhairle for establishing this special committee.  We look forward to tackling some of the inequality and issues that impact on the Traveller community, and I look forward to working with all the members.  I propose that the committee go into private session.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2020111900002#A01100","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605744000,"counter":562,"content":"<p>The joint committee went into private session at 2.09 p.m. and adjourned at 2.44 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Thursday, 3 December 2020.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
