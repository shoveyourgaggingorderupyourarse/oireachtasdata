ETF investments can take many different legal and regulatory forms even where they are established within the same jurisdiction. <\/p>  <p>  An ETF is an investment fund that is traded on a regulated stock exchange. A typical ETF can be compared to a tracker fund in that it will seek to replicate a particular index. <\/p>  <p>  There is no separate taxation regime specifically for ETFs. \u00a0Being collective investment funds, they generally come within the regimes set out in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 for such funds. The domicile of the ETF will generally determine the applicable fund regime, specifically whether the ETF falls within the domestic fund regime or the offshore fund regime. <\/p>  <p>  Where the domestic fund regime applies, a &lsquo;gross roll-up&rsquo; applies such that there is no annual tax on income or gains arising to a fund but the fund has responsibility to deduct an exit tax in respect of payments made to certain unit holders in that fund.

Almost every advanced country in the world is in the same position, with inflation rates of 8, 7 and 7.4 per cent recorded in the US, UK and euro area respectively in March. <\/p>  <p>  The rise in wholesale energy prices is the key contributor and reflects the rapid rebound in global demand and, more recently, the war in Ukraine. Price spikes have been seen in a range of other commodities as well, including food, fertilisers and metals. Global supply chain disruptions, including the availability of inputs and transport bottlenecks, have also added to inflationary pressures. Domestically, the speed and strength of the economic recovery has led to an imbalance between demand and supply and put additional upward pressure on both wages and prices.<\/p>  <p>  Looking ahead, energy prices increases will continue to be a key driver over the coming months. Inflation is now expected to peak at around 6&frac34; per cent in the second quarter and average 6&frac14; per cent for the year as a whole. Pass-through price effects are expected in other sectors such as food (via higher fuel\/fertiliser costs) and consumer goods and services (due to higher energy inputs), and will add to core inflation, which excludes energy and unprocessed food, this year. Core inflation is expected to average 3.9 per cent for 2022 as a whole. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the impact of rising prices on citizens and businesses and has introduced a series of measures in recent months at a cost of over &euro;2 billion to help address the rising cost of living.

This followed an initial reduction in processing time from 40 working days to 35 working days which was made in March, and is a direct result of the staffing and resources the Department has invested in the Passport Service. <\/p>  <p>  There are currently over 167,000 applications in the Passport Service system. While there is a very high volume of applications, this does not represent a backlog. These applications are all being processed in the usual way, with a continuous stream of new applications and a continuous dispatch of completed passports happening every day.<\/p>  <p>  Figures show that of the total number of applications in the system, 61% are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. The other 39% of applications in the system are incomplete, which means the Passport Service is waiting for the applicant to submit the necessary documentation required. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently experiencing high demand for first time passports, particularly for children. First time passport applications take longer to process than renewal applications and there are a number of reasons for this. First time applications are necessarily complex to process, since, in many cases, they are applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is taking a number steps to deal with increased demand on its services:  The Passport Service has a comprehensive plan to ensure that adequate staff, accommodation and technology supports are in place to meet expected demand for passports in 2022.  A major recruitment drive has been underway over the past several months, which has seen the number of Passport Service staff increase by over 300 since June 2021.  The Passport Service is currently running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers. This recruitment effort will bring staffing numbers to over 900, which represents a doubling of staff compared to June 2021.\u00a0 Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications, such as first time child applications.  The Passport Service is prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time. Passport Service staff are working targeted overtime in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Urgent Appointment Service is available for customers who wish to renew their passport at short notice. Customers availing of this service can renew their passport within 1 or 4 days in Dublin, within 4 days in Cork and within 5 days in London.  In February, the Passport Service increased the number of appointments at its public offices by 100%, providing an extra 170 Urgent Appointments per week. A new document management system was put in place at the beginning of March. This aims to improve the processing speed in the Passport Service offices, and subsequent turnaround times for the applicant. One particular feature of the new system improves the processing time for applicants who have been asked to submit additional documents. Once the additional documents are received, they are being prioritised and complete applications can then be processed in 3 weeks. This significantly reduces the processing time, particularly for first time applicants.  Public information media campaigns reminding citizens to check and renew their passports will continue during this busy year.<\/p>  <p>  There is an updated Department of Foreign Affairs website, which includes a new passport service section where applicants can easily find out what additional documents are required for their type of application.  The Passport Service is also working on public education materials, including video tutorials, with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly. These videos will be shared on social media and will include instructions on submitting consent forms for child applications properly.  I am confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022, particularly for first time applications, and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.<\/p>  <p>  I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042700078#WRE02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":128,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[21463\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042700078#WRE02300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if documents in relation to an application for a passport in the case of a person (details supplied) will be returned; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":129,"content":"<p>With regard to the specific application about which the Deputy has enquired, the Passport Service has issued a passport to the applicant and supporting documents have been returned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042700078#WRE02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":131,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042700078#WRE02600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":130,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042700078#WRE02500"},{"type":"question","counter":131,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[21331\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042700078#WRE02600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if his Department or any organisations under his remit have purchased services from or otherwise sought to use technology developed and-or sold by a company (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1488","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":132,"content":"<p>I can confirm that neither my Department nor any organisations under my remit have purchased services from the company specified.<\/p><p>There are no records\u00a0of dealings with this company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042700078#WRE02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":133,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042700078#WRE02800"},{"type":"question","counter":134,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[21384\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042700078#WRE02900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he will sign over ownership of the military barracks in Nenagh, which is in a dilapidated state, to Tipperary County Council in order that it can make a decision on its future use.","asker":"1610","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":135,"content":"<p>The Department of Defence is currently progressing the application for First Registration of this property with the Land Registry. <\/p><p>Upon completion of this application, the property will then be a Registered Title held under a folio, and the Department of Defence will proceed with its disposal.

If they apply initially at their port of entry to the State they will still need to make a formal application at the Dublin offices of the International Protection Office (IPO) of my Department. There is no need to make an appointment. Everyone completes their preliminary interview under Section 13 of the International Protection Act 2015 on the day they first attend the IPO offices. Therefore, there are no applicants waiting for a preliminary interview.<\/p>  <p>  Applicants will generally receive the Temporary Residence Certificate on the same day they complete their application if there is no language barrier and if the number of applications the IPO received on that given day is not excessively high.<\/p>  <p>  If an interpreter is required to assist them or for other reasons beyond the control of the IPO, the applicant may need to be called back to complete their application. The call back appointment is usually arranged quickly, unless there is a difficulty with sourcing an interpreter for the required language.<\/p>  <p>  In recent months, the number of people claiming international protection has increased significantly with approximately 1,039 new applications received in the month of March alone. This has unfortunately impacted the IPO&rsquo;s ability to complete an application and issue TRC cards on the same day to applicants. There are currently approximately 937 applicants who need to return to complete their applications.<\/p>  <p>  The IPO has identified the practical efficiencies that can be made to improve the process and has put in place measures to ensure that the call back appointments are cleared as quickly as possible for the benefit of applicants allowing the majority of applicants complete the entire process on the first day. The target is to have up to 300 call back slots taking place per week to eliminate the backlog in the shortest timeframe possible, including by offering appointments at weekends. The IPO is determined to maintain the positive momentum around this approach and to continuing to ensure that the majority of new applicants receive their TRC cards on the day of application.<\/p>  <p>  You may be interested to know that the IPO received its highest ever number of daily applicants on 19 April 2022 (163 new applicants).

This is an entirely new scheme and separate to the \"fair deal\" scheme.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, work is on-going within the Department of Health to progress the development of the new statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services. Taking place within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, this work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, it is not possible to give you definitive dates for new statutory scheme. This is because there are dependencies for these pieces of work that are beyond the control of the Department. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In April 2021, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. A regulatory impact analysis will be undertaken by the Department in 2022 to ensure effectiveness and mitigate risks.<\/p>  <p>  In collaboration with HIQA and in consultation with the Health Service Executive and other key informants, the Department developed draft regulations and a targeted stakeholder consultation was undertaken in January 2022. Evaluating the feedback of this consultation is informing amendments in the draft regulations in advance of a public consultation planned in Q2 2022.<\/p>  <p>  On 24th February, the ESRI published a report on the demand for and cost of home support. This is the final output from a programme of research that the ESRI has undertaken to support the Department of Health to progress the development of the new home support scheme.\u00a0 This research will form an important part of the evidence base for the development of a sustainable funding model for home support services in the context of our ageing population.\u00a0 Government approval will be sought in due course on any proposed legislation to provide for a financial support scheme, taking into consideration the cost associated with the various options.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for the new scheme. \u00a0The Pilot for testing of a reformed model of service for the delivery for home-support is fully operational. It commenced in November in CHO 8, which is the first of the four pilot sites. The three other sites CHO2, CHO 4 and CHO 7 became operational in January 2022. \u00a0The pilot site evaluation will be critical to the development of the new home-support scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042700084#WRL01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":304,"content":"<p>Question No. 153 answered with Question No. 152.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Healthcare Infrastructure Provision","counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042700084#WRL01600"},{"type":"question","counter":306,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[21385\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042700084#WRL01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on a new publicly owned elective hospital being located in the mid-west.","asker":"1610","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":307,"content":"<p>The Cross Party Sl&aacute;intecare Report in 2017 articulated a new vision for healthcare in Ireland, including the provision of elective only hospitals, providing protected capacity for elective care.
