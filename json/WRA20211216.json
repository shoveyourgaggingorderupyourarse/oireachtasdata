That study highlighted that 55% of women stated they would not use public transport at night and 34% of women stated that feelings of insecurity have prevented them from travelling. The report also highlighted that 1 in 3 public transport users have seen or experienced some form of harassment or violence while using public transport. This presents a challenge at a time when we are committed to increasing usage of public transport and to achieve modal shift.<\/p>  <p>  While it should be noted that the vast majority of public transport passenger journeys occur without incident, I am of course concerned to ensure that the necessary arrangements are in place to protect the safety of all passengers and staff.<\/p>  <p>  The safety and security of both public transport passengers and staff, including arrangements to deal with anti-social behaviour, are important matters that, first and foremost, must be managed by every public transport company, in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, where appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has been engaging regularly with the NTA and the three CI&Eacute; companies, on the issue of anti-social behaviour. The companies have advised me of a number of initiatives being undertaken to help ensure the safety and security of both the travelling public and their staff. <\/p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have advised that, in conjunction with an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a joint focus on public order and anti-social behaviour has been in place since May 2021, with a particular emphasis on the Greater Dublin Area and the DART, Northern Line and Heuston to Portlaoise services.<\/p>  <p>  As of the 13th of December, four Garda Response Hubs are now in operation to support on-board staff at: Mallow; Limerick Junction; Thurles; and Portlaoise.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, an Athlone Garda Response Hub has been approved and will commence operations on 1st January 2022, with additional Response Hubs in Kildare (Kildare Town or Newbridge) and Roscommon (Castlereagh) in negotiation.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently supporting Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in carrying out on-board patrols on scheduled late night services over the Christmas period across the network in addition to ongoing joint Garda\/Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann operations, including high visibility patrols of stations where specialist Garda Teams included the Garda Dog Unit will be deployed.<\/p>  <p>  A text alert service has also been introduced to enable customers to discreetly report anti-social behaviour incidents<\/p>  <p>  Transdev Dublin Light Rail, who operate the Luas network on behalf of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, employ 50 security staff. These staff liaise with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regularly as part of their work, such as through the Operation Citizen initiative, commenced in October, which has increased the visual presence of Garda patrols, particularly in the city centre where heavy footfall Luas Stops are located. Concurrently they have reported that they are seeing a decrease in anti-social behaviour of circa 40% - at the same time as experiencing an increase in tram travel. <\/p>  <p>  Both Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann have reported that the level of anti-social behaviour is relatively low on their services and also noted a declining trend, which is positive.<\/p>  <p>  The entire Dublin Bus fleet is fully fitted with CCTV cameras, with up to 10 internal cameras and two external cameras fitted on the more modern vehicles in the fleet. Each vehicle is equipped with a radio, which facilitates immediate contact to the Central Control Centre.<\/p>  <p>  All of the company's buses are in radio contact with Central Control. Any instances of disruption or concerns around security are immediately reported and services are suspended as necessary. The company also has mobile inspectors in the city centre, who are available to attend incidents as required.<\/p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has invested in extensive CCTV coverage throughout its fleet for the protection of passengers and staff and driver security screens are fitted to the entire low-floor, single-deck and double-deck bus fleet. Emergency support for drivers is provided through 24-hour control centres and any incidents of anti-social behaviour are fully investigated and followed up with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as required.<\/p>  <p>  The combined interventions implemented to date have had a number of successes in tackling anti-social behaviour, particularly on the northern DART through teamwork between I&Eacute;&rsquo;s security provider, the Howth Junction Security Centre, Revenue Protection Unit staff, station staff and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, however this is an issue which will require continuing joint action. <\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, both Minister Ryan and I will continue to work collectively with all stakeholders to ensure the safest possible travel environment for members of the public, and safest possible working environment for the employees providing our valuable public transport services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600052#WRA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network","counter":18,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600052#WRA01700"},{"type":"question","counter":19,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[62299\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600052#WRA01800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the position regarding the Government approval of the DART+ West project; the planning timeline of the project; if it is possible the approved business case could change by the time planning is approved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question although I think there are probably three linked but separate questions I need to address.<\/p><p>Firstly, both Minister Ryan and I were delighted to secure Government approval last week for DART+ West.

Active travel initiatives together with improved and expanded public transport services across the country are essential for promoting modal shift. Projects like BusConnects in cities and Connecting Ireland in rural areas will help provide viable alternatives to the private car.  <\/p><p>BusConnects aims to support citizens&rsquo; travel needs by offering affordable, frequent and high-quality services throughout the day across the city-regions.It will overhaul the current bus system in the cities by implementing a network of &lsquo;next generation&rsquo; bus corridors, which includes segregated cycling facilities, on the busiest routes.  This will make journeys faster, predictable, and reliable. <\/p><p>BusConnects will also introduce a new system of ticketing known as Next Generation Ticketing and cashless payments. This will enable seamless transfers between bus services by reducing time consuming interactions with drivers and cutting boarding times. The ticketing equipment that is procured for BusConnects will be required to be capable of being used anywhere and will act as a foundation to introduce modern payment methods across all modes of public transport.<\/p><p>But improved public transport can&rsquo;t be just about cities. The Connecting Ireland plan is a major national public transport initiative developed by the National Transport Authority (NTA) with the aim of increasing public transport connectivity, particularly for people living outside the major cities and towns. It will significantly increase both the number of routes and the frequency of existing services right across the country.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be pleased to learn that Connecting Ireland proposes to specifically expand the public transport network in rural areas and to increase service levels. Under Connecting Ireland, the NTA is proposing an overall increase of approximately 25% in rural bus services as part of the five year Connecting Ireland plan. It will extend public transport services into many rural villages and areas for the first time and is a hugely important initiative .<\/p><p>Finally, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the <i>Strategic Rail Review<\/i>which my Department has undertaken in co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland.

In Budget 2020, in recognition of the challenging environment that the haulage industry faced at that time with regard to the prospect of a disorderly Brexit, the scheme was enhanced to the extent that when the retail price of auto diesel is over &euro;1.07, the marginal rate of compensation increases to 60% of the excise paid up to a maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cent per litre when the price of auto diesel is &euro;1.16 or over (VAT exclusive).   In recognition of the vital role that the haulage sector plays in the economy, the 2020 enhancement has been maintained since. It is worth noting also that businesses that are registered for VAT may deduct the VAT charged to them on the purchase of business inputs, such as road diesel and other motoring costs. <\/p>  <p>  Minister Ryan and I met on 10 December with representatives of the Irish Road Haulage Association (IRHA) to discuss a range of issues including fuel prices, decarbonisation of the HGV sector and skills issues including the HGV driver shortage. <\/p>  <p>  At the meeting with IRHA, the Department agreed to consider a proposal to expand the relief available to hauliers under the Diesel Rebate Scheme, but with a link to the phasing out of older, more polluting vehicles and an overall reduction in emissions from the sector.

The HGV driver shortage is not confined to Ireland; it has been a growing issue across Europe and globally for a number of years now.  It is a multifaceted issue with a range of different contributing factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which has clearly had a significant impact on the labour market for many sectors.<\/p><p>My Department established the National Logistics and Supply Chain<b><\/b>Skills Group in 2019, the key objective of which is to support the promotion of careers, skills development and sustainable employment in the logistics and supply chain sectors in Ireland.  The Group includes haulage and logistics sector industry representatives, education and training providers and all of the relevant Government Departments and Agencies. In July, I asked the Group to examine the HGV driver shortage issue and make recommendations, with specific regard to actions that can be taken by Government and the industry. These recommendations are aimed at ameliorating the supply issue, without undermining the working conditions and health and safety of drivers or other road users.  The Group is finalising its recommendations for submission to me in the coming days.<\/p><p>Much work is already underway in this space.<\/p><p>The promotion of education, training, careers and sustainable employment in the sector is crucial, along with skills development and career progression for existing workers.  My Department has engaged with the Department of Social Protection (DSP), which has dedicated employer relations teams offering a range of supports and services to employers to fill vacancies including recruitment campaigns, specialised jobs fairs and through the online portal JobsIreland.ie. I have written to Education and Training Boards across Ireland to offer support for the many HGV driver training courses offered by the ETBs around the country.<\/p><p>Regarding driver testing in Ireland, in the 4 weeks prior to December 12th, an average of 154 tests for HGV drivers were carried out by RSA testers each week, with a pass rate of almost 73%. This means that 112 HGV drivers were qualified on average each week.<\/p><p>Regarding recruitment of drivers from abroad, I understand that the DSP organises events in the EU\/EEA labour market for sectors where there are particularly acute labour shortages and that it will run a transport-focused recruitment event early in the new year.  My Department will engage with industry to promote the event.  <\/p><p>HGV drivers from outside the EU\/EEA must have a valid employment permit and a visa, if coming from a visa required state as defined by the Department of Justice.  Following engagement with my colleague Minister of State English at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the quota for employment permits for HGV drivers from outside the EU\/EEA has been removed.  These drivers must also exchange their HGV drivers licence for an Irish licence.  Ireland has licence exchange agreements with several countries and the Road Safety Authority, which oversees these agreements, is engaging with a number of other countries with a view to progressing further licence exchange agreements. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to publish a 10-year strategy for the haulage sector. The Government&rsquo;s aim is to develop a strategy that will focus on generating efficiencies and improving standards, and helping the sector move to a low-carbon future.  We remain mindful of the driver and skills shortage facing the sector, and a section of the Haulage Strategy will focus on this.<\/p><p>I will continue to proactively engage with the freight transport, distribution and logistics sectors and the Government is committed to continuing to support the industry. It is vitally important for education, industry, and government to work together to enhance the appeal of a career in road haulage and logistics, so that the sector can both attract and retain talent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600053#WRB03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600053#WRB03100"},{"type":"question","counter":93,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[62313\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600053#WRB03200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the extent of engagement with Transport Infrastructure Ireland and Cork County Council on the measures now proposed to make the N22 junctions safe between Macroom and Ballincollig; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1455","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":94,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport I have responsibility for overall policy and exchequer funding in relation to the National Roads Programme.

Since January 2019, there have been very regular discussions with shipping companies and other maritime stakeholders about the issue of maritime connectivity.  In that time, we have consistently received strong assurances from the shipping companies that if there is an increase in demand for shipping capacity on direct routes to Continental Europe, they would respond. <\/p>  <p>  This assertion has been borne out. We have witnessed throughout 2020 and 2021 an unprecedented response from the shipping industry in terms of increasing capacity to match market demand. It has occurred across all relevant modes and has drawn from all available responses. These responses include (1) utilization of surplus capacity, (2) increasing capacity by altering schedules, (3) redeploying vessels within their fleets, and (4) adding new capacity in the form of additional vessels. <\/p>  <p>  New\/additional direct ferry links with increased capacity including to Cherbourg, Dunkerque, Zeebrugge, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Roscoff, Le Havre and Santander have come on stream and are seeing high demand. These responses and the new services launched over this and last year demonstrate the commitment of the shipping companies to the Irish market.  <\/p>  <p>  Overall, Brexit has been a positive boost for Rosslare Europort with the largest growth of any port in the number of direct European services with sailings increasing from three a week in January 2020 to 14 return journeys currently (28 weekly).

The biofuel obligation, provided for under Part V of the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007 (as amended), requires fuel suppliers to include a certain proportion of biofuels in fuels for use in road transport. Currently, the biofuel obligation rate is 11% (i.e., not less than 11 litres in every 100 litres of road transport fuel is biofuel) and will increase to 13% next year. <\/p>  <p>  The Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy Statement which I published last month sets out a future trajectory of increase in biofuels use in land transport in line with Climate Action Plan targets to 2030, as well as a range of measures and incentives for future supply of renewable fuels such as biomethane and green hydrogen. My Department also intends, in early 2022, to carry out an assessment concerning the future availability of renewable fuels, which will inform implementation of this Policy beyond 2025.<\/p>  <p>  The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA), as administrator of the biofuel obligation, publish monthly statistics on volumes (litres) of oil consumption which is subject to the NORA levy and Biofuel levy obligation. NORA and obligated parties under the biofuel obligation submit raw data on biofuels to the OLA (database) in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, primarily in the context of blending biofuels with fossil fuels to adhere to the biofuel obligation. <\/p>  <p>  In 2020, over 239 million litres of biofuels were placed on the Irish road transport fuel market, mainly biodiesel and ethanol and to a lesser extent bio-liquid petroleum gas (LPG). Small quantities of biomethane were also placed on the market.  Biofuels in transport replaced c. 209 million litres of fossil fuels and avoided approximately 520ktCO2eq greenhouse gas emissions.

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. Electrification will be key to achieving this objective in the transport sector. <\/p><p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the <i>Climate Action Plan<\/i>, and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 945,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. <\/p><p>Considerable progress has been made, as a result of the work of the <i>Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce<\/i>, to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base, to over 47,500 now. <\/p><p>In addition, my Department convened the <i>Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group<\/i>to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. The <i>EVPP Working Group <\/i>comprises senior officials and has considered regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to help drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales.  <\/p><p>The recommendations of the EVPP Working Group were approved by Government and the full report is available online. <\/p><p>The Working Group examined the issue of price parity between EVs and ICE vehicles. The Report finds that there is divergence within the research community as to when TCO in economic terms cost parity will be achieved with some studies estimating that it is likely to occur in the middle of this decade, driven by falling battery prices and savings due to economies of scale, while others<b><sup><\/sup><\/b>argue that the cross-over point may not occur until towards the end of the decade. <\/p><p>In the meantime, in order to support the transition to EVs, the Group recommended that:<\/p><p>- The generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland should be retained until at least end-2022. Additional measures to further incentivise EVs and\/or disincentivise fossil fuelled vehicles will also be necessary. Cost-effective, targeted policy supports should continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years; and<\/p><p>- An <i>Office for Low <\/i>Emission<i>Vehicles<\/i>should be established, as a matter of priority, to co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure. The new <i>Office<\/i>should also take charge of developing and launching an extensive communication and engagement campaign, whole of Government in coverage, to drive the availability and understanding of key information regarding EVs, tailored to household, business and public sector consumers. <\/p><p>Overall, the Department is acutely aware that the cost of electric vehicles remains an issue for many consumers. To this end, electric vehicle policy is being kept under continuous review to endeavour to make low emission vehicles affordable. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Government is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the electric vehicle charging network over the coming years. A national charging infrastructure strategy is due for publication early next year which will set out a pathway to stay ahead of demand over the critical period out to 2030.<\/p><p>I am also aware that a report was published by the CCMA on the provision of guidance to local authorities on the provision of charging infrastructure.

The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department is reviewing the Scheme at present to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort. <\/p><p>Having an effective and reliable recharging network is essential to enabling drivers to choose electric. Charging at home is the most convenient and cheapest way to recharge. Targeting the installation of smart home chargers is a priority as we look to moving towards more energy efficient and sustainable ways to charge. A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open in the near future.<\/p><p>There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging, and workplace charging. <\/p><p>&euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022.

This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.<\/p><p>The Department is aware of initiatives to retrofit internal combustion engine cars to electric vehicles, and is giving the matter active consideration. Innovations that provide reliable solutions for people willing to transition to electric vehicles are to be welcomed, particularly if they provide options for people who might be unable to purchase a new vehicle. <\/p><p>There are various measures to consider when determining the effectiveness of this type of initiative.

It generally underpins our economic development, the expansion of our tourism sector and in particular our success in attracting foreign direct investment. Nevertheless, the contribution of aviation to climate change is undeniable and the need to move towards a more sustainable model is now fully accepted across the industry.<\/p>  <p>  Sustainable aviation is a very broad term that encompasses many facets of the aviation industry from greener airports, the use of sustainable aviation fuels, improved aircraft technology and more efficient air traffic management.<\/p>  <p>  Whilst my Department does not have any plans at present to introduce incentives in relation to sustainable aviation, it is considering strategies to promote the sustainability of the industry through the EU Fit for 55 package of proposals which includes, inter alia, measures to increase the uptake of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) and proposed amendments to the aviation aspects of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  For example, Ireland strongly supports the ReFuelEU Initiative which will mandate fuel suppliers to blend increasing levels of SAF with kerosene over the coming decades. Consultations are already ongoing to ascertain the impact the proposed mandated levels of SAF will have on the industry, and although Ireland currently imports over 90% of kerosene, it is possible that as the blending mandates increase, production of sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel may take place domestically.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, Ireland is also a keen proponent of the proposed Reform of the Single European Skies (SES) Regulatory Framework which will modernise the management of European airspace and establish more sustainable and efficient flightpaths. This can reduce air transport carbon emissions by up to 10%.<\/p>  <p>  As a &lsquo;technology taker&rsquo; Ireland does not have an indigenous aircraft or engine manufacturing industry and is unlikely to play a significant role in the development of new aircraft technology. It does, however, have the potential for mass generation of green energy and therefore green hydrogen. As outlined in the Climate Action Plan, green hydrogen will be an important tool in permanently decarbonising transport, including through the use of blended Sustainable Aviation Fuels and there may be opportunities for Ireland in this space as the technology develops over the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  The Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy Statement sets out a roadmap for the supply and use of renewable fuels in transport energy, including updates to the Biofuel Obligation Scheme. While sustainable aviation fuels are not obligated under the Biofuels Obligation Scheme, fuel suppliers that place SAF on the market in Ireland can apply for biofuel obligation scheme certificates for this. Additionally, the Department of Transport intends to carry out a review of the supply of renewable transport fuels in Ireland, such as biofuels, advanced biofuels, e-fuels, synthetic fuels, green hydrogen and biogas in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has put in place a range of funding measures to assist our airports with regard to climate resilience, including through the Regional Airports Programme (RAP) 2021-2025. The previous RAP provided funding for safety and security projects, however the 2021-2025 Programme now includes funding for capital projects with a sustainability focus. The funding is aimed at helping expedite airports&rsquo; efforts to reduce emissions in line with the 2021-2025 Programme&rsquo;s goal to move towards carbon neutrality. The COVID-19 Regional State Airports Programme 2021 also supported projects incorporating measures to support sustainability.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, the Climate Action Fund was established on a statutory basis in 2020. At least &euro;500 million will be available from this Fund over the period to 2027 to support projects, initiatives and research across the economy that contribute to the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s climate and energy targets, and goals.  To date, over &euro;140 million has been committed from the Climate Action Fund for a range of projects. Opportunities to secure support from the Climate Action Fund will also be available during 2022, particularly in relation to projects and initiatives that are aligned with the recently published Climate Action Plan.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to other possible funding opportunities, the European Union's Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) supports the development of Europe's transport, energy and digital services networks. Funding is awarded on a competitive basis and information on open calls under this programme and others is available on the EU's funding and tenders portal. Likewise the EU Innovation Fund which is financed from revenue from the auctioning of 450 million allowances from 2020 to 2030 under the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), aims to fund innovative technology that delivers the avoidance of Green House Gas emissions. In Ireland this fund is administered by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600055#WRD01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","counter":192,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600055#WRD01500"},{"type":"question","counter":193,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[62107\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600055#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to deliver the port access northern cross route; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1497","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":194,"content":"<p>Louth County Council is the statutory planning and road authority for its area of responsibility.

The Report finds that there is divergence within the research community as to when TCO in economic terms cost parity will be achieved with some studies estimating that it is likely to occur in the middle of this decade, driven by falling battery prices and savings due to economies of scale, while others<b><sup><\/sup><\/b>argue that the cross-over point may not occur until towards the end of the decade. <\/p><p>In the meantime, in order to support the transition to EVs, the Group recommended that:  <\/p><p>- The generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland should be retained until at least end-2022. Additional measures to further incentivise EVs and\/or disincentivise fossil fuelled vehicles will also be necessary. Cost-effective, targeted policy supports should continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years; and  <\/p><p>- An <i>Office for Low <\/i>Emission<i>Vehicles<\/i>should be established, as a matter of priority, to co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure. The new <i>Office<\/i>should also take charge of developing and launching an extensive communication and engagement campaign, whole of Government in coverage, to drive the availability and understanding of key information regarding EVs, tailored to household, business and public sector consumers. <\/p><p>Overall, the Department is acutely aware that the cost of electric vehicles remains an issue for many consumers. To this end, electric vehicle policy is being kept under continuous review to endeavour to make low emission vehicles affordable. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600055#WRD03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":214,"content":"<p>Question No. 84 answered with Question No. 61.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aviation Industry","counter":215,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600055#WRD03800"},{"type":"question","counter":216,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[62250\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600055#WRD03900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"when his Department will begin preparing a new national aviation policy; and if he will provide an indicative timeframe for the completion of same.","asker":"1519","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":217,"content":"<p>The National Aviation Policy (NAP) was published in August 2015.

This Office, which I chair, is situated within the Department of Finance and has held meetings with a wide range of stakeholders including insurance companies, and representative organisation on issues surrounding competition. Its aims are to help expand the risk appetite of existing insurers and explore opportunities for new market entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance. In relation to this, the Office is working with IDA Ireland to help leverage the ongoing insurance reforms with the aim of targeting new entrants to the Irish market or seeking current incumbents, to expand their existing operations here.  <\/p><p>In recent weeks, as part of this work I met with the CEOs of the major insurance providers in Ireland. They have confirmed that they are committed to passing on savings from the Guidelines, and other reforms, to customers. They also reiterated their support for the reform agenda and that they are adhering to the Guidelines in direct settlements with their clients. The need to expand their risk appetite into &lsquo;pinch-point&rsquo; sectors that are experiencing issues with availability and affordability of cover, particularly high-risk\/high-footfall areas, such as leisure activities was impressed upon providers at all our engagements. Some insurers indicated they are actively considering growing their business in certain areas.Separately, I also recently met with a leading international insurance brokerage firm, and discussed both the question of supply and the Irish market in general. In this regard, I also believe that insurance brokerage firms have an important role in assisting clients in sourcing cover, particularly in niche areas where their expertise and underwriting networks can add real value.<\/p><p>In conclusion, this Government is committed to securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland. In this regard, it is my intention to work with my Government colleagues to ensure the timely implementation of the Action Plan which will bring benefits to individuals, businesses, community and voluntary groups across Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600056#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consumer Prices","counter":235,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600056#WRE01100"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[62402\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600056#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the measures he plans to take to curb inflation and the impact it is having on the cost of living for those on low and middle incomes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":237,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[62405\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600056#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the measures he is taking to deal with the increasing cost of living and the impact this is having on low and middle-income households; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":238,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 107 together.<\/p><p>The Government is very conscious of the recent spike in consumer price inflation, which reached 5.4 per cent in November.  This, of course, is not unique to Ireland, with the majority of advanced economies recording relatively high rates of price inflation in recent months.  That said, it is worth pointing out that this comes after several years of low inflation: the price level in Ireland is well below the level it would have been had inflation been in line with the ECB's price stability target of 2 per cent over the last two decades.<\/p><p>The recent rise in inflation is partly explained by global factors, including the recovery in oil prices following the pandemic-induced decline in prices last year, global supply chain disruptions and the imbalance between supply and demand in the markets for some goods and services following the re-opening of the economy.  Many of these factors are expected to fade over the course of next year.  <\/p><p>In its <i>Economic and Fiscal Outlook<\/i>, published alongside <i>Budget 2022<\/i>, my Department forecast a headline inflation rate of 2&frac14; per cent both for this year and for next.  A scenario analysis was also presented which showed the impact <i>inter alia<\/i>of higher energy prices on this projection.<\/p><p>The recent rise in wholesale energy prices means there is likely to be some upside to the projection for next year.  Nevertheless, the baseline projection that the rate of inflation eases over the course of next year remains valid; while persistently higher inflation cannot be ruled out, this is not the central assumption. <\/p><p>The Government has responded to higher inflation in a timely manner, with a range of measures introduced in <i>Budget 2022 <\/i>to protect households against increases in the cost of living.  <\/p><p>At a macro-level, these include a personal income tax package worth &euro;520m and a social welfare package of over &euro;550m. <\/p><p>At a micro-level, the fuel allowance was increased by &euro;5 per week to compensate lower-income households for higher energy costs as a result of the increase in the carbon tax. There were also increases in the allocation of Early Learning Care and School-Age Childcare to ensure childcare prices do not rise. <\/p><p>Furthermore, following the recent rise in energy prices, the Cabinet this week approved an Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment of up to &euro;100 in 2022 to an estimated 2.1m domestic electricity account holders. <\/p><p>In conclusion, the Government has responded to the mitigate the cost of living increases and my Department will continue to monitor inflationary developments closely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600056#WRE01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600056#WRE01500"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[62110\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600056#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of householders who made a local property tax return; the number of householders who accepted the initial Revenue Commissioners' determination; if a figure is available for projected revenue that will be raised by the tax in 2022; the way in which this compares with the past five years, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":241,"content":"<p>The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 provided for a revaluation of properties to form the basis of the Local Property Tax (LPT) charge from 2022. <\/p><p>LPT for the years 2022 to 2025 will be based on property values on 1 November 2021.

Ireland, in line with the VAT Directive and by way of special derogation from the general rule, maintains several &ldquo;standstill&rdquo; provisions and derogations that allow us to maintain reduced rates to certain supplies for historical reasons. It is on this basis that Ireland applies its 13.5% reduced rate of VAT to the supply of fuel, gas, oil, and electricity services for both domestic and commercial use.

The restructured credit is of the same value i.e. &euro;1,650 per annum as the one-parent family tax credit and it also carries the same entitlement to the additional &euro;4,000 extended standard rate band, which increases that band to &euro;36,800 per annum, before liability to higher rate of income tax arises. However, the credit is more strategically targeted, in that it will in the first instance only be available to the principal carer of the child. <\/p>  <p>  The Single Person Child Carer Credit is available if you are the &lsquo;primary claimant&rsquo;. To be a primary claimant your qualifying child must live with you for the whole, or greater part, of the year (a period greater than 6 months).

An increase of &euro;1,500 in the income tax standard rate band for all earners was also announced.

The Government is committed to holding insurers to account and ensuring that consumers experience the benefits from the range of measures being implemented under the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. As the Deputy will appreciate, consistent implementation of these Guidelines by insurers, PIAB and the Judiciary will be vital in achieving an improved claims environment.  <\/p>  <p>  The National Claims Information Database (NCID) is published by the Central Bank of Ireland. The NCID contains a wealth of data that can provide insights into developments within the insurance sector such as the cost of premiums; the cost and frequency of claims; the settlement of claims; the revenues and expenditures of firms, and the profitability of the sector. As the Deputy is aware, there is no comparable resource in the UK, or indeed any other EU market. As such, the NCID allows us to monitor the impact of any reduced costs that insurers incur on the cost of premiums. I believe this is more valuable than monitoring the impact of a single reform such as the Personal Injuries Guidelines, especially as there are multiple reforms being pursued under the Action Plan, which may also impact on the cost and availability of insurance.<\/p>  <p>  That said, following the publication of the Personal Injuries Guidelines, officials engaged with the Central Bank of Ireland to consider possible further enhancements to the NCID data specification.  In this regard, the Bank has outlined its intention to collect additional claim settlement data for all classes of business within the remit of the NCID so as to obtain further information on the impact of the Guidelines on claims settlement.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that it is still early days in terms of assessing the impact of the Guidelines, and any data available to date is preliminary in nature. Nevertheless, I am pleased to note that the latest CSO data, and the recently-published third NCID Report on Private Motor Insurance, both point to a continuing decline in the price of motor insurance. In time with consistent use of the Guidelines this should help to further bolster this downward trajectory, and the NCID will allow us to see whether this is the case. The NCID has already proven to be an excellent tool when it comes to increasing transparency regarding how the cost of claims impacts on the price of premiums. In light of the ongoing expansion that is planned, I believe that it remains the most effective measure to objectively monitor whether savings arising from the Personal Injuries Guidelines, as well as other reforms, are being reflected in premiums.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600056#WRE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":253,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600056#WRE02900"},{"type":"question","counter":254,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[62342\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600056#WRE03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will direct banks operating in the State to provide customers with written banking statements on a monthly basis, if requested by the customer.","asker":"1525","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":255,"content":"<p>All credit institutions in Ireland are independent commercial entities and decisions in relation to the provision of bank statements are made by the boards and management of individual banks.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Central Bank that Chapter 6 of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 &lsquo;Post-sale Information Requirements&rsquo; sets out the requirements that regulated entities must follow when providing statements to consumers in relation to deposit, credit and investment accounts, including the consumers right to receive statements on paper.<\/p>  <p>  Provision 6.2 of the Code sets out that in relation to these accounts, a regulated entity must inform a consumer that he or she may request the statements to be provided on paper and, if requested by the consumer, the regulated entity must provide these statements on paper to the consumer.<\/p>  <p>  The Code provides that the regulated entity must provide the consumer with these statements at least annually. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the Central Bank is currently conducting a review of the Code and a public consultation on the Central Bank&rsquo;s proposals for amendments will take place as part of the review giving all stakeholders an opportunity to make submissions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600056#WRE03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners","counter":256,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600056#WRE03200"},{"type":"question","counter":257,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[61505\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600056#WRE03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department has the authority to initiate or commission an investigation or a review into the Revenue Commissioners; and if so, the number of investigations or reviews his Department initiated in the past five years.","asker":"1491","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":258,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[61506\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600056#WRE03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department will consider commissioning an investigation to review the tax agreement signed between the Revenue Commissioners and the courier sector in October 1997 (details supplied) to assess the grounds upon which the deal was signed, the financial implications to the State and to the workers involved and the knock-on effect to other sectors.","asker":"1491","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":259,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 142 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware, in accordance with section 101 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011, the Revenue Commissioners are independent in the performance of their functions under, or for the purposes of, the laws governing taxation.  Furthermore, all taxpayers have rights of appeal under tax law against assessments to tax raised on them by Revenue. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the agreement reached between the courier sector and Revenue in 1997, I am advised that the purpose of the arrangement was to ensure that motor bike and bicycle couriers that were engaged on a regular basis by courier businesses were assisted in relation to their tax compliance by having tax deductions made when they were paid for their services.  In order to participate in the scheme, the couriers in question had to be bona fide self-employed and as such there was no cost involved to the Exchequer. The courier companies that operated this &lsquo;voluntary PAYE&rsquo; scheme did so of their own volition and made the necessary remittances to Revenue based on the deductions from the payments they made to individual couriers.  <\/p>  <p>  From the courier&rsquo;s perspective, no additional costs arose because they participated in the scheme.  As they were self-employed, when they filed their annual income tax return at year end, they were given a credit for any tax deducted by the courier companies against their final tax liabilities for the year.  In addition, in recognition of the fact that couriers had to cover the costs of insurance, repairs, fuel etc. on their own vehicles, the agreement also provided for a flat deduction of 45% of the courier&rsquo;s gross annual turnover as expenses of their trade, such that tax only became payable on the balance of 55% of their turnover.  This aspect of the agreement was withdrawn at the start of 2019 when PAYE Modernisation was introduced.  In common with all other self-employed persons, couriers should now claim any expenses of their trade in their annual income tax return.<\/p>  <p>  I am further advised that the &lsquo;voluntary PAYE&rsquo; scheme operated by courier companies has all but ceased to exist, with 2 companies operating the scheme for 10 individual couriers in 2021 and that no similar arrangements exist, or have existed, for any other business sector.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it conducts a full range of compliance interventions to combat all types of tax evasion. Furthermore, Revenue compliance interventions include a focus on the practice of disguised employment and challenging the inappropriate classification of workers as self-employed contractors.  These interventions are conducted by Revenue acting alone or in collaboration with Department of Social Protection officers, who examine the PRSI status of individuals as part of such interventions as well as with officers from the Workplace Relations Commission, who are responsible for examining employee rights including sick leave and other entitlements. <\/p>  <p>  I am fully satisfied that Revenue has and will continue to administer the tax code fairly and in accordance with underlying law.  The agreement reached in 1997 between Revenue and the courier industry was a pragmatic approach to secure as much voluntary compliance from within the sector as possible.  The instances of the take-up of the scheme today has significantly reduced and Revenue has more administrative powers at its disposal to secure compliance from all commercial sectors than it did back in the 1990s when the agreement was made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600056#WRE03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":260,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600056#WRE03600"},{"type":"question","counter":261,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[60863\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600056#WRE03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, rates will be restored for the hospitality sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":262,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[60439\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600056#WRE03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will reinstate the employment wage subsidy scheme for enterprises that need it at this difficult time for traders; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":263,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[60861\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600056#WRE03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position in relation to the reduction in income that many workers in hospitality sector face due to the employment wage subsidy scheme being cut in the coming weeks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1520","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":264,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[60852\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600056#WRE04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans for the employee wage subsidy scheme until the new year given the current and evolving Covid-19 situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":265,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113, 159, 249 and 250 together.<\/p><p>The objective of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is to support employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 crisis. It is an economy-wide scheme that operates across all sectors.  <\/p><p>In monetary terms, the overall support provided to-date (9<sup>th<\/sup>December) by EWSS is over &euro;6.6 billion comprising direct subsidy payments of almost &euro;5.73 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;902 million to 51,700 employers in respect of over 696,900 employees.  <\/p><p>Following the agreement of Government on 3 December 2021, my Department and Revenue sought to develop a proposal to modify the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) to provide for a supplementary subsidy (in addition to EWSS) for businesses which are subject to the latest restrictions on operating.  The objective of the modified scheme was to provide targeted, timely and sector-specific support to supplement the reduced EWSS payments to the sector. <\/p><p>However, on further consideration and analysis of the data on CRSS, it proved to be administratively complex to design such a scheme and it would not be possible to have it operational ahead of Christmas as was hoped. The proposed modifications which included a change to both the turnover threshold and the rate, as well as consideration of a higher weekly cap, had the potential to significantly increase the cost of the scheme, particularly in the context of uncertainty around the trajectory of Covid-19 and the impact of the Omicron variant. <\/p><p>Instead, maintaining the enhanced rates of subsidy under the EWSS offers a relatively more efficient and effective way to support affected businesses in the immediate term. As such, the Government decided, and it was announced on Thursday last (9<sup>th<\/sup>December), that the enhanced rates of EWSS subsidy would apply for a further two months, December 2021 and January 2022. This will give certainty to businesses when they need it most. <\/p><p>The Government and I have been clear that there will be no cliff edge to supports for employers but we have also been clear that the EWSS cannot run indefinitely, nor is it sustainable to continue with the enhanced rates for a prolonged period of time given the very substantial costs to the Exchequer.<\/p><p>As such, from 1 February 2022, the original two-rate structure of &euro;203 per week and &euro;151.50 per week will apply; for March and April 2022 the flat rate subsidy of &euro;100 per week will apply and the scheme will end on 30 April 2022.<\/p><p>The CRSS will remain in place to support businesses who are required to close or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises, and who meet the qualifying criteria.

We intend to issue proposals emanating from the Review of the Policy Framework for consultation shortly. <\/p><p>In terms of supporting the sector to provide essential financial services to local communities, the following are some recent developments which highlight the potential of the sector to fulfil a role in relation to community banking.  <\/p><p><b>Review of Lending and Investment Regulations<\/b><\/p><p>The Central Bank has in recent years reviewed both the lending and investment frameworks. Since 1 January 2020, credit unions now have a combined capacity to provide up to &euro;1.1 billion in additional SME and mortgage loans, with further  capacity available to credit unions who can comply with certain conditions or on approval by the Central Bank. As of June 2021, credit unions had a combined mortgage and SME loan book of circa &euro;372 million, an increase of 18% year-on-year.  <\/p><p>Credit unions are permitted to place their surplus funds that have not been lent to members in a range of investments including Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). I am pleased to share with the Deputy that two credit union backed funds have received approval from the Central Bank. Credit unions will be able to invest up to &euro;900 million in these regulated funds, which will subsequently lend to AHBs. <\/p><p><b>SME Lending <\/b><\/p><p>Nineteen credit unions were approved in early 2021 for participation in the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. Further development of SME lending in a controlled manner could also assist credit unions in growing and diversifying their loan book. Further, in November five credit unions were announced as participants in the &euro;330m Brexit Impact Loan Scheme (BILS). The BILS is a successor to the Brexit Loan Scheme and provides low-cost loans of &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m to eligible Brexit-impacted businesses. While its predecessor had been available through participating banks, the BILS will now also be available through participating credit unions, ensuring wider accessibility of the scheme.<\/p><p>In total, SME lending has grown 5.6% year on year to end June 2021.<\/p><p><b>Access to Finance for Retrofit <\/b><\/p><p>The Government significantly increased the funding available to support retrofit in Budget 2022.

The value of the gift is calculated by reference to the difference between any consideration paid by the beneficiary for the use of the property and the &ldquo;best price obtainable in the open market&rdquo; for the use, occupation, or enjoyment of similar property for that year.  On foot of a recommendation to align the CAT code, I included a provision in Finance Bill 2021 (as initiated) to amend section 40 as it applies to the treatment of interest free (and low interest) loans.  <\/p>  <p>  Generally, the calculation of the best price obtainable in the open market for the use, occupation, or enjoyment of an asset is carried out by reference to the value of the gift received.  For example, where a person is given the free use of a house, the gift would be valued at what it would cost to rent an equivalent property on the open market.  In the case of the free use of money in the form of an interest-free or low interest loan, however, the Revenue practice to date has been to accept the current best financial institution deposit interest rate as the best price obtainable in the open market at the end of each year. As such, the value of these loans has been calculated by reference to the cost of making the gift, rather than the value of the gift received.  This is out of step with the way the value of the free use of other types of property is calculated for CAT purposes.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed amendment aimed to address this inconsistency by specifying that the annual value of an interest-free or low interest loan was to be calculated by reference to the best borrowing interest rate obtainable for the same sum. The intention was that a person in receipt of an interest-free or low interest loan would consult the published borrowing rates of the leading financial institutions in order to determine the best rate. <\/p>  <p>  However, while this approach may be in line with the treatment for the free use of other property, it does not take account of the nuances inherent in how financial institutions determine the appropriate interest rate as lenders. Therefore, it may prove difficult to apply in practice. For this reason, I decided to withdraw the amendment at D&aacute;il Committee Stage, to allow for further time and consideration to be given to the proposal. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the recent publication of the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) to which the Deputy has referred, this shows that almost 42% of first-time buyers, and almost 25% of mover purchasers, used gifts to help fund deposits needed to secure a mortgage to purchase a home. However, they said that the main source of deposits was from savings, with 96% of first-time buyers using savings to fund their deposits for mortgage loans. It is my understanding that the gifts the BPFI was referring to were in the form of outright gifts of money, rather than loans of money, i.e. there was no repayment aspect to these gifts, unlike with an interest-free or low interest loan. The Deputy should note that  it has always been the case that where the taxable value of a gift exceeds the relevant Group threshold, which would include gifts of money to buyers to help fund deposits, a CAT liability will arise. I have proposed no changes to the legislation in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600056#WRE06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Growth","counter":289,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600057#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":290,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[62304\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600057#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he remains satisfied regarding the durability of Ireland&rsquo;s economy and its continued ability to withstand economic shocks, internal or external; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":291,"content":"<p>Due to the success of our vaccination programme earlier this year, restrictions were eased with the domestic economy recovering strongly as a result. Modified Domestic Demand (MDD) &ndash; the best measure of domestic economic activity now exceeds the level immediately preceding the pandemic (2019-Q4) by around 3 per cent. Improvements can also be seen in the labour market with the unemployment rate including PUP recipients now below 7 per cent, the lowest rate since the onset of the pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  Looking forward, early indications point towards an easing in growth rates in the domestic economy in the fourth quarter. Part of this is the continued adjustment in growth towards pre-pandemic trends with re-opening effects and pent-up demand tapering off. Clearly, any further deterioration in the current epidemiological situation that results in the re-introduction of significant restrictions would hamper the economic recovery. However, with our booster campaign ramping up, and nearly a third of those who are fully vaccinated having now received a third jab, I am confident that, once we overcome the fourth wave of the virus, our economy will strengthen. <\/p>  <p>  The rapid rebound in domestic economic activity however has also been accompanied by rising inflationary pressures. However, this recent rise in inflation is partly explained by global factors, many of which are expected to ease over time but may prove persistent.  Needless to say, significantly higher inflation next year would have significant impacts on the wider economy and public finances. My Department will therefore continue to monitor inflationary developments closely and respond as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  Over the longer term, thanks to the strength of our economic model, including our well educated work force and pro-enterprise culture, I believe our economy will remain resilient to future economic shocks. However, we have borrowed heavily to provide support to the economy and minimise the negative effects of the pandemic. While such a counter-cyclical approach was both appropriate and necessary, the ongoing cost is significant.

The internationally-agreed minimum effective tax rate is 15%.<\/p><p>To ensure consistency in the application of the rules internationally to calculate effective tax rates, as a first step the GloBE rules set out a common basis for measuring profits. The starting point for measuring profits for GloBE purposes is to take the financial accounting information for the companies concerned, subject to certain agreed adjustments. This is the case whether the companies in question are in Ireland or anywhere else in the world.<\/p><p>The second step in calculating the effective tax rate is to work out the amount of tax to be matched against the profits. Again, the tax figure is taken from financial accounting information, subject to certain agreed adjustments. The use of financial accounting information in both steps sets out a robust process for calculating effective tax rates.<\/p><p>The report which is the subject of the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to section 291A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (&ldquo;<i>Section 291A<\/i>&rdquo;). Section 291A provides for allowances in respect of capital expenditure on the acquisition of certain intangible assets, referred to as <i>specified intangible assets<\/i>. Section 291A claims that are based on the amortisation or impairment charge, computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice, in the company accounts will align with the GloBE rules of Pillar Two. Where the Section 291A claim exceeds the amount of such charge in the company accounts, the GloBE rules will intervene to limit any deduction, for minimum tax purposes, to the charge in the accounts&mdash; unless the excess is attributable to a short-term timing difference that will subsequently reverse in the company&rsquo;s accounts. Section 291A allowances are made in respect of real expenditure reflected in the financial accounts and are not unique to Ireland.<\/p><p>The report in question also refers to the so-called <i>double Irish<\/i>structure. As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland has made changes to its corporate tax residence rules in Finance Act 2014 that are specifically designed to prevent such structures. Since 1 January this year, following a transitional period, the changes concerned have come into full effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600057#WRF02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Coverage","counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600057#WRF03000"},{"type":"question","counter":318,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[62348\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600057#WRF03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that persons with eating disorders are currently being denied access to mortgage protection insurance policies, at times on a near permanent basis in respect to persons with long-term conditions; the steps he is taking to address the issues faced by persons unable to access life insurance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":319,"content":"<p>I note that the questions refers to difficulties accessing life insurance for individuals with eating disorders. With regard to applications for life insurance, it is my understanding that generally, insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply. These can include age; health; family medical history; occupation; and lifestyle. In addition, these may be determined or linked to the policy duration. In the case of mortgage protection policies, these tend to be over the lifetime of the repayment schedule. In addition, my understanding is that different insurers do not use the same combination of rating factors.  Accordingly, prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and will be priced in accordance with firms&rsquo; prior claims experience.<\/p>  <p>  My officials have previously engaged with Insurance Ireland about accessing life insurance for individuals with medical conditions. According to Insurance Ireland, it is not standard practice to automatically decline cover for any cohort of applicants. It stated that insurers are obliged to assess the risk involved as part of any application for a life insurance policy, which will be specific to the individual applicant, and that the availability of cover depends on a number of factors. In this regard, I understand that applicants are asked questions about various conditions in order for insurers to assess the risk involved, and that all applicants are assessed against the same criteria. If higher risk is identified as a result of this assessment, Insurance Ireland has advised that the policy will be adjusted accordingly, and cover may be declined if the applicant poses a risk beyond the insurer&rsquo;s threshold.<\/p>  <p>  It may be useful for the Deputy to know that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance cover, which can be accessed at feedback@insuranceireland.eu. Where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes that consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can intervene in the provision or pricing of insurance products, nor can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600057#WRF03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":320,"content":"<p>Question No. 130 answered with Question No. 101.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":321,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600057#WRF03400"},{"type":"question","counter":322,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[62133\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600057#WRF03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has considered making tips received in the hospitality sector tax free; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":323,"content":"<p>Section 19 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 sets out that tax under Schedule E shall be charged in respect of every public office or employment of profit. Section 112 of the TCA 1997 brings into charge all salaries, fees, wages, perquisites or profits whatever arising from an office or employment. Therefore, all tips, gratuities and service charges arising from an office or employment are chargeable to income tax under Schedule E in accordance with section 112. I have no plans to change this position. <\/p>  <p>  Gratuities from customers for example, service charges in hotels or tips in restaurants, paid to the employer and subsequently paid out to an employee should be included in pay for the income tax week or month in which they are paid out. These tips constitute pay for the purposes of the PAYE system.  However, in a situation where an employee receives tips directly from customers, the employer is not obliged to operate PAYE and in that case, the tips and gratuities are fully taxable and should be included by the employee in his or her income tax return.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is progressing legislation on tips and gratuities. It will prohibit the practice of using tips or gratuities to top up wages. It will also ensure that electronic tips and gratuities, which are much more common these days, have to be divided fairly and equitably among the staff.

Road transport is a sector earmarked for radical decarbonisation, and motor vehicle taxation is an important policy lever in achieving these goals.

The rates structure increases progressively according to the emissions profile of a vehicle; EVs are therefore liable to motor tax at the lowest rate.

Work is at an early stage but we will continue to be active in relation to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600057#WRF05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":339,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600057#WRF05200"},{"type":"question","counter":340,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[62408\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600057#WRF05300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department plans to apply reduced VAT rates on the supply and installation of highly efficient low-emissions heating systems as per Annexe 3 in view of the agreement reached on 7 December 2021 by the Council of the European Union (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1594","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":341,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[62252\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600057#WRF05400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department intends to apply reduced VAT rates on the supply, rental and repair of bicycles including e-bikes in view of the agreement reached on 7 December 2021 by the Council of the European Union (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1617","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":342,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[62253\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600057#WRF05500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if, in view of the agreement reached on 7 December 2021 by the Council of the European Union (details supplied), his Department intends to apply reduced VAT rates to solar panels in line with section 4a; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1617","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":343,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139, 149 and 155 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputies will be aware, the Commission issued its original proposal to amend a Council directive on the common system of value added tax as regards rates of value added tax on 18 January 2018.<\/p><p>The compromise text agreed at ECOFIN has been amended significantly in comparison to the original proposal so the EU Parliament will once again be consulted for their opinion.\u00a0<\/p><p>Once the Parliament has issued its opinion on the proposal, the Council will formally adopt the directive.

This year we have seen a number of announcements from the main retail banks in relation to their operations in the state and their branch networks around the country. While decisions relating to the business model of regulated firms are a commercial matter for the boards of those firms, the Central Bank and I expect them to take a consumer-focused approach in respect of any decision that affects their customers. <\/p>  <p>  Under Provision 3.12 of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code), any bank that intends to close, merge or move a branch must: <\/p>  <p>  1. notify the Central Bank immediately;<\/p>  <p>  2. provide at least two months&rsquo; notice to affected consumers to enable them to make alternative arrangements; <\/p>  <p>  3. ensure all business of the branch is properly completed prior to its closure, merger or move, or alternatively inform the consumer of how continuity of service will be provided; and <\/p>  <p>  4. notify the wider community of the closure, merger or move in the local press in advance<\/p>  <p>  Once notified, the Central Bank engages with the regulated entity to ensure the impact of the decision has been carefully considered across its full customer base and at the appropriate levels. The Central Bank expects entities to provide affected vulnerable customers with the assistance necessary to ensure that those customers can retain full access to basic financial services, albeit in many cases at another branch location.<\/p>  <p>  The changes currently taking place in the Irish retail banking sector are a reflection of the wider challenges the banking sector\u00a0is facing, not only in Ireland but also abroad. It is because of these changes that I have instructed my Department to undertake a broad-ranging review of the retail banking sector.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Retail Banking Review has commenced its work and is currently in its research phase and is developing its project plan. It will be undertaking a survey of consumers in the coming months to ascertain their experience and perceptions of the retail banking sector in Ireland. The survey sample will include consumers in rural areas. <\/p>  <p>  There will also be a public consultation process in 2022 where members of the public can make a submission to the Department of Finance on issues that fall within the Terms of Reference.

The team will also look at the size and structure of the sector\u00a0in Ireland\u00a0and in similar size open economies in the EU and the OECD to see what lessons can be learned from initiatives and practices in those jurisdictions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600057#WRF06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":353,"content":"<p>Question No. 144 answered with Question No. 127.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":354,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600057#WRF06700"},{"type":"question","counter":355,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[62329\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600057#WRF06800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans for a review of the special assignee relief programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":356,"content":"<p>The Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP) is designed to help reduce the cost to employers of assigning skilled individuals in their companies from abroad, to take up positions in the Irish-based operations of their employer or an associated company, thereby facilitating the creation of jobs and the development and expansion of businesses in Ireland. The scheme currently has a sunset date of 31 December 2022.<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise policy is based on export-led growth. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has been and continues to be an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s economic development.\u00a0SARP is part of our FDI policy which allows our country to be competitive and attract certain senior decision-makers here to particular companies. This is fundamental to the creation and retention of other jobs. <\/p><p>The existence of an incentive like SARP is an acknowledgement that we are competing on a global basis for highly skilled and mobile executives. The competition for this talent is intense, particularly for the types of skills required to facilitate the development and expansion of businesses in Ireland. If we cease this scheme, it makes what we offer uncompetitive versus the offerings from competitor jurisdictions, for example France, Portugal, the Netherlands and Italy &ndash; to name but a few.<\/p><p>The existence of similar (and indeed more attractive) special assignee type tax reliefs in competitor jurisdictions creates a market failure that would not be addressed, but for the continued existence of SARP.<\/p><p>On Budget Day, the annual Revenue report on SARP for 2019 was published. It found a significant reversal in the overall cost of the scheme in 2019 (&euro;38.2m) as compared with 2018 when the cost was &euro;42.4m. This is attributable at least in part,\u00a0to my decision to introduce a salary cap of &euro;1m on\u00a0the amount of a person's income that can benefit from the scheme in Finance Act 2018. The change applied from 1 January 2019 for new entrants and from 1 January 2020 for existing recipients.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the aggregate number of jobs that were reported as created and retained as a result of the scheme has increased since 2018. There were 379 additional employees compared with 236 in 2018 and the number of employees retained was 483, compared with 348 in 2018.\u00a0This combined total of 862 SARP-related jobs in 2019\u00a0represents a cost of\u00a0&euro;44,000 per job created or retained, a decrease in cost per job compared with 2018, when there were 584 SARP supported jobs at an average cost of &euro;73,000 each. This represents a decrease in cost of over 39%. <\/p><p>The benefits of SARP, aside from enhancing our international competitiveness, are detailed clearly in the Indecon report and they include:<\/p><p>- Increased employment and retention of staff within SARP companies;<\/p><p>- Associated additional investment in the economy of the order of &euro;25 million;<\/p><p>- Additional Corporation Tax receipts;<\/p><p>- Additional PAYE receipts; and<\/p><p>- R&amp;amp;D spill-over activity. <\/p><p>In 2019, I commissioned an independent review of the scheme.\u00a0The report of the review confirmed to me the strong policy rationale for the continued relevance of SARP to the Irish economy. The report is available on the Department of Finance website.<\/p><p>The review highlights the following data regarding companies that availed of SARP for the year 2017:<\/p><p>- they paid over &euro;2.5 billion in corporation tax;<\/p><p>- they employed over 155,00 individuals; and,<\/p><p>- they paid over &euro;1.9 billion in PAYE taxes.<\/p><p>I recognise that there is, of course, a balance to be struck between the principle of horizontal equity within the tax system and the need to compete internationally for highly skilled and mobile personnel. In this regard, and in order to seek to ensure that the appropriate balance is maintained, the issue is kept under regular review through detailed examinations of the type carried out by Indecon in 2019. As the scheme sunsets next year, there will be a further opportunity for review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600057#WRF06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Coverage","counter":358,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600058#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":359,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[61888\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600058#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will bring forward recommendations to address the high costs of insurance cover in the childcare sector.","asker":"1451","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":360,"content":"<p>I am aware that the affordability of insurance is an issue of concern for some businesses. However, neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, nor do we have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific businesses or individuals. This position is reinforced by the EU Solvency II Directive framework.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Government keenly understands that access to affordable insurance is vital for businesses, and is therefore working to improve both the cost and availability of this key financial service through the\u00a0Action Plan for Insurance Reform. This reform agenda is progressing well, with the first Implementation Report published last July showing that 34 of the 66 actions were complete.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key achievements to date has been the implementation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines some six months ahead of schedule, which should provide much greater certainty regarding award levels, in addition to reducing awards for many common injuries. These should also lead to lower legal fees by encouraging greater use of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to settle claims.\u00a0The overall impact should therefore be to lower claims costs for insurers. In turn, it is the Government&rsquo;s expectation that insurers will reflect any savings by reducing customers&rsquo; premiums.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, Minister of State Fleming recently met with the CEOs of the main insurers here to assess their response to the Guidelines, and to emphasise the importance of insurers not undermining the Guidelines by settling for amounts that are inconsistent with them. I understand that this engagement was positive, and that insurers confirmed that they are committed to passing on savings from the Guidelines, and are adhering to them in their direct settlements.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to lowering premiums, it is hoped that consistent use of the Guidelines will result in a more stable claims environment that will encourage existing insurers to expand their risk appetite, and help to attract new entrants into the Irish market.\u00a0Work being undertaken by the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market to attract new providers here, in conjunction with IDA Ireland, will seek to leverage this. In his recent meetings, Minister of State Fleming also impressed upon insurers the need to expand their risk appetite into &lsquo;pinch-point&rsquo; sectors that are experiencing issues with availability and affordability of cover.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, work to complete outstanding reforms under the Action Plan remains ongoing. Upcoming priorities of particular note with regard to the childcare sector and high footfall industries include changes to the duty of care, which the Minister for Justice is leading on. It is my intention to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the overall implementation of the Action Plan can have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance across all sectors of the economy, including childcare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600058#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions","counter":361,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600058#WRG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":362,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[62242\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600058#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the need for future collaboration and co-operation in the credit union sector.","asker":"1611","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":363,"content":"<p>Enhancing collaboration is rightly seen as central to the future of the credit union movement.

My Department does not have any additional or more detailed information on this specific data.<\/p>  <p>  However, more generally the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI)\u00a0has indicated that\u00a0financial institutions always seek to ensure the right outcome for the customer by taking all aspects of the specific mortgage application into consideration and, in reviewing any case where an exemption to the requirement to arrange mortgage protection insurance is sought, lenders will engage closely with each customer on a case-by-case basis to understand the credit and other\u00a0risks which may arise in each individual case. Of most concern in such cases is understanding if any surviving party to the mortgage would have the ability to repay the facility in the event of the death of the uninsured party. There are situations where it is deemed in the customer&rsquo;s best interest to waive the requirement and others where it is deemed not to be in the customer&rsquo;s best interest to waive the requirement for mortgage protection. This is likely to be particularly relevant where the mortgage is on the family home or the\u00a0primary residence of the customer. Also it should be noted that, as customers typically arrange mortgage protection insurance through a third-party insurance company, lenders\u00a0are often unaware of the specific reasons why the third-party insurance company has declined mortgage protection cover and therefore this is not a factor included in consideration when deciding on a waiver request. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless,\u00a0it should also be noted that\u00a0if any\u00a0person is not satisfied with the way a regulated mortgage provider\u00a0or insurance provider has dealt with them in relation to an application for a mortgage or mortgage protection insurance, the consumer\u00a0can complain directly to the regulated entity.

Section 96(2A) of Finance Act 1999 provides that &ldquo;substitute fuels&rdquo; are also subject to MOT; substitute fuels are liquid products, other than mineral oils, that are used as motor or heating fuels. Under the Act, a substitute fuel is taxed at the MOT rate of the mineral oil in whose place it is used. For example, a substitute fuel used in place of diesel in a motor vehicle would be taxed at the MOT rate for auto-diesel, currently &euro;535.46 per 1,000 litres, which comprises carbon and non-carbon components of &euro;109.74 and &euro;425.72 per 1,000 litres respectively.<\/p>  <p>  MOT law provides for a relief from the carbon component of MOT for biofuels that are made of biomass of animal or vegetal origin. This means that a substitute fuel that is entirely made from biomass would be liable for the non-carbon component of MOT only. In the case of such a biofuel used in place of diesel, the MOT carbon component of &euro;109.74 per 1,000 litres would be fully relieved and the applicable MOT rate would be &euro;425.72 per 1,000 litres. For blended fuels containing biomass, the relief applies to the portion of fuel that meets the biofuel criteria set out in MOT legislation. The biofuel relief is intended to promote a higher level of biofuel in conventional transport fuel sales and supports Government&rsquo;s commitment to incentivising the use of greener alternatives to fossil fuels. <\/p>  <p>  Because the carbon component of MOT is already fully relieved for biofuels, these types of fuels are not impacted by the ten-year trajectory of carbon tax increases which I introduced in Finance Act 2020. This means that, as annual increases in the carbon component of MOT are implemented, the differential in tax costs between biofuels and fossil fuels will continue to widen, further incentivising the uptake of biofuels.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may also wish to note that I introduced a Report Stage amendment to the Finance Bill 2021 so as to provide for a temporary reduction in the non-carbon component of MOT with effect from 1 April next year until Budget Day 2022. I have taken this step to partially offset the expected increase in fuel costs arising from an increase in the Biofuel Obligation for transport fuels proposed by my colleague the Minister for Transport. The reduction in MOT of 1 cent per litre (inclusive of VAT) will be matched by a reduction in the National Oil Reserves Agency levy, which together will offset the estimated impact of the biofuels increase on the retail price of auto fuels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600058#WRG05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","counter":412,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600059#WRH00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Prices","counter":411,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600059#WRH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":412,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[62435\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600059#WRH00300","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if a statutory authority monitors the price of diesel and petrol products throughout the country in view of the wide price differential between different areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":413,"content":"<p>My Department does not have any function in monitoring the price of diesel and petrol products.<\/p>  <p>  The price of petrol and diesel is determined by a number of factors including taxation, the price of the raw materials, the prevailing exchange rates as well as the fact the different wholesalers can enter into forward contracts at different rates for the purchase of oil.

In compliance with State aid rules, funding on an exceptional basis was provided to Shannon Heritage at the end of December last to cover the incremental costs incurred to keep heritage sites open during the winter of 2020.

Shannon Group has advised that it is not financially viable to keep the heritage sites open in line with its pre-COVID-19 operating model given the lack of international visitors and the losses incurred as a result of that.  However, while Shannon Group had planned to close Bunratty and King John's Castles following the Christmas period until Easter, the decision by the Government to continue the EWSS into next year has allowed the Group to decide to keep the heritage sites open in the new year.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Shannon Group is currently engaging with the relevant Local Authorities with a view to the transfer to them of the Shannon Heritage sites.

This due diligence must be concluded before the relevant Ministerial consents can be given to execute any transfer of the sites, with the agreement of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I understand that while Shannon Group had planned for this work to be complete by the end of the year, the complexities involved in the transfer of the business and the due diligence required mean that it will be next year before the transfer of the sites can be completed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600060#WRJ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":499,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600060#WRJ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":500,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[62465\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600060#WRJ01800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he is satisfied at levels of compliance with the requirement to wear face masks on public transport; if his Department and the CI&Eacute; group of companies are monitoring compliance with and enforcement of the regulations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":501,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, I am responsible for the policy and overall funding of public transport.

Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the HTB scheme.\u00a0 HTB is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for new build homes in order to encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In my Budget 2022 address, I announced an extension of HTB for a further year until the end of 2022 and also that a formal review of the scheme would take place in 2022.

Last year, a general government deficit of &euro;18&frac12; billion was recorded &ndash; the equivalent of nearly 9 per cent of modified gross national income (GNI*). This year, Budget 2022 projected a general government deficit of &euro;13.3 billion, nearly 6 per cent of GNI*. <\/p>  <p>  Against this background, the Government has still made very extensive commitments in the area of housing. This reflects the priority which the Government places on boosting housing supply. <\/p>  <p>  To this end, the Housing for All plan commits to increase housing supply and affordability by targeting the delivery of, on average, 33,000 new homes every year to 2030. This includes the provision of over 10,000 social homes per year and an average of 6,000 affordable homes to purchase or rent. The plan is supported by significant annual investment of over &euro;4 billion in guaranteed State funding over the next five years. <\/p>  <p>  While public investment has an obvious role in alleviating housing market pressures, there are also significant non-fiscal constraints. In particular, the public health measures needed to suppress the spread of the virus have placed a direct restriction on the construction of new housing. The industry is now facing increased costs and difficulty sourcing building materials as a result of the pandemic, high international demand, and Brexit. There are also skills shortages within the construction sector, which is why the Government is providing significant investment in skills and trades. As acknowledged in the report, simply increasing expenditure will not negate these capacity constraints. It is, therefore, a gross simplification to suggest that providing additional housing is purely a matter of increasing Exchequer funding.<\/p>  <p>  From a broader fiscal perspective, as the recovery gains strength, it is important to remember that it is neither sustainable nor prudent to run perpetual deficits. Even before the onset of Covid-19, Ireland&rsquo;s level of public debt per capita was one of the highest in the developed world. \u00a0The impact of the pandemic is expected to add nearly &euro;6,000 per person to this ratio by the end of the year, bringing the level of public indebtedness to &euro;47,250 for every citizen in this country. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Looking beyond the pandemic, a number of fiscal challenges lie ahead, including financing the digital and climate transitions, as well as making provision for the future costs of an ageing population. It is also important that fiscal buffers are rebuilt and public indebtedness is steadily reduced once the pandemic has passed, so we can address future shocks by providing support at the right time &ndash; as we have done over the past twenty months. <\/p>  <p>  While I keep close track of all important research published by the ESRI, I have not met with the Institute specifically to discuss this paper. However, it is important to note that since the publication of the paper, the ESRI have welcomed the fiscal stance taken in Budget 2022 and clarified that the analysis contained within the paper refers to a so-called &ldquo;steady-state&rdquo; scenario, a theoretical situation where macroeconomic and fiscal balance has been achieved and the government is not already running a very large deficit.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, while I greatly respect the analysis produced by the ESRI, the Institute does not have a monopoly on providing economic advice.\u00a0 I get economic and fiscal advice from a broad range of specialists, including my own officials and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.\u00a0 In this vein, it is worth noting that the IFAC has welcomed the fiscal stance taken in the recent budget.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600062#WRL03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":635,"content":"<p>Question No. 249 answered with Question No. 113.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":636,"content":"<p>Question No. 250 answered with Question No. 113.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Rebates","counter":637,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600062#WRL03500"},{"type":"question","counter":638,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[60850\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600062#WRL03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to introduce an enhanced or improved carbon tax rebate for cucumber and other greenhouse growers that use CO2 in the growing process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":639,"content":"<p>Mineral Oil Tax (MOT) applies to minerals oils used for motor or heating purposes in the State.

This momentum reflects our coordinated policy support, successful vaccine rollout and the boost to reforms and investment now that recovery funding has started to flow. Indeed, growth figures for the third quarter show that the euro area is nearly back to pre-pandemic levels of output.<\/p>  <p>  However, the uptick in new cases and emergence of the omicron variant present a downside risk to the economic outlook. In addition, the sharp rebound in global demand and persistent production and transport disruptions has brought elevated rates of inflation. <\/p>  <p>  The latest Eurostat estimates point to euro area annual inflation of 4.9 per cent in November. This was largely driven by energy inflation, which increased to an estimated 27.4 per cent. Pandemic-related effects, such as the impact of temporary VAT reductions, and technical factors, such as measurement issues, added further volatility. HICP inflation reached 5.4 per cent in Ireland in the same period. <\/p>  <p>  The latest figures point to inflation, including energy prices, remaining high over the course of the year, before gradually easing next year. The ECB projects inflation to average 2.2 per cent this year but to decline to rates of 1.7 and 1.5 per cent in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Both the Commission and the ECB are confident that elevated inflation is linked to temporary factors, supply-side constraints and the recovery in demand as our economies reopen.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the ECB has an independent mandate to maintain price stability, and uses the range of monetary policy instruments to target an inflation rate of 2 per cent over the medium-term. The ECB has stated that the outlook for inflation over the medium-term remains subdued. Core inflation &ndash; which strips out energy and non-processed food inflation &ndash; was 2.6 per cent in November.<\/p>  <p>  That said, energy prices can entail wide-ranging consequences for inflation and raise costs for businesses and families. In recognition of these potential social impacts, many Member States have introduced targeted measures to protect vulnerable households from energy poverty. In framing Budget 2022, I was conscious of these cost of living pressures and announced a range of measures including targeted social welfare initiatives.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, at an EU level, the Commission has issued a Communication on Tackling Rising Energy Prices, and the matter was discussed at various Council configurations. The Communication emphasises the broad nature of the impact and policy response.<\/p>  <p>  In short, my fellow Finance Ministers and I all agree that this is an important issue and that we need to continue closely monitoring inflation and energy price developments and the potential implications for our economies. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600063#WRM01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":684,"content":"<p>Question No. 266 answered with Question No. 263.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Policy","counter":685,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600063#WRM01800"},{"type":"question","counter":686,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[62737\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600063#WRM01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which international increases in taxation with particular reference to the 12.5% corporations profits tax is likely to affect the economy in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":687,"qnumday":268,"qnumall":"[62738\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600063#WRM02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if foreign direct investment has been affected one way or another by the change in corporation profits taxes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":688,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 267 and 268 together.<\/p>  <p>  I take it that your questions relate to Ireland joining the 8 October OECD\/G20 Inclusive Framework agreement to address tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy.<\/p>  <p>  There are two pillars to the OECD agreement. Pillar One will see a reallocation of a proportion of profits to the jurisdiction of the consumer. This means that, in effect, corporate tax revenue streams which now flow to the Irish Exchequer will flow to the Exchequers of other countries when implemented.<\/p>  <p>  Pillar Two will see the adoption of a new global minimum effective tax rate of 15 per cent\u00a0applying to multinational companies (MNEs) with global revenues in excess of &euro;750m. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax rate of 12.5 per cent will remain for the vast majority of Irish businesses. The threshold that will apply to the 15 per cent minimum effective tax rate is &euro;750 million annual global turnover. Thus, the vast majority of companies in Ireland - over 95 per cent - will not be subject to these new rules, and will continue to be subject to corporation tax at a headline rate of 12.5 per cent. <\/p>  <p>  At a superficial level, the application of a minimum tax rate of 15 per cent under Pillar Two could provide some uplift to domestic corporation tax revenues. However, this would be a static assumption which does not take account of how firms react to a new tax regime, or to potential changes in tax regimes in other jurisdictions i.e. changes to the tax base. Further, any uplift on Pillar Two would be countered by the potential cost of Pillar One. That cost remains highly uncertain as its technical implementation is still far from resolved.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Revenue Commissioners previously estimated that the cost of the OECD agreement on a new tax framework to address the tax challenges of digitalisation could be up to &euro;2 billion annually when both pillars come into effect. However, as I have stated previously, this is an extremely challenging exercise, both in terms of timing and magnitude. Although there are two pillars to this Agreement, it is important to understand that they are intended as integral parts of a single agreed solution. How they interact and the degree to which this interaction influences business behaviour is very difficult to predict.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be stressed that what we have at the moment is a broad high level agreement on the main features of a solution.

This momentum reflects the success of our coordinated policy support, the vaccine rollout, the introduction of structural reforms and the recovery funding that is now flowing across Europe. <\/p>  <p>  The European Commission&rsquo;s Autumn Forecast remains positive about EU growth momentum, though growing headwinds to the economic outlook are signalled. The Commission projects growth of 5.0 per cent this year and 4.3 per cent next year in both the EU and euro area. While the pace of recovery is varying, it is positive to note from the Forecasts that the Commission expects the EU to return to its path of economic convergence.<\/p>  <p>  That said, the recent uptick in cases and the emergence of the Omicron variant present significant downside risks to the outlook. It is imperative that we continue work to understand this variant and respond as quickly as we can to mitigate its impact.

This means that any new wave of cases will have a smaller impact on economic activity than during previous waves. <\/p>  <p>  Beyond the evolution of the virus, the economic landscape is also facing other challenges, such as inflation, rising energy prices and supply constraints.

Eurostat publishes Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) data with regard to insurance, but this only provides a comparison of the level of inflation for different types of insurance such as motor and travel insurance. It is not possible to compare the underlying cost of each insurance type.\u00a0 In addition, this does not include a comparative index for the price of insurance to businesses.<\/p>  <p>  In any event, any international comparisons based on price alone would not take into account relevant factors such as the various regulatory environments and liability systems in place in different jurisdictions.\u00a0 However, increased availability of data in relation to insurance and understanding the factors that influence or drive the cost of it are important. In Ireland, we have the National Claims Information Database (NCID), which is unique in Europe in terms of the transparency it provides into the insurance sector, including claims costs and average earned premium data. The Central Bank of Ireland has published three NCID reports on private motor insurance and one NCID report on employer liability, public liability and commercial property insurance to date. The Central Bank of Ireland will continue to publish regular reports that will provide us with a wealth of data in terms of how insurance costs are affecting different groups. The Government has also proposed for further enhancements to be made to the NCID in the new Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, to further increase transparency in the sector. The Heads of that Bill are currently going through the pre-legislative scrutiny process.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the competitiveness of the Irish insurance sector more generally, I believe that the implementation of the outstanding Action Plan for Insurance Reform elements will have a positive impact. In July, the Cabinet Committee Insurance Reform Sub-Group published the first six-monthly Implementation Report of the Action Plan. This showed that work is progressing well to implement these important reforms, with 34 of the 66 actions completed. \u00a0Work remains ongoing across Government to deliver further elements of the Action Plan, including measures to reform the PIAB, reduce fraud, and make changes to the duty of care.\u00a0 The implementation of these key actions in particular are anticipated to have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses, community and voluntary groups across Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600063#WRM03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Rates","counter":700,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600063#WRM03300"},{"type":"question","counter":701,"qnumday":273,"qnumall":"[62790\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600063#WRM03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which interest rates charged to home borrowers here are in accord with those applicable throughout Europe having particular regard to the need to ensure that the benefits of the Single Market remain available to all in the European Union; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":702,"content":"<p>I am aware that the general level of new lending interest rates in Ireland are higher than is the case in many other European countries, though it should also be noted that recent trends indicate that certain mortgage rates have been falling in Ireland.\u00a0 For example, the interest rates on new mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.05% in December 2014 to 2.73% in October 2021.\u00a0 There has also been a reduction in the interest rates charged on loans to SMEs and consumers over the same period.<\/p>  <p>  However, Irish mortgage and other loans\u00a0can have different characteristics from those offered in other countries.\u00a0For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers, which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Also Irish mortgages are\u00a0generally not subject to upfront fees which are typically charged by banks in some other EU jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  There are also\u00a0a number of important factors which will likely influence\u00a0the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages. These include operational costs, certain structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect: <\/p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;<\/p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks (as provisioning and capital requirements are higher for these loans to reflect their higher risk and this in turn results in higher credit and capital costs for the Irish banks);<\/p>  <p>  - higher cost-to-income\u00a0ratios which has\u00a0been a characteristic of the Irish banking sector in recent years;<\/p>  <p>  - lower levels of competition in the Irish banking market compared to other jurisdictions (however, it is noted that non-bank lenders are now playing a greater role in the provision of new mortgage credit and\u00a0are\u00a0offering long term fixed rate mortgages at competitive interest rates). <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless,\u00a0the Central Bank has a range of measures to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage.\u00a0 The consumer protection framework requires lenders to be transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; through protections at the initial marketing\/advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties.\u00a0 In particular, the Central Bank introduced a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in\u00a02017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in\u00a02019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. Consumers can reduce average pricing in the mortgage market by availing of switching options to ensure that recent and potential future price reductions through increased competition pass through to the greatest number of customers possible.\u00a0 Indeed a Central Bank\u00a0study estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remain term. <\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.\u00a0 As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks including the interest rates they charge for loans including mortgages.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I appreciate that greater sustainable competition\u00a0in the credit market will be of benefit to consumers and other borrowers.\u00a0 Accordingly,\u00a0the review of the retail banking market which is now underway in my Department will consider\u00a0how the banking system can best support economic activity,\u00a0assess\u00a0competition and consumer choice in the market for banking services and look at options to further develop the mortgage market. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600063#WRM03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises","counter":703,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600063#WRM03600"},{"type":"question","counter":704,"qnumday":274,"qnumall":"[62791\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600063#WRM03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he expects credit to remain available to small and medium sized enterprises; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":705,"content":"<p>As Minister for Finance, one of my main concerns is to ensure that SMEs have access to sufficient liquidity, and that access to credit for SMEs is maintained.

This recovery of spending continued in the third quarter, albeit at a more moderate pace. Spending growth of &frac12; per cent on the quarter was surprisingly soft particularly given that additional contact-intensive services sectors re-opened, the ongoing strength of VAT receipts and the recovery in employment and wages. Nevertheless, consumer spending remains around 1 per cent below the pre-pandemic level despite standing at almost 15 per cent below that level in the first quarter this year. <\/p>  <p>  This rapid recovery in consumer spending was supported by the protection of household incomes throughout the pandemic through the provision of government supports in the form of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme. This support to household balance sheets and in-turn to consumer confidence has helped to minimise &ldquo;scarring effects&rdquo; of the crisis, a key overarching policy objective. In addition, the Government has continued to provide support to the sectors worst affected by the pandemic, including the reduced VAT rate for the hospitality sector until end-August 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Looking ahead, early indications point toward a continued moderation of consumer spending growth in the fourth quarter, with the recovery expected to continue into next year. This recovery in consumption will be underpinned by a normalisation of household savings following the record increase in savings built up since the start of the pandemic. However, we must be cognisant that if an excessive amount of savings flow into areas where demand is already strong and supply is already under pressure, it could add to current inflationary pressures.

Minister Martin attended the Ryder Cup in 2021 in the U.S. and while there met with the venue owner and the organisers on the 24th of September 2021. This was part of a visit to the US promoting Ireland as a tourism destination organised by Tourism Ireland.  My officials last met with the venue owners on 19th December 2019 and are in frequent dialogue with the event organisers, calls or e-mails are exchanged on at least a monthly basis.  The last in-person meeting with the event organisers took place prior to the pandemic in London on 17th January 2020.  The costs for these meetings are being compiled and I will forward the details to the Deputy in accordance with the timelines set out in standing orders.  The Department is also working with and regularly meets stakeholders including Sport Ireland, Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Limerick City and County Council and other public sector bodies in planning for the event. <\/p>  <p>  In July 2019, after an extended period of consideration and negotiation, including an assessment of the costs and benefits, the Government approved a package of financial support for the hosting of the event to which the Deputy refers.  The main payment to the event organisers, to host the event is an event licence fee.  The first year of payment was in 2020 and, on foot of a payment agreement drafted by the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office, &euro;3.2 million of the licence fee was paid to the event organisers. A similar agreement was put in place for 2021. Allowing for the fact that the event was rescheduled to 2027 from 2026, the payment for 2021 encompassed a licence fee instalment of &euro;2.755m. Payment levels similar to 2021 are envisaged for each year between 2022 and 2027 for the licence fee. The licence fee in total is scheduled to cost &euro;22.5 million, not including VAT which is paid to the Irish Exchequer.<\/p>  <p>  To strengthen the professional game in Ireland in the run up to the event, additional financial support of &euro;8.5million is also being provided for professional golf events i.e. the Irish Open, the Challenge and Legends Tour Events scheduled to take place in Ireland up and including 2027.  Marketing of the event will also form a key part of the preparations for the hosting and a budget of &euro;8m will be provided for marketing through and with the European Tour.  <\/p>  <p>  Separate to this an operational budget will be required to support the staging of the event to cover matters such as policing, local authority support, transport provision as well as an opening ceremony and fanzone.  These supports will ensure that Ireland can maximise the opportunity which this tournament affords Ireland, the Mid-West and Limerick city and county.<\/p>  <p>  It is best practice to draw lessons learned from all major events and this event will be no different. In that regard, a review of the event including the delivery, costs, operation and impacts will be conducted after the event.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600064#WRN03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":770,"content":"<p>Question No. 296 answered with Question No. 295.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sport and Recreational Development","counter":771,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600064#WRN03900"},{"type":"question","counter":772,"qnumday":297,"qnumall":"[62829\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600064#WRN04000","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the steps she is taking to increase the level of girls and women participating in sport and structural inequities regarding the treatment of female sports players; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":773,"content":"<p>Equality in sport is a key priority for Government.  Our overall vision is for women to have an equal opportunity to achieve their full potential while enjoying a lifelong involvement in sport.  Both the Programme for Government and the National Sports Policy are unequivocal in their commitment to making this a reality.<\/p>  <p>  The aim in the National Sports Policy 2018-2027 is to eliminate the gender participation gap entirely by 2027.  The Programme for Government commits to prioritise increasing female participation in sport as participants, coaches, referees, and administrators as well as to increase funding year on year for the Sport Ireland's Women in Sports Programme. <\/p>  <p>  The 2019 Irish Sports Monitor Report, which is the most recent full year report, showed that the gender gap in sports participation was 3.4%, narrower than at any point over the past ten years.  However, recent quarterly figures show that a gender gap is beginning to re-emerge as COVID 19 restrictions are lifted.  Addressing this will be a priority in the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  Last month I launched the Sports Action Plan 2021-2023.  The Plan outlines over 40 specific initiatives intended to ensure the sports sector's continued recovery from the impact of COVID-19, its development over the next three years and the actions required to achieve the target of 60pc of the population participating in sport and physical activity.  The plan focuses on inclusion, diversity and equality and includes targets for active participation, social participation, governance and high performance sport.  A copy of the plan can be found at the following link: www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/93232-sports-action-plan-2021-2023\/<\/p>  <p>  Sport Ireland, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, increasing participation at all levels and raising standards.  This includes the allocation of funding to sporting organisations for the implementation of a range of programmes and measures to increase the level of girls and women participating in sport and to address inequalities in sports participation.<\/p>  <p>  Many National Governing Bodies will begin to deliver Women in Sport and Dormant Accounts Funded Programmes this winter which will actively target populations that have been disproportionately impacted by the Pandemic including females, economically and socially disadvantaged communities, people with a disability and ethnic minorities.<\/p>  <p>  The Women in Sport Funding Programme was established in 2005 and to date over &euro;20 million has been invested through the National Governing Bodies of Sport and Local Sports Partnerships.<\/p>  <p>  Sport Ireland launched a revised Women in Sport investment programme in 2019 following publication of its new Women in Sport Policy.  Recognising that effective and sustainable programmes require a long-term approach, Women in Sport funding is now issues on a two year cycle to the National Governing Bodies.  &euro;4m is being allocated for the two years 2021\/2022 representing a 33% increase on the 2019-2020 funding of &euro;3m.  The investment aims to support NGBs and enhance all aspects of female involvement across the Women in Sport policy target areas namely, Coaching &amp;amp; Officiating, Active Participation, Leadership &amp;amp; Governance and Visibility.<\/p>  <p>  A priority this year was to eliminate the funding gap that existed in grand funding for male and female Gaelic players and I am very pleased to have achieved that aim and ensured that we have now parity in terms of that grant funding.  Additional funding of &euro;1.7m has been provided this year and for future years for enhanced support of female inter-county Gaelic games players on an equivalent basis to that being provided for their male counterparts.  This additional provision brings the total amount available for female players in this context to &euro;2.4m.  This is a very important development for women's sport and demonstrates the Government's commitment to equality in sport.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Minister Catherine Martin and I received a letter on Friday from 59 female international rugby players, both currently active and retired, regarding issues they have with the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU).  We have responded to the group to advise that a meeting will be sought with the IRFU and that Sport Ireland will meet with the players to discuss the issues raised.  Both Minister Martin and I indicated that we were also happy to meeting with the players should that be needed, and we plan to do so before Christmas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600064#WRN04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Policy","counter":774,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600064#WRN04200"},{"type":"question","counter":775,"qnumday":298,"qnumall":"[62879\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600064#WRN04300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the progress that has been made on the commitment in the programme for Government to establish a wild Atlantic walkway; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":776,"content":"<p>The matter raised is an operational matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland.

The property in question must also meet certain eligibility criteria. <\/p>  <p>  A Review of the MTR scheme for borrowers of commercial private lending institutions published in February 2017 explored the avenues and impediments to participation in the scheme and identified a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers.

The 2017 Review committed to exploring the potential of private institutional investment in MTR in order to allow the MTR scheme to deliver at scale. <\/p>  <p>  An Expressions of Interest (EOI) Request issued in 2017 inviting parties from the private sectors to express their interest in participating in a new alternatively funded long-term MTR lease model.

It was critical that the entity (or entities selected) were capable of purchasing the required number of MTR cases, demonstrated the appropriate understanding of the MTR process and the position of borrowers in long-term mortgage arrears, as well as the capacity to undertake the management and structural maintenance of properties over the lifetime of the lease agreement.

No funding application was received, under that call, from Cork City Council in respect of Blackpool.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600065#WRO02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Derelict Sites","counter":820,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600065#WRO02300"},{"type":"question","counter":821,"qnumday":313,"qnumall":"[62505\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600065#WRO02400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if there is an obligation on a property owner to pay outstanding derelict site levies upon the sale of a property.","asker":"1453","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":822,"content":"<p>Where monies are owed under the derelict site levy, including any interest chargeable for late payment, they become a charge on the land concerned under section 24 of the Derelict Sites Act 1990 (the Act) until they are paid.

It is primarily intended to influence behaviour towards increased housing output, rather than to raise revenue. <\/p>  <p>  The scope of the tax is based on lands zoned for housing development on statutory development plan or local area plan zoning maps (either solely or primarily for residential use, or for a mixture of uses that includes residential use), where such lands are &lsquo;serviced&rsquo;, in that they are able to connect to the necessary infrastructure to enable housing development and for which there is capacity available, with land subject to known issues relating to contamination or the presence of known archaeological or historic remains to be excluded. Social, recreational and community uses as well as infrastructure and utilities will be excluded from the scope of the tax.<\/p>  <p>  The lands falling into scope, being, in the first instance, all land zoned as of 1 January 2022 and meeting criteria set out in the legislation, including with regard to servicing and taking into account any exclusions, must be identified by each local authority on &lsquo;residential zoned land&rsquo; maps to be published in advance of the introduction of the measure on 1 February 2024.<\/p>  <p>  Each local authority will be required to prepare and publish a map to indicate the land within the scope of the tax, with the final map to be published by 1 December 2023.  In advance of this, it will be necessary to publish an initial draft map by 1 November 2022 to identify the land in question. Preparation of the map will involve consultation with infrastructure providers to provide a robust evidence base with regard to servicing, including capacity. <\/p>  <p>  The timescales for the various stages of the process including provisions for appeal of inclusion of lands on the draft map are set out in the Finance Bill and will be clarified within Guidelines to be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 in order to ensure the maps will be published and updated by each local authority by 1 December 2023, in advance of the measure coming into effect on 1 February 2024. <\/p>  <p>  Once established, maps will be updated every year, to reflect any changes in zoning, development servicing status or other criteria which would bring land into or out of scope.

The making of valuations for rating purposes is the sole responsibility of the Commissioner and I, as Minister, have no function in decisions in this regard.<\/p><p>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2020. <\/p><p>Under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between valuation of rateable property and the levying and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. <\/p><p>Valuation lists comprising all rateable properties in the State are maintained using two statutory valuation processes known as &ldquo;revaluation&rdquo; and &ldquo;revision&rdquo;. <\/p><p>Firstly, revaluation is a process where all rateable properties in a Local Authority area are valued periodically by reference to a single valuation date. Following the first revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area will then be carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation (Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001).<\/p><p>Secondly, revision is a process to reflect structural changes to individual properties or the addition to the valuation lists of new properties between revaluations. It is a function of a local authority to apply to the Commissioner of Valuation for the appointment by the Commissioner of an officer of the Commissioner to carry out a revision of valuation under Part 6 of the Valuation Acts 2001 (as amended by the Act of 2015).<\/p><p>In line with best international practice, the valuation element of the rating system should have both a comprehensive revaluation and revision programme running in tandem. Further information about these processes is available at <i>www.valoff.ie\/en\/ <\/i><\/p><p>New rateable properties are added to the valuation lists on foot of revision applications made by the relevant Local Authority to the Commissioner of Valuation. Once a new rateable properties is capable of beneficial occupation it can be valued and entered on the valuation list whether it is occupied or vacant. Section 28(5) of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2020 provides that once a valuer had been assigned a revision application the property referenced in the application should be valued and entered on the valuation list within 6 months. <\/p><p>While the average length of time it takes to put a rateable valuation on a new rateable property that has never been occupied is not available it is important to note that valuing a new rateable property involves a number of statutory steps. The process usually begins with an inspection of the property which is followed with the issue of a proposed valuation certificate to the owner or occupier of the property. The owner or occupier may within 40 days of the issue of the proposed valuation certificate make representations to the Valuation Office. Any representations received must then be considered before the valuation is determined and a final valuation certificate is issued. The Valuations Acts provide for the valuation list to be amended seven days after the issue of the final valuation certificate.<\/p><p>Where a property is newly entered onto the valuation list by the Commissioner of Valuation during a financial year it is not subject to rates in that year, however, it is subject to an Entry Year Property Levy under section 7 of the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Act 2006. The Entry Year Property Levy effectively imposes rates on properties with effect from the date of their entry on valuation lists.  It is a charge that applies until such time as the property can be charged rates. A commercial property is liable for rates in the normal way in the financial year immediately following its entry onto the valuation list.  <\/p><p>Existing commercial rates legislation provides for a refund of rates paid on vacant commercial properties in certain circumstances. The Local Government Act 1946, provides that where a property is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate, the owner becomes liable for rates.  However, the owner is entitled to a refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes, these being if the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment. The collection of rates and the determination of eligibility for a refund in this context are matters for each individual local authority. The Local Government Reform Act 2014 gives discretion to the elected members of local authorities to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual local electoral areas within the authority&rsquo;s administrative area. A decision to vary the level of rate refund applying is a reserved function of elected members of a local authority.<\/p><p>The Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 modernises the legislation governing commercial rates and contains provision for schemes for the abatement of rates on vacant properties (not yet commenced). The Act provides that a local authority may provide a temporary abatement for vacant properties, subject to any maximum relief which may be specified by the Minister, to ensure that all property owners (other than those whose rates liability would be below a de minimis threshold) make some level of payment to the local authority.  The Act allows the Minister to prescribe, that the maximum level of relief can be further reduced by individual local authorities.  Currently only a portion of the Act has been commenced.  Commencement of the remaining elements of the Act, including in relation to rates on vacant property, has been delayed due to the COVID crisis.  The revised aim is to achieve the necessary amendments and make prescribed regulations in 2022 so that the legislation would be operational for the planning of local authority 2023 budgets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600066#WRP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":876,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600066#WRP01100"},{"type":"question","counter":877,"qnumday":333,"qnumall":"[62636\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600066#WRP01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of cost rental units he has signed off; when these will be tenanted; the locations they will be delivered in; the size of the units; the number of bedrooms and type that will be delivered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":878,"content":"<p>Housing for All commits to the provision of 18,000 Cost Rental homes to 2030, an average of 2,000 per year.

The cost-covering rents for these CREL-funded homes range from &euro;900 per month for the two-bed homes to &euro;1,250 per month for the three-bed homes, which are approximately 42% below market rent.

As AHBs sought to use CREL funding to allow developers to construct homes that may otherwise not have been delivered, the commencement of construction on these specific units was, in most instances, not possible until the lifting of relevant COVID restrictions.<\/p><p>A further &euro;75 million in Exchequer funding has been allocated for 2022. Combined with funds made available by the Housing Finance Agency, this will help to meet the Housing for All target of a further 750 Cost Rental homes. A second Call for Proposals was opened to AHBs under the CREL scheme on Friday 22 October 2021, seeking applications for properties prioritised for delivery in 2022. The closing date for this call expired on Tuesday 30 November. The process to assess these applications is currently ongoing.<\/p><p>Furthermore, it is my intention to issue an Open, Rolling Call under CREL from early 2022. This will facilitate ongoing applications from AHBs as projects present themselves, assist with applications for Cost Rental and social housing (through Capital Advance Leasing Facility CALF) on the same sites and will facilitate longer-term developments where AHBs can purchase land and undertake design and build contracts directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600066#WRP01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Process","counter":879,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600066#WRP01400"},{"type":"question","counter":880,"qnumday":334,"qnumall":"[62658\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600066#WRP01500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the stage at which the monuments and archaeological heritage Bill is in the legislative process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":881,"content":"<p>The Revised General Scheme of the Monuments and Archaeological Heritage Bill was approved by Cabinet on 30 November 2021.<\/p><p>I intend to refer the Revised General Scheme to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage over the coming days in order to commence pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600066#WRP01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1512"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Parks and Wildlife Service","counter":882,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600066#WRP01625"},{"type":"question","counter":883,"qnumday":335,"qnumall":"[62660\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600066#WRP01650","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when the National Parks and Wildlife Service expects to provide a decision for works (details supplied) in County Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":884,"content":"<p>The National Parks and Wildlife Service has already provided its views to the Local Authority in respect of this matter and has no further role with regard to the Local Authority's decision making on this project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600066#WRP01675","answer":true,"speaker":"1512"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defective Building Materials","counter":885,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600066#WRP01700"},{"type":"question","counter":886,"qnumday":336,"qnumall":"[62668\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600066#WRP01800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the reason the recent sliding-scale redress for homeowners accessing the defective concrete block scheme is not 100% redress given the motion that passed in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 15 June 2021 was in favour of 100% redress.","asker":"1520","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":887,"content":"<p>I brought a Memorandum on an enhanced Defective Concrete Blocks Grant Scheme to Government on the 30 November 2021 and it included an unprecedented suite of improvements to the current scheme.

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy and progressing legislation, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding support for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.<\/p><p>The most recent review of fire services in Ireland resulted in the publication of &ldquo;Keeping Communities Safe - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland&rdquo; (KCS) in 2013. This was the report on the outcome of a wide-ranging review of fire services in Ireland which was undertaken in 2011\/2012, and was endorsed as national policy in early 2013. It concluded that local authorities were best positioned to continue to provide fire services in Ireland. <\/p><p>The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a risk management approach of area risk categorisation which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires which occur, as well as the fire protection measures in place. The current fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three year average, equates to 4.3 deaths per million of population, this figure is a third of what it was twenty years ago when it stood at 12.9 deaths per million of population. While every death is a regrettable tragedy that level of fire fatalities positions Ireland among countries with lower fire fatality rates.<\/p><p>Fire authorities cooperate with each other as and when required and on a regular basis on a number of matters. For example, they are enabled by the Fire Services Act, 1981 and 2003 to assist each other and provide support on a &lsquo;mutual-assistance&rsquo; basis, and this is the expected norm for fire services. The Chief Fire Officer for the area where a large scale incident is located will typically engage neighbouring services when required, on the basis of agreed pre-planned arrangements.<\/p><p>At national level, a National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) was created within my Department in 2009 to give central direction and leadership for the fire and emergency management services. The 2009 arrangements put in place a management structure at central government level with a clear mandate and visibility to develop national policy and to drive consistent achievement of quality fire services by local authorities. Under the system, responsibility for the day-to-day operation of fire services remains with the local authorities. However, the National Directorate&rsquo;s mandate includes developing national policies and national standards, and supporting and overseeing their implementation at local level.<\/p><p>Over the course of 2014\/2015, the National Directorate&rsquo;s Management Board's External Validation Group (EVG) visited every fire service in the country as part of an external validation process arising from implementation of KCS. In April 2016, the Management Board published the first EVG Report titled &ldquo;Local Delivery - National Consistency&rdquo;. The report concluded that current fire service arrangements, as outlined, are working effectively to meet the challenges involved in trying to protect communities from fire and other emergencies.<\/p><p>A copy of this report is available on my Department's website at the following link:<\/p><p><i>www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/a23ce-external-validation-of-fire-services\/<\/i><\/p><p>In May 2019, the Management Board of NDFEM considered a proposal for a second round of external validation, or EVG II. Stakeholder engagement was undertaken in preparation for a thematic review process, which was scheduled to commence in Q1 2020. However, due to Covid-19, the Board made a decision to postpone this process.<\/p><p>As an alternative, the Management Board mandated staff in the NDFEM to undertake a review of the impact of Covid-19 on local authority fire service resilience and response, as well as on fire safety work and to look at fire services roles in supporting Covid-related emergency management. <\/p><p>This review was undertaken by means of &lsquo;virtual visits&rsquo; (i.e. by Webex link) to each of the 27 fire services and three Regional Communications Centres. This &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; process was undertaken by an NDFEM team, working in association with Chief Fire Officers and their staff and local authority executives. A composite report on themes related to the impact of Covid-19 on fire services was compiled and presented to the NDFEM Management Board in October 2020.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the current Covid-19 situation has understandably delayed the EVG II process. The position in relation to undertaking an EVG II will be kept under review by the NDFEM Management Board, taking account of the virtual experience of the response and resilience study and in light of the evolving Covid-19 situation. A new EVG II process would likely focus once again on the delivery standards of our fire services and an assessment of how the structure of the service impacts on delivery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600066#WRP03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defective Building Materials","counter":900,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600066#WRP03200"},{"type":"question","counter":901,"qnumday":341,"qnumall":"[62781\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600066#WRP03300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the progress to date in introducing a 100% redress scheme for homeowners affected by mica; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":902,"content":"<p>I brought a Memorandum on an enhanced Defective Concrete Blocks Grant Scheme to Government on the 30 November 2021 and it included an unprecedented suite of improvements to the current scheme.

Addressing vacancy and maximising the use of existing housing stock is a primary concern of this Government and the new Housing for All Strategy outlines a multi-faceted approach to addressing this matter, including:   <\/p>  <p>  - A new local authority-led programme to help Local Authorities buy or compulsory purchase 2,500 vacant homes in their areas which can then be sold on the open market will ensure homes don&rsquo;t lie vacant.<\/p>  <p>  - Reform of the Fair Deal Scheme to remove disincentives to selling or renting unused homes. <\/p>  <p>  - The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund will be delivered by local authorities for the provision of serviced sites for housing, to attract people to build their own homes and to support the refurbishment of vacant properties, enabling people to live in small towns and villages, in a sustainable way. <\/p>  <p>  - A new Town Centre First policy, which will include approaches to utilising existing stock and new financial incentive mechanisms.<\/p>  <p>  These measures are in addition to the vacant property tax and vacant site tax being pursued by the Department of Finance. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600066#WRP06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":932,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600067#WRQ00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":931,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600067#WRQ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":932,"qnumday":351,"qnumall":"[62491\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600067#WRQ00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the selection process to nominate an Irish ambassador to Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic missions abroad; the oversight proposals that exist on such appointments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":933,"qnumday":352,"qnumall":"[62492\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600067#WRQ00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if consideration is being given to using the Public Appointments Service to source candidates for senior roles in Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic missions abroad; the efforts being considered to increase transparency on assigning senior postings abroad; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":934,"qnumday":353,"qnumall":"[62493\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600067#WRQ00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the grade and associated pay scales for diplomatic ambassadors posted overseas; if this pay scale varies amongst Ireland&rsquo;s embassies abroad; if so, the variations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":935,"qnumday":354,"qnumall":"[62494\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600067#WRQ00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the current or former Departmental secretary generals, assistant secretary generals or civil servants that have or will undertake diplomatic missions abroad in tabular form; if he will list the name, location of diplomatic mission and previous public sector employment roles in each case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":936,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 351 to 354, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>I propose to group the Deputy&rsquo;s four questions together for answer.  The Government, on foot of proposals made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, nominates officers for Ambassadorial posts.

Only serving civil servants are considered for ambassadorial assignments. <\/p><p>All currently serving Ambassadors are established career civil servants employed by my Department. All civil service grades are recruited through the Public Appointments Service or external competitions administered by my Department in accordance with the Code of Practice as set out by the Office of the Commission for Public Service Appointments (CPSA). In considering the nomination of Ambassadors, a range of factors is taken into account including political, economic and trade priorities. In addition the management experience, regional knowledge, country knowledge, relevant language skills, policy experience, consular experience, and other factors of the officers are taken into account as part of the assignment process. Officers submit a list of preferences for an overseas posting.  Ambassadors are paid on the same pay scales for all Civil Service employees for that grade. These pay scales are available on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform website. Additional allowances and costs (e.g. healthcare, school fees, transportation of goods) are paid by the Department depending on the conditions in the local county, based on Department of Public

The work of the Commission will inform the future development of the Defence Forces and it's terms of reference encompasses the following matters;<\/p><p><i>-  Structure and size of the Defence Forces encompassing consideration of appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing. <\/i><\/p><p><i>-  Leveraging the capabilities of the Reserve Defence Force in their supports to the Permanent Defence Force and make service in the RDF more attractive.<\/i><\/p><p><i>-  Governance and high level command and control structures in the Defence Forces. <\/i><\/p><p><i>-  The evolution of remuneration systems and structures in the Defence Forces. <\/i><\/p><p><i>-  A strategic perspective on HR policies and associated strategies, recruitment, retention and career progression.  <\/i><\/p><p>As part of a broad consultation process, the Commission invited submissions from individuals and organisations on matters  related to its terms of reference.  The Commission received nearly 500 submissions, all of which have been published on their website.  <\/p><p>I understand that the Commission has met with a broad stakeholder group including the Defence Forces Representative Associations, commissioned and enlisted members of the Defence Forces, senior officials and personnel from my Department and the Defence Forces as well as other groups.  Members of the Commission conducted site visits to a number military locations across the country, meeting nearly 1,000 military personnel.  <\/p><p>The Chairman of the Commission Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll met with members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence in April to discuss the on-going work of the Commission.  The Commission also held two webinars, one in conjunction with the Royal Irish Academy (RIA) and one in conjunction with the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA).<\/p><p>The  work  of the independent Commission on the Defence Forces underpins this Government's commitment to ensuring that the  Defence Forces are fit for purpose, in terms of meeting immediate requirements and also in terms of seeking to develop a longer term vision beyond 2030.  <\/p><p>I understand that the Commission are continuing their work with a view to completing the Report as soon as possible.  The Report will be fully considered at that point.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600067#WRQ05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Properties","counter":984,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600067#WRQ05500"},{"type":"question","counter":985,"qnumday":370,"qnumall":"[62863\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600067#WRQ05600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the status of the proposed transfer of lands at Rockbrae House, Bray, County Wicklow to Wicklow County Council; the stage the handover is currently at; the estimated timeframe for the transfer of such lands; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":986,"content":"<p>Officials from my Department are currently liaising with the Chief State's Solicitors Office on the necessary legal matters with regard to finalising contracts and the intention is to conclude the transfer as soon as possible, subject to the normal exigencies of the conveyancing process.

From the 13th to the 17th September the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company endured almost continuous attack. At the end of the Siege, the men were taken into captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of awarding of Military Medals for Gallantry (MMG) and Distinguished Service Medals (DSMs) to a number of personnel who served in Jadotville in September 1961 has been considered on a number of occasions over the years and a range of actions have taken place to give due recognition to the courage and bravery of all the members of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion who were stationed in Jadotville in 1961. The range of actions taken to date to recognise the bravery of the men stationed in Jadotville in 1961 include:<\/p>  <p>  -  A presentation of scrolls to \"A\" Company in 2006.  <\/p>  <p>  -  Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006.  <\/p>  <p>  -  In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. A Congo photographic book was also produced for the occasion; a section of which was dedicated to the events at Jadotville in 1961.  <\/p>  <p>  -  A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Costume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011.  <\/p>  <p>  -  On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, it was decided to issue a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>  -  On 13th June 2017, the Government decided, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  This medal presentation ceremony took place in Custume Barracks, Athlone on 2nd December 2017.  It is from Custume Barracks that &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.  The &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; has the word &ldquo;Jadotville&rdquo; depicted on the clasp of the medal and the medal ribbon represents a combination of an Irish tricolour and the United Nations Operation in Congo (ONUC) mission medal. The medal depicts a warrior of the ancient Fianna with sword and shield. To the left is a reproduction of the Irish overseas flash. Surrounding the central motif are the words &ldquo;Cosaint Chalma&rdquo; (Valiant Defence) and &ldquo;Misneach&rdquo; (Courage). The reverse contains a unique unit identification representing A Coy, 35 Cathlan &Eacute;ireannach (Irish Battalion). <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the actions that have been taken to date to recognise and honour the valiant actions and bravery of all of the men stationed at Jadotville sixty years ago, an Independent Review Group (IRG) was established to examine and report on matters relating to recommendations for military medals relating to events at Jadotville.    <\/p>  <p>  The Independent Review Group completed its research in July and has submitted its report to the Chief of Staff, as the convening authority.  The work of the Independent Review Group has now concluded.   <\/p>  <p>  The report, which was published in full, is substantial and makes a number of recommendations in respect of the issue of award of medals, honouring the role of families and the support they provided to veterans and in respect of veterans affairs.  <\/p>  <p>  The deeply unsettling aftermath of Jadotville is detailed in the report as is the lack of personal welfare supports afforded to the men following events at Jadotville, their period in captivity and upon their return home. I have apologised to veterans and to their families on behalf of the State and the Government to the men of &lsquo;A&rsquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to their families for the lack of necessary supports or deserved recognition of their valiant service on their return from the Congo and for the many issues that arose as a result, some of which had tragic consequences.  I have also acknowledged that the lack of supports in place at that time is extremely regrettable.  There have been great steps in the intervening years to support Defence Forces personnel, their families and veterans through the work of the Defence Forces personnel support services.   <\/p>  <p>  A judicial review is under way at present regarding a recommendation of the IRG report relating to the convening of a Military Board to consider the award of medals. Given that the matter is now before the Courts, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600067#WRQ06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces","counter":990,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600067#WRQ06100"},{"type":"question","counter":991,"qnumday":372,"qnumall":"[62898\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600067#WRQ06200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if Defence Forces recruitment and retention issues are being addressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":992,"content":"<p>A range of actions have been taken to address recruitment and retention issues in the Permanent Defence Force and bridge the shortfall between the current strength figures and those of the establishment. <\/p>  <p>  The strength of the PDF at the end of October 2021 was 8,572 personnel.

The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.<\/p><p>A budget of &euro;65.1 million has been provided for the scheme in 2021.<\/p><p>The programme provides funding towards food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes: The urban school meals scheme and the school meals (local projects) scheme.  The Urban School Meals Scheme for primary schools is operated and administered by local authorities and is part-financed by my department.  The school meals (local projects) scheme provides funding towards the provision of food to schools and organisations.  <\/p><p>Funding under the school meals (local projects) scheme can be provided for breakfast, snack, lunch, dinner, hot meals and afterschool clubs and is based on a maximum rate per child per day, depending on the type of meal being provided e.g. &euro;1.40 per child per day where a cold lunch club is being provided, &euro;1.90 per child per day where a dinner club is being provided and &euro;2.90 per child per day where a Hot Meal club is being provided.  Dinner clubs provide a hot meal, but are different from the Hot Meals clubs, in that they tend to be provided by schools with onsite cooking facilities whereas food for Hot Meals clubs is cooked offsite and either delivered hot or reheated in the school.<\/p><p>Participation in the scheme is entirely voluntary with the onus being on the individual eligible schools to make an application and to administer the programme in accordance to the guidelines.  <\/p><p>In recent years entry to the School Meals Scheme has been confined to DEIS schools in addition to schools identified as having levels of concentrated disadvantage that would benefit from access to the School Meals Programme. <\/p><p>Prior to the introduction of DEIS in 2005, all schools and organisations that were part of one of a number of Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; initiatives for disadvantaged schools were eligible to participate in the programme, which included Breaking the Cycle, Giving Children an Even Break, the Disadvantaged Area Scheme, Home School Community Liaison and the School Completion Programme.  These schools and organisations have continued to remain in the scheme since the introduction of DEIS in 2005 but their level of funding has been capped at the same rate year on year to allow for the concentration of the scheme on DEIS schools.<\/p><p>As part of Budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019, providing hot school meals in primary schools at a cost of &euro;1m for 2019 and &euro;2.5m in 2020.  The pilot involved 37 schools benefitting 6,744 students for the 2019\/2020 academic year and was aimed primarily at schools with no onsite cooking facilities.  <\/p><p>Budget 2021 provided an additional &euro;5.5m to extend the provision of hot school meals to an additional 35,000 primary school children, currently receiving the cold lunch option.  Invitations for expressions of interest were issued to 705 primary schools (612 DEIS and 93 non-DEIS) in November 2020.  A total of 281 (256 DEIS and 25 non-DEIS) expressions of interest were received in respect of 52,148 children.<\/p><p>The 35,000 places were allocated to each local authority area based on the number of children applied by local authority as a percentage of the total number.  A minimum of one School for each Local Authority area was selected.

together.<\/p><p>The school meals programme provides funding towards the provision of food to some 1,506 schools and organisations benefitting 230,000 children.  The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.<\/p><p>A budget of &euro;65.1 million has been provided for the scheme in 2021.<\/p><p>The programme provides funding towards food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes: The urban school meals scheme and the school meals (local projects) scheme.  The Urban School Meals Scheme for primary schools is operated and administered by local authorities and is part-financed by my department.  The school meals (local projects) scheme provides funding towards the provision of food to schools and organisations.  <\/p><p>Funding under the school meals (local projects) scheme can be provided for breakfast, snack, lunch, dinner, hot meals and afterschool clubs and is based on a maximum rate per child per day, depending on the type of meal being provided e.g. &euro;1.40 per child per day where a cold lunch club is being provided, &euro;1.90 per child per day where a dinner club is being provided and &euro;2.90 per child per day where a Hot Meal club is being provided.  Dinner clubs provide a hot meal, but are different from the Hot Meals clubs, in that they tend to be provided by schools with onsite cooking facilities whereas food for Hot Meals clubs is cooked offsite and either delivered hot or reheated in the school.<\/p><p>Participation in the scheme is entirely voluntary with the onus being on the individual eligible schools to make an application and to administer the programme in accordance to the guidelines.  No information is collated in relation to the onsite canteen facilities in each school. <\/p><p>As part of Budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019, providing hot school meals in primary schools at a cost of &euro;1m for 2019 and &euro;2.5m in 2020.  The pilot involved 37 schools benefitting 6,744 students for the 2019\/2020 academic year and was aimed primarily at schools with no onsite cooking facilities.  <\/p><p>Budget 2021 provided an additional &euro;5.5m to extend the provision of hot school meals to an additional 35,000 primary school children, currently receiving the cold lunch option.  Invitations for expressions of interest were issued to 705 primary schools (612 DEIS and 93 non-DEIS) in November 2020.  A total of 281 (256 DEIS and 25 non-DEIS) expressions of interest were received in respect of 52,148 children.<\/p><p>The 35,000 places were allocated to each local authority area based on the number of children applied by local authority as a percentage of the total number.  A minimum of one School for each Local Authority area was selected.  Thereafter, a process of random selection was used for each area.<\/p><p>Budget 2022 is providing for the hot school meals to be extended from January 2022 to the 81 DEIS schools that submitted an expression of interest but were not selected in the extension to 35,000.<\/p><p>The number of primary and special needs students in receipt of hot school meals is contained in table 1 of the attached tabular statement. This includes children from the additional 35,000 announced in Budget 2021, where the school was in a position to commence the provision of hot school meals prior to the end of the 2020\/2021 academic year.

They consist of four periods of on-the-job training interspersed with three periods of off-the-job training. The off-the-job training for these programmes is delivered in either ETB Training Centres, Institutes of Technology or Technological Universities, during this time craft apprentices receive a training allowance payment, the level of which is determined with reference to the relevant sectoral payment agreements. <\/p>  <p>  COVID-related public health measures impacted on face to face training in a number of ways.  Each of which had a different implication for the level of expenditure on off-the-job training allowances paid to craft apprentices. <\/p>  <p>  For periods of complete closure of face-to-face training, those apprentices who had been scheduled to attend off-the-job training were retained on the off-the-job training phase and continued to receive a training allowance during this period.  The retention of apprentices on Phase 2, 4 or 6, allowed for apprentices to engage with the restricted level of theory based training and remote assessment which could be delivered, given the practical course content, as these became available in 2020 and early 2021.  It also provided surety for apprentices in relation to income during the closure of construction sites in early 2020. <\/p>  <p>  When face-to-face training was allowed, it operated at 50% - 60% normal capacity until September 2021 to ensure adherence to public health distancing guidance.

Apprentices are not penalised on their training allowances for operational issues that may arise. In circumstances where there has been a delay by SOLAS due to lack of available provision in the offer of a training place the apprentice may be entitled to payment of one phase rate higher e.g. on Phase 2 such apprentices may be paid the Phase 4 rate. On Phase 4 the apprentice may be paid the Phase 6 rate and on Phase 6 apprentices may be paid the fourth year rate. <\/p>  <p>  The total saving declared in 2020 for the Apprenticeship programme was &euro;23.2m.

Issues arise for communities where vehicles are used on public, open spaces such as in housing estates, playing pitches or in public parks. <\/p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that I chair the Anti-Social Behaviour Forum within my Department. One of the tasks of the Forum was to deliver proposals to Government for a community based approach to tackling this problem. While the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is fundamental to addressing the misuse of scramblers and other vehicles, it was also highlighted to the Forum that engagement with communities and raising awareness are just as important.  <\/p><p>  Raising awareness encompasses educating younger people of dangers to themselves and to others in using such vehicles and highlighting the dangers to parents who are considering buying such vehicles for their children. The Forum explored the opportunities of intervention and diversion from this type of activity. <\/p><p>  Earlier this year, the Department of Justice invited applications for funding from Youth Diversion Projects who would act as the focal point for local consortiums for the development of proposals for community-based interventions to work with young people involved in the anti-social use of these vehicles and related crime and anti-social behaviour.<\/p><p>  These funding provisions have so far enabled eight Youth Diversion Projects to obtain funding to work with young people involved in the misuse of these vehicles. A total of ten Youth Diversion Projects have submitted applications to the Department, though there have been two joint applications, leaving the total number of projects funded at eight. <\/p><p>Seven of these projects are based in Dublin with one in Limerick. <\/p><p>The projects will be required to consult with other local interests, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and to create a local consortium which will include the local authority. <\/p><p>Based on experience with existing initiatives, it is envisaged that the local authority partner is best placed to assist with the provision of tracks and related facilities. Each proposal submitted via the YDPs is assessed in accordance with the guidelines issued by my Department. The programme will also encourage young people to engage positively to learn motorcycle skills, including maintenance, combined with relevant educational and personal development activities.<\/p><p>  Separately, the Minister of Transport is examining provisions to strengthen the law in relation to the dangerous and antisocial off-road use of scramblers, quads and other similar vehicles. It is hoped that this combined approach of increased Garda powers to tackle the misuse of scramblers, together with the creation of alternative options for those who wish to use such vehicles safely and legally, will have a significant impact in tackling the problem. <\/p><p>  The Department of Justice would welcome additional applications from other Youth Diversion Projects to support the development of additional local scrambler initiatives. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600073#WRZ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1618"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Management Companies","counter":1300,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600073#WRZ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1301,"qnumday":484,"qnumall":"[62797\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600073#WRZ00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will review the legislation in relation to management companies; if she is satisfied that the provisions that enable them to carry out their duties and obligations including the collection of management fees are sufficient; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1302,"content":"<p>The Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 (MUD Act) was enacted with the primary purposes of reforming the law relating to the ownership and management of common areas of multi-unit developments and facilitating the fair, efficient and effective management of owners' management companies (OMCs).

NIAC in conjunction with the RCPI and the Irish Association of Allergy and Immunology have prepared a guide to aid vaccinators and other healthcare workers on how to advise allergic individuals in respect of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, this guide is available here: www.rcpi-live-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/FAQs-about-COVID19-Vaccines-and-Allergies_12August2021.pdf .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600073#WRZ04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1342,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600073#WRZ04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1343,"qnumday":498,"qnumall":"[62431\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600073#WRZ04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 624 of 5 October 2021, if the vacant occupational therapy roles have now been filled; the number of children currently awaiting occupational therapy appointments in counties Roscommon and Galway; the average waiting time for an appointment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1344,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600073#WRZ04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":1345,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600073#WRZ05000"},{"type":"question","counter":1346,"qnumday":499,"qnumall":"[62436\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600073#WRZ05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason more pharmacies are not administering the booster vaccination in view of the excellent work that pharmacists have carried out throughout the pandemic; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1347,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600073#WRZ05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes","counter":1348,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600073#WRZ05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1349,"qnumday":500,"qnumall":"[62442\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600073#WRZ05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the actions that his Department has taken to ensure clean air in nursing homes, including providing ventilation schemes, CO2 monitors or HEPA filters, to support them in ensuring their residents are exposed to clean air in an effort to keep them safe from Covid-19 infection.","asker":"1628","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1350,"content":"<p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE has developed, published and regularly reviews a comprehensive package of public health and infection prevention and control guidance for long-term residential care facilities.

It is of particular regret that children can experience long waiting times for orthopaedic treatment, especially for time sensitive procedures, and I remain acutely aware of the impact that this has on children and their families. <\/p><p>As part of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland&rsquo;s (CHI) paediatric orthopaedic service, most scoliosis cases are treated at Crumlin and Temple Street, with Crumlin providing specialised multi-disciplinary treatment for the most complex patients. The National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional capacity for the treatment of less complex orthopaedic patients, including routine scoliosis procedures. By using the capacity provided by Cappagh, CHI can free up space in order that complex orthopaedic procedures, including scoliosis spinal fusions, can be carried out centrally at CHI sites.<\/p><p>More specifically, additional theatre capacity at the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh commenced on the 26 April 2021 for daycase surgery. CHI has advised the Department of Health that this should result in a positive impact in reducing long waiting times for general orthopaedics, in addition to consequential capacity gains for scoliosis patients. In 2022 CHI is planning to undertake a range of inpatient, daycase and outpatient orthopaedic appointments in Cappagh.<\/p><p>In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. This funding is recurring and has been provided in the base HSE allocation each year since 2018. The additional funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTEs in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services. <\/p><p>  Funding proposals submitted to the HSE by Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland for increased investment in paediatric orthopaedic services in 2022 will be decided as part of the finalisation of the Waiting List Action Plan 2022. In addition the HSE has advised my Department that a proposal to fund an additional theatre at Temple Street is currently progressing through the normal HSE capital approval process. Improving access to scheduled care capacity remains a priority for me and my Department as we work to finalise next years&rsquo; Access to Care fund.<\/p><p>Improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures remains a commitment of this Government. For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.<\/p><p>In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. <\/p><p>In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy regarding the creation of dedicated teams to deal exclusively with scoliosis procedures, and the number and grade of extra staff required to meet current and future requirements in respect of scoliosis, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600073#WRZ06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1361,"content":"<p>Question No. 504 answered with Question No. 503.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1363,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600074#WRAA00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1364,"qnumday":505,"qnumall":"[62459\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600074#WRAA00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there is a hospital transfer service in place for elderly persons who are unable to drive to hospital appointments;

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.<\/p><p>Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p><p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p><p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p><p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.<\/p><p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.<\/p><p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.<\/p><p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p><p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020\/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card\/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.<\/p><p>My Department has asked the National Immunisation Advisory Committee to consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to:<\/p><p>- girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and<\/p><p>- women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.<\/p><p>If the NIAC conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600074#WRAA03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":1394,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600074#WRAA03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1395,"qnumday":515,"qnumall":"[62490\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600074#WRAA03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the policy on an issue (details supplied) regarding healthcare assistants and home helps employed through section 39 organisations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1396,"content":"<p>The option to avail of Covid-19 vaccination is open to anyone for whom it is deemed clinically safe and who wishes to receive a vaccination.

ME\/CFS is characterised by severe fatigue accompanied by a range of other symptoms. It is also a fluctuating condition in which a person's symptoms can change unpredictably in nature and severity over time. <\/p>  <p>  As a result, clinical assessment and the design of care plans need to be tailored to the individual patient. In general, these treatments are delivered within the context of primary care by General Practitioners, with referrals into secondary care for specialist interventions in the areas of Neurology, Rheumatology, Pain Specialists, Endocrinology, Immunology, Cardiology, etc. The challenge in relation to ME\/CFS is that it does not sit within one specialty, but crosses a number of specialties, with patients attending different Consultants for management of symptoms as they arise. The General Practitioner (GP) is regarded as best placed to refer patients, if appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive, on behalf of the State, does operate two schemes which assist citizens with their medication costs. These are the Drugs Payment Scheme and the General Medical Services Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme no individual or family pays more than &euro;114 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The maximum payable under the Drugs Payment Scheme will be further reduced to &euro;100 per month from 1 January 2022. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.<\/p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.<\/p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%. <\/p>  <p>  As this question also relates to a service matter, I have also asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600074#WRAA03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":1401,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600074#WRAA04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1402,"qnumday":518,"qnumall":"[62499\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600074#WRAA04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will engage with the Minister for Social Protection to expand the critical illness protocol to persons diagnosed with ME\/CFS; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1574","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1403,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600074#WRAA04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1404,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600074#WRAA04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1405,"qnumday":519,"qnumall":"[62501\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600074#WRAA04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the waiting times for behavioural therapy and speech and language therapy for children, by county (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1590","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1406,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600074#WRAA04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Bodies","counter":1407,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600074#WRAA04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1408,"qnumday":520,"qnumall":"[62528\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600074#WRAA04700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of State boards under the remit of his Department or its agencies, in tabular form; the number of members of each board; the number of persons with a declared disability on each board; and the percentage of each board that is made up of persons with a declared disability.","asker":"1525","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1409,"content":"<p>Board members are not employees of the Department of Health or its aegis bodies therefore the information requested by the Deputy is not collected. <\/p><p>In line with the Code of Practice for Governance of State Bodies annex on Gender Balance, Diversity and Inclusion the board is required to carry out a self-assessment evaluation questionnaire.

scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in as a direct result of the COVID-19. While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times. <\/p><p>The current surge in Covid-19 cases has put increasing pressures on hospitals and ICUs. As part of the response to this the HSE has advised all Hospital Groups to take a series of immediate actions which include a period of prioritising unscheduled care, COVID care and time sensitive work, in particular in Model 4 hospitals. This situation is to remain under review. <\/p><p>On the 7th October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan. This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack. <\/p><p>In addition, my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. <\/p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services. <\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the attached documents.

is included in the Programme for Government. The model of care for infertility was developed by my officials in conjunction with the HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme (NWIHP) in order to ensure that infertility issues are addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary. <\/p>  <p>  This model of care comprises three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs) and extending into secondary care (i.e., Regional Fertility Hubs) and then, where necessary, tertiary care (i.e., IVF and other advanced assisted human reproduction (AHR) treatments), with patients being referred onwards through structured pathways. <\/p>  <p>  Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care has involved the establishment, at secondary care level, of Regional Fertility Hubs within maternity networks, in order to facilitate the management of a significant proportion &ndash; estimated by NWIHP to be in the range of 50% to 70% &ndash; of patients presenting with infertility issues at this level of intervention. <\/p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;2m was provided to the HSE to commence Phase One of the roll-out in 2020 and this was utilised specifically in respect of the development of the first four Regional Fertility Hubs &ndash; namely, Cork University Maternity Hospital, the Rotunda Hospital, the National Maternity Hospital and the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital. These four Hubs are currently operational.<\/p>  <p>  Additional funding was made available in Budget 2021 to enable the continuation of Phase One this year, including through the setting-up of the final two Regional Fertility Hubs, one located within the Saolta Hospital Group, at University Hospital Galway, and one within the University of Limerick Hospital Group, at Nenagh General Hospital. Work is well underway in relation to the recruitment, refurbishment and equipping of these two Hubs.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the completion of Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care, envisaged before the end of 2022, will result in operational Regional Fertility Hubs in each of the six Hospital Groups across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system, but will not commence until such time as infertility services at secondary level have been developed across the country, required resources have been allocated and the AHR legislation commenced, which will allow for a robust regulatory framework to be put in place. <\/p>  <p>  Publication of the Bill to regulate the area of AHR is a priority for the Government, and officials in the Department and the Office of the Attorney General will continue to engage intensively over the coming weeks in order to finalise this complex legislation, which encompasses the regulation for the first time of a wide range of practices undertaken in this jurisdiction.<\/p>  <p>  While advanced AHR treatment, such as IVF, is not currently funded by the Irish public health service, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant\/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme. Given the costs associated with certain fertility medicines, I understand that these schemes can have a material impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of them.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access IVF, or other advanced AHR treatment, privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department and the Government is fully committed, through the full implementation of the model of care for infertility, to ensuring that patients always receive care at the appropriate level of clinical intervention and then those requiring, and eligible for, advanced treatment such as IVF will be able to access same through the public health system. The underlying aim of the policy to provide a model of funding for AHR, within the broader AHR regulatory framework, is to improve accessibility to AHR treatments, while at the same time embedding safe and appropriate clinical practice and ensuring the cost-effective use of public resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600075#WRBB06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1488,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600075#WRBB06300"},{"type":"question","counter":1489,"qnumday":547,"qnumall":"[62590\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600075#WRBB06400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the services that will be provided at a location (details supplied);

This includes contraceptive injections, implants, various types of intrauterine system (IUS) or device (IUD; commonly known as the coil), the contraceptive patch and ring, and various forms of oral contraceptive pill, including emergency contraception.<\/p>  <p>  Funding for free contraception in Budget 2022 also includes an allocation for training of additional GPs in fitting and removal of various forms of long-acting reversible contraception (e.g. various forms of the coil and contraceptive implant).

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times.<\/p><p>The current surge in Covid-19 cases has put increasing pressures on hospitals and ICUs. As part of the response to this the HSE has advised all Hospital Groups to take a series of immediate actions which include a 14 day period of prioritising unscheduled care, COVID care and time sensitive work in particular in Model 4 hospitals. The situation is to be reviewed after that period.<\/p><p>On the 7th October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan. This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack.<\/p><p>In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. <\/p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.<\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the attached documents. This information shows the number of patients on the Inpatient &amp;amp; Daycase (IPDC) waiting list at Mayo University Hospital. In regard to average wait times for inpatient and outpatients at Mayo University Hospital, the health system does not collect the data necessary to calculate average wait times. In particular, the time to treatment of patients who have already received their care is not collected.

We are working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.<\/p>  <p>  GPs are self-employed practitioners and therefore may establish practices at a place of their own choosing. Under the GMS scheme, the HSE contracts GPs to provide medical services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders. Where a vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes actively involved in the selection process to find a replacement GP.<\/p>  <p>  Several efforts to increase the number of practicing GPs have been undertaken in recent years. The number of entrants to GP training has increased from 120 in 2009 to 233 this year, with large increases made in recent years. Further increases are expected as responsibility for training has transferred from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners. Changes have been made to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to facilitate more flexible\/shared GMS contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme. An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was also introduced.<\/p>  <p>  Recent developments in relation to general practice, in particular the 2019 Agreement on Contractual Reform and Service Development, have helped to re-establish general practice in Ireland as an attractive career choice.  The additional investment, which will amount to &euro;210 million annually once the Agreement is fully implemented, provides for an increase in capitation fees, improved maternity and paternity arrangements as well as enhanced supports for rural practices. In addition, targeted on-going funding of &euro;2 million will also be set aside to provide additional support to practices in deprived urban areas. The wider reforms in the health service will also help to provide an atmosphere in which the practice of medicine in Ireland will remain attractive. The additional investment in general practice provides a sound basis for ensuring that GPs have access to a credible and rewarding career path in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600078#WREE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Admissions","counter":1633,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600078#WREE01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1634,"qnumday":596,"qnumall":"[62843\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600078#WREE01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of planned surgeries that have been cancelled in each hospital in the Saolta University Health Care Group over each of the past six months as a result of bed capacity issues;

At various times of the year, they can be found from the Iberian peninsula in the south to the Barents Sea in the far north, in the North sea and as far west as the mid-Atlantic ridge. During the summer months, the bulk of the stock is found feeding in the Norwegian Sea and adjacent waters. Later in the year, they migrate south to spawn during the first half of the year in warmer waters, typically to the west of Britain and Ireland for Blue Whiting while Mackerel also spawn in the Bay of Biscay. Detailed information on the spawning behaviour of mackerel is available from the mackerel egg survey which takes place every three years. Over the most recent decade, this survey indicates that, while Irish waters have remained very important, the distribution of spawning activity has expanded both north and west and has become more variable in terms of the timing and location of the peak of spawning.

Any amendments to the technical file must undergo detailed scrutiny to assess compliance with the EU rules for Geographical Indications and spirit drinks and will also require consultation with stakeholders. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600079#WRFF04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greyhound Industry","counter":1735,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600079#WRFF05000"},{"type":"question","counter":1736,"qnumday":631,"qnumall":"[62803\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121600079#WRFF05100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of racing greyhounds microchipped annually between 1 December 2020 and 30 November 2021, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1737,"content":"<p>R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann (RC&Eacute;) is a commercial state body, established under the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 chiefly to control greyhound racing and to improve and develop the greyhound industry.
