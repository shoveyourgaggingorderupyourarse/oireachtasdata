The approach proposed is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to:<\/p>  <p>  - build core social and emotional skills and competencies<\/p>  <p>  - experience supportive relationships within the school setting<\/p>  <p>  - be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe, in which they feel a sense of belonging and connectedness, where their voice is heard, and they feel  supported<\/p>  <p>  Schools are encouraged to use a reflective, school self-evaluation approach to identify and prioritise the needs of its own school community in relation to the promotion of wellbeing and mental health, and to respond to meeting those needs.  <\/p>  <p>  This approach to supporting wellbeing has been found internationally to produce a wide range of educational and social benefits for individual children and young people, including increased inclusion, greater social cohesion, increased social capital and improvements in mental health.  <\/p>  <p>  Embedded in the whole-school approach is the recognition that members of the school community may have different needs at different times and that a continuum of support in relation to wellbeing should be made available. <\/p>  <p>  A broad range of supports, resources and professional learning opportunities are being provided to support schools to promote and support wellbeing and resilience by the Department&rsquo;s support services.  The services support schools to provide strong universal support at the level of whole school and classroom, more targeted support for some children and young people who may be at risk, and more individualised support for those with greatest need.  Support is provided to primary and post-primary school staff through the following services and supports:<\/p>  <p>  - The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS)  <\/p>  <p>  - Guidance Counselling service\/provision  <\/p>  <p>  - National Council for Special Education (NCSE)   <\/p>  <p>  - Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) Wellbeing Team <\/p>  <p>  - Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) Support Service<\/p>  <p>  - Education Support Centres Ireland (ESCI) <\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides a school-based, consultative, psychological service in two ways &ndash; through the provision of an individual casework service for students and a support and development service for school staff. <\/p>  <p>  The NEPS casework service involves the provision of a psychological service for a student, with the psychologist working with the student, teachers and parents, and other professionals if appropriate, to identify need and plan for intervention and review to support the student in school.  This service can take place over an extended period of time with NEPS psychologists.  This model does not operate on a waiting list basis, and extends to approximately 8000 students per annum. <\/p>  <p>  The NEPS Support and Development service, reaching an estimated 25,000 teachers annually, is an applied psychological service for school staff to help build their capability to respond to the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional needs of all students, and particularly those who are experiencing barriers to their wellbeing, learning, inclusion and participation. <\/p>  <p>  This model of service allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.<\/p>  <p>  The capacity of NEPS has increased significantly from its 2016 allocation of 173 whole-time equivalent psychologists.  The capacity of NEPS was increased recently as part of a package of measures to support the reopening of our schools when the provision of an additional seventeen psychologist posts to NEPS was announced bringing overall sanctioned numbers to 221 whole-time equivalent psychologist posts.  This represents by far the highest number of psychologists sanctioned for NEPS since its inception in 2000.  The capacity of NEPS will be kept under review and I hope to be in a position to increase this capacity in future years. <\/p>  <p>  At post primary level, a Student Support Team is a student-focused mechanism put in place by a school in order to co-ordinate the support available for students in the school and to facilitate links to the community and other non-school support services. NEPS provides support to post primary schools in the setting up or review of Student Support Teams. <\/p>  <p>  Also at post primary level, counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. Guidance allocations for all schools were increased in the 2020\/21 school year. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.   The total number of guidance counsellor posts in the school year 2020\/21 is 852.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, the Department of Health has responsibility for the provision of counselling services in Ireland, and through HSE Primary Care Psychology and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) provides clinical support to children and young people with mental health needs. In addition, the HSE and its funded providers, provide e-mental health services that offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice.  These include services provided by the Samaritans, Pieta House, MyMind, Turn2Me, Aware, Crisis Text Ireland, Shine, BeLongTo, LGBT Ireland, Jigsaw, spunout, Bodywhys and Childline. <\/p>  <p>  My Department &ndash; through NEPS, Student Support Teams, Guidance Counsellors and other services - will continue to signpost schools and students to the HSE\/HSE-funded e-mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has built strong links with the Department of Health and both Departments are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including around increased awareness, promoting help-seeking behaviour and sign-posting to the wide range of available services.  We will continue to collectively explore ways of improving supports for children and young people. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100072#WRB04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":81,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100072#WRB04800"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[35258\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100072#WRB04900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the building of a new school building for a school (details supplied).","asker":"1453","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":83,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware a building project for the new Gaelscoil in question is included in my Department's current Building Programme.<\/p><p>Officials from my Department have been working closely with Cork City Council towards acquiring a permanent site for this school.<\/p><p>A potential site option has been identified and discussions are ongoing with the landowner with a view to acquiring this site.

The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005. <\/p><p>Section 1 &ndash; Interpretation<\/p><p>Section 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational Needs<\/p><p>Section 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schools<\/p><p>Sections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing.<\/p><p>Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards<\/p><p>Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act<\/p><p>Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council<\/p><p>Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council. <\/p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.

Legal advice also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.<\/p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act have not recently been conducted. The estimated level of additional expenditure required, to implement the outstanding sections of the Act, would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who may now currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. <\/p><p>In 2021 the Department of Education and Skills will invest approximately &euro;2 Billion in the area of special educational needs support.<\/p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis.  <\/p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of a new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017. <\/p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report. <\/p><p>Additional powers have also been provided to the National Council for Special Educational to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. <\/p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>It should also be noted, however, that since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives. <\/p><p>Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child.  This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act.  The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs based approach.  <\/p><p>This Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support. Ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.<\/p><p>I have also indicated that one of my priorities as Minister for Special Education and Inclusion is: &ldquo;Updating our Laws: Reviewing and updating the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Any review of the Act will take into account the extent of additional investment which has been made in special educational services since 2004, with some &euro;2 Billion per year now being spent of special educational supports. <\/p><p>It will also take into account the range of reforms which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not based primarily on a response to assessment as policy advice has indicated that requirement of diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons. Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100073#WRC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":95,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100073#WRC01200"},{"type":"question","counter":96,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[35349\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100073#WRC01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the school bus transport scheme issue that has been repeatedly identified in County Clare in particular the concessionary ticket issue; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1520","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":97,"content":"<p>The School Transport Scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.

Since 2016 my Department launched a number of strands of SEF including SEF-DEIS, Gaeltacht, Digital, STEM and Step up (Leadership).<\/p>  <p>  The overarching aim of the SEF-DEIS strand is to improve learning outcomes for young people. In order to achieve this, schools participating in the SEF-DEIS strand are challenged to promote innovation by adopting new evidence-based approaches to tackling under-performance in literacy and in the STEM subjects or in the Arts subjects.  My Department provided total funding of &euro;1.8m for SEF-DEIS. Thirty clusters, comprising approximately 100 early years settings, primary and post-primary schools and operating on a cross-sectoral basis are currently participating in the SEF-DEIS. <\/p>  <p>  Sharing learning across clusters is regarded as an important element of the SEF-DEIS.  To date, two shared learning days have been held. There are no plans to extend participation in the SEF-DEIS strand beyond the current thirty clusters. The focus of my Department will be on facilitating participant schools and education settings to identify and share good practice arising from their SEF-DEIS work.  There will also be a focus on supporting schools to ensure they successfully capture data and information relating to the outcomes of their work.   <\/p>  <p>  Since 2017, a budget of in the region of &euro;20m has been made available to support the implementation of the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme, which forms part of the overall implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education. The 105 primary schools and 29 post-primary schools participating in the scheme receive a range of additional supports and resources. Due to the unprecedented school closures resulting from the COVID pandemic,  the original 5 year term of the Scheme has been extended up to the 2023\/24 school year to provide schools with more time to implement the language based criteria to gain recognition as Gaeltacht schools. <\/p>  <p>  There are some 40 clusters participating in the SEF Digital &amp;amp; STEM programme, 9 of which are under the STEM strand. Some &euro;1 million in funding is provided to over 200 primary and post-primary schools participating across both strands. The programme commenced in the 2018\/19 school year, and was intended to run for 3 years but is extended to end 2021\/22 school year in recognition of the impact of the pandemic. An evaluation of the programme is underway and the outcome from this evaluation will be considered in the context of applying the learnings to the wider system.<\/p>  <p>  Step up (leadership) SEF was a two year programme for the 2018\/2019 and 2019\/20 school years.The programme was a joint initiative between my Department's Inspectorate and Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) to recognise where schools were engaging in very good practice in implementing the Junior Cycle.  The final report is due to be published by my Department and JCT in due course.  The learnings gathered from the project have been incorporated into the work of JCT and will also be available to schools once the final report is published.

From 11 January 2021, all students, including students currently in fifth year and who are due to sit the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2022, engaged in a programme of remote learning with their schools. Students in fifth year were prioritised for a return to school following the return of sixth year students.<\/p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils\/students in a COVID-19 context.  These are available at www.gov.ie\/backtoschool.<\/p><p>The nature of distance learning, which was necessitated during the unprecedented closure of schools last year and early this year, required educators to take on a range of approaches to support their pupils&rsquo; continuity of learning during that period. Assisted by Department-funded resources and supports, schools and teachers demonstrated great innovation in adapting to the unprecedented situation including the use of digital technologies and online learning platforms for teaching and learning.  <\/p><p>Extensive guidance and supports have been and continue to be made available by my Department and its support services to support schools to plan for the transition to online and remote learning. Circular 0074\/2020, &lsquo;Communication\/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform&rsquo;, was issued by the Department last year.  In accordance with the circular, it became a requirement for all schools to have in place a communication\/learning platform (while acknowledging that many schools have already put such platforms in place) that supports them to respond in the event of a partial or full school closure in the future, including the facilitation of some use of live or recorded video lessons where practicable.<\/p><p>The circular includes links to a range of materials and supports developed by the Digital Technologies team of the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), including information and resources for commonly used platforms for teaching, learning and assessment,  short video tutorials exploring how digital platforms and tools can be used effectively for remote learning purposes and clarity regarding how chosen platforms can be effectively used for assessment and feedback purposes, links to each of which are shown.<\/p><p>Other documents published by my Department include <i>Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education<\/i><i>and Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers<\/i>. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning. A number of adjustments were made to the assessment arrangements for the 2021 Leaving Certificate examinations to take account of the disruption to learning experienced by the students who are due to take these examinations.<\/p><p>However, I am conscious that students who are due to take their Leaving Certificate examinations in 2022 have experienced a degree of disruption to their learning.<\/p><p>Yesterday, the Advisory Group on Planning for State Examinations received an update in relation to the 2022 Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations. I announced that the level of adjustment to the assessment arrangements for the 2022 Leaving Certificate Examination cohort would be broadly the same as that applied by the <i>Assessment Arrangements for Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021,<\/i>as set in December 2020.  There arrangements were announced before the second period of school closures. Minor changes will be made to that document to reflect syllabus content specific the 2022 examinations. The revised document will be published later this month.<\/p><p>I also announced yesterday that the State Examinations Commission (SEC) will run an alternative set of Leaving Certificate Examinations in 2022, shortly following the main set of examinations.  The SEC will set out the eligibility conditions for these examinations, which will be limited to certain students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations due to close family bereavement, COVID-19 illness during those examinations, and certain other categories of serious illness, to be clearly and strictly delineated.  The SEC will issue further details regarding these examinations, with all arrangements guided by prevailing public health advice.

The purpose of this engagement is to ensure that all schools, including DEIS schools, are supported through periods of  remote learning and also now as schools have reopened and learners have returned to the classroom. <\/p>  <p>  The Department's Inspectorate also carried out telephone surveys of principals in the September to December 2020 period (return to school) and in the January-February period when schools were closed. Engagement with schools revealed that, in some instances, schools provided hard copy materials to students, initially where those students had no means of accessing online learning, where internet connectivity was particularly poor or where some students with additional needs found it difficult to engage in online learning. The subject of associated costs was not explored.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will spend over &euro;150million on supports for schools under the DEIS programme in 2021. Included in this, is funding in the region of &euro;16.2 million which is provided to schools in the form of a DEIS grant. In response to the difficulties faced by some students to engage with remote learning, my Department issued the DEIS Grant for the 2020\/21 school year earlier than scheduled, ensuring schools had funding to support their vulnerable learners. At the time the grant issued last year all DEIS schools were informed by letter that they could consider using some of their DEIS funding to support pupils&rsquo; learning, for example to arrange access to additional materials of supports for students during the move to remote teaching and learning caused by Covid-19. This grant has already issued to schools in respect of the 2021\/22 school year. <\/p>  <p>  When schools were closed, where the nature of costs which would normally have been incurred when schools were open changed, it was a matter for schools to use the resources available to the school including the DEIS grant funding allocated to support students in DEIS schools, in accordance with the needs of the school and to support the objectives of the DEIS programme, including retention, attendance, literacy and numeracy. <\/p>  <p>  My Department provides capitation funding to all recognised schools in the free education scheme. The capitation grant caters for day to day running costs of the school including postage costs. I am pleased to say that budget 2020 was able to provide for a further 2.5% increase in standard capitation funding for primary schools that applied from the start of the 2020\/21 school year. This builds on the 5% increase in capitation announced in budget 2019. All schools have received the benefit of the capitation increases awarded to date. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to supporting the connectivity of schools and learners, as part of the &euro;210m investment programme underpinning the implementation of the Digital Strategy for Schools,  my Department provided &euro;100m in grant funding to schools to address their ICT needs during 2020. Schools were advised that they can use this funding to support the continuity of teaching and learning should a period of partial or full school closure occur arising from Public Health advice owing to Covid-19 restrictions. This can include the purchase of ICT devices including laptops, etc, that can be shared with students and teachers who do not have access to devices, essential learning platforms and other ICT infrastructure to support the provision of remote learning. <\/p>  <p>  In an effort to support students and families a process to zero rate educational websites was put in place during the first lockdown, as announced by the then Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications. I am advised that the zero rating has been maintained by a number of telecoms providers and also that there is a range of unlimited mobile data packages on offer by the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100075#WRE03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Curriculum","counter":210,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100075#WRE03200"},{"type":"question","counter":211,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[35402\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100075#WRE03300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the review of the senior cycle; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1511","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":212,"content":"<p>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) undertook an extensive review of senior cycle programmes and vocational pathways, including Transition Year, Leaving Certificate Applied, Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme and the Leaving Certificate Established.

Advance notice will be given to recipients so that there is no sudden and unexpected withdrawal of support. <\/p>  <p>  Irish social welfare rates of payment compare well with peer countries.  Social transfers, excluding pensions, continued to perform strongly in reducing the at-risk-of-poverty rate.  Without social transfers and pension income, EU-SILC research indicates that the at-risk-of-poverty rate would be 41.4%.  After social transfers, the rate is 12.8%.  This is a poverty reduction effect of nearly 70%, one of the highest in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  It will take some time for the full social impact and the impact on poverty levels of the pandemic to become clear, particularly in the form of official data which takes time to gather and process.  Nevertheless, data and research published by the ESRI since the beginning of the pandemic shows the importance of the social protection system for supporting those on low incomes in general and the role of pandemic supports in &lsquo;cushioning&rsquo; the impact of the unemployment shock related to the pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position at this time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100077#WRG01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":296,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100077#WRG01900"},{"type":"question","counter":297,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[35181\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100077#WRG02000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the steps she plans to take in order to introduce a cost of disability as committed to in the Programme for Government; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":298,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government commits the Government to use the research into the cost of disability to individuals and families to properly inform the direction of future policy.

This is because many employers operate a &quot;last in-first out&quot; approach when reducing their labour force.  Moreover, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact on our youth is driven by the tendency for many younger people to work in some of the sectors most severely impacted by the pandemic: namely, the hospitality (accommodation &amp;amp; food) and retail sectors.<\/p><p>Prior to the pandemic, the seasonally adjusted youth unemployment rate (15-24 year olds) stood at just under 12% in December 2019.  Latest estimates from the CSO, however, indicate that the traditional unemployment rate for young persons stood at 20.1 percent for young people in May.  This estimate excludes those in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).  When all those in receipt of the PUP are included, this gives a COVID-19 adjusted unemployment rate estimate of 58.8 percent for young people at the end of May.<\/p><p>A significant number of PUP recipients are students.  As of last week (June 22nd 2021), it is estimated that just under 27,000 PUP recipients are students, with the vast majority under the age of 25.  Using international measures of unemployment, set by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), students are generally not counted as unemployed, as they are not considered part of the labour force.  Therefore, the inclusion of PUP recipients, including students, in the COVID-19 adjusted measure of youth unemployment serves to inflate this measure. <\/p><p>While the employment of young people has been significantly affected by the pandemic, we also know from past recessions that they are also the most resilient, with youth unemployment levels typically falling quite quickly once economic activity resumes.  Many have already returned to work, and others will continue to return to their previous employment, as public health restrictions continue to ease. <\/p><p>However, others will require assistance and support to return to employment, re-skill and to find new jobs.  As a consequence, my Department is supporting a range of initiatives to assist people, including young people, back to work.<\/p><p>As outlined under the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Economic Recovery Plan&rsquo;, which was launched on June 1st 2021, a central focus of the recovery process will be on helping people get back to work, training or education by extending labour market supports,  and through intense activation and skills opportunities.  Pathways to Work 2021-2025 will be a key delivery mechanism of the Economic Recovery Plan&rsquo;s second Pillar on &lsquo;Helping People Back into Work&rsquo;.<\/p><p>In supporting people back into employment &ndash; including young people &ndash; the Pathways to Work 2021&ndash;2025 strategy will seek to minimise any long-term scarring effects of the pandemic on the labour force for those whose jobs are permanently lost while providing support to those unemployed pre-pandemic.  The strategy will also set out how an expanded Public Employment Service will utilise its existing and expanded capacity to deliver effective services in a post-COVID labour market with an overall target of increasing the caseload capacity by 100,000 per annum.<\/p><p>Some of the key supports for young people that will form part of Pathways to Work and the Economic Recovery Plan include:<\/p><p>- Expanding the JobsPlus scheme to 8,000 places and enhancing the incentive to recruit young jobseekers in particular, by increasing the youth age limit from 25 to 30 years.<\/p><p>- Accelerating rollout of an additional 50,000 education and training places to support jobseekers to upskill and reskill for the labour market.<\/p><p>- A new Government Youth Employment Charter for intensive engagement with young jobseeker which will build on the new EU Reinforced Youth Guarantee.<\/p><p>- A new work placement scheme which will be open to all regardless of age, but should be particularly attractive to and beneficial for young people requiring work experience. <\/p><p>My Department works closely with the Further Education and Training sector to provide access to training, upskilling and reskilling opportunities.  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science also last week announced the extension of the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme until the end of December 2021.  This scheme provides financial supports for employers who register apprentices to a national apprenticeship. <\/p><p>In addition, the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 was launched in April by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  It sets out a five-year strategy to deliver on the Programme for Government commitment of reaching 10,000 new apprentice registrations per year by 2025.  The plan provides a roadmap to a single apprenticeship system and new supports for employers and apprentices, which will prove attractive for young people.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100077#WRG03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Programme for Government","counter":314,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100077#WRG03700"},{"type":"question","counter":315,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[35288\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100077#WRG03800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the steps she is taking to fulfil the Programme for Government commitment to&rsquo; develop a carer&rsquo;s guarantee proposal that will provide a core basket of services to carers across the country regardless of where they live.","asker":"1525","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":316,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government commits the Government to develop a &lsquo;Carers Guarantee&rsquo; proposal that will provide a core basket of services to carers across the country, regardless of where they live.

All social insurance benefits are paid out of the fund which operates on a pay-as-you-go basis, with the Exchequer acting as the residual financier where there is a shortfall between social insurance income and the cost of social insurance benefits paid.<\/p><p>The social insurance fund is currently facing significant financial and sustainability challenges.  In 2020, the fund recorded an operational deficit of &euro;3.44 billion.  The revised estimate provides for a deficit of &euro;4.2 billion in 2021 as receipts from contributions to the fund are expected to be insufficient to meet expenditure due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on employment and the scale of expenditure on benefits, such as the pandemic unemployment payment, required to mitigate its effects.  Funding this deficit will require an Exchequer subvention of &euro;3.76 billion in addition to the remaining &euro;453 million accumulated when the fund was in surplus prior to 2020.  <\/p><p>While employed workers who are contributors to the social insurance fund have always had access to the full range of benefits available from it, there has been significant expansion of access to such benefits to self-employed workers in recent years.  However, the 4% of income contribution rate to the fund by self-employed workers, who are now covered for approximately 93% of the value of all benefits paid by the fund, is 11 percentage points lower than the standard combined employee and employer rate of 15.05% of employee earnings.  This is one example of several sustainability challenges facing the fund.  <\/p><p>The Programme for Government &lsquo;Our Shared Future&rsquo; includes two commitments that are likely to impact on the future income and expenditure of the social insurance fund.  One being to consider increasing all classes of social insurance over time to replenish the fund to help pay for measures and changes to be agreed including, inter alia, to the State pension system, improvement in short-term sick pay benefits, parental leave benefits, pay-related jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and treatment benefit.  The second commitment is the establishment of a Commission on Pensions to examine sustainability and eligibility issues with State pensions and the social insurance fund.  The Commission was established in November 2020 and I expect that, in accordance with its terms of reference, it will submit its report to me in the near future.<\/p><p>Considering the interaction of the social insurance and taxation systems, the terms of reference of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare, established by the Department of Finance in April 2021, includes an intention to examine what changes, if any, should be made to the social insurance system, including structure and benefits coverage, while ensuring sustainability.  I expect that the work of this Commission in this regard will contribute to informing future policy in the area of social insurance generally.<\/p><p>I, as Minister for Social Protection, am required to have an Actuarial Review of the social insurance fund undertaken at five yearly intervals.  The purpose of the review is to determine the extent to which the fund may be expected, in the long term, to meet the demands in respect of payment of benefits and other payments.  The review takes account of the adequacy or otherwise of contributions to support benefits and other payments as well as other matters relevant to the current and future financial condition of the Fund.  Preparation for the next Actuarial Review of the fund in respect of the year ending 31 December 2020 is underway.  The review is expected to be completed and published in 2022. <\/p><p>I trust that the foregoing sets out the current financial position of the social insurance fund as well as the initiatives underway with a view to ensuring its financial stability and sustainability in order for it to meet the significant income support challenges required of it in the years ahead. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100077#WRG05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Schemes","counter":331,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100078#WRH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[35361\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100078#WRH00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated cost of providing the WALK PEER employment support service model nationally; and her views on the overall use and efficacy of the programme.","asker":"1520","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":333,"content":"<p>The Ability Programme is a pre-activation programme for young people with disabilities.

To date expenditure on the scheme is over &euro;8 billion, which demonstrates the Governments clear commitment to support workers and businesses who have been severely impacted by Covid-19.  <\/p><p>Approximately 227,980 people received a PUP payment this week, representing a drop of 254,000, or almost 53%, since the numbers in receipt of PUP peaked this year at around 482,000 in February.  The requirement for emergency measures is diminishing due to more people returning to work as restrictions are gradually lifted and the continuation of the vaccination roll-out.  We expect tens of thousands more people to close their PUP over the coming weeks and months because their employment will reopen. <\/p><p>To allow as much time as possible for employment to recover, a transitional approach will be taken until February 2022 with PUP whereby the rates of payment will remain unchanged until September when they will commence a gradual reduction over 6 months back to standard jobseekers terms.  People currently receiving the &euro;203 rate and those who reach the &euro;203 rate in each phase, will then transition to standard jobseeker terms.  This will be done over a period of time commencing from September and with advance notice.<\/p><p>Supports will be available under the Jobseeker's Benefit and the means tested Jobseeker's Allowance for those who may be returning to reduced days of employment.  Detailed information on these supports are available on the gov.ie website and from Intreo centres. <\/p><p>As has been the case throughout the pandemic, the position with regard to the PUP will be kept under review as the public health advice evolves. <\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the position at this time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100078#WRH02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Labour Activation Measures","counter":358,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100078#WRH02900"},{"type":"question","counter":359,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[35296\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100078#WRH03000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her views on the role labour activation measures can play in the post-Covid recovery; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":360,"content":"<p>Both domestically and internationally there is a significant body of empirical evidence that demonstrates the positive role labour activation measures can play in stimulating economic recovery and in increasing the employment prospects of participants. <\/p><p>While many have been displaced from their employment by the pandemic, a significant share of these people have already returned to work, and others will continue to return to their previous employment, as public health restrictions continue to ease.  This week there are 228,000  on PUP, representing a reduction of around 50% from the most recent peak in numbers in February last when public health restrictions were at their highest level.  However, it is inevitable that some jobs will be permanently lost, and additional numbers of persons will require State support to find new jobs and in transitioning back to work.<\/p><p>A central focus of Government&rsquo;s Economic Recovery Plan, which was launched on June 1st 2021, is on  helping people get back to work, through the provision of employment supports, additional training, reskilling and work placement opportunities. <\/p><p>Central to achieving this objective will be the Government&rsquo;s forthcoming national employment services strategy, &lsquo;Pathways to Work 2021-2025&rsquo;, which is currently being finalised by my Department.  By increasing labour market supports, and through the provision of employment supports, activation and skills opportunities, the Pathways to Work strategy will act as a key delivery mechanism of the Economic Recovery Plan&rsquo;s second pillar &lsquo;Helping People Back into Work&rsquo;. <\/p><p>Under this Strategy, in order to meet the increased demand for activation and labour market support as a result of the of the pandemic, the capacity of the Public Employment Service will be significantly expanded.  Additionally, new innovative digital channels of delivery will improve efficiencies and complement existing face to face engagement in employment service delivery in the post-COVID labour market. <\/p><p>Among the key activation measures outlined under the Economic Recovery Plan and Pathways to Work is the new paid Work Placement Experience Programme.  Individuals out of work for at least six months will be eligible for the scheme, regardless of age and time spent on the PUP and other activation programmes is counted towards eligibility.  This programme, which has a target of 10,000 participants by end-2022, will seek to encourage businesses to provide jobseekers with the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market and to help break the vicious circle of &ldquo;no job without experience, no experience without a job&rdquo;.<\/p><p>While this Pathways to Work strategy will include measures to address the challenges arising as a result of the pandemic, the strategy will also focus on those groups unemployed and most distant from the labour market pre-pandemic, such as lone parents, disadvantaged young people, people with disabilities and members of the Traveller and Roma communities.<\/p><p>Given the impact of the pandemic on young people, my Department is also supporting targeted supports for young persons, to help them to regain their footing in the labour market.  Under Pathways to Work, this will include a new Government Youth Employment Charter for intensive engagement with young jobseekers, building on the EU&rsquo;s new Reinforced Youth Guarantee and expanding the JobsPlus scheme to 8,000 places, enhancing the incentive to recruit young jobseekers in particular.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100078#WRH03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":361,"content":"<p>Question No. 138 answered with Question No. 124.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":362,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100078#WRH03300"},{"type":"question","counter":363,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[35358\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100078#WRH03400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of applications for rent supplement for 2020 and to date in 2021.","asker":"1514","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":364,"content":"<p>Rent supplement continues to play a key role in supporting families and individuals in private rented accommodation, with the scheme supporting 18,851 active recipients at the end of May 2021. <\/p><p>The scheme provides short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.

My Department offers a range of income supports to self-employed people, including: jobseeker's benefit (self-employed); the option of applying for a means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance instead depending on their personal circumstances; the pandemic unemployment payment; facilitating self-employed workers who are in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment and who are seeking to maintain their business, to earn up to &euro;960 over an eight week period while maintaining their full payment entitlement; the enhanced illness benefit payment of &euro;350 per week where they have been medically diagnosed with Covid-19 or have been medically advised to self-isolate or restrict their movements; the back to work enterprise allowance scheme which offers support to people who are long-term unemployed and who are interested in self-employment as a route to entering the labour market - this allowance is payable to self-employed workers for up to a 24-month period from the commencement of their new business, and the once-off enterprise support grant of up to &euro;1,000 to assist with the costs associated with reopening a business following the imposition of Covid-19 related restrictions.  In addition, my Department's employment support services are available to self-employed people on a voluntary basis through their local Intreo Centre.<\/p><p>With respect to the categorisation of self-employed workers, my Department&rsquo;s social welfare inspectorate carry out, as part of their duties, employer investigations to ensure compliance with social insurance law and employment status investigations form part of this work.  The approach to addressing potential false self-employment includes the setting up of a new team of inspectors in late 2019 to focus entirely on detecting and investigating such practices.

To date, payments of over &euro;3.61 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;590 million have been granted to 50,100 employers in respect of some 592,000 workers.<\/p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware from announcements made on Tuesday 1st June, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of December 2021.<\/p>  <p>  With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy. It is therefore appropriate that key business supports should remain in place until the end of December 2021.<\/p>  <p>  As the revised plan is implemented, the EWSS will play an important role in getting people back to work as public health restrictions are eased, thereby reducing the numbers dependent on social welfare payments over time, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).<\/p>  <p>  For Q3 2021, the Government has decided to broadly maintain the status quo for EWSS, including the enhanced rates of support, with a modification to widen eligibility, and maintaining the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI of 0.5%.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has approved the extension of the EWSS for Q4 2021, however, it is considered too early as yet to prescribe the precise operational parameters of the scheme that should apply for that quarter. Decisions in that regard will be taken closer to the time, possibly around the end of August\/early September, with the benefit of more up-to-date information on a number of variables, including the overall epidemiological situation, progress made in reopening all sectors of the economy, the vaccine efficacy, as well as the operation of the EWSS during the early parts of Q3. As such, no decisions have yet been taken on any changes to the scheme for Q4 2021.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that, as the recovery gains further momentum, supports are further recalibrated in the longer-term interests of businesses that are in receipt of those supports and in the interests of the wider body of taxpayers. As such and as already signalled, for Q4, consideration will be given to a future change to EWSS which will require an employer contribution towards employee wages. This possible change is being signalled now to provide sufficient notice to businesses in respect of same. Such a move, if it were to be introduced, could have the effect of testing the viability of businesses to the extent that they would be required to make a contribution against the background of a reduced overall subsidy from the State under the EWSS.<\/p>  <p>  No decisions have been taken as yet as regards the EWSS beyond December 2021.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, for those businesses who may need additional support during this period, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS) which has been extended, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme. I also announced on 1st June a new additional business support scheme (Business Resumption Support Scheme or BRSS) for businesses with reduced turnover as a result of public health restrictions to be implemented in September 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100082#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":550,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[35596\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100082#WRM00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that some travel agents have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that under the reopening of non-essential retail that they no longer qualify for the Covid restrictions support scheme despite not being able to trade due to non-essential travel (details supplied); his plans to address this anomaly; if it will be ensured that travel agents under such circumstances will remain eligible for the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":551,"content":"<p>The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan. <\/p>  <p>  Details of CRSS were published in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website.<\/p>  <p>  The CRSS applies to businesses carrying on trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, which requires the business to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises and as a result, is operating at less than 25% of turnover in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  It is not sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19.  The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or significantly restrict access to its business premises.  This means that in the case of a travel agent that operates from a business premises, they may qualify for support under the scheme provided they meet all the eligibility criteria, including the requirement that customers are either prohibited, or significantly restricted, from accessing their business premises under the public health regulations.<\/p>  <p>  As non-essential retail, including travel agent businesses, were permitted to open from 17 May 2021, they are no longer subject to Covid restrictions which would require them to prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises.  Therefore, from that date, they ceased to qualify for support under the CRSS. However, subject to meeting the relevant criteria, a business such as a travel agent business, reopening after a period of restrictions, may claim a &ldquo;restart week payment&rdquo; under the CRSS scheme to assist it with the costs of reopening. <\/p>  <p>  For businesses reopening between 29 April 2021 and 1 June 2021, an &ldquo;enhanced restart week payment&rdquo; may be claimed, which is computed at double the normal weekly CRSS rate, for two weeks, subject to a maximum weekly amount payable of &euro;5,000.<\/p>  <p>  On 1 June, I announced that an additional business support scheme, the Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS), would be available for businesses whose turnover in the period from 1 September 2020 to 31 August 2021 is reduced by 75% compared with their 2019 turnover.  To qualify under the scheme, a business must carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D.  The BRSS will come into operation from early September.  Under the scheme, a qualifying business will be able to claim a cash payment calculated as three times the sum of 10% of their average weekly turnover up to &euro;20,000 and 5% on any excess of average weekly turnover above &euro;20,000, subject to a maximum payment under the scheme of &euro;15,000.<\/p>  <p>  Companies and self-employed individuals may be entitled to support under other measures put in place by Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). Businesses may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with my Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100082#WRM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Availability","counter":552,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100082#WRM01100"},{"type":"question","counter":553,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[35600\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100082#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the volume of SBCI lending to SMEs through the retail banks for each of the years 2015 to 2020, by financial institution in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":554,"content":"<p>The purpose of the SBCI is to deliver effective financial supports to Irish SMEs to address gaps and potential failures in the Irish SME finance market as well as encouraging competition and innovation and facilitating the efficient and effective use of EU resources and financial instruments.

As part of that funding, on Tuesday 15 June I announced the allocations for the &euro;25 million live performance support scheme (LPSS 2021).  I was delighted to be in a position to fund 237 successful applications under this scheme, the details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The scheme opened for applications on 19 March 2021. <\/p><p>There was a very high level of interest in this scheme, with over 400 applications received by the closing date 14 April requesting funding in excess of &euro;80 million. The scheme was operated by my Department and all applications were assessed and scored.  Given the available funding of &euro;25 million, difficult decisions had to be made and it was not possible to award grants to everyone who applied. The funding available under this scheme has now been fully allocated. LPSS 2021 builds on the successful pilot Live Performance Support Scheme in 2020, which provided thousands of days of employment to hundreds of musicians, actors, crew and technicians in tandem with a pipeline of high quality on-line much needed entertainment for Irish audiences. The 237 grants awarded will help to support employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public.<\/p><p>While there are no plans at present for a further round of the scheme, the <i>Economic Recovery Plan <\/i>published on 1 June stated that Government also recognises that as long as physical distancing remains a public health requirement, further supports may be needed for these sectors.  In that context, supports are kept under review in light of developments in public health guidance.<\/p><p>I have also made an allocation of &euro;14 million available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.  The main features of this new scheme will see support offered by way of three levels of flat payments:<\/p><p>- &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 - &euro;50,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;3,000 incurred from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021.<\/p><p>- &euro;4,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;50,001- &euro;100,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;6,000 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021.<\/p><p>- &euro;5,000 for businesses with VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;7,500 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021.<\/p><p>Under the scheme, self employed businesses including musicians, singers, lighting and sound crew and audio  equipment suppliers operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector are eligible to apply. Applications may be made via the MEBAS application portal on my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>I have also made an allocation of &euro;5 million available to local authorities for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.  This will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers.  This funding will be allocated shortly.<\/p><p>In addition, I have announced an additional &euro;11.5m for a new Events Sector Covid Support Scheme which I hope to launch soon.

The extension of the transitional period originally prescribed by Section 38(b) of the 2009 Act (3 years) by the aforementioned 2011 Act (extending the period to 12 years) relates simply to the period when a claim to a prescriptive right can be made by reliance on the 'old' law replaced by the 2009 Act.  From 2021, reliance must be made on the 'new' law introduced by the 2009 Act; in particular, reliance must be made on the new single and shorter period of 12 years.  There is no question of a cut-off point occurring in 2021 when a claim to a prescriptive right can no longer be made.  All that changes in 2021 is the basis on which the prescriptive right can be claimed.<\/p>  <p>  2. The new procedure for registration of a prescriptive right introduced by Section 41 of the 2011 Act is not subject to a time limit.  It is a permanent procedure and, in particular, does not cease to be available in 2021.  The only change which occurs in 2021 is the basis on which an application must be made to the PRA.  As pointed out in (1) above, from 2021, the application will have to be grounded on the 'new' law introduced by the 2009 Act and reliance on the 'old' law repealed by that Act will cease to be possible.<\/p>  <p>  This procedure is only for easements (including rights of way) acquired by prescription.  If all parties agree to the registration of an easement, an application should be made by lodging the appropriate Deed of Grant.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, a Practice Direction Easements and Profits &agrave; Prendre Acquired by Prescription under Section 49A and an informational video are available on the PRA&rsquo;s website (www.prai.ie) that cover the process relating to the registration of prescriptive easements. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100082#WRM03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":579,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100082#WRM03800"},{"type":"question","counter":580,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[35426\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100082#WRM03900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the details of all guidelines and policy directives issued to An Bord Plean&aacute;la under sections 28 and 29 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) since 2020, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":581,"content":"<p>Details of guidelines and policy directives issued to all planning authorities, including An Bord Plean&aacute;la, by my Department under Sections 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, since 1 January 2020 are set out in the Table below.

All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations and responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations rests with the relevant local authority.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has made significant Exchequer funding available to local authorities in recent years, with the result that the number of minimum standards inspections undertaken more than doubled from 19,645 in 2017 to 40,728 in 2019, with a similar increase in the number of properties becoming compliant from 3,329 to 7,206. In order to assist local authorities increase inspection rates further and strengthen compliance, an increased budget of &euro;10 million is being made available this year. However pandemic restrictions have severely impacted on both inspections and enforcement activity since March 2020.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the pandemic some local authorities have been piloting virtual inspections. Dublin City Council have led this initiative, which entails landlords receiving a checklist for self-assessment and being required to submit photographic\/video evidence by email, tenants being invited to raise any non-compliance issues they are aware of and to confirm if the landlord&rsquo;s checklist answers are correct, and the Council reserving the right to conduct a physical on-site inspection when it is safe to do so. <\/p>  <p>  While virtual inspection systems present certain challenges and limitations, they do offer a way of improving the standard of rental accommodation despite the pandemic. My Department is encouraging local authorities not involved in the pilots to consider adopting them and providing Exchequer funding to those that do. <\/p>  <p>  Annual data in respect of the level of minimum standards inspections carried out by each local authority is available on my Department's website at www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/da3fe-private-housing-market-statistics\/.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, landlords as persons having control over premises have responsibilities to ensure fire safety on those premises. Fire Authorities have powers of inspection and enforcement.  Fire Services are independent in exercising their functions under the Fire Services Acts. My Department does not have specific information regarding inspection and enforcement in rented properties.  Fire safety in all properties, especially dwellings is of importance.  My Department has published  a range of guidance on fire safety in houses and flats, be they rented or owner occupied, which are available on my Department's website.  Central to this is having working smoke alarms, testing them weekly, dealing with obvious dangers such as smoking materials, and having an escape plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100082#WRM05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":594,"content":"<p>Question No. 222 answered with Question No. 221.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","counter":595,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100082#WRM05400"},{"type":"question","counter":596,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[35593\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100082#WRM05500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if local authorities can use their discretion to look upon a housing applicant&rsquo;s pandemic unemployment payment as temporary and be in compliance with the terms as set out in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1517","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":597,"content":"<p>Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended.<\/p>  <p>  The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.

Reports of suspected cases have been followed up and carcasses submitted to DAFM&rsquo;s Regional Veterinary Laboratories for testing. Although dedicated surveys have not been possible, the available evidence suggests that RHD2 remains primarily a disease of rabbits, with some limited spill-over into hares. Furthermore, the total number of reports has declined noticeably in 2021.

The School Completion Programme is one of the key supports available in DEIS schools to support attendance, participation and retention of learners.  The enrolment threshold for the allocation of an additional deputy principal in DEIS post-primary schools, was also reduced from 700 to 600 students.<\/p>  <p>  Responding to specific actions in the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS), a 2 year pilot project has been established to target attendance, participation and school completion in specific Traveller and Roma Communities regionally.

The programmes are available to all primary and post primary free education schools, and aims to support pupils to re-engage with education, to build their confidence and increase their motivation, promote wellbeing and for some who are at key transition stages, help to ensure they can move on to their planned educational placement next September along with their peers. Under this expansion of the summer programme, students with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage will have access to an enhanced summer programme of education. The total funding available to provide the programme is up to &euro;40 million, a one hundred per cent increase on the allocation for summer provision in 2020. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100083#WRN05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Welfare Service","counter":653,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100083#WRN05300"},{"type":"question","counter":654,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[35403\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100083#WRN05400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the planning in place to support students due to sit the 2022 leaving certificate; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1519","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":655,"content":"<p>My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. From 11 January 2021, all students, including students currently in fifth year and who are due to sit the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2022, engaged in a programme of remote learning with their schools. Students in fifth year were prioritised for a return to school following the return of sixth year students.<\/p>  <p>  The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils\/students in a COVID-19 context.  These are available at www.gov.ie\/backtoschool.<\/p>  <p>  The nature of distance learning, which was necessitated during the unprecedented closure of schools last year and early this year, required educators to take on a range of approaches to support their pupils&rsquo; continuity of learning during that period. Assisted by Department-funded resources and supports, schools and teachers demonstrated great innovation in adapting to the unprecedented situation including the use of digital technologies and online learning platforms for teaching and learning.  <\/p>  <p>  Extensive guidance and supports have been and continue to be made available by my Department and its support services to support schools to plan for the transition to online and remote learning. Circular 0074\/2020, &lsquo;Communication\/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform&rsquo;, was issued by the Department last year.  In accordance with the circular, it became a requirement for all schools to have in place a communication\/learning platform (while acknowledging that many schools have already put such platforms in place) that supports them to respond in the event of a partial or full school closure in the future, including the facilitation of some use of live or recorded video lessons where practicable.<\/p>  <p>  The circular includes links to a range of materials and supports developed by the Digital Technologies team of the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), including information and resources for commonly used platforms for teaching, learning and assessment,  short video tutorials exploring how digital platforms and tools can be used effectively for remote learning purposes and clarity regarding how chosen platforms can be effectively used for assessment and feedback purposes, links to each of which are shown.<\/p>  <p>Other documents published by my Department include Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education and Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers  . These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning. A number of adjustments were made to the assessment arrangements for the 2021 Leaving Certificate examinations to take account of the disruption to learning experienced by the students who are due to take these examinations.<\/p>  <p>  However, I am conscious that students who are due to take their Leaving Certificate examinations in 2022 have experienced a degree of disruption to their learning.<\/p>  <p>Yesterday, the Advisory Group on Planning for State Examinations received an update in relation to the 2022 Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations. I announced that the level of adjustment to the assessment arrangements for the 2022 Leaving Certificate Examination cohort would be broadly the same as that applied by the Assessment Arrangements for Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021,   as set in December 2020.  There arrangements were announced before the second period of school closures. Minor changes will be made to that document to reflect syllabus content specific the 2022 examinations. The revised document will be published later this month.<\/p>  <p>  I also announced yesterday that the State Examinations Commission (SEC) will run an alternative set of Leaving Certificate Examinations in 2022, shortly following the main set of examinations.  The SEC will set out the eligibility conditions for these examinations, which will be limited to certain students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations due to close family bereavement, COVID-19 illness during those examinations, and certain other categories of serious illness, to be clearly and strictly delineated.    The SEC will issue further details regarding these examinations, with all arrangements guided by prevailing public health advice.

It sets out a shared vision articulated as the basis, which will guide further work on specific areas for developments, such as, senior cycle programmes and pathways, curriculum specifications and assessment.

This decision was taken by government to ensure for every candidate in 2021, a method to assess their learning and attainment at the end of their post-primary education, and to progress to higher and further education, and the world of work.<\/p>  <p>  The written examinations began on 9 June and ran until 17 June in the case of Leaving Certificate Applied and 29 June in the case of Leaving Certificate (established).<\/p>  <p>  Candidates were provided with the choice of sitting the examinations, opting to receive Accredited Grades or both on a subject by subject basis. This dual process, believed to be unique in the world, was put in place following consultation with stakeholders in response to the disrupted learning experienced by the class of 2021 during the periods of school closures in 2020 and 2021. <\/p>  <p>  In any subject where a candidate sits the examination and opts to receive an Accredited Grade, they will be credited with the better of the two results.<\/p>  <p>  The results this year are expected to issue on Friday 3 September through the Candidate Self Service Portal. The results issue date this year must take account of both the examinations marking process and the Accredited Grades process operating in parallel and being brought together at the end to issue to candidates.  To ensure the accuracy and the integrity of the results being provided to candidates, sufficient time must be allowed not only in the parallel operation of both of these complex processes but also in the integration of the results to ensure that candidates are provided with a set of examinations results that comprises, based on their individual options on a subject by subject basis, examination results, Accredited Grades or the better of the two.<\/p>  <p>  A range of checking and robust quality assurance procedures apply to the resulting and grading processes for the examination results and Accredited Grades focussed on maintaining data integrity and on identifying and reconciling candidate information.  Given the robust quality assurance checks associated with the resulting process and in the integration of both the Accredited Grades and written examinations, It is of vital importance that the processes are given sufficient time to execute to the highest standards.  <\/p>  <p>  Candidates&rsquo; results will be transferred to the CAO at the earliest opportunity to facilitate the generation of offers to CAO applicants.  The CAO have announced that Round 1 offers will be made on 7 September. <\/p>  <p>  For those Leaving Certificate candidates who have applied to pursue their higher education in UK Universities, the UCAS deadline for acceptance of conditional offers is 8 September 2021. <\/p>  <p>  In 2020, along with the UK, countries such as the Netherlands, Denmark, Poland and Hungary showed flexibility in working with the Department to accommodate Irish students, when results issued on 7 September 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has already been engaged with these countries, and this engagement continues. Both Departments will continue their work to ensure that the same flexibility will be extended to the 2021 Leaving Certificate candidates. I have also written to my ministerial colleagues in other jurisdictions seeking their support in this matter.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important that candidates who have applied for places in universities and colleges outside of Ireland should engage with the institutions to which they have applied as early as possible to notify them of the results date and to confirm their position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100084#WRO01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":676,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100084#WRO01700"},{"type":"question","counter":677,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[35513\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100084#WRO01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to staff shortages affecting the July provision in a school (details supplied); if a solution will be provided; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":678,"content":"<p>I am aware of the school referred to and the issue raised.

In addition, there has been a three point reduction in the retention schedule, which will assist schools that would otherwise be at risk of losing teaching posts.

Moreover, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact on our youth is driven by the tendency for many younger people to work in some of the sectors most severely impacted by the pandemic: namely, the hospitality (accommodation &amp;amp; food) and retail sectors.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the pandemic, the seasonally adjusted youth unemployment rate (15-24 year olds) stood at just under 12% in December 2019. Latest estimates from the CSO, however, indicate that the traditional unemployment rate for young persons stood at 20.1 percent for young people in May. This estimate excludes those in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). When all those in receipt of the PUP are included, this gives a COVID-19 adjusted unemployment rate estimate of 58.8 percent for young people at the end of May.<\/p>  <p>  A significant number of PUP recipients are students. As of last week (June 22nd 2021), it is estimated that just under 27,000 PUP recipients are students, with the vast majority under the age of 25. Using international measures of unemployment, set by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), students are generally not counted as unemployed, as they are not considered part of the labour force. Therefore, the inclusion of PUP recipients, including students, in the COVID-19 adjusted measure of youth unemployment serves to inflate this measure. <\/p>  <p>  While the employment of young people has been significantly affected by the pandemic, we also know from past recessions that they are also the most resilient, with youth unemployment levels typically falling quite quickly once economic activity resumes. Many have already returned to work, and others will continue to return to their previous employment, as public health restrictions continue to ease. <\/p>  <p>  However, others will require assistance and support to return to employment, reskill and to find new jobs. As a consequence, my Department is supporting a range of initiatives to assist people, including young people, back to work.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined under the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Economic Recovery Plan&rsquo;, which was launched on June 1st 2021, a central focus of the recovery process will be on helping people get back to work, training or education by extending labour market supports,  and through intense activation and skills opportunities. Pathways to Work 2021-2025 will be a key delivery mechanism of the Economic Recovery Plan&rsquo;s second Pillar on &lsquo;Helping People Back into Work&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  In supporting people back into employment &ndash; including young people &ndash; the Pathways to Work 2021&ndash;2025 strategy will seek to minimise any long-term scarring effects of the pandemic on the labour force for those whose jobs are permanently lost while providing support to those unemployed pre-pandemic. The strategy will also set out how an expanded Public Employment Service will utilise its existing and expanded capacity to deliver effective services in a post-COVID labour market with an overall target of increasing the caseload capacity by 100,000 per annum.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the key supports for young people that will form part of Pathways to Work and the Economic Recovery Plan include:<\/p>  <p>  - Expanding the JobsPlus scheme to 8,000 places and enhancing the incentive to recruit young jobseekers in particular, by increasing the youth age limit from 25 to 30 years.<\/p>  <p>  - Accelerating rollout of an additional 50,000 education and training places to support jobseekers to upskill and reskill for the labour market.<\/p>  <p>  - A new Government Youth Employment Charter for intensive engagement with young jobseeker which will build on the new EU Reinforced Youth Guarantee.<\/p>  <p>  - A new work placement scheme which is open to all regardless of age, but should be particularly attractive to and beneficial for young people, not in education, requiring work experience.<\/p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the Further Education and Training sector to provide access to training, upskilling and reskilling opportunities. The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science also last week announced the extension of the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme until the end of December 2021. This scheme provides financial supports for employers who register apprentices to a national apprenticeship. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 was launched in April by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. It sets out a five-year strategy to deliver on the Programme for Government commitment of reaching 10,000 new apprentice registrations per year by 2025. The plan provides a roadmap to a single apprenticeship system and new supports for employers and apprentices, which will prove attractive for young people.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100085#WRP04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment","counter":769,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100085#WRP04800"},{"type":"question","counter":770,"qnumday":283,"qnumall":"[32281\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100085#WRP04900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will increase expenditure on the pandemic unemployment payment if further Covid-19 restrictions are required.","asker":"1520","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":771,"content":"<p>The Pandemic Unemployment Payment, or PUP, was introduced as an emergency measure to support qualifying employees and the self-employed who lost employment due to Government mandated public health restrictions.  <\/p><p>To date expenditure on the scheme is over &euro;8 billion and just under 900,000 people have benefitted from the scheme.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household. <\/p>  <p>  The Fuel Allowance is an important measure that assists pensioners and other welfare dependent householders to address income deficiency, especially during the winter when a household faces increased heating needs.  The duration of the scheme is designed to coincide with the coldest periods of the year and it is for this reason the scheme runs from October to mid-April.  <\/p>  <p>  The household benefits package (HHB) comprises the electricity or gas allowance, and the free television licence.  The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain long-term welfare payments such as invalidity pension, carer's allowance, disability allowance, blind pension and incapacity supplement. <\/p>  <p>  In order to support vulnerable households during the initial COVID-19 emergency, financial resources at that time allowed for the 2019\/20 fuel season to be extended by four weeks for existing eligible customers on a once-off basis.  While I fully understand that these are difficult times for many people, especially for the vulnerable and the elderly, any further economic measures, such as extending the 2020\/21 fuel allowance season, can only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.  In this regard, the Deputy will appreciate the scale of support provided throughout the pandemic with over &euro;8 Billion spent on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment alone to date. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, the Government targeted one third of carbon tax revenues to go towards boosting the incomes of the poorest in our society.  Based on ESRI research, three key DSP payments were targeted for increases in the budget as a result - the Fuel Allowance, the Qualified Child Allowance and the Living Alone Allowance.  Accordingly, with effect from January 2021, I increased the Fuel Allowance by &euro;3.50 per week to &euro;28 for a period of 28 weeks, while the increase in carbon tax on solid fuels will not take effect until May 2021.  This ensured that recipients benefitted from the increased payment over the winter period.  <\/p>  <p>  The full year cost of the Fuel Allowance would be &euro;541.6 million approximately in 2021 if it was provided for the full year to the 372,000 eligible households.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs Payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100086#WRQ03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":814,"qnumday":297,"qnumall":"[35636\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100086#WRQ04000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of the research being carried out in association with an organisation (details supplied) into the cost of bereavement.","asker":"1560","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":815,"content":"<p>In Budget 2020, a budget of &euro;60,000 was provided to support the Irish Hospice Foundation (IHF) in carrying out a research project into funeral poverty in Ireland.<\/p><p>This independent research by the IHF is to examine how bereavement affects people, particularly the economic impact of death.

The scheme provides financial incentives to private sector employers to hire people with a disability for between 21 and 39 subsidised hours per week under a contract of employment. The basic rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour giving a total annual subsidy available of &euro;10,748 per annum based on a 39 hour week. The subsidy rate is not linked to the statutory minimum wage - it is a contribution paid to the employer, subject to certain conditions, against the cost incurred where a productivity shortfall arises from a disability. <\/p><p>The financial supports for employers are structured under three separate strands and companies could benefit under one strand or under two or three strands simultaneously depending on the number of people with a disability employed, as below: <\/p><p>Strand I is a general subsidy for any perceived productivity shortfall in excess of 20% for a person with a disability, in comparison to a colleague without a disability. The subsidy is based on the number of hours worked. <\/p><p>Strand II subsidy is payable when an employer employs three or more people with disabilities who are supported by a Wage Subsidy Scheme Strand I payment. Strand II is intended to cover the additional supervisory, management and other work-based costs relating to such employees. This top-up payment is a percentage of the Strand I subsidy and is  based on the overall number of employees with a disability employed under Strand I. It ranges from an additional 10% of wage subsidy for 3 to 6 employees with a disability to a maximum of 50% of wage subsidy for 23+ employees with a disability. Therefore, when an employer has 23 or more Wage Subsidy Scheme employees a 50% top-up is applied to the hourly rate increasing the payment rate to &euro;7.95 per hour for each employee. <table>    <tr>       <th>Nos.<\/th>       <th>%<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>3 to 6 employees with a disability <\/td>       <td>10% top-up of wage subsidy paid<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>7 to 11 employees with a disability <\/td>       <td>20% top-up of wage subsidy paid<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>12 to 16 employees with a disability <\/td>       <td>30% top-up of wage subsidy paid<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>17 to 22 employees with a disability <\/td>       <td>40% top-up of wage subsidy paid<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>23 + employees with a disability <\/td>       <td>50% top-up of wage subsidy paid<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>Strand III subsidy enables employers who employ 25 or more workers with a disability on the Wage Subsidy Scheme to be eligible for a grant of up to &euro;30,000 per year towards the expense of employing an Employment Assistance Officer to support these employees.<\/p><p>The total cost in a full year to set the rate of the Wage Subsidy at 55%, 60% and 65% of the national minimum wage are set out in tabular form below. <\/p><p>The figures below are based on the following:<\/p><p>- The current number of 1,602 private sector employers availing of the subsidy in respect of some 2,539 participant employees.

Research from my Department has shown that young persons make up a significant share of the workers in those sectors most impacted by the pandemic and associated public health restrictions, namely hospitality (accommodation &amp;amp; food) and retail, which has contributed to a rise in the youth unemployment rate since the onset of the pandemic. <\/p><p>Prior to the pandemic, the seasonally adjusted youth unemployment rate (15-24 year olds) stood at just under 12 percent in December 2019. Latest estimates from the CSO, however, indicate that the traditional unemployment rate for young persons stood at 19.9 percent for young people in June. This estimate excludes those in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). When all those in receipt of the PUP are included, this gives a COVID-19 adjusted unemployment rate estimate of 44.2 percent. This represents a substantial decline from the COVID-19 adjusted unemployment rate of 58.8 percent for young people at the end of May.<\/p><p>In addition, a significant number of PUP recipients are students. As of this week (June 29<sup>th<\/sup>2021), it is estimated that just under 24,000 PUP recipients are students, with 86 percent (20,350) of these under the age of 25. Using international measures of unemployment, set by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), students are generally not counted as unemployed, as they are not considered part of the labour force. Therefore, the inclusion of PUP recipients, including students, in the COVID-19 adjusted measure of youth unemployment serves to inflate this measure. <\/p><p>For these reasons, it is at present not possible to say what the precise level of youth unemployment is.<\/p><p>While the employment of young people has been significantly affected by the pandemic, we also know from past recessions that they are also the most resilient, with youth unemployment levels typically falling quite quickly once economic activity resumes. Many have already returned to work, and others will continue to return to their previous employment, as public health restrictions continue to ease. This is reflected in the significant decline in the number of people in receipt of the PUP, including among young persons. <\/p><p>Between the 1<sup>st<\/sup>and 29<sup>th<\/sup>of June, PUP claims by young persons under the age of 25 declined by close to 35 percent as the economic recovery progressed.

However, we must also be aware that some jobs will be permanently lost as a result of the pandemic.

This strategy, which is currently being finalised for launch in the coming weeks, will seek to support people back into employment and will include a range of measures targeted at young persons; including an expanded JobsPlus recruitment subsidy scheme, an additional 50,000 education and training places, a new Government Youth Employment Charter and a new work placement scheme which is open to all regardless of age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100087#WRR01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Labour Market","counter":850,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100087#WRR01400"},{"type":"question","counter":851,"qnumday":309,"qnumall":"[35716\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100087#WRR01500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the extent to which she foresees an improvement culminating in a drop in unemployment levels in all age cohorts as we approach quarter four in 2021; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":852,"content":"<p>Prior to the pandemic, the unemployment rate in Q4 2019 stood at approximately 4.5 percent.

However, this estimate excludes those in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). When all those in receipt of the PUP are included, this gives a COVID-19 adjusted unemployment rate estimate of 18.3 percent at the end of June.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of the effective rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme and consequent easing of public health restrictions, a significant share of those temporarily displaced by the pandemic have been able to return to work in recent weeks. This is reflected in the month-on-month reduction in COVID-19 adjusted unemployment figures since the peak of Level 5 restrictions in February 2021. Since the 2021 peak in PUP recipients in February at over 485,000, the number of individuals supported by the payment has reduced by over 53 percent, currently standing at just below 228,000 as of June 29th 2021.<\/p>  <p>  As restrictions continue to ease in the coming weeks and months, I expect numbers in receipt of the PUP, and in turn the COVID-19 adjusted unemployment rate, to continue to fall steadily as more people return to work. This anticipated trend is supported by the most recent unemployment forecasts from both the Department of Finance in their Stability Programme Update (April 2021) and the latest Quarterly Economic Commentary from the ESRI (June 2021).<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Finance estimate an unemployment rate of just over 11 per cent by Q4 2021, while the ESRI forecast is more optimistic, anticipating unemployment to be closer to 9 percent by year end, driven by an expected strong increase in domestic sources of growth. Both of these sets of forecasts are predicated on the successful rollout of the vaccine programme and a continued, and more permanent, easing of public health restrictions over the course of the year.<\/p>  <p>  While neither the Department of Finance nor the ESRI provide unemployment forecasts by age cohort, I am acutely aware that the pandemic has not been felt equally across all groups. Younger workers (under the age of 25) have been particularly affected as they typically make up a significant share of the workers in those sectors most impacted by the pandemic and associated public health restrictions, namely hospitality (accommodation &amp;amp; food) and retail. <\/p>  <p>  While a reduction has been seen in all age cohorts in receipt of the PUP since the recent reopening of these sectors, the largest reduction has been in the numbers of younger workers. Over the past week, the number of PUP claims attributable to young persons has fallen by 6,000 cases. These reductions are reflected in the latest COVID-19 adjusted youth unemployment rate which for June stands at 44.2 percent, a sharp reduction from the May figure of 58.8 percent.<\/p>  <p>  Given the broad reopening planned for all sectors of the economy over the coming months, I anticipate that the forecast reductions in unemployment will be spread across all age groups.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that additional numbers of persons will require assistance and support to return to employment, reskill and to find new jobs. The Government is committed to supporting a range of initiatives to assist people back to work as outlined under the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Economic Recovery Plan&rsquo;. The Plan sets out a jobs-lead recovery by supporting sectors and workers most impacted by the pandemic, with an overall ambition of exceeding pre-crisis employment levels by the end of 2024.<\/p>  <p>  Central to achieving this objective will be the Government&rsquo;s forthcoming national employment services strategy, &lsquo;Pathways to Work 2021-2025&rsquo;, which is currently being finalised by my Department. By increasing labour market supports, and through the provision of employment supports, activation and skills opportunities, the Pathways to Work strategy will act as a key delivery mechanism of the Economic Recovery Plan&rsquo;s second pillar &lsquo;Helping People Back into Work&rsquo;. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100087#WRR01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":853,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100087#WRR01700"},{"type":"question","counter":854,"qnumday":310,"qnumall":"[35717\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100087#WRR01800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the extent to which exceptional needs payments have been availed of in the past 12 months by various applicants in terms of age profile; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":855,"content":"<p>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, my Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.

This includes cross border agencies such as InterTradeIreland. This group acts an important vehicle in ensuring a co-ordinated response to the labour market impacts of both Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic, and is supported by the group&rsquo;s regional counterparts. My Department is also represented on the Cross Border EURES Partnership Steering Committee, whose principal aim is to support labour market mobility along the border. <\/p>  <p>  My Departmental officials work with their counterparts in the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland and officials in the Divisional management teams work with their colleagues in Northern Ireland on a regular basis to provide employer information sessions and to host various jobseeker events. <\/p>  <p>  Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, employment opportunities nationwide have been curtailed as a result of public health restrictions which has limited business activity. This has impacted on all regions, including the Border counties. <\/p>  <p>  In recent months, with the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme and consequent easing of public health restrictions, more persons have been returning to work.

This survey is conducted by Pobal on behalf of the Department.<\/p><p>Data from the Early Years Sector Profile report indicates that nationally, 4690 services were contracted to provide at least one of the four DCEDIY funding programmes in 2019\/2020. This represents an increase of 2%, from 4,598 in 2018\/19. Of these services, 1214 (26%) were community services, while 3476 (74%) were private services. <\/p><p>Early Years Sector Profile data is also available by urban\/rural breakdown, and at a Local Authority level. Of the national total, 65% (3,070) of services were located in urban areas and 35% (1,620) were located in rural areas (see Table 1). Notably, 61% of services in rural areas were smaller services, catering for 40 children or less.  Conversely, of larger services catering for over 100 children, 72% were located in urban areas.  The highest number of services, 450, was recorded in Dublin city, with the smallest number of services, 38, in Longford. A breakdown of community and private services can be found in Table 2. According to data from the 2019\/2020 report, Kildare had the sixth highest number of services nationally, with a total of 199 services, of which 11 were community services, while 188 were private services.<\/p><p>Owing to the impact of COVID-19 on services, capacity figures for services are not available for 2019\/2020. However, figures from previous years would suggest that nationally, supply currently meets demand, while acknowledging that some pockets of undersupply exist. In 2018\/19 the overall estimated capacity was 218,745, representing an increase of 2% from the previous year. Local authority level data for Kildare evidences an increase of 17% in reported capacity between 2017\/2018 and 2018\/2019.  Local authority level capacity data is provided in Table 3. <\/p><p>The number of vacant places increased by 13% in 2018\/2019 to an estimated 12,444. The vacancy rate in 2018\/19 was 6%, an increase of one percentage point from last year. The recorded vacancy rate in Kildare was 6% in 2018\/2019, matching the national average rate.  In 2018\/2019 the settings in rural areas had a higher vacancy rate of 9%, compared to 5% of those in urban areas. In addition, the share of vacant places in urban services decreased from 57% in 2017\/2018 to 55% this year.<\/p><p>A key policy objective of my Department is to improve affordability, accessibility and quality of Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC). A 141% increase in investment over the last number of years has led to a doubling in the number of children receiving free or subsidised early learning and care and school-age childcare. It has also supported the sector to increase the number of places available.<\/p><p>In previous years the creation of new places and new services were prioritised in the Department's capital programmes. Many community facilities, and some private facilities, were built using public investment through the major capital investment programmes, Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (2000-2006) and the National Childcare Investment Programme (2006-2011).  Since then, annual capital programmes have provided investment for establishment of new provision, expansion of services, quality improvements and maintenance and upgrades to existing facilities. The Department&rsquo;s capital programmes have increased capacity in the sector by 27,433 places nationally since 2015.<\/p><p>First 5, the ten-year strategy for babies, young children and their families commits to 'maintain and extend the supply of high-quality publicly subsidised early learning and childcare to best serve the developmental needs of babies and young children, ensuring that it also reflects the needs and preferences of parents and families'. To deliver on this strategic action, a range of actions are under way, including the development of a strategic capital investment plan to deliver large-scale capital investment under Project 2040, and the development of a new funding model for ELC and SAC.<\/p><p>An Expert Group has been convened to examine the current model of funding and its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services. The Expert Group will recommend how additional resourcing can be delivered for the sector to achieve these objectives, drawing on international practice in this area. It is expected that a report on the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations on the new Funding Model will be submitted to me in November.

It should be noted the Play and Recreation fund, and the criteria applied for accessing funding, represents my Department&rsquo;s contribution to the funding of new and refurbished play and recreation facilities accessible for all children and young people. Local Authorities are ultimately responsible for ensuring that all of their investment in this area provides facilities that are accessible to all children and young people in their respective communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100087#WRR06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":898,"content":"<p>Question No. 325 answered with Question No. 317.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":899,"content":"<p>Question No. 326 answered with Question No. 317.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":900,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100088#WRS00400"},{"type":"question","counter":901,"qnumday":327,"qnumall":"[35755\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100088#WRS00500","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the number of persons in direct provision; the number of these living in independent living units with facilities to cook their own food; if an open and fair complaints procedure has been put in place; the other reforms carried out to the system in the past year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":902,"content":"<p>As of Sunday 27 June 2020 there were 6465 persons being accommodated by the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department. Of this number 70.6% (4564) are being accommodated in centres that provide independent living facilities that include cooking facilities and 33.38% (2158) have own-door access to their accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I have now published a &ldquo;White Paper to End Direct Provision and to establish a new International Protection Support Service&rdquo;. The White Paper sets out a new Government policy to establish a new International Protection Support Service which I envision will be fully operational by December 2024.<\/p>  <p>  As we transition to the new system, in order to meet our legal obligations to provide accommodation and other support services for protection applicants, existing accommodation centres will continue to operate in the short to medium term; as such my Department currently utilises a mixture of state owned, commercial and temporary emergency accommodation centres. <\/p>  <p>  The past year has seen a number of changes implemented by my Department as we work towards improving the facilities available in all dedicated accommodation centres to allow for greater independence for residents, allowing them to cook for themselves and have more family spaces. It is expected that, in the coming years, all families will be in some form of own-door accommodation that will meet their needs better than the current congregated accommodation.   <\/p>  <p>  There is an open and fair complaints procedure set out in the House Rules &amp;amp; Procedures Booklet for International Protection applicants. Complaints are made initially to the centre manager with a view to informal resolution.  If the person concerned is not satisfied with the outcome of their complaint, he or she may make a complaint to IPAS who will investigate the matter and take action as appropriate.  In the event that a resident is not satisfied with how his or her complaint is dealt with, he or she has full access to the services of the Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children.  In addition, a new dedicated Customer Services Team has also been recently been established in IPAS and, as well as strengthening the existing resident complaints system, this team will be taking a more proactive approach to dealing with residents' issues, actively engaging with residents through customer feedback mechanisms and focus groups in the months ahead.  <\/p>  <p>  A confidential Freephone telephone support service was also introduced last year to provide further support to all residents. The Freephone helpline is operated by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS).  If a resident wishes, a complaint made through this service may be passed, in confidence, to IPAS for investigation and resolution.  <\/p>  <p>  A Vulnerability Assessment process is currently being piloted by the IPAS. The pilot commenced in December 2020 and was extended to all new applicants for international protection from the beginning of February. The purpose of these assessments is to determine if, by virtue of a particular category of vulnerability, an applicant is deemed to have special reception needs, what those needs are and what actions are required to address those needs. IPAS assess the vulnerability of everyone who makes an application for international protection to the International Protection Office (IPO). Where an application includes children of an applicant, IPAS also assess their vulnerability in an appropriate manner. <\/p>  <p>  A new Resident Welfare Team has been established which is a multi-disciplinary team with officials seconded from the HSE, Tusla and the Department of Education and focuses on case management of  residents identified as particularly vulnerable. IPAS is also currently reviewing all of its operational policies to identify areas where there may still be gaps in terms of formally outlining how we meet the needs of our very diverse range of customers.  A new IPAS website is expected to go live in early July and all operational policies developed to date will be published on that website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100088#WRS00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Protection","counter":903,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100088#WRS00700"},{"type":"question","counter":904,"qnumday":328,"qnumall":"[35764\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100088#WRS00800","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the accommodation arrangements made for applicants for international protection in County Galway who are working as front-line workers during the Covid-19 pandemic; if he is satisfied that this accommodation is suitable to them taking into account the work they are doing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":905,"content":"<p>The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic presented challenges to maintaining the health and safety of residents living within International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) as it did for the country as a whole.  <\/p><p>In order to safeguard our residents, specific measures were put in place by IPAS in close collaboration with the HSE from the outset of the pandemic.

The processing of personal data for marketing and profiling purposes takes place under the so-called &ldquo;legitimate interests&rdquo; ground in Article 6.1(f) of the GDPR, with the case law of the European Court of Justice underlining the importance of free movement of personal data and establishing that Member States are not permitted to impose additional conditions that would have the effect of amending the scope of any of the grounds now set out in Article 6.1 of the GDPR. <\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Attorney General has also advised my Department that section 30 of the 2018 Act appears to go beyond the margin of discretion afforded to Member States in giving further effect to the GDPR and would conflict with Article 6(1) (f), read alongside Recital (47). <\/p>  <p>  Put simply, it is not an option for a Member State to unilaterally prohibit a category of processing activities which might otherwise be lawful under Article 6.1(f).  The commencement of section 30 could, therefore, give rise to a substantial risk of infringement proceedings against the State pursuant to Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission has also confirmed that processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest and that Article 6(1) (f) of the GDPR does not make the processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of direct marketing unlawful. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission also indicated that subject to Article 22 (automated decision-making), processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of profiling is not generally prohibited, albeit the processing must take into account that children merit specific protection as clarified in recital (38). <\/p>  <p>  Moreover, the Commission have indicated that the term \"micro-targeting\", as referenced in Section 30 of the Act, is not mentioned in the GDPR, as such its scope remains uncertain and undefined.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from this apparent conflict with the GDPR, the Office of the Attorney General has advised that section 30 gives rise to difficulties under Article 38.1 of the Constitution and under Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 38.1 provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law. In order for a domestic offence provision to comply with Article 38.1, it must be clear, precise and foreseeable in its application.  It is not clear under section 30 what might constitute the processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of micro-targeting.  It is also a requirement under Article 7 of the Convention that offence provisions must be sufficiently clear and precise so as to enable individuals to ascertain which conduct constitutes a criminal offence and to foresee the consequences of engaging in such conduct. <\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are keeping this specific issue under review. The Deputy will also appreciate that my Department has no role in the wider regulation of advertising or broadcasting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100088#WRS03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Applications","counter":927,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100088#WRS03100"},{"type":"question","counter":928,"qnumday":336,"qnumall":"[35429\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100088#WRS03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when an application for citizenship by a person (details supplied) will be determined.","asker":"1620","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":929,"content":"<p>An application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy on 10 March 2021.<\/p>  <p>  This application for naturalisation continues to be processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision in due course. <\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.

Prisoners can also request Hepatitis C screening through their local Prison Healthcare Team at any stage of their time in custody.  All prisoners who are actively engaged with addiction services are routinely screened as per the advice of the Addiction Counsellor\/Clinical Addiction Team. <\/p>  <p>  The information received as part of this process is recorded on the prisoner&rsquo;s individual medical record on the Prison Healthcare Management System and provides prison healthcare management with significant medical information on the prisoners in their care and allows for the development of an individual healthcare plan for the prisoner while in custody. Medical treatment is provided, if clinically indicated, including treatment for Hepatitis C.  At present, this treatment is available to those who are identified as requiring it and is arranged by Prison Healthcare Staff supported by specialist colleagues from the Acute Hospital Sector.<\/p>  <p>  While medical information, including details of the results of Hepatitis C screening, is held on the individual prisoner record, the system does not allow for centralised reporting of a particular medical condition.  Steps are being taken to review how this data is compiled and the aim of the Prison Service is to have this completed by the end of 2022.   <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, the Irish Prison Service partnered with an EU project (HepCare Europe) to enhance screening for populations at risk of Hepatitis C infection, and specifically implemented an enhanced Hepatitis C screening programme at Mountjoy Prison in collaboration with the Mater Hospital. The initiative aimed to improve access to, and effectiveness of, Hepatitis C treatment and to support patients through treatment. The programme consisted of an initial nurse-led screening programme. A total of 422 (78% of the study population) participated in the study.<\/p>  <p>  This study reported that approximately one in five prisoners had evidence of a previous infection and that the main risk for Hepatitis C infection was intra-venous drug use. Once detected, patients with Hepatitis C infection were offered treatment with new direct-acting antivirals as this can reduce their viral load dramatically as well as the risk of secondary infections, extent of liver damage and the need for liver transplantation. <\/p>  <p>  The reporting of Hepatitis C infection in prisoners in this way allows for the estimation of the true levels of active Hepatitis C infection, the monitoring of treatment outcomes and rates of re-infection. Identifying risk factors for Hepatitis C infection allows for targeted prevention, screening and treatment strategies. Combined they allow for the informed planning and implementation of national and international Hepatitis C strategies. <\/p>  <p>  The Prison Service is continuing its engagement with the HSE and developing plans for the implementation of a GP led community model of care for the screening and management of Hepatitis C across the prison estate, in line with the National Hepatitis C Strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100089#WRT01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":970,"content":"<p>Question No. 350 answered with Question No. 349.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":971,"content":"<p>Question No. 351 answered with Question No. 337.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Family Law Cases","counter":972,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100089#WRT01900"},{"type":"question","counter":973,"qnumday":352,"qnumall":"[35707\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100089#WRT02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if her plans to reform the family  law court system can ensure that in future family law cases are held in local courts to facilitate the families concerned; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":974,"qnumday":353,"qnumall":"[35708\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100089#WRT02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will work with family and victim support organisations to provide an alternative to the planned system of regional family courts; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":975,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 352 and 353 together.<\/p>  <p>  Family law reform is a major element of the Justice Plan 2021.

Garda&iacute; will be best placed to advise how to proceed in these circumstances, and also address any safety concerns they might have.<\/p>  <p>  Alternatively, they can contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by using the Garda Confidential Line (Tel: 1800 666 111) which provides a ready means of reporting crimes anonymously to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that there is legislation in place to combat harassment. 'Coco's Law', also referred to as the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act, entered into force on 10 February 2021. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to creating new offences to address the sending of, or threatening to send, intimate images without the consent, the Act also updated the existing harassment legislation. It broadened the scope of the offence of harassment which now covers all forms of persistent communications about a person and has increased the penalty from seven to 10 years to reflect the harm that can be caused by the most serious forms of harassment.<\/p>  <p>  The Act also provides for a new offence of sending, distributing or publishing a threatening or grossly offensive message by any means of communication with intent to cause harm to the victim. This offence covers once-off harmful communications, as distinct from harassment which requires persistence. This offence carries a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine and\/or 2 years&rsquo; imprisonment. <\/p>  <p>  The new legislation is intentionally silent about the types of technology that may be used to commit the offences so as to cover all forms of online and offline communications that cause harm to a victim.<\/p>  <p>  Again I would urge anyone who believes they have been the victim of a criminal offence to report the matter to the Garda&iacute;. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100089#WRT02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Service","counter":980,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100089#WRT02700"},{"type":"question","counter":981,"qnumday":355,"qnumall":"[35758\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100089#WRT02800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when she plans to publish the three-day monitoring report on operations in the D&oacute;chas centre submitted to her office in August 2020; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":982,"qnumday":356,"qnumall":"[35759\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100089#WRT02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the investigation report under section 31(2) of the Prisons Act 2007 that was due to be submitted to her by the Office of the Prison Inspectorate in December 2020; if she has received this report yet; if so, when it will be published; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":983,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 355 and 356 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Office of the Inspector of Prisons is a statutory body, independent in its work, set up under the Prisons Act 2007. <\/p><p>The section 31(2) report referred to by the Deputy has not yet been furnished to me by the Inspector of Prisons.

Following our discussion, a variety of measures have been initiated by CORU in order to reduce timeframes, including a programme for increased frequency of regulatory decision making, additional temporary staff resources, and the recruitment of additional assessors and the development of parallel processing.

The GMHS Nurse led asymptomatic screening service has also been re-instated, following the recent HSE cyber attack. <\/p>  <p>  The closure of the GMHS in 2020 resulted from the pressures arising from the Covid-19 pandemic and related primarily to the necessary redeployment of increasing numbers of personnel to diverse COVID-19 related duties. Staff in the Gay Men&rsquo;s Health Service (GMHS) were reassigned, by reason of necessity, to other HSE services.  Following the GMHS closure, significant efforts were made to maintain service provision through other locations, including the GUIDE Clinic in St. James&rsquo; Hospital. <\/p>  <p>  Prior to the pandemic, the GMHS was staffed by 97% agency staff; this is no longer the case. Funding for the PrEP programme allowed pro-rata recurring funding to be allocated to GMHS in 2020. As a result of pandemic related pressures on staffing, recruitment in 2020 initially focused on the services required to support the Covid-19 pandemic. However, a recruitment campaign to fill the posts for the GMHS PrEP programme commenced in the latter part of 2020 and is progressing well, with the recruitment of additional nurses underway. IT improvements have also been put in place.<\/p>  <p>  HSE Community Healthcare East advises that they have made every effort to restore, and maintain services as far as is possible, given current pandemic related pressures on resources. It should be noted that, in order to ensure compliance with HSE Covid-19 safety measures, capacity at clinics is somewhat reduced, in order to maintain adherence to social distancing protocols.<\/p>  <p>  The GMHS will continue to reinstate services on a phased basis and in line with the HSE's Safe Return to Work Guide. Officials from the Department of Health and HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme are in regular contact with CHO6 in order to monitor progress. <\/p>  <p>  The GMHS website is updated regularly, and provides full details of services available, as these are reinstated. It is hoped that GMHS services can be delivered to their full potential and developed further, once pandemic related constraints on health service capacity as a whole can be safely reduced.<\/p>  <p>  As this Parliamentary Question relates to an operational issue, it is a matter for the HSE.

Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents.  Under these regulations the person in charge shall ensure that in so far as is reasonably practicable, visits to a resident are not restricted, unless such a visit would, in the opinion of the person in charge, pose a risk to the resident concerned or to another resident, or the resident concerned has requested the restriction of visits.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre published new visiting guidance on 23rd April, which came into effect on 4th May. This provides additional opportunities for residents in long-term residential care facilities to receive visits and participate in social and recreational outings.  Residents may now be facilitated to receive four routine visits per week. This will be possible following two weeks after the full vaccination of approximately 8 out of 10 of all residents in the nursing home. In the absence of a high level of vaccination of residents, two visits per week should be facilitated unless there are critical or compassionate circumstances that require increased frequency of visiting.<\/p>  <p>  A copy of the latest guidance can be accessed at www.hpsc.ie.  As noted by the HPSC, restrictions on visiting should only be applied on the basis of the relevant guidance and a documented risk assessment that is reviewed regularly in view of the evolving public health situation and new guidance. Visiting by the resident to a private home outside of their nursing home is also possible and should comply with public health restrictions that apply to the general public at the time. <\/p>  <p>  Although the situation in nursing homes has greatly improved, the risk associated with COVID-19 remains very real. There is still a risk of introduction of infection, including the possibility of a new variant of COVID-19, against which the vaccine may be less effective. Therefore, caution remains appropriate. At all times vigilance on the general infection prevention and control measures must be maintained and public health advice must continue to be followed, including when visiting, to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect those living in our communities.<\/p>  <p>  I have written to HIQA and all nursing home providers to emphasise the need to ensure visits take place to the greatest extent possible in line with the new guidance. I have also encouraged providers to communicate frequently and clearly with residents and families on the matter of visiting.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to reassure the Deputy that the guidance will be kept under continuing review as new evidence and data emerge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100092#WRW01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"question","counter":1154,"qnumday":413,"qnumall":"[28839\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100092#WRW01975","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the nursing home temporary assistance payment scheme; his plans to continue the scheme and support nursing homes in acting to suppress and manage Covid-19; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1155,"content":"<p>Awaiting reply from Department.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":1156,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100092#WRW02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1157,"qnumday":414,"qnumall":"[28840\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100092#WRW02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the vaccination options that are available for those who are housebound and unable to travel to their general practitioner or local vaccination centre and do not meet the criterion of being over 70 years of age in order to receive vaccination by the National Ambulance Service; the steps that will be taken in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1158,"content":"<p>As this Parliamentary Question relates to an operational issue, it is a matter for the HSE.

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020. On the 23rd of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. <\/p><p>On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the NIAC and my Department , following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.). <\/p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by: <\/p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most; <\/p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country; <\/p><p>- improving transparency and fairness. <\/p><p>Further details are available here: <\/p><p>www.gov.ie\/en\/press-release\/93f8f-minister-donnelly-announces-update-to-irelands-vaccination-prioritisation-list<\/p><p>The HSE will begin the process of rollout vaccination to those living in direct provision this week.

With regard to disability services, day services re-opened at 39% capacity at service locations throughout August and early September of 2020, and by end of January 2021 this had increased to 51%. The combination of supports in the location, outreach supports, and remote supports provides an overall quantum of support to service users of over 60% at the end of January. The increase in day service capacity was supported by additional funding of &euro;30 million provided in Budget 2021 to increase capacity in buildings and provide extra staff. This funding provided an increase in day services by an average of one day a week for 14,940 people against September 2020 service levels.<\/p>  <p>  For the duration of the COVID-19 emergency day service capacity is reduced, this is due to the physical limitations of the buildings available, the lack of mainstream community activities, and the continued restrictions imposed by social distancing guidance. Many people with disabilities have underlying health conditions, and as the threat of COVID-19 remains, unfortunately so too does the need for these restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  The vaccination process for staff and service users is well underway across day services, and all service providers should now be delivering a minimum of 60% of pre-COVID levels of location-based supports. For those in residential services, currently their day service supports are largely being provided in their residence, however some service users have returned to their day service location, and it is now expected that all residential service users that received their day service at a location pre-COVID should begin to resume location-based day service supports.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is in the process of establishing the vaccination status of all staff and service users in day services. Once established, the HSE will engage with Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) on what further easing of restrictions can appropriately be applied to day services. Those attending day services have been vaccinated as part of cohort 4, people aged 16-69 years and at very high risk of severe COVID-19 disease. The administration of the second vaccine dose for this cohort began in the week beginning May 10th and is expected to be complete by early July.<\/p>  <p>  The IPC guidance are kept under constant review and updates will be provided in the months ahead on further restoration of day services.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to older person's services; day centres are fundamental to the health and well-being of our older population and play a key role in enabling older people to live independently in their own communities. The pandemic and associated restrictions has had a profound impact across society and especially for our older population.  <\/p>  <p>  All Community Health Organisations through the National Older Persons Office were requested in April 2021 to provide information on the status of their Day Care Services in order to ascertain the level of service that could resume on receipt of updated public health guidance.  As a result, it was intended that approximately 100 day centres would re-open week beginning 5 July. It was also intended that an additional 55 centres would resume in July and August, with a further 90 centres that require works expected to reopen before the end of the year.   It was indicated that these dates may be subject to change as the HSE continues to deal with the significant challenge of the on-going cyber attack.  <\/p>  <p>  Since then updated Public Health guidance to support the re-opening of Day Care Services for Older People was provided in June 2021 to facilitate re-opening plans. Following on from this a further information request issued to HSE Services to obtain an update on re-opening plans. Their responses are currently being analysed and further detail regarding the re-opening of services is expected imminently and it is intended that the re-opening of centres will commence this month.<\/p>  <p>  A Day Care Focus Group which was established in 2020 will remain in place (representative of both HSE and voluntary sector) to oversee the resumption of day care services and provide feedback in relation to both service delivery and users of the services.<\/p>  <p>  While services may have to operate at a reduced capacity, initially, this is a huge step forward in the resumption of day centres for older people. It follows extensive planning by the HSE and has been made possible by the advanced stage and positive impact of the COVID-19 vaccination programme among our older population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100093#WRX05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Abortion Services","counter":1257,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100093#WRX05400"},{"type":"question","counter":1258,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[29105\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100093#WRX05500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the scheduled three-year review of the operation of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 will be conducted independently of his Department and the HSE; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1259,"content":"<p>The Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 was signed into law on 20 December 2018 and commenced on 1 January 2019.

The new guidance provides additional opportunities for residents in long-term residential care facilities to receive visits and participate in social and recreational outings. Residents may now be facilitated to receive four routine visits per week. This is possible following two weeks after the full vaccination of approximately 8 out of 10 of all residents in the nursing home. In the absence of a high level of vaccination of residents, two visits per week should be facilitated unless there are critical or compassionate circumstances that require<i><\/i>increased frequency of visiting.<\/p><p>Residents in nursing homes may be facilitated to partake in social and recreational outings, subject to risk assessment by the Person in Charge and a high level of vaccination in the nursing home. All outings and activities should continue to fully align and comply with the wider public health measures in place at the given time. In particular, residents and visitors should continue to observe social distancing, practice good hand hygiene and cough etiquette, and wear face coverings in public spaces.<\/p><p>Visiting by the resident to a private home outside of their nursing home is also possible and should comply with public health restrictions that apply to the general public at the time.  <\/p><p>Outdoor visiting where safe distance can be maintained is low risk and can be facilitated at all times. Outdoor visits will require suitable facilities; capacity to accommodate and support the visit and the visits will also generally need to be arranged in advance.<\/p><p>At all times, regardless of vaccination status, residents must be accommodated when they have essential business to conduct. This includes a visit to the post office, bank, legal services or critical personal requirements, such as that related to the death of a family member or a visit to a family grave. A copy of the latest guidance can be accessed at www.hpsc.ie  <\/p><p>Although the situation in nursing homes has greatly improved, the risk associated with COVID-19 remains very real. There is still a risk of introduction of infection, including the possibility of a new variant of COVID-19, against which the vaccine may be less effective. Therefore, caution remains appropriate. At all times vigilance on the general infection prevention and control measures must be maintained and public health advice must continue to be followed, including when visiting, to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect those living in our communities.<\/p><p>I have written to HIQA and all nursing home providers to emphasise the need to ensure visits take place to the greatest extent possible, in line with the guidance.

It is therefore not open to Irish authorities to grant a marketing authorisation for orphan medicines outside of this framework. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Health Act and the national framework agreed with industry, a company must submit an application to the HSE to have a new medicine added to the reimbursement list. <\/p>  <p>  Reimbursement is for licensed indications which have been granted marketing authorisation by the EMA or the Health Products Regulatory Authority. <\/p>  <p>  In making a reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach reimbursement decisions on all medicines, including orphan drugs, in as timely a manner as possible. However, it must ensure that the best possible price is achieved, as these commitments often represent multi-million-euro investments on an ongoing basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process. The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible, but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced in a viable and sustainable manner. <\/p>  <p>  While the 2013 Health Act does not include provision for a different ruleset when assessing orphan drugs, the HSE seeks as far as possible to take into account issues such as the small patient numbers and the nature of the condition to be treated when evaluating these medicines.  The criteria that apply to the evaluation process allow sufficient scope for the HSE to take on board the particular circumstances that pertain to orphan drugs and rare diseases. <\/p>  <p>  There has been a number of key changes in the HSE assessment process of medicines within the confines of the 2013 Health Act.  These have included changes to the HSE Drugs Group, whose membership has been expanded to include representatives from the National Patients Forum and more clinical expertise in the area of rare diseases. <\/p>  <p>  In June 2018, the HSE Leadership appointed a Technology Review Committee for Rare Diseases (RDTRC) which is responsible for: <\/p>  <p>  1) reviewing proposals received from industry or expert groups in Ireland for funding of new products for rare diseases including orphan drugs, or expanded indications for existing products for rare diseases and making recommendations as to the implementation of the relevant recommendations from the National Rare Diseases Plan 2011-2018; and <\/p>  <p>  2) providing contributions to the development of clinical guidelines for relevant Orphan Medicinal Products (OMPs) and supporting the implementation of guidelines in conjunction with the National Drugs Management Programme Office where applicable.<\/p>  <p>  The Committee&rsquo;s recommendations for reimbursement of OMPs are not intended to replace any part of the existing medicines appraisal or reimbursement process but rather complement it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100095#WRZ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":1349,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100095#WRZ00425"},{"type":"question","counter":1350,"qnumday":480,"qnumall":"[29227\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100095#WRZ00450","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when it is expected that the standard, quality and accessibility to mental health services is likely to be improved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1351,"content":"<p>Awaiting reply from Department.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Healthcare Policy","counter":1352,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100095#WRZ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1353,"qnumday":481,"qnumall":"[29228\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100095#WRZ00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the degree to which the administration of health services is moving towards the provisions set out in Sl&aacute;intecare; the expenditure to date arising therefrom; the expenditure proposals for the remainder of 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1354,"content":"<p>The vision of Sl&aacute;intecare is to achieve a universal single-tier health and social care system, where everyone has equitable access to services based on need, and not ability to pay and to deliver safe, quality health and social care services that meet the needs of our growing population, and attracts and retains the very best healthcare clinicians, managers, and staff.<\/p>  <p>  Considerable progress has been made in moving from vision to reality.

The pandemic and associated restrictions has had a profound impact across society and especially for our older population.  <\/p>  <p>  All Community Health Organisations through the National Older Persons Office were requested in April 2021 to provide information on the status of their Day Care Services in order to ascertain the level of service that could resume on receipt of updated public health guidance.  As a result, it was intended that approximately 100 day centres would re-open week beginning 5 July. It was also intended that an additional 55 centres would resume in July and August, with a further 90 centres that require works expected to reopen before the end of the year.   It was indicated that these dates may be subject to change as the HSE continues to deal with the significant challenge of the on-going cyber attack.  <\/p>  <p>  Since then updated Public Health guidance to support the re-opening of Day Care Services for Older People was provided in June 2021 to facilitate re-opening plans. Following on from this a further information request issued to HSE Services to obtain an update on re-opening plans. Their responses are currently being analysed and further detail regarding the re-opening of services is expected imminently and it is intended that the re-opening of centres will commence this month.<\/p>  <p>  A Day Care Focus Group which was established in 2020 will remain in place (representative of both HSE and voluntary sector) to oversee the resumption of day care services and provide feedback in relation to both service delivery and users of the services.<\/p>  <p>  While services may have to operate at a reduced capacity, initially, this is a huge step forward in the resumption of day centres for older people. It follows extensive planning by the HSE and has been made possible by the advanced stage and positive impact of the COVID-19 vaccination programme among our older population. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100095#WRZ04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":1394,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100095#WRZ04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1395,"qnumday":495,"qnumall":"[29270\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070100095#WRZ04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to recruit more clinical psychologists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1396,"content":"<p>The 2021 National Service Plan recognised the need for an unprecedented expansion of the permanent health workforce through permanent appointments.
