It comes at the end of an enforcement process, during which a provider is afforded fair procedure, and generally provided with several opportunities to rectify matters and meet regulatory requirements. Tusla does not take the decision lightly and generally does so because of persistent and serious non-compliance with the Regulations. While there is a right of appeal to the District Court within 21 days, the services will be required to close after the notice period. <\/p>  <p>  The safety and protection of children remains the first priority of the regulator and indeed of Government. Safety and protection is assured through the enforcement of regulations which have children at the heart of their implementation. <\/p>  <p>  I have great sympathy for parents who, due to de-registration of their cr&egrave;che, now need to find alternative childcare options. This comes in addition to the distress they may already be experiencing due to the poor standards uncovered. Their distress is further exacerbated where access to alternative services is limited or indeed absent. <\/p>  <p>  Where a service is removed from the register, City and County Childcare Committees are available to support parents who need help finding alternative provision. In the case of current de-registrations in central Dublin, officials in my Department have been liaising closely with Dublin City Childcare Committee and Fingal County Childcare Committee, to offer supports to parents who will be affected by the closures. Both Childcare Committees have operated extended opening hours to support parents who need help finding alternative provision. <\/p>  <p>  Both Childcare Committees have also been actively seeking to support the development of alternative childcare options in the locality, either through the development of new services, or the expansion of existing services. Tusla has also agreed to fast-track any applications received from providers to increase capacity in the area. <\/p>  <p>  I would like to encourage providers to consider expansion given apparent demand in the area and the fact that demand may continue to increase with the introduction last month of the National Childcare Scheme and other measures being taken by Government.<\/p>  <p>  It will not be a comfort to the parents affected in this case, but capacity in the sector has doubled in the last 5 years, and continues to rise. My Department is actively seeking to increase capacity even further, through a range of measures including its annual capital funding scheme. In 2019, I provided &euro;5.9m towards the creation of new places within the Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare sector. I hope to announce details for a new 2020 capital scheme in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Childminders are also an option that parents may consider and Childminding Ireland is available to provide information to parents on potential childminding places. My Department has recently been consulting on a Draft Childminding Action Plan. Once the plan is finalised, reforms will commence that should see more childminders being available to offer places and to deliver Government schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000060#WRB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Services Provision","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000060#WRB00700"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[51482\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000060#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the appeals process arising from the decision made following the submission of expressions of interest by Galway city, county and the islands for the development of a comprehensive domestic violence outreach service; the status of the appeals process; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":28,"content":"<p>In 2019, I was pleased to be in a position to provide Tusla, the Child and Family Agency with &euro;1.5 million in additional funding for the provision of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services.<\/p><p>This funding allowed 12 additional domestic violence outreach workers to be employed in areas of need in counties Carlow, Cork, Dublin, Galway and Wicklow.<\/p><p>Following an extensive needs analysis project by Tusla, carried out with local stakeholders, areas of County Galway were identified as requiring access to additional services.

The new Scheme will change this. <\/p><p>At a broad and simplified level, the NCS's maximum subsidy rates compare very well overall with existing targeted scheme subsidy rates, while acknowledging that the schemes do not lend themselves to easy comparison.<\/p><p>The NCS is based on the principle of progressive universalism &ndash; providing a level of support to all families while providing additional targeted support to families with lower incomes.

The Tusla Early Years Inspectorate liaises with Local Authority fire services where appropriate.  <\/p><p>The suitability and safety of premises is a key concern in the assessment of quality provision for children in early learning and care settings. Section 58G of the Child Care Act, 1991 (as amended by Part 12 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013) places an onus on the providers of early years services to ensure that they take all reasonable measures to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of children. <\/p><p>In August 2019, Tusla issued guidance for the registered providers of early years services on the fire and planning requirements for the re-registration and change in circumstances process, which is available for download on the Tusla website. It is important to note that these were not new Regulations, but guidance on the submission of documentation for the purpose of re-registration.<\/p><p>Registration of Early Learning and Care settings is granted where Tusla is satisfied that the premises, operation and location of the setting poses no unmanaged risk to children. <\/p><p>In recognition of the difficulties many providers were experiencing in completing re-registration, Tusla decided to revise the time-line for submission of some supporting documentation for re-registration.

The extended deadline of 30th June 2020 for providing supporting documentation will allow providers to access the relevant professionals and get the required documentation in place.<\/p><p>While the health and safety of children is the primary concern in decisions on the regulation of early learning and care services, I recognise that a balanced approach to the re-registration process is required, given difficulties some providers have experienced in completing their applications. In that context, I fully support Tusla&rsquo;s decision.<\/p><p>The importance of addressing fire safety concerns cannot be underestimated. In recognition of this, my Department awarded &euro;330,000 of capital funding to community-based, non-profit services in 2019.

An Independent Strategic Review of MONUSCO was conducted in 2019 ahead of the renewal of its mandate in December 2019. <\/p>  <p>  A large humanitarian community is also present in DRC but given the scale of humanitarian needs, scarce resources, and the long standing structural drivers of instability, humanitarian actors are experiencing difficulties in reacting to emergencies. <\/p>  <p>  During this year, WHO has documented approximately 390 attacks on health facilities, leading to ten killed and 83 injured. In recent weeks the number of security incidents in DRC has increased significantly, especially in parts of the east of the country. WHO has evacuated 173 staff from Biakato Mines and Mangina.  <\/p>  <p>  Since the start of November the increasingly active conflict between the FARDC, the national army, and the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) has led to the deaths of an estimated 100 people in the Beni region with thousands of others displaced. Recently, protests took place in Beni and in Butembo as communities affected by severe violence engaged in demonstrations. On 25 November, a crowd marched to the camp of MONUSCO in Beni to protest against the latest fatal attack by the ADF, in which eight people died, and the failure of the UN and government troops to prevent the attack. Protesters torched a building on the UN base and the town hall in Beni.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2019, Ireland provided &euro;7.8 million in development and humanitarian assistance to UN and NGO partners in DRC, including &euro;2 million to WHO in response to the Ebola outbreak. Ireland continues to work with EU and its Member States to address the humanitarian situation and the drivers of poverty and conflict in DRC.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000063#WRE01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Israeli Settlements","counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000063#WRE01500"},{"type":"question","counter":174,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[51218\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000063#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on reports of plans for new settlements in Hebron; the actions he will take in view of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":175,"content":"<p>Ireland's position on settlement expansion, related infrastructure development, the demolition of Palestinian homes and other buildings, and the forced removal of Palestinians from their homes, is extremely clear. Settlements are illegal under international law, and all actions which compromise the viability of a future Palestinian state are very damaging. Such unilateral actions further diminish the prospects for successful negotiations and an end to the conflict, something which I firmly believe is in the best interests of both Israelis and Palestinians. <\/p>  <p>  Last week I made my fourth visit to Israel and Palestine as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I held meetings with a range of senior political figures, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Israel Katz. I very clearly conveyed Ireland&rsquo;s unequivocal position on the illegality of settlements and on the harmful effects of settlement expansion. I also discussed settlement activity in my meetings with Palestinian leaders, including President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the reports to which the Deputy refers, on plans for new settlement construction in Hebron. Any further settlement expansion in Hebron would be deeply regrettable, and would be likely to accentuate tensions in an already fragile situation. This is particularly the case following the Israeli Government&rsquo;s decision earlier this year not to renew the mandate of the Temporary International Presence in Hebron, which had played an important role in preventing violence.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to convey our concerns on related developments on the ground in all relevant international fora, as well as directly with the Israeli authorities. Ireland and the EU stand by the internationally agreed parameters for a negotiated peace agreement and continue to urge the Israeli Government to uphold its international legal obligations, including under the Fourth Geneva Convention, on the treatment of a civilian population. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000063#WRE01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid","counter":176,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000063#WRE01800"},{"type":"question","counter":177,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[51237\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000063#WRE01900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of the new initiative on sexual and reproductive health and rights promised in A Better World; when the initiative will be launched; the level of funding to be allocated for its implementation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1309","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":178,"content":"<p>In February 2019, the Government launched Ireland&rsquo;s new international development policy, A Better World.

This was my fourth visit to Israel and Palestine as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I met with key representatives of the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as well as UN officials from UNRWA, UNTSO and OHCHR, as well as visiting an Israeli community close to Gaza.<\/p>  <p>  The political leaders I met with on the Israeli side included Prime Minister Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Katz. On the Palestinian side, my meetings included President Mahmoud Abbas, Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh and Dr. Saeb Erekat, Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. I also met with the Palestinian Minister for Education, Dr. Marwan Awartani, and signed a memorandum of understanding which outlined Irish support for the Palestinian education sector, and with Minister Mazen Ghuneim, head of the Palestinian Water Authority. In all of these meetings I conveyed the importance the Irish people attach to the resolution of the Middle East Peace Process, something that has been a priority for me personally since I took office. <\/p>  <p>  In my meetings with the Israeli authorities, I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the impact of the continuing occupation, including the situation in Gaza, settlement construction and the demolition of properties in the West Bank and actions taken against Palestinians in East Jerusalem. <\/p>  <p>  I had a frank discussion with Prime Minister Netanyahu about actions taken by Israel over recent years which are jeopardising the viability of a two-state solution and thus the prospect of a just and lasting solution to the conflict. I reiterated the EU&rsquo;s and Ireland&rsquo;s well known views that settlements are illegal under international law and the urgent need to address the unsustainable situation in Gaza. I discussed how Ireland and the EU can play a constructive role in the MEPP, and outlined Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to support efforts towards a just and sustainable peace. I also raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the protection of civil society space. <\/p>  <p>  During my visit to Gaza, I met with secondary school students from an UNRWA school in Jabalia, where I saw first-hand the impact of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to supporting quality education for children, including the 282,000 UNRWA students in Gaza.  I also met with senior UNRWA officials and discussed the humanitarian situation in the Gaza strip and the operational challenges facing the agency. Ireland is a longstanding supporter of UNRWA in its provision of services to Palestinian refugees. I was pleased to announce that Ireland will provide an additional &euro;2.5 million in funding this year to support the delivery of these core services, bringing Ireland&rsquo;s total support to UNRWA in 2019 to &euro;7.5 million.<\/p>  <p>  I also visited the Northern Gaza Emergency Sewage Treatment (NGEST) where I met with Minister Mazen Ghunaim to formally launch Ireland&rsquo;s investment in support of the water sector. Ireland will contribute &euro;8.8 million to a joint project with France to build a 7.5mW solar power plant providing clean, reliable energy to the NGEST wastewater treatment plant.

I witnessed the effects of the blockade, and the effects that this is having on young people's prospects and hopes, leading to a dangerous sense of despair.

Around 6.2 million people are displaced inside Syria, and a further 5.6 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region. After almost nine years of conflict, nearly 12 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, and more than 80 per cent of people live below the poverty line. This year there have been alarming escalations of violence in the north-east and north-west in the country.<\/p><p>In the north-east, the Turkish incursion of October 2019 against Kurdish forces in the border area has severely destabilised the region and undermined the fight against ISIS. Around 75,000 people remain displaced as a result of the unilateral action. Moreover, the potential for conflict remains while Russian, Turkish and Syrian Government troops vie for influence and control. Ireland has issued three statements on the military action, stressing that respect for international humanitarian law and the protection of civilians, especially displaced and vulnerable communities, must be paramount. As a result of the operation, EU Member States have committed to halting arms export to Turkey. <\/p><p>In the north-west of Syria, in the area around Idlib, conflict between armed groups and forces of the Syrian Government, aided by Russia, has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of civilians and the displacement of more than 400,000 people since May. I have publically condemned, on a number of occasions, the violence that is taking place. The airstrikes that are reported to have targeted civilian infrastructure, including medical facilities and schools, are particularly abhorrent and the escalation of hostilities in recent days is very troubling. The EU has called on the Syrian Government and its allies to cease these attacks. Ireland welcomed the announcement, on 1 August, of the establishment of a UN Board of Inquiry to investigate these incidents. <\/p><p>Ireland takes every appropriate opportunity to speak out against human rights abuses and breaches of international humanitarian law in Syria in international fora, including the UN Human Rights Council (HRC). Ireland also strongly supports accountability mechanisms for crimes committed during the war and has contributed &euro;500,000 to the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism (IIIM), established by the UN General Assembly. <\/p><p>The UN is attempting to reach a negotiated solution to the conflict. Ireland welcomes the agreement on the formation of the UN-facilitated Constitutional Committee, which has begun meeting in Geneva<b>.<\/b>It is intended that this Committee will chart the way forward for the country and unlock a broader political process. This will, of course, only be a starting point; reforming the constitution will not, in itself, offer the types of guarantees against persecution which Syrian refugees would need to return home.<\/p><p>It is imperative that Ireland continues to contribute to the humanitarian effort in Syria. Our overall funding supports those in need inside Syria as well as Syrian refugees and vulnerable host communities in the region. In March 2019, Ireland pledged a further &euro;25 million to the crisis, bringing the total amount of humanitarian assistance committed to the Syria crisis to over &euro;143 million since 2012 &ndash; our largest ever response to any single crisis. In November, Ireland supported two projects in areas that have received the highest proportion of displaced persons, including one in north-east Syria. <\/p><p>Humanitarian aid will not solve the conflict, though it is important in mitigating its impact on the millions of innocent victims of the war.  Any sustainable solution to the Syrian conflict requires a genuine political transition. I take this opportunity to reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for the work of the UN Special Envoy and urge all parties to engage with the UN-led process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000063#WRE04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabilities Data","counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000063#WRE04800"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[51656\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000063#WRE04900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if each embassy is fully wheelchair accessible; if not, the embassies that are not fully wheelchair accessible; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":208,"content":"<p>The State&rsquo;s network of diplomatic and consular missions plays a key role in promoting Ireland&rsquo;s political and economic interests and in protecting our citizens abroad.

In this regard, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have any influence over the pricing of insurance products, and neither can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover as this is a commercial matter for insurers.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the <i>Solvency II<\/i>Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules, which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, the Government cannot direct insurance companies to cover certain types of risk, such as those in the culture or leisure sector.  A further constraint is the fact that for constitutional reasons, the Government cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding these constraints, reducing the high cost of insurance generally has been a priority for the Government.  The Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) was established in July 2016 and undertook an examination of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers, businesses and the voluntary and arts sectors.  The CIWG has produced two reports the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance and the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  <\/p><p>Many reforms have been made already including amendments to the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act, and the establishment of National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank of Ireland, however it is clear that the single biggest challenge that still needs to be addressed and which is having the most impact on the culture and leisure sector is the level of awards that exist in Ireland, for relatively minor injuries, as compared to other jurisdictions.  In this regard, the key recommendation arising from both of the CIWG&rsquo;s reports was the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) and the publication of its two reports.  The PIC conducted a benchmarking of award levels between Ireland and other jurisdictions for the first time and this has been very helpful in identifying the scale of the problem that is faced.  This research showed that award levels for soft tissue injuries in Ireland were 4.4 times higher than in England and Wales. The PIC recommended that a Judicial Council be established and that it should compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.  In carrying out this exercise, the PIC believes that the Judiciary will take account of the jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal, the results of its benchmarking exercise, etc.  On foot of this recommendation, the Government with the support of all parties in the Oireachtas prioritised the passing of the <i>Judicial Council Act 2019<\/i>.  This Act provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee upon the formal establishment of the Judicial Council.  This Committee is tasked with introducing new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum. <\/p><p>With regard to the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee and the subsequent publication of its new guidelines to recalibrate award levels and replace the Book of Quantum, it is a matter for the Judiciary to put in motion the necessary process to expedite these.  The first important step in this process was the recent announcement by the Chief Justice of the names of the seven &ldquo;members designate&rdquo; of the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee (PIGC), which will be chaired by Ms Justice Mary Irvine of the Supreme Court.  This is a significant step forward as I believe it is a recognition of the prioritisation that the Judiciary are giving to this issue. <\/p><p>I am hopeful that the creation of personal injury damage guidelines by the Judiciary can result in the lowering of award levels.  Were this to happen, I would expect a lowering of the costs of insurance generally.  In this context, I note the comments made by the Interim Insurance Ireland CEO Gerry Hassett recently that if award levels come down so will premiums.  I believe that this is a very reassuring commitment and it is one the Government intends holding the insurance industry to.<\/p><p>Finally, I wish to reiterate my view that a recalibration of award levels will go a very significant way towards addressing the current problems around the affordability and availability of insurance being experienced by impacted businesses and voluntary groups, including the arts and culture sectors.  I also believe this recalibration in combination with the cumulative effects of the implementation of the two CIWG Reports&rsquo; recommendations will lead to a more competitive insurance market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000064#WRF01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":233,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000064#WRF01900"},{"type":"question","counter":234,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[51290\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000064#WRF02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to reduce the current rate of the life assurance exit tax in order to bring it in line with the rate of DIRT; the reason there is an 8% difference in the two tax bands for savings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":235,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will undoubtedly appreciate, there were minimal changes in taxation in this year's Budget due to the need to take into account the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. <\/p><p>Any changes to align the rate of financial products subject to LAET with DIRT rates has an Exchequer cost. On a post-Budget basis, the estimated full year cost of reducing Life Assurance Exit Tax (LAET) from 41% to 33%, thereby aligning it with Capital Gains Tax (CGT) and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT), is &euro;25 million.

I have spoken to a number of staff about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised. <\/p><p>In Budget 2020 I increased the number of secretaries and caretakers in certain schools, allowing schools with enrolments of 500-625 to fill secretary vacancies provided they have fewer than 1.5 secretaries; schools with enrolments of 626-699 to fill vacancies provided they have fewer than two secretary posts filled, and schools of 700 or more to fill caretaker vacancies provided they have fewer than two caretakers.  These measures will take effect from September 2020.  <\/p><p>Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect<\/p><p>Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  <\/p><p>The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. <\/p><p>On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  <\/p><p>The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. <\/p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendation applies.My Department receives informal correspondence by telephone in respect of grant-funded secretary and caretaker circulars, as regularly occurs with the publication of pay circulars.  Advice is provided on the implementation of the circular and the appropriate steps to take.  Secretaries and Caretakers who have queries regarding the application of the circular should raise queries directly with their individual employer \/ Board of Management.  <\/p><p>In addition, the recent survey of Secretaries and Caretakers has identified some schools that are non-compliant with the provisions of the 2015 Arbitration Agreement, and my Department will be making contact with these schools to remind them of their obligations under the agreement, as implemented through various circulars. The links below will bring you to the most recent circulars in respect of the pay increases under the 2015 Arbitration Agreement.<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.<\/p><p>In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting.

These specifications are informed by extensive research. In addition a broad consultation process, that included the voices of teachers and students, was co-ordinated by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. Similar to the Primary Language Curriculum, the <i>Policy for Gaeltacht Education<\/i>and the actions planned by the Department as part of the <i>20-Year Strategy for Irish<\/i>2010-2030, these specifications seek to promote the provision of high quality education through the medium of Irish and the use of Irish among young people and in Gaeltacht school communities. <\/p><p>The T1 specification seeks to address, in the first instance, those students who study all of their subjects through the medium of Irish and therefore is expected to be delivered in Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute;, Scoileanna Gaeltachta and in Aonaid L&aacute;nGhaeilge. The T2 specification is intended for use in schools that operate through the medium of English. The provision of two separate specifications for the first time means that the teaching and learning experience can be tailored for very different categories of students. In particular, the provision of the T1 specification means that the learning needs of the learners in Gaeltacht schools, particularly the needs of first-language speakers of Irish (and all-Irish schools &ndash; gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute; and gaelscoileanna) can be catered for in ways that were simply not possible under the old arrangements. The provision of the T1 specifications has been widely welcomed by Gaeltacht communities and organisations in supporting the implementation of the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme.  <\/p><p>The introduction of the new specifications for Junior Cycle Irish represents a significant departure from existing approaches to the teaching, learning and assessment of Irish at junior cycle level. The new arrangements emphasise the importance of oral skills in the language for all students and are deliberately designed to foster students&rsquo; ability to use the language. Classroom based assessment of students&rsquo; oral language skills are used widely in other countries as they offer a much more authentic assessment of the students&rsquo; communicative abilities. All of this is designed to strengthen teaching and learning of Irish in junior cycle. <\/p><p>Both specifications (T1 and T2) place significant emphasis on Irish as a spoken language. This is reflected in the integrated strands, which structure the learning experiences of students throughout the three years of junior cycle &ndash; Communicative Competence, Language and Cultural Awareness and Learner&rsquo;s Self-Awareness.  The provision of opportunities for students to speak Irish, including interaction with other users, will be a key aspect of the learning activities in which students will engage in order to achieve the learning outcomes associated with these strands. <\/p><p>The Department remains committed to encouraging the use of spoken Irish. It is important to state that the assessment of oral language skills in Irish forms an integral component of the overall language learning experience and will occur in a number of ways in the new Junior Cycle specifications. In addition to the completion of a range of tasks that will require students to use and demonstrate their oral language skills in order to achieve the stated learning outcomes, oral language skills will also be formally assessed in Classroom-Based Assessment<\/p><p>(CBA) 2, in third year. This task will be linked to ongoing classroom exchanges and, therefore, will be a more authentic reflection of students&rsquo; interests and competence levels in Irish.  Furthermore, students can also include texts that demonstrate their oral language skills in Irish for the purpose of CBA 1 &ndash; Learning Portfolio where it is specified that one portfolio item based on sound\/ video must be included. This could for example, be a presentation, a speech, or a poem. These CBAs will be formally reported upon in each students&rsquo; Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement.  <\/p><p>The previous oral examination was optional and taken by less than one third of students. The new assessment arrangements on the other hand require all students to engage in an assessment of their oral skills through a classroom based assessment.  This gives a greater opportunity for all students to develop and enhance their oral language proficiency skills and to foster their ability to use the Irish language.  <\/p><p>As part of the consultation process during the development of the specifications, much feedback emphasised the lack of choice with the current Junior\/Senior Cycle syllabi as an issue. Many students noted that they have no choice and\/or no voice on what texts to read\/study. The desire to provide students with a choice of more modern, accessible texts, which would afford rich and relevant learning opportunities for students, across a range of genres with due regard to dialect of region (or dialect of choice), was echoed across much of the feedback from teachers, students and stakeholders more generally.<\/p><p>The integration of literature is a central facet of teaching and learning. Students are given opportunities to sample a selection of literature to support their learning over the three years of junior cycle. The development of language skills and the exploration of literary texts should be integrated in the classroom to aid language development. Literature supports the development of language and literacy, critical and creative skills, cultural understandings and personal development.<\/p><p>There is a recommended list of appropriate texts to support learning in first year and a list of compulsory genres with an internal choice of texts for second and third year. These texts are not separate to the teaching of the language but are an integral part of language teaching and will support the development of  students&rsquo; language skills by providing students with appropriate examples of ordinary language in context, and  a range of opportunities to speak and use the language. They are not separate to the teaching of the language but provide important source material and rich learning opportunities for students learning the language.<\/p><p>Sample examination papers are produced by the SEC, in consultation with the Department of Education and Skills (DES) and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), in advance of the first state examinations for any new subject or revised subject specification.  These sample papers are produced as a guide to students, teachers and the public as to the structure and format of the new examination. Like &lsquo;real&rsquo; examinations, they are produced with a high level of oversight and quality assurance to ensure their fitness for purpose.  In addition, sample papers are previewed by subject experts in relation to the appropriateness of their content, the extent to which they are an appropriate assessment of the learning outcomes set out in the relevant specification, the language of their content, and the demand they present in relation to the time it would take to complete them.  <\/p><p>In the case of Junior Cycle Gaeilge, sample papers were recently issued by the SEC to all schools.  One Higher Level paper and one Ordinary Level paper was issued in respect of each of the T1 and T2 specifications. The sample papers highlight the features of the new examination structure and how the examination papers assess the level of student achievement of a significant sample of the learning outcomes contained in the specifications.  To assist students manage their time during the examination, mark allocations are provided for questions and sections, and the spaces for responses to questions are indicative of the length of an appropriate response.  The SEC is satisfied that the structure and content of the Junior Cycle Gaeilge sample papers are in full alignment with the thrust of Junior Cycle Reform, including the learning outcomes contained in the specification, and the overall reform of the assessment structures in place.  <\/p><p>The SEC is confident that the published sample papers issued will assist students, teachers and the public, and in particular those presenting for the first &ldquo;live&rdquo; examinations in Junior Cycle Gaeilge in 2020, and is satisfied that they are in full accordance with the learning outcomes and assessment objectives set out in the subject specifications.  <\/p><p>The Irish language is accorded special status in Ireland and is protected by various pieces of Legislation and in particular Article 8 of our Constitution which states that &ldquo;The Irish Language as the national language is the first official language&rdquo;. <\/p><p>The Education Act 1998 recognises the particular responsibility of the education system with regard to supporting the Irish language. The language has particular social, historical and educational importance and is part of the unique cultural heritage of the Irish people. It is an aim of Government to increase on an incremental basis the use and knowledge of Irish as a community language.<\/p><p>In recognising the linguistic, social and cultural importance of Irish and English in Ireland, both languages are included as core subjects in the national curricula for recognised primary and post-primary schools and centres for education in Ireland. This has been the case since the foundation of the State and the importance of the teaching of both languages in this way has been re-affirmed on a number of occasions by the State, including most recently in the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000066#WRH02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":360,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000066#WRH02900"},{"type":"question","counter":361,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[51239\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000066#WRH03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when an illness related early retirement pension will issue to a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":362,"content":"<p>I am pleased to confirm for the Deputy that the calculation of pension benefits for the person to whom he refers is complete.

I have spoken to a number of staff about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised. <\/p><p>In Budget 2020 I increased the number of secretaries and caretakers in certain schools, allowing schools with enrolments of 500-625 to fill secretary vacancies provided they have fewer than 1.5 secretaries; schools with enrolments of 626-699 to fill vacancies provided they have fewer than two secretary posts filled, and schools of 700 or more to fill caretaker vacancies provided they have fewer than two caretakers.  These measures will take effect from September 2020.  <\/p><p>Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school.

This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect<\/p><p>Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  <\/p><p>The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. <\/p><p>On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  <\/p><p>The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. <\/p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendation applies.My Department receives informal correspondence by telephone in respect of grant-funded secretary and caretaker circulars, as regularly occurs with the publication of pay circulars.  Advice is provided on the implementation of the circular and the appropriate steps to take.  Secretaries and Caretakers who have queries regarding the application of the circular should raise queries directly with their individual employer \/ Board of Management.  <\/p><p>In addition, the recent survey of Secretaries and Caretakers has identified some schools that are non-compliant with the provisions of the 2015 Arbitration Agreement, and my Department will be making contact with these schools to remind them of their obligations under the agreement, as implemented through various circulars. The links below will bring you to the most recent circulars in respect of the pay increases under the 2015 Arbitration Agreement.<\/p><p><i>www.education.ie\/en\/Circulars-and-Forms\/Active-Circulars\/cl0076_2018.pdf.<\/i><\/p><p><i>www.education.ie\/en\/Circulars-and-Forms\/Active-Circulars\/cl0077_2018.pdf.<\/i><\/p><p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.<\/p><p>In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting.

The study is conducted every three years since 2000, and assesses reading literacy, mathematics and science. The ERC identified an error in the course of a review of PISA 2015 data.  <\/p>  <p>  The error referred to by the Deputy involved the ERC using the wrong indicator variable to compare students in DEIS and non-DEIS schools in PISA 2015 national reporting. The PISA 2015 national report and its accompanying e-Appendix were published by the ERC in December 2016. <\/p>  <p>  As a result of this error, the published analyses in the PISA 2015 national report, that compare students in DEIS and non-DEIS schools were incorrect. The ERC has recently published the corrected data.  While the improvements are somewhat less than previously reported, nevertheless the revised figures still represent improvements on the equivalent data for 2012. <\/p>  <p>  A second consequence of this error was that the post-primary literacy and numeracy targets in the DEIS Plan and in the Interim Literacy and Numeracy Strategy Review document, which are based on PISA proficiency levels, were incorrect. The figures should have presented a lower baseline of achievement than what was published at the time. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has noted the errors and the corrected data now published by the ERC.  The ERC has confirmed to my Department that the error related only to one variable indicator, and that no other analysis carried out by it for my Department is affected. The ERC has also confirmed that it is in the process of a broader internal review of its data management processes to mitigate the recurrence of such an error.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Literacy and Numeracy, and DEIS, the original targets were published in 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware the findings from PISA 2018 were published in early December and show that Irish students in Ireland scored higher than the OECD average in reading, mathematics and science. <\/p>  <p>  Consideration is being given to the development of new targets taking into account the outcome of the 2018 PISA report and the corrected baseline of achievement in 2015 that the ERC has now published in relation to DEIS schools.<\/p>  <p>  Evaluation is a key element of the DEIS Programme and PISA findings are considered part of the ongoing evaluation of DEIS. Aside from PISA, there are a number of mechanisms of evaluation of DEIS schools.<\/p>  <p>  Since DEIS was first introduced, the Educational Research Centre (ERC) and my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate have conducted a series of evaluations on aspects of the programme and findings of this work are contained in a series of published reports. Evidence from this research to date demonstrates that the DEIS programme is having a positive effect on tackling educational disadvantage and is succeeding in improving educational outcomes.  <\/p>  <p>  The Educational Research Centre has also been involved in implementing and reporting on National Assessments of \u200eMathematics and English Reading (NAMER) on behalf of my Department. Since 2009 NAMER assesses primary pupils in English Reading and Maths at the end of Second and Sixth \u200eclasses, to coincide with the end of the Junior and Senior cycles at primary level. The ninth NAMER takes place in the spring of 2020 in a nationally representative sample of schools. One of the objectives of this assessment cycle is to evaluate progress towards the revised targets identified after NAMER 2014. NAMER 2020 will incorporate an increased sample of DEIS schools in order to compare the achievements of pupils in non-DEIS and DEIS schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000067#WRJ05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Data","counter":445,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000067#WRJ05300"},{"type":"question","counter":446,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[51477\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000067#WRJ05400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of schools in which the use of an application fee has been reported and confirmed by county in 2019, in tabular form; if refunds have been issued; the value of the application fee; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1225","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":447,"content":"<p>My Department does not hold records regarding payments collected from or made to parents, as the case may be. <\/p><p>Section 64 of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which is operational since October 2018, explicitly prohibits the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions for admission to or for continued enrolment in a school.<\/p><p>Under the provisions of the Education Act, 1998 the board of management is responsible for the direct governance of the school, including compliance with the appropriate legislation. <\/p><p>Should an individual have a concern regarding admission fees being sought by a school, or they are concerned about the manner in which the school is requesting payment, they can raise this with the principal of the in the first instance.  <\/p><p>Should they not be satisfied with their response then the Chairperson of the Board of Management of the school can be contacted school in relation to the concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000067#WRJ05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homelessness Strategy","counter":448,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000067#WRJ05600"},{"type":"question","counter":449,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[51478\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000067#WRJ05700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of his actions to date to implement the recommendations of a report (details supplied) of the Children's Rights Alliance home works report.","asker":"1225","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":450,"content":"<p>My Department is represented on the Homelessness Inter-Agency Group (HIAG) which was established by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to bring about greater coherence and coordination in the provision of homelessness related services across the relevant Government organisations.

That Report was a response to an Interdepartmental Government Committee report (McAleese Report) that was set up to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalen institutions. <\/p>  <p>  The ex-gratia scheme was established for the benefit of women who were admitted to and worked in the ten Magdalen Institutions as well as St Mary&rsquo;s Domestic Training Centre Stanhope Street and the House of Mercy Domestic Training School Summerhill, Wexford.

The State was represented at the Committee by a cross-Departmental group led by Minister of State Stanton. Ireland&rsquo;s national statement to the Committee was delivered by Minister Stanton at the outset of the review and, in the course of the Committee hearing, further detail on Ireland&rsquo;s actions in this important area were set out in exchanges with the Committee. I take it the Deputy is referring to the exchanges as part of that review. <\/p><p>I can confirm that my Department is working to update Ireland&rsquo;s criminal law on both hate speech and hate crime as a priority.<\/p><p>It is important to note that our law already includes provision for prosecution of relevant crimes. Under current law, hate crimes are prosecuted under general criminal law, rather than through a specific 'hate crime' offence.  Where a perpetrator has been found guilty of a crime, such as for example assault or criminal damage, a sentencing judge may consider a hate motive to be an aggravating factor that would increase the sentence. <\/p><p>With a view to ensuring that any new legislation in this field is as robust and effective as possible, my Department is currently finalising research on the effectiveness of different legislative approaches to tackling hate crime in other countries. This research will allow us to learn from experience elsewhere and to identify the approach that will work best in Ireland. <\/p><p>When this work has concluded, which I expect to happen within the coming weeks, I plan to incorporate the learning from the research and then bring forward proposals for new hate crime legislation in the new year. These proposals will be published for discussion and an opportunity will be given to experts, communities and the public to share their views. <\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department has also been running a public consultation on the separate but related issue of incitement to hatred since October, to gather the views of all stakeholders on how our laws should deal with those who actively seek to promote and encourage hatred and prejudice against vulnerable groups. The consultation remains open until 13 December and I encourage all those who wish to contribute to go to the Department&rsquo;s website at  for further information.<\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that it is important that complex legislative measures are well researched and evidence-based.  Development of new criminal law in this area is a priority for me as Minister but it is important to ensure that the right to freedom of expression is protected; that any new law is necessary and proportionate; and importantly that any law adopted is effective in practice in dealing with the very real harms caused by hate speech and hate crime. <\/p><p>The Deputy may also wish to be aware that my Department is leading on a number of cross-Government initiatives to tackle racism in Ireland. <\/p><p>The Migrant Integration Strategy published in 2017 sets out the Government's commitment to the promotion of migrant integration and provides a framework for a wide range of actions to support migrants to participate fully in Irish life. It includes actions to promote intercultural awareness and to combat racism and xenophobia - including review of legislation concerning racially motivated crime and hate speech.  The Progress Report for the mid-term review of the Migrant Integration Strategy was published earlier this year by my Department and work continues across Government as a whole to achieve its goals.<\/p><p>In relation to the justice sector and in addition to the steps outlined above, my colleague Minister of State David Stanton is in the process of establishing a new Anti-Racism Committee which will include representatives of the public, private and voluntary sectors. This Committee will have a mandate to examine what needs to be done by public sector bodies as well as the wider community to challenge racism.<\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have also taken a number of important steps recently, consistent with the Migrant Integration Strategy.  A Diversity and Integrity Strategy has been adopted, including a working definition of hate crime to assist Garda&iacute; in delivering a victim-centred service and ensure that Garda&iacute; respond consistently and robustly to reports of hate crime.<\/p><p>I am confident that the approach being taken - including research and providing the opportunity for experts and members of the public to provide their views through consultation - will help to ensure that the legislation we develop will deliver a safer, fairer and more inclusive Ireland for everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000069#WRL01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":532,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000069#WRL01900"},{"type":"question","counter":533,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[51792\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000069#WRL02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if Ireland will pay financial penalties for not complying with an EU directive regarding the implementation of a wills registry; if so, the amount of penalties; the amount paid in fines over the years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":534,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[51793\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000069#WRL02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason a wills registry has not been implemented as per an EU directive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":535,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 and 234 together.<\/p>  <p>  It is my understanding that the Deputy is referring to EU Regulation (650\/2012) of July 2012 on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions, acceptance and enforcement of authentic instruments in matters of successions and on the creation of a European Certificate of Succession. I can inform the Deputy that Ireland did not take part in the adoption of this Regulation in accordance with protocol number 21 on the position of Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland took the decision not to opt-in to this Regulation on the grounds that, despite intensive negotiations, the final text of the Regulation would have interfered to an unacceptable extent with the manner in which estates are administered in this jurisdiction.  Accordingly, there is no question of fines being imposed on Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The views of the Law Society on the desirability of establishing a registration of wills system were sought in 2005.  The Society's Probate, Administration and Trusts Committee subsequently informed the Department that it did not favour the establishment of a Register of Wills for a number of reasons.  <\/p>  <p>  Firstly, since the registration would be voluntary, there might be very limited usage of such a service.  Secondly, even where a will was registered, such registration would not guarantee the validity of the will if the statutory requirements in relation to signature, witnesses etc. had not been complied with.  Moreover, there could be no guarantee that a registered will was in fact the final will of the testator concerned.

I understand however that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.<\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy in respect of the number probationer Garda&iacute; allocated to the Mayo Division in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:  <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. We now have approximately 14,300 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 2,900 Garda staff and as part of the Government&rsquo;s plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, there is ongoing and increased recruitment both of new Garda&iacute; as well as Garda staff.  <\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in 2014, approximately 3,000 probationers have attested and been assigned to frontline policing duties nationwide, including the 197 new probationers that attested on 29 November. Of these probationers, 18 have been assigned to the Mayo Division.  <\/p><p>I have reviewed the details of the Mayo Division workforce and I would point out that the number of Garda members and staff in the Mayo Division has increased over recent years. I am informed by the Garda authorities that as of 31 October 2019 there were 338 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Mayo Division. This represents a significant increase of 35 Garda&iacute; in the Division since the end of 2015. These Garda&iacute; are supported by 50 Garda staff, which again represents a significant increase of 17 Garda staff since the end of 2015. This increase in Garda staff supports the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative to operational policing duties, where their training and expertise can be used to best effect. Taking account of retirements and departures, there are now 35 additional Garda&iacute; across the Mayo Division since the end of 2015, representing an overall 12% increase in Garda members across the Mayo Division since the end of 2015.<\/p><p>Taken together, the increase in Garda and civilian staff numbers means a significant increase in operational policing hours in Mayo in recent years.<\/p><p>With regard to retirements, I am advised by the Commissioner that projected departures are kept under continuous review and that the level of recruitment is adjusted as necessary in order to maintain the desired strength.<\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the retirement of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is governed by law, which sets the mandatory retirement age for all members at 60 years of age.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who joined prior to 1 April 2004 may retire on full pension at 50 years of age once they have served at least 30 years and those who joined on or after 1 April 2004 may retire on full pension at 55 years of age with 30 years service.

The Bureau&rsquo;s remit is to target a person's assets, wherever situated, which derive, or are suspected to derive, directly or indirectly, from criminal conduct. Since its inception, the Bureau has been at the forefront of fighting organised crime in this jurisdiction and disrupting the activities of criminal gangs by depriving them of ill-gotten assets.<\/p><p>The Bureau is widely regarded as a best practice model in the context of combating organised crime.  It works closely with law enforcement bodies at national and international levels and continues to relentlessly pursue the illicit proceeds of organised crime activity. The actions of the Bureau send a strong message to criminals and to local communities that profiting from crime will not be tolerated. <\/p><p>In accordance with the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996-2016, all funds collected by the Bureau are forwarded, either directly or through the Revenue Commissioners\/Department of Social Protection, to the Central Exchequer Fund.  It is this Central Fund from which the Government draws for expenditure on all necessary public services and investment including the provision of drug services.<\/p><p>The Constitution requires, and Government accounting principles provide, that public moneys be spent only as voted or approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, unless otherwise provided by statute.<\/p><p>While there have been calls from some quarters for monies confiscated by the Criminal Assets Bureau to be ring fenced, a policy of ring-fencing monies obtained by the Exchequer and the reallocation of same for a specific purpose, runs contrary to the normal Estimates process. While allowing for a small number of very specific targeted exceptions, it is believed that earmarking revenues for a specific expenditure programme would, in general, constrain the Government in the implementation of its overall expenditure policy.<\/p><p>There are also practical difficulties owing to the variable and uncertain nature of the value of the assets seized by the Bureau in any given year.  In addition, the potential delays caused by legal challenges to court disposal orders would also be problematic in terms of continuity of provision of funding to specific programmes or projects, whether drug related or otherwise.<\/p><p>Therefore because of the variable value and nature of assets seized by the Bureau in any given year, such a revenue source would not be reliable for facilitating the proper planning of drug treatment provision and programmes by organisations involved in the delivery of such services. <\/p><p>Finally, the Deputy may be interested to know that Section 21 of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 requires the Bureau, through the Garda Commissioner, to provide a report of its activities each year to the Minister for Justice and Equality who is then required to lay copies of the report before each House of the Oireachtas.  <\/p><p>The Annual Reports (including the most recent, the Annual Report 2018, which was published in June this year) are available in the Oireachtas library and on the website of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my own Department.

The Act distinguishes between the entitlement to citizenship by birth and descent and to the acquisition of citizenship through the naturalisation process. Following a referendum of the Irish people, the 27th amendment to the Constitution changed the situation in relation to entitlement to Irish Citizenship. As a result, Section 6 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 was amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2004. The changes came into effect on 1st January 2005. As of that date a person born in the island of Ireland is not entitled to be an Irish citizen, unless that person's parents have been resident in the island of Ireland for a total of three years during the four years preceding that person's birth. Periods of unlawful residence, periods of residence which were for the sole purpose of having an application for refugee status determined or periods of residence where permission was granted for the purposes of study are excluded from the determination of periods of reckonable residence.<\/p>  <p>  Where a child born in the State did not, at birth, have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, the parent or guardian or person who is in loco parentis to the child may lodge an application for naturalisation on behalf of the child if and when the conditions for naturalisation are satisfied, including a requirement to have a total of 5 years residence in the State. This ensures that, even where a child born in the State did not have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, there is a path to obtaining Irish citizenship through naturalisation. <\/p>  <p>  I recognise that there are some cases of young people who have grown up here but who, as a result of their parents' illegal status, find themselves in a difficult situation. However, it is important to emphasise once again, that when it comes to people living here illegally, the only option for regularisation is on a case by case basis.   Inevitably, granting permission to children and young people who reside in Ireland in an undocumented capacity will require that other family members must also be allowed to remain in order to care for and support the children. However, where people who have had an application for residence refused or who simply overstay their permission to reside in this country and do not apply for an extension to their permission, the State must be allowed to exercise its legal right to remove them from the State.  It would be unwise to permit people to simply ignore our immigration laws and allow them and their families to remain here merely on the basis of the length of time that they have resided here without permission.  <\/p>  <p>  I would clarify for the Deputy, however, that my Department is currently exploring the various policy options available for addressing the issue of undocumented children having regard to international best practice.<\/p>  <p>  I met with the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland (MRCI) in June to discuss the situation and my Department is engaging with MRCI and other NGOs on this matter. Another meeting is planned at official level shortly.<\/p>  <p>  In all cases, people must engage with the authorities if they wish to be permitted to remain here legally. I would encourage any person who is resident in the State without permission to contact my Department or their local immigration office and to take all appropriate steps to regularise their family's status.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000069#WRL05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":562,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000069#WRL05100"},{"type":"question","counter":563,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[51203\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000069#WRL05200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; stationed in Portarlington Garda station; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":564,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is statutorily responsible for the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including personnel matters and deployment of resources.

The most significant of these was the introduction of a single application procedure. By replacing the previous multi-layered and sequential process, the single application procedure brings certainty at a much earlier stage to those who qualify for protection. In turn, this provides for timely reunification with immediate family members to support those granted international protection to begin their new lives here in Ireland.<\/p><p>In aligning our application procedure with other EU Member States, the Government was also mindful of the need to align our family reunification provisions. The EU Family Reunification Directive governs family reunification in the Member States, with the exception of Ireland, the UK and Denmark. In so doing, we considered it appropriate and humane not to impose the economic conditions on sponsors. In addition, unlike some EU Member States, our family reunification provisions apply equally to beneficiaries of both types of international protection: refugee status and subsidiary protection status.  <\/p><p>In order to apply for Family Reunification, an applicant must have a current declaration as a Convention Refugee, Programme Refugee or they must be a current beneficiary of Subsidiary Protection. The sponsor must make an application within 12 months of being granted one of the above, or from the date of their arrival in the State as a Programme Refugee.<\/p><p>Under Section 56 of the International Protection Act, the following family members are eligible for family reunification (with relevant criteria in brackets):<\/p><p>- Spouse (the marriage must have subsisted on the date the application for International Protection in the State was lodged);<\/p><p>- Civil Partner (the civil partnership must have subsisted on the date the application for International Protection in the State);<\/p><p>- Parent(s) and their children (under 18 and unmarried) if the sponsor was under 18 and unmarried on the date the application for family reunification in the State was lodged; and<\/p><p>-  A child of the sponsor, who is under the age of 18 and unmarried when the sponsor made an application for Family Reunification in the State.<\/p><p>Under Sections 56 and 57, a person may apply for permission for member(s) of their family to:<\/p><p>- Enter and reside in the State where they are living outside the State; or<\/p><p>- Reside in the State where they are already in the State on the date the application was lodged.<\/p><p>- Where an application for Family Reunification is granted, family members will be given permission to enter and\/or reside in the State for not less than one year, provided the sponsor's permission is in force and the sponsor is entitled to remain in the State.<\/p><p>However, it also remains open to me to exercise my discretion under the Non-EEA Policy Document on Family Reunification to waive the economic conditions for sponsors applying for extended family members.

The CSO produces these statistics using data including data recorded on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s PULSE system.  CSO Recorded Crime statistics are wholly dependent on PULSE data. <\/p><p>In light of quality issues in relation to PULSE data, the CSO took the decision in early 2017 to postpone further publication of recorded crime statistics.  <\/p><p>While CSO resumed publication of recorded crime statistics, it has done so in a new category entitled &lsquo;Under Reservation&rsquo;. <\/p><p>The CSO has confirmed that this classification has been applied to reflect the fact that there are data quality issues in the underlying sources used to compile the statistics.  The CSO has further indicated that this approach of differentiating statistics based on quality concerns associated with the underlying data is consistent with other jurisdictions. <\/p><p>The CSO is engaging with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to set out the criteria for the lifting of the reservation. These criteria will address quality concerns across a broader range of issues. They will address issues such as data governance, training, crime data recording procedures and the auditing and monitoring of data quality.<\/p><p>Last week I noted the publication of a new statistical release by the CSO on Recorded Crime Detection 2018, the data of which is categorised as &lsquo;under reservation&rsquo;. I welcome the fact that improvements in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in particular in terms of data governance including upgrade of the Pulse system had facilitated preparation and publication of this report by the CSO. The report provides a snapshot of the extent to which crimes reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2018 have been detected.  Detection is understood in this context as identification and sanction of at least one suspected offender; or, in a very limited set of circumstances, a verified exception whereby an offender is not directly sanctioned because, for example, the DPP decides that prosecution is not in the public interest or the suspected offender dies prior to any prosecution.<\/p><p>In publishing this report, the CSO explicitly confirmed that the report constituted a 'significant break' in the previous series for measuring crime detection rates in Ireland. This means that detection rates set out in the CSO report issued for 2018 are not comparable with figures published in earlier years. <\/p><p>The report is available at the following link: <\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that, given the pause in reporting on this issue by the CSO, it was not possible for me to provide a response to the issue raised in her earlier Parliamentary Question.  For the same reason it is difficult to provide data at this point for the earlier years referred to. <\/p><p>However it is important to note that the most recent CSO report was made possible by progress in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has improved the quality and consistency of recording of crime data. This establishes a reliable baseline against which operational decisions can be considered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and further progress can be ensured and measured.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Policing Authority is responsible for overseeing the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of its functions relating to policing services, and accordingly has the primary oversight role in relation to these matters, including any issues arising from the historical inaccuracies in the recording of detections on PULSE.  The welcome clarity which the CSO has brought to this issue through this new and more reliable assessment of detections will be of assistance to the Authority in that independent oversight task and will also be of assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as it continues to improve the policing services it provides nationwide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000070#WRM01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":589,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000070#WRM01700"},{"type":"question","counter":590,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[51345\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000070#WRM01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; deployed in Garda stations in County Wexford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":591,"content":"<p>The Garda Commissioner is statutorily responsible for the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including personnel matters and deployment of resources.

There are 224 valid permission under the scheme at present. Under the terms of the Scheme, all crew from non-EEA countries must be employed directly and exclusively by a sea fishing vessel license holder under a written contract of employment for a duration of 12 months. All license holders are under a contractual and statutory duty to comply with EU and national law applicable to employees working under the Scheme.<\/p><p>My Department has been advised that each contract is certified by a solicitor as follows:<\/p><p>1. that the terms of the scheme are met<\/p><p>2. that  the conditions of employment are in accordance with the relevant legislation and that annual wages are not less than the National Minimum Wage - currently &euro;9.80 per hour; and<\/p><p>3. that there is a statement from the vessel owner that they will enrol the crew member in a Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) Safety Training Scheme prior to commencement of employment. <\/p><p>The enforcement of appropriate employment law, including minimum wage requirements, is not a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality. Enforcement of the employment conditions of any non-EEA National in the Irish fishing industry is a matter for the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), and the Marine Survey Office or (in the case of alleged criminal activity), the Garda&iacute; and other appropriate authorities of the State.<\/p><p>The vessels encompassed by the scheme are subject to regular inspection by a number of State Agencies. The WRC in particular has inspected almost all vessels within the scope of the scheme and maintains a risk-based inspection and compliance regime which is informed by intelligence, including information from concerned NGOs.<\/p><p>From April 2016 to the end of June 2019, 390 port inspections of the 186 whitefish vessels that have participated in this scheme since 2016 were undertaken by WRC inspectors. Port inspections refer to the initial contact that is made with the vessel as it arrives in the harbour. The inspections entail checks for visas and informal interviews with the crew about the working conditions. These inspections are followed up with a call to the HQ of the vessel for more formal checks on records and relevant documents, follow up interviews and so on.<\/p><p>There are currently some 171 vessels which come within the scope of the Atypical Working Scheme and the WRC inspection services have inspected 169 (over 99% of all vessels). Two of the vessels registered under this Scheme have not been detected in Irish ports in recent times.<\/p><p>Since the Atypical Working Scheme was launched late in 2015, six targeted enforcement operations have taken place:<\/p><p>1. Operation Egg Shell, which was led by and coordinated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and involved several enforcement agencies, took place on 5th and 7th October 2016 and focussed on labour exploitation and human trafficking in the fishing industry.<\/p><p>2. Operation Trident, which took place from 29th to 31st March 2017.<\/p><p>3. Operation Neptune, which took place in March 2018 <\/p><p>4.Operation Poseidon, which took place in June 2018, involved unannounced inspections at several fishing ports by WRC inspectors.<\/p><p>5.Operation Nemo which involved unannounced inspections operation at 5 of the 6 fishery harbour centres during the period 21st to 23rd February 2019; and<\/p><p>6. Operation Preteus, which took place from 26 June to 29 June. WRC inspectors boarded 28 whitefish vessels at seven landing places across the country to inspect employment records, carry out compliance checks and interview employees.<\/p><p>Some 260 contraventions were detected by WRC Inspectors from 2016 to end June 2019:<\/p><p>1. 26% of contraventions relate to records<\/p><p>2. 19% of contraventions relate to leave, public holiday and associated entitlements<\/p><p>3. 16% of contraventions relate to illegal workers <\/p><p>4. 13% of contraventions are failures to issue payslips<\/p><p>5. in 17% of cases, owners are not cooperating and\/or complying with an Inspector's requirement<\/p><p>6. 4% of contraventions related to pay rates.<\/p><p>By the end of 2019 it is expected that two detailed investigations of all Atypical Working Scheme vessels will have been conducted. So far, the WRC has proceeded to prosecutions in 12 cases. 7 of these are currently before the courts and, in 5 cases, the WRC has been successful in securing convictions. It is noteworthy, that the inspection resources allocated by the Workplace Relations Commission to the Atypical Working Scheme is significant compared to other sectors of employment. There are over 2.2 million persons employed in Ireland. There are slightly in excess of 200 crew members currently employed under the Atypical Working Scheme.<\/p><p>Where an individual believes themselves to be a victim of human trafficking or where another person believes that this situation applies, they should contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS), or an NGO or State authority (e.g. WRC) who will be able to refer their case to AGS. AGS will be in a position to take the victim to a place of safety and arrange for immediate accommodation, food and medical needs.<\/p><p>AGS will refer the person's case to the competent authority for the identification of victims, the Human Trafficking investigation and coordination unit (HTICU) of AGS.<\/p><p>Where an individual is identified as a suspected victim of human trafficking by HTICU they will be eligible to receive State supports and services through the National Referral Mechanism for Victims of Human Trafficking (NRM) to assist their recovery. Where such persons do require a permission to remain in the State and do not already have one, a permission to remain will be granted under the Administrative Immigration Arrangements (AIAs) on foot of a formal identification by senior officers of HTICU.<\/p><p>As a result of the multi-agency engagement outlined above, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have identified 16 migrant fishermen who had been employed under the Terms of the Atypical Working Scheme as possible victims of human trafficking and caused them to be admitted to the NRM. Admission to the NRM is based on a low threshold of possibility that trafficking may have occurred. While this is a matter of concern and is being treated with the utmost seriousness, these cases represent a small percentage of the overall number of fishers availing of the AWS. Assistance and services under the NRM have been afforded to all of these victims, including accommodation, medical and legal assistance. Investigations are continuing.  <\/p><p>Responsibility for transposition of EU Directive 2017\/159, which implements the standards of the ILO Work in Fishing Convention, is not a matter for my Department.

These contracts will be longer term with a minimum contract duration of 2 years on offer and a maximum contract duration of 4 years. <\/p>  <p>   My Department has, in conjunction with a number of charities and NGOs who were awarded funding for projects, assisted a total of 675 people to transit from state provided accommodation to permanent homes in the community. This figure relates to the period from the beginning of the year to the end of October.<\/p>  <p>   My Department also secured an additional &euro;1m in Budget 2020 for immigration Service Delivery which includes provision for additional staffing to fast-track decisions on applications for international protection, thus reducing pressure on the State provided accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000071#WRN01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Reports","counter":638,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000071#WRN01700"},{"type":"question","counter":639,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[51645\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000071#WRN01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the 2018 annual report of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":640,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that my Department has received the 2018 annual report of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I expect to be in a position to publish it very shortly. <\/p><p>In accordance with the statutory reporting provisions, the Annual Report will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000071#WRN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Recruitment","counter":641,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000071#WRN02000"},{"type":"question","counter":642,"qnumday":273,"qnumall":"[51646\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000071#WRN02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of competitions for Garda members to join the north Dublin roads policing unit held in 2018 and to date in 2019, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":643,"content":"<p>It is important to be clear that under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 as amended, the Garda Commissioner has responsibility for management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the allocation and efficient use of Garda resources.

A lead-in timeframe is essential to ensure that the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations will be in place. This will ensure that the DSS will have the capacity to be up and running effectively. There are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations, and the situation is being kept under ongoing review as the preparatory work on implementation moves forward.<\/p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing. <\/p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the DSS. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016) commenced provisions of the Act to enable the recruitment of the Director of the DSS.  Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the DSS on 2 October 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 8 of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to make recommendations to the Director of the DSS in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives. In anticipation of the completion of that process, the Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 on 17 December 2018 (S.I. No. 527 of 2018). <\/p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the DSS is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options. <\/p>  <p>  Work has been ongoing in the Department of Justice and Equality on the drafting of necessary amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, taking account of issues raised by the Mental Health Commission, the codes of practice working groups and submissions received from other bodies.  The intention was to bring forward these amendments by way of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016. However, when D&aacute;il Committee Stage took place on the Bill on 30 January 2019, a number of amendments were agreed which had previously been ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle, thus giving rise to a procedural matter.

Historically, the overwhelming majority of child victims of offences under trafficking legislation included in Irish statistics are Irish child victims of sexual exploitation, usually carried out for personal gratification rather than commercial gain, and often by someone known to the child.

Community pharmacy is recognised as the most accessible element of our health service with an unequalled reach in terms of patient contact and access.<\/p><p>Regulations governing the current pharmacy fee structure were made under section 9 of the FEMPI Act 2009 and are set to expire at the end of 2019. Under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, these regulations must be replaced on 1<sup>st<\/sup>January 2020 to maintain a statutory basis for contractor payments and to prescribe the fees payable from that date. <\/p><p>In keeping with my obligations under Section 43 of the 2017 Act, my officials have undertaken a process of consultation with the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU), as the representative body for the profession. My officials have met with an IPU delegation on two occasions where proposed fee restructuring was discussed. A detailed submission was received from the IPU. This consultation process has now concluded. <\/p><p>I met with the IPU on the 5<sup>th<\/sup>December, where I reiterated my intention to move beyond the arrangements underpinned by the FEMPI regulations and to commence a comprehensive review of the pharmacy contract. In this context I also communicated my intention to maintain the current fee structure from 1 January 2020. <\/p><p>The comprehensive review of the pharmacy contract in 2020 will address the role to be played by community pharmacy in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare. It will consider all aspects of pharmacy service provision including delivery of a multi-disciplinary model of service delivery for patients, ensuring clarity of roles and achieving optimum value for money.<\/p><p>However, any publicly funded pharmacy service expansion should address unmet public healthcare needs, improve access to existing public health services or provide better value for money or patient outcomes. Accordingly, any measures to be considered must be evidence based. <\/p><p>New secondary legislation is currently being drafted in order to give effect to the prescribed fee structure, as required under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000072#WRO06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Funding","counter":741,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000072#WRO06600"},{"type":"question","counter":742,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[51775\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000072#WRO06700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department and the HSE will review the funding being made available to an organisation (details supplied) that provides preschool for children with intellectual disabilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":743,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

Following Cabinet consideration, the Memorandum was withdrawn at that time.  I intend to revert to Government in due course with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between myself and Minister Harris, on the best way to progress the Transport Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that in July last, my colleague the Minister for Rural and Community Development, announced CL&Aacute;R funding of &euro;890,632 to 20 voluntary community organisations. This funding will support the purchase and\/or fit out of vehicles to provide transport for people in rural areas with mobility issues.

The cost of disability can be defined as the amount it costs a person with a disability to achieve the same standard of living as those persons without a disability.  This includes extra living costs such as heating; disability aids and equipment; medical and drug costs; care costs and transport costs.  Following a procurement process, Indecon International Consultants have been commissioned by that Department to carry out this research.  It is hoped that the research, when complete, will inform policy direction in relation to the provision of adequate supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities, from a whole-of-Government perspective. <\/p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport supports available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.

It is currently with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office in order for drafting to be undertaken. I hope to be in a position to publish this Bill in 2020. <\/p><p>It should be noted that the primary focus of this Bill will be on the introduction of a regulatory framework for public and private hospitals, as well as enabling for certain high risk activities that take place outside a hospital setting to be designated as also requiring a licence. <\/p><p>With regard to the particular cases which the Deputy refers to, I would firstly note that I am not familiar with the individual circumstances but I of course share with him the utmost concern with regard to such matters. In addition to the Patient Safety (Licensing) Bill, I have previously instructed my Department to undertake work examining whether further regulations are required in order to ensure that appropriate protections are in place for the supply and administration of dermatological fillers. This work, including consultations with relevant state agencies, seeks to identify risks in this area and any tools that may be available to alleviate issues identified. <\/p><p>It should be noted that there are already a number of legal frameworks in place that provide regulation in this area, including with regard to the work of the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA). The HPRA have a role in protecting public health by regulating medicines, medical devices and other health products. This includes a national reporting system for medical devices where users of devices are encouraged to report incidents or problems associated with their use to the HPRA. <\/p><p>Where a significant safety or quality concern is identified with the actual device, there are a range of regulatory actions the HPRA can take to protect public health. These include changes to labelling, information and safety notices to users and recalling the product from the market. They can also request changes or modifications to the device itself. <\/p><p>Aesthetic&rsquo; procedures are currently regulated through a combination of professional regulation (I.e. regulation of doctors and dentists who engage in &lsquo;aesthetic&rsquo; procedures) and product regulation. Product regulation covers products placed on the market as cosmetic products, products which are authorised medicines or would be classified as such and are thereby possibly restricted to prescription-control e.g. medicines containing botulinum toxin (such products are also restricted to administration by physicians only), and medical devices. <\/p><p>From 2020 certain products used for aesthetic purposes that currently do not fall within the definition of a cosmetic product or a medicine, which includes dermal fillers, may be classified as medical devices under the new EU Medical Devices legislation - Regulation (EU) 2017\/745. The Regulation, which becomes fully applicable in May 2020, specifically includes dermal fillers within the remit of the regulatory framework for medical devices. <\/p><p>The medical device regulations do not specifically address the administration of dermal fillers, however, under the new Regulations Member States may make provision for certain devices to be eligible for prescription control.  This may represent an opportunity to introduce national legislation restricting the supply or use of dermal fillers. The Department of Health is working with the HPRA to identify the correct use of this provision and how it may be applied to the administration of dermal fillers in Ireland. Work on developing this requirement is ongoing.<\/p><p>Ahead of possible further regulatory changes, my Department continues to recommend that anyone seeking to have a cosmetic  surgery procedure , seek advice from their General Practitioner (GP) to  ensure that they are a suitable candidate for the procedure in question.  GP&rsquo;s can then recommend a reputable specialist practitioner in this area. <\/p><p>The Department further recommends a consultation with an appropriately registered plastic surgeon. In  Ireland, such surgeons can be found by examining the online register of medical practitioners found at the website of the Medical Council.  A patient can also establish if a surgeon is a full member of the Irish Association of Plastic Surgeons at the website of that organisation; all of its members have had full specialist training and are on the Specialist Register in Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery of the Medical Council. Specific advice, which has been prepared by the Chief Medical Officer and the Irish Association of Plastic Surgeons, is also available on the website of my Department. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000075#WRR01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Capital Programme","counter":874,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000075#WRR01800"},{"type":"question","counter":875,"qnumday":353,"qnumall":"[51279\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000075#WRR01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if funding will be provided in 2020 to start the design phase for the new emergency department for Mayo University Hospital.","asker":"1336","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":876,"content":"<p>As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of public healthcare infrastructure projects, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that all capital development proposals must progress through a number of approval stages, in line with the Public Spending Code, including detailed appraisal, planning, design and procurement before a firm timeline or funding requirement can be established. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000075#WRR02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Data","counter":877,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000075#WRR02100"},{"type":"question","counter":878,"qnumday":354,"qnumall":"[51280\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000075#WRR02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children in County Mayo waiting for an occupational therapy, physiotherapy and-or speech and language appointment in tabular form; and the length of time they have been waiting","asker":"1336","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":879,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

Following Cabinet consideration, the Memorandum was withdrawn at that time.  I intend to revert to Government in due course with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between myself and Minister Harris, on the best way to progress the Transport Support Payment Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that in July last, my colleague the Minister for Rural and Community Development, announced CL&Aacute;R funding of &euro;890,632 to 20 voluntary community organisations. This funding will support the purchase and\/or fit out of vehicles to provide transport for people in rural areas with mobility issues. It will support voluntary organisations that provide:- <\/p>  <p>  - transport for people with significant mobility issues, including those requiring specialised  wheelchair accessible vehicles, to day-care or other medical, therapeutic or respite services; or <\/p>  <p>  - transport to\/from designated cancer treatment hospitals\/centres under the National Cancer Care Programme.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy might be interested to know that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty T.D., has commissioned research into the cost of disability.  The cost of disability can be defined as the amount it costs a person with a disability to achieve the same standard of living as those persons without a disability.  This includes extra living costs such as heating; disability aids and equipment; medical and drug costs; care costs and transport costs.

It provides both residential care and day care for service users, all of whom have a diagnosis of dementia. Many of the 60 residential places are funded through the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS). Separately, the HSE contracts for approximately 25 Day Care places per day at St Joseph&rsquo;s.<\/p><p>The NHSS, commonly referred to as <i>Fair Deal<\/i>, is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care. Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<\/p><p>The NHSS is expected to support 23,042 people at any one time in 2019. The NHSS budget for 2019 saw an increase of &euro;24.3m over 2018 making a total budget of &euro;985.8m for 2019. In 2020, the NHSS will see a further investment in its budget. This significant investment will provide ongoing long-term residential care over the course of 2020 ensuring that the Scheme continues to deliver affordable and accessible nursing home care for our citizens with long-term care needs.<\/p><p>The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been designated by the Minister for Health pursuant to Section 40 of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 as a body authorised to negotiate with proprietors of non-HSE registered nursing homes to reach agreement in relation to the maximum price(s) that can be charged for the provision of long-term residential care services to NHSS residents. <\/p><p>The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function and negotiates with a nursing home on an individual basis. The Minister for Health does not have any role in this regard. <\/p><p>The NTPF has clear, established processes for agreeing prices, and has successfully negotiated terms with over 430 private and voluntary nursing homes participating in the Scheme. The NTPF&rsquo;s processes are available to all nursing homes and since the end of 2017 there has been a net increase in the number of nursing homes operating in Ireland with an increase of almost 1,300 (5.7%) in the number of beds in the nursing homes with whom the NTPF has agreed terms.<\/p><p>In its statutory role to negotiate maximum prices charged for the provision of long-term residential care services to NHSS residents, the NTPF established processes are the appropriate mechanism for engagement.

This report was published in November 2018 and includes recommendations across a number of key areas including care pathways for the management of women with complications.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that a package of care is now available for women who have been identified with urgent or immediate needs. In addition, the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan 2020 identifies the continued implementation of the CMO&rsquo;s report on transvaginal mesh as a priority action. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed that an ongoing work programme for the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications is being progressed through the HSE, led by the National Women and Infants Health Programme. In terms of broader service provision going forward, I am informed that the HSE&rsquo;s proposals include the development of multidisciplinary specialist services for women suffering from mesh complications at Cork University Hospital and National Maternity Hospital Dublin<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has published a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information for women suffering complications, which I hope is a useful resource. This can be found on the HSE website. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that sixty contacts have been received from women through the established mesh pathways, which includes women suffering from post-mesh surgery complications. The HSE has also indicated that a number of these are women who have travelled to the UK for mesh removal and are now in need of complex aftercare. <\/p>  <p>  Funding has been identified within the HSE in 2019 to provide a package of care, including non-surgical supports procured through the private system, for women already identified with urgent or immediate needs. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed that translabial scanners have been procured by the HSE for the mesh centres at Cork University Hospital and the National Maternity Hospital Dublin and the two sites are awaiting delivery in the coming weeks. Access pathways to the translabial scanning service will be via the mesh pathways and on a consultant to consultant basis. Training for personnel in the use of the scanners has been arranged with a specialist mesh centre in the UK and it is expected that the service will commence early in the New Year. <\/p>  <p>  At my recent meeting with the Mesh Survivors Ireland group in November 2019, I made a commitment to have my officials examine the potential for medical cards to be provided as a possible support for women affected by transvaginal mesh implants. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for health services in Ireland is based primarily on residency and means. The HSE's Expert Group on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility has previously examined the issue of awarding medical cards and concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to individual applicants, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE National Medical Card Unit is responsible for determining medical card eligibility. Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to provide a medical card application system that is responsive and sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs.  If the HSE is made aware that persons have particular requirements, assistance will be afforded to help that person to complete their application. This assistance can be availed of through a person's local health office or by calling LoCall 1890 252 919.<\/p>  <p>  I strongly encourage all women affected by this issue to engage with the relevant HSE contact points - provided on the HSE website - and the associated care pathways being provided, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for as early as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Having met with the women affected recently, I have also made a commitment to consider the establishment of an independent, compassionate process for women affected by mesh to have their voices heard. My Department is currently developing proposals on how to establish this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000076#WRS05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages Provision","counter":967,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000076#WRS05200"},{"type":"question","counter":968,"qnumday":385,"qnumall":"[51376\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000076#WRS05300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a person (details supplied) will receive home care on a daily basis similar to the level they received at a previous address; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":969,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000076#WRS05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drug and Alcohol Task Forces","counter":970,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000076#WRS05500"},{"type":"question","counter":971,"qnumday":386,"qnumall":"[51380\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000076#WRS05600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the funding from his Department to the Canal Communities Local Drugs and Alcohol Task Force by year since 2015; the planned funding for 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":972,"content":"<p>Drug and Alcohol Task Forces play a key role in assessing the extent and nature of the drug problem in local communities.

This is very welcome reassurance in regard to our national cervical screening programme.<\/p>  <p>  A key finding in the report is that, in the case of 308 or 29.8% of the participants, the Review disagreed with at least one of the individual&rsquo;s original CervicalCheck slide results. Of these, there were 159 cases in which the Expert Panel felt an opportunity to prevent cancer or to detect cancer at an earlier stage may have been missed. The findings in this regard are reflective of the position, as stated by the Panel, that cervical cancer screening will fail to prevent 30-35% of cancers, even in well run programmes.  <\/p>  <p>  Colposcopy management was also reviewed in 106 cases, of which 27 were considered suboptimal. The Expert Panel noted that it was inevitable in a review such as this that a small number of cases would be found where practice was suboptimal but were clear that this should not be taken to conclude that colposcopic practice in the CervicalCheck programme is substandard.<\/p>  <p>  I note the findings of the RCOG report in which the Expert Panel noted that colposcopy is an integral component of any cervical screening programme, that colposcopy management was in line with standard practice in the vast majority of cases reviewed and that the Review Team has said that women can have confidence in colposcopy services and in the Programme overall.<\/p>  <p>  Clearly, screening failures have a serious and sometimes devastating impact on the lives of women and their families. The Expert Panel has stated that these are unfortunately inevitable given the limitations of cytology-based screening. <\/p>  <p>  We must do all we can, therefore, to make cervical cancer a rare disease in Ireland. This can be done through a combination of screening and vaccination, together with strong uptake, and this is my priority. HPV vaccination has now been extended to boys as well as girls, and the HSE has committed to introducing HPV primary screening in Q1 next year.<\/p>  <p>  The Report of the Expert Panel contains ten recommendations, and I have written to the HSE in regard to these.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000078#WRU01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1043,"qnumday":410,"qnumall":"[51606\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000078#WRU01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will report on the recent resignation of the patient representative from the CervicalCheck steering group; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1044,"content":"<p>Patient representatives make a significant contribution on an ongoing basis to the work of the Department, the HSE and health agencies.

An individual report was prepared for each woman. Significant planning and preparation took place to ensure that the process for communication of results to women and families was done in the most appropriate and sensitive way possible. This included providing all participants with options for how they might choose to receive their report, and providing the option for participants to have an independent advocate attend with them at a meeting about their report, if they chose to have one. The communication process began on 23 September, and all participants who wished to receive their individual reports did so in advance of the publication of the Aggregate Report.<\/p>  <p>  A dedicated HSE Information Line for women and families who consented to participate in the RCOG review, which has been in operation since August 2018, continues in place. Queries to the information line, pertaining to the contents of individual reports, averaged less than five per day during November, the month during which the majority of the participants received their reports.<\/p>  <p>  In May 2018, Government decided to offer a package of health and social care supports to women or their next of kin for whom the CervicalCheck audit had found a result that was discordant with their original result. At that time Government also decided this package would be made available to those identified as having discordant results through the RCOG process. This package of health and social care supports is being offered through dedicated Community Liaison Officers.<\/p>  <p>  In recent weeks, some concerns have been raised in regard to the verification process carried out by the HSE to ensure that the correct report went to each participant, and in regard to the accuracy of reports. On foot of these concerns, the Expert Panel travelled to Dublin and met with patient representatives to explain the verification process and the rationale underpinning it to them.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently, both the HSE and RCOG have confirmed to the Department their confidence in the processes underpinning this review, and the participation of more than 1,000 women or their next of kin provides a robust and comprehensive analysis of the performance of the programme. The Expert Panel has noted that, should any women have any queries about the data in their reports, they are happy to investigate further and that throughout this process the objective has been to ensure that every woman received an accurate report. The HSE's Information Line also remains open if any woman has any outstanding queries or concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000079#WRV00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE National Service Plan","counter":1098,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000079#WRV00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1099,"qnumday":429,"qnumall":"[51655\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000079#WRV00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason funding for the winter plan was not included in the 2019 HSE service plan and is being included in the Supplementary Estimates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1436","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1100,"content":"<p>Increase in demand was considered as part of 2019 HSE National Service Plan.

The RCOG Expert Panel also found that the CervicalCheck programme is working effectively and, crucially, that women can have confidence in the programme.  <\/p>  <p>  In regard to the Deputy's question of 5 February, I can confirm that the person with appropriate expertise referred to was in the context of the laboratory audit report. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000079#WRV03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1131,"qnumday":441,"qnumall":"[51731\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000079#WRV04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 322 and 323 of 24 September 2019, if the fact that the HSE has established an expert group to review clinical audit of interval cancers is a reference to a review (details supplied) or a different expert group.","asker":"1367","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1132,"qnumday":443,"qnumall":"[51750\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000079#WRV04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if, following the Scally report and a review (details supplied), he will recommence the CervicalCheck audit that has been paused since May 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1133,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 441 and 443 together.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2010, as part of quality assurance measures, CervicalCheck reviewed the screening history of every woman notified to it as having a diagnosis of cervical cancer, who had previously been screened by the programme. The objective of audit and quality review at CervicalCheck was to facilitate continued improvement and ongoing learning within the programme. Following the issues which arose in relation to the non-disclosure of audit findings, a decision was taken to pause the audit.<\/p>  <p>  The Scoping Inquiry led by Dr Gabriel Scally made a number of recommendations, one of which was that &ldquo;Audit should continue to be an important component of cervical screening as this complies with all good clinical practice. Common, robust and externally validated approaches to the design, conduct, evaluation and oversight of audits should be developed across the screening services.&rdquo; (Recommendation 26).<\/p>  <p>  This recommendation was accepted by Government, as were all of Dr Scally's recommendations. Actions to implement these recommendations were set out in an implementation plan which was approved by Government and is published on the website of my Department.<\/p>  <p>  As set out in the implementation plan, the HSE has established an Expert Group within the National Screening Service to review the clinical audit processes for interval cancers across all screening programmes. This is separate to the work of the Independent Expert Panel Review led by the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (RCOG Review). The Expert Group, which includes two patient representatives, will develop a report setting out recommendations for the operation of clinical audit processes across all screening programmes. The Expert Group is expected to complete its work at the end of this year, following which its recommendations will be implemented by the HSE. I expect that the detail requested by the Deputy regarding the timing of the recommencement of the audit will be informed by the Expert Group's work and this detail will become available once that work is complete.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000079#WRV04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cross-Border Health Services Provision","counter":1134,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000079#WRV04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1135,"qnumday":442,"qnumall":"[51734\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000079#WRV04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) would not receive a full reimbursement under the cross-Border directive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1136,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000079#WRV04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1137,"content":"<p>Question No. 443 answered with Question No. 441.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cancer Screening Programmes","counter":1138,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000079#WRV04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1139,"qnumday":444,"qnumall":"[51751\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000079#WRV05000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of slides requested by a college (details supplied) to be included in its review and which had been given consent for inclusion by the women concerned but were not available to the review due to the fact the laboratory concerned could not locate them, by laboratory; if the slides have subsequently become available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1140,"content":"<p>The transfer of slides from CervicalCheck labs for the RCOG Review was a complex process that involved the retrieval, imaging, packing and transfer of over 1,700 slides spanning a period of approximately 11 years, since the commencement of the CervicalCheck programme.<\/p><p>In addition to the over 1,700 slides which transferred, the HSE reported during the process that a total of 35 slides of women or next of kin who had consented to be included in the review were not located by the laboratories as of the closing date for slide transfers to RCOG on 7 June.<\/p><p>Nine of these slides have since been located.

(BIA-ALCL). This condition is not a breast cancer; it is a cancer of the immune system. BIA- ALCL is an uncommon condition and when diagnosed and treated early it has a very good recovery rate.  To date, it has been diagnosed in only a small number of people worldwide. Most cases of BIA-ALCL have been in patients with implants or who have had tissues expanders manufactured by Allergan with a surface texture called BIOCELL. These implants and expanders have not been used in Ireland since December 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has issued letters to public patients who have received a breast implant and placed information on its website, advising all individuals to be breast aware; describing the signs and symptoms to monitor for and what to do if a patient finds a swelling or lump. If patients are concerned that they have a breast lump or swelling, they are advised to make contact with the hospital in which they had their implant surgery or their GP.<\/p>  <p>  There is currently no international evidence to support the removal of the Allergan BIOCELL implants in asymptomatic women at this time and international medical experts recommend that people should not have their implants removed unless the condition has been diagnosed. <\/p>  <p>  Following the European wide recall of Allergan BIOCELL breast implants and tissue expanders in December 2018, the HPRA made this information publicly available via their website where they provided additional background information and advice. Following the commencement of this recall in December 2018, all non-implanted Allergan BIOCELL breast implants and tissue expanders in Ireland were quarantined and returned to the manufacturer. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE advisory programme was initiated in response to an increased understanding of the incidence of the condition and emerging evidence based on international studies over the past year. The advisory aimed to increase general awareness of BIA ALCL, ensure that women in Ireland are fully informed on this issue and are given the appropriate advice and follow up as required. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE's advisory letter to patients included a helpline number, so as to provide assurance, encourage women to be breast aware and when necessary allocate  clinical review.

Licences issued under the Act may be extended for up to a further five years, beyond the initial validity period.  Tree felling licences are issued for the benefit of the applicant i.e. the forest owner and not a forestry company or saw mill.  <\/p>  <p>  I accept that delays in issuing licences can impact forestry companies in terms of clear-fell and harvesting work  and sawmills in terms of a supply of raw material. I acknowledge that changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP) has resulted in delays to many files, which is beyond my Department&rsquo;s control.<\/p>  <p>  Officials are obliged to implement changes to AAP that were required following important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.  These changes have been implemented, but it will take time to work through the backlog created, while new procedures were developed.<\/p>  <p>  All forestry licences issued by the Department undergo a legal consent process.  Since 2017, all forestry licence applications received have been subject to a statutory public notification system and are subject to a statutory appeal system operated by the FAC. <\/p>  <p>  Most appeals have been in connection with our Appropriate Assessment (AA) procedures.  The Habitats Directive (Article 6.3) requires that where a plan or project is likely to have a significant effect on a Natura site, either individually or in-combination with other plans or projects, it must undergo an appropriate assessment of its implications for that Natura site.  <\/p>  <p>  AA procedures have been amended to introduce a robust and workable system which will address the issues now faced.  Introducing this system involved the recruitment of additional ecological expertise and changes in procedures for the forestry inspectorate.  Interviews are taking place for additional ecologists under a recently advertised competition.  I expect the successful candidates will be deployed early in the new year.  Forestry district inspectors have undergone training and are continuing to receive support in delivering the new procedures.

The Government intends to ensure an early connection to high speed broadband in specific key locations in rural communities. Approximately 300 Broadband Connections Points (BCPs), including schools, library hubs and local sports halls in every county in Ireland, will be connected to high speed broadband during 2020, to enable communities to quickly get free public access to high speed broadband. <\/p><p>All BCPs will have a free public Wi-Fi connection, some will also have hot-desks, and some will be digital hub business centres where digital training, business information events and other SME supports are organised.<\/p><p>My Department's November 2014 NBP High Speed Broadband Map Public Consultation was completed to identify where State investment would be required to enable access to high speed broadband. This consultation described a set of &ldquo;Strategic Connection Points&rdquo;, including schools, hospitals and business parks, described as locations which &ldquo;may fulfil a common social or economic role for its surrounding community&rdquo;.<\/p><p>Those making submissions to the public consultation were invited to share their views on the Strategic Connection Points (SCPs) and to suggest additional types of locations. The majority of submissions agreed on the importance of the SCPs. Some respondents expanded on the initial list and suggested that the list should also include innovation hubs, community enterprise centres, community centres, sports clubs and rural tourist locations. The list of SCPs was prioritised by Local Authority Broadband Officers into Priority 1, Priority 2 and Priority 3 SCP locations. <\/p><p>The Priority 1 locations, called Broadband Connection Points (BCPs), are targeted for priority deployment in 2020, the first year of the NBP State intervention network deployment.<\/p><p>In 2016, Broadband Officers, in consultation with their communities, selected up to 20 SCPs for evaluation as BCPs. In October of that year, the Regional Telecommunications and Innovation Unit in the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (now in the Department of Rural and Community Development (DRCD)) convened an evaluation panel comprised of representation from that Department, local authorities and also my Department. Potential BCP locations were evaluated on the basis of various criteria, including facilities available and the practicalities of access to the site for members of the public.<\/p><p>In April 2017, the NBP Map was further updated to reflect changes in the Intervention Area. As a result, a number of the BCPs were located in an area where they could avail of a commercial operator high speed service and they were removed from the list. At this time, the BCP list was refreshed by the Local Authorities. The updated list of BCPs reflected the priorities of the Local Authorities and characteristics of each county. <\/p><p>The final list of 298 BCPs was published on 19 November. There will be between 7 and 23 BCP locations in each county and they include 138 community centres, 19 tourism locations, 78 schools and 13 business locations. The BCP locations are available to view on the High Speed Broadband Map on the Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.dccae.gov.ie<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000083#WRZ02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":1323,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000083#WRZ02700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Services Data","counter":1322,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000083#WRZ02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1323,"qnumday":516,"qnumall":"[51512\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000083#WRZ02700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the reason the rolling stock purchased by Irish Rail in recent years is being stored in warehouses and cannot be used.","asker":"1448","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1324,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding of public transport.

The initial selection and prioritisation of works is a matter for each local authority.<\/p>  <p>  There were major cutbacks in funding for the road network in general during the recession. Project Ireland 2040 provides for a gradual increase in grant assistance for regional and local roads and there has been a significant increase in Exchequer funding particularly in the last two years - the &euro;483 million allocated this year represents an increase of nearly 50% compared to 2017.  However, the amount available is not sufficient to achieve &ldquo;steady state&rdquo; levels of investment.   For this reason, there continues to be very limited scope for funding road improvement projects under the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes.  <\/p>  <p>   Within the budget available to my Department, grant funding is allocated on the basis of grant programmes and not on the basis of the category of road.  My Department does not, therefore, have the details sought by the Deputy regarding funding for regional roads since 2016.  The allocation of funding across specific roads or across categories is a matter for each local authority, having regard to the funding available to it from local and central sources as well as its particular priorities. <\/p>  <p>  The main Regional and Local Road Grant programmes are focussed on specific policy objectives i.e. surface sealing to protect the road surface from water damage, road strengthening based on pavement condition rating to lengthen the life of roads and a Discretionary Grant Scheme which allows for a specified range of activities including winter maintenance.  These 3 grant programmes account for most of the grant funding and are allocated taking into account the length of the road network and traffic factors in a particular local authority area.  <\/p>  <p>  The regional road network is an important component of the overall road network comprising over 13,000 kms and carrying approx. 30% of national road traffic.  It is a requirement of Exchequer grants that at least 15% of the road strengthening grant is spent on regional roads.   <\/p>  <p>  A road condition survey of the whole regional road network was completed in 2011 and a new survey commissioned by my Department was undertaken in 2018. The results of this survey give a national overview of the current condition of the regional  road network.  As part of the survey various parameters were measured, including visual rating (PSCI), international roughness index (IRI), rut depth, mean profile depth (MPD) and Characteristic SCRIM coefficient (CSC).  In general, the average values for each parameter were very similar in 2018 and 2011, despite the significant drop in investment in the same time period.  Important values like IRI and PSCI had actually shown an improvement since 2011.  <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless it is the case that there is still significant ground to be made up to improve the condition of regional roads.

Transport has a critical role to play in the national effort to reduce carbon emissions, as it accounts for about 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall carbon emissions.  Moreover, it is a sector where fossil fuel use is firmly embedded, and where travel demand is growing due to our economic recovery and growing population. As over half of all land transport emissions come from private car use it is clear that the maximum impact in emissions savings can be achieved by promoting modal shift away from cars where possible or the transition towards lower emitting vehicles.<\/p>  <p>Accordingly, analysis conducted during the development of the Climate Action Plan indicated that electric vehicles (EVs) are a key mitigation technology for Ireland. The Plan   set ambitious targets of 180,000 EVs on our roads by 2025, and 936,000 EVs by 2030. These figures include all forms of EVs - be they big or small, or a car, van, truck or bus. While these targets are very challenging, they are indicative of the scale of transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to reduce national emissions and reach its legally binding emission ceiling in future years.<\/p>  <p>  To help achieve a significant step-up in electrified transport the National Development Plan (NDP) sets out an indicative resource allocation of &euro;200 million. Programmes are being funded by my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, through the SEAI, to support and accelerate the necessary transition from conventionally-fuelled to EVs.  Such supports include an EV Purchase Grant Scheme, a Domestic Charger Grant and the roll out of an extensive recharging network.  Tax supports introduced by the Department of Finance have also been fundamental in establishing the current positive policy environment; EV drivers can currently avail of Vehicle Registration Tax relief, low Motor Tax and may be eligible for a 0% Benefit in Kind rate and an Accelerated Capital Allowance Scheme.  Two further initiatives, funded by my department, that support EV uptake are the EV Toll Incentive (EVTI) Scheme and the Electric Small Public Service Vehicle (eSPSV) Grant Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Beyond electric cars, the potential contribution of other forms of electric transport to reduce transport emissions is considered. Indicative calculations by my Department estimate that replacing 10,000 daily car journeys with cycling, including on e-bikes, abates approximately 37.25 ktCO2 between 2020 and 2030 (assuming the replaced car journey length was equivalent to the average bike journey length in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA)). To contextualize this, the transport sector in Ireland emitted just over 12,000 ktCO2   in 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to support the increasing numbers of people who choose cycling as their preferred mode of transport, including the increasing number of e-bikes users, &euro;110 million will be specifically dedicated to cycling and walking infrastructure in our major urban areas under Project Ireland 2040.  Key actions under the Climate Action Plan   also underpin my commitment to increasing cycling as a mode of travel, including the establishment of a Cycling Project Office within the National Transport Authority and increased cycling infrastructure for Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. <\/p>  <p>  The Cycle to Work Scheme also continues to encourage citizens to cycle to and from work. Under the scheme an eligible employer can buy a bicycle for their employees and the employee pays the amount, less the tax relief, over a period of up to 12 months through a salary sacrifice arrangement. Up to &euro;1,000 can be provided for towards the purchase of a new bicycle or e-bike; this represents a generous contribution towards any commuter bicycle, but especially towards e-bikes, which are generally more expensive.<\/p>  <p>  In considering the possible contribution of other small and lightweight EVs to the overall reduction of carbon emissions in the transport sector, it should be noted that any use of mechanically propelled vehicles in a public place requires insurance, road tax and a driving licence (Note: a bicycle that is equipped with an auxiliary electric motor with maximum continuous rated power of 0.25 kW and which is progressively reduced and finally cut off as the vehicle reaches a speed of 25 km\/h or if the cyclist stops pedalling, is not classified as mechanically propelled vehicle and does not require a licence).

The Draft Childminding Action Plan is firmly based on the 2018 report of the Working Group on Reforms and Supports for the Childminding Sector ('Pathway to a Quality Support and Assurance System for Childminding'), which was chaired by Childminding Ireland and included a number of representatives form the childcare sector.<\/p><p>Childminding is of huge importance to children, to parents, to our economy, and to our society. Until now however, it has not received the support it deserves in terms of public funding or our system of quality assurance or regulation. The Draft Action Plan aims to recognise the valuable work that childminders do and to ensure they can access the supports they need. The Draft Action Plan sets out positive reform proposals to bring childminding into the mainstream of regulation, funding and support.<\/p><p>I am very aware of the unique nature of a childminding service; that is why I established the expert group and called for the development of a bespoke plan for childminders. The Draft Childminding Action Plan makes clear that the intention is to develop regulations that are specific and appropriate to childminding, and to develop customised training and resources to support the quality of childminding provision, including through the development of staffed local networks to provide professional development and peer support. The new regulation and inspection process for childminders is yet to be developed, but the Draft Childminding Action Plan stresses the importance of regulation and inspection being proportionate and appropriate to the home and family setting in which childminders work.<\/p><p>The public consultation process on the Draft Action Plan was widely publicised on social media, through National Voluntary Organisations (including Childminding Ireland) and City\/County Childcare Committees. The consultation process was carefully designed to ensure strong participation by childminders. In particular, a series of 31 focus groups were organised around the country by the local City and County Childcare Committees. The focus groups were designed specifically to enable childminders to take an active part in the consultation. The focus groups were at county level &ndash; run through the City and County Childcare Committees and organised with the help of the new team of regional Childminding Development Officers that I have put in place this year. The focus groups were organised in evenings to make it easier for childminders to take part. <\/p><p>In addition to the 31 focus groups in the evenings, an Open Policy Debate took place in the daytime to facilitate participation by other stakeholders. There was also an online survey and a call for submissions. The online survey had 471 respondents, of whom nearly 60% were childminders.<\/p><p>The Draft Childminding Action Plan proposes that a Steering Committee be appointed to drive and oversee the implementation of the Action Plan, and that the Steering Committee should include representation of childminders, parents and other key stakeholders within the early learning and care and school-age childcare sectors. The role of the Steering Committee will include monitoring and review of the implementation of the plan. During Phase 1 it is proposed that four Advisory Groups will be established and will meet, under the auspices of the Steering Committee, and will work with officials in relation to the following: Regulation and Inspection, Qualifications and Training, Funding and Financial Supports and Consultation and Communications.  <\/p><p>With the completion of the consultation process, my officials will soon commence a process of consideration of all the feedback received  from the various fora and methodologies. A final plan will then be brought for approval which will reflect the results of the extensive consultation exercise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000085#WRBB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services","counter":1445,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000085#WRBB03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1446,"qnumday":559,"qnumall":"[51202\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000085#WRBB03900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which she continues to engage with local and voluntary youth services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1447,"content":"<p>My Department maintains close contact with the 30 national youth organisations we fund and I, and officials from my Department, meet formally with these organisations twice a year to share knowledge and information on developments in the youth sector. <\/p><p>Most recently I met with the National Youth Organisations on 2ndDecember 2019.

Given the large amount of public money that is used in funding these programmes, there needs to be an appropriate level of oversight and accountability. My Department believes that our approach to compliance and supporting services strikes a necessary and appropriate balance. Our approach involves setting out the rules for the receipt of State funding, supporting providers to deliver services, and at the same time, the approach offers assurances to the taxpayer that the funding assigned is being spent as it was intended. Subsidies for the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes are paid based on attendance, a vital governance component of the funding for which my Department is responsible. <\/p>  <p>  Part of Pobal&rsquo;s role in overseeing compliance is to carry out unannounced visits to services to check their compliance with programme rules. Where Pobal discovers that the actual attendance does not match registrations on PIP (Pobal&rsquo;s IT system), the service will be advised by Pobal to make the necessary corrections to ensure that the total amount of funding received for the programme year is correct. There is an appropriate amount of flexibility applied to this corrections process and Pobal works with services on a case by case basis. However, the recovery of overclaimed funds is an integral part of ensuring that public money is properly accounted for.<\/p>  <p>  The service in question received an unannounced compliance visit from Pobal in October 2018. During this visit, discrepancies between attendance of children and registrations on PIP were identified. The service subsequently made the necessary corrections. This led to the funding to the service being adjusted to ensure that total payments for the year were correct. As funding is based on attendance, the Department cannot restore funding which was provided on the basis of registrations which did not match actual attendance.<\/p>  <p>  The local Childcare Committee (CCC) and Pobal Case Management have been engaging with the service in question since March 2019 regarding their sustainability issues. During this time, an Operational Review was carried out in July and a projected cash flow for the 2019\/2020 programme year in October was completed. In November 2019, Pobal submitted to the Department a formal Sustainability funding request to address the financial issues raised as a result of the Overclaim identified in the 2018 Compliance visit. The Department approved this request on 6th December 2019 and the Service will receive the funding upon signing of the Grant Agreement and all pre-contractual conditions being met.<\/p>  <p>  Pobal and the local CCC will continue to monitor and engage with the service in order to address any other outstanding sustainability and compliance issues. If the service requires further details, I would encourage them to get in contact with their local CCC.<\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2020, I have secured funding to pilot a meals programme in Early Learning and Care settings &ndash; delivering on a commitment in First 5.<\/p>  <p>  The pilot will run in a sample of community, not-for-profit Early Learning and Care settings. It will focus on the ECCE Programme and will operate for the full duration of the 2020\/2021 programme year (i.e. 38 weeks from September to June). A range of meals options will be piloted, including a hot meals option. Rates for meals will be based on the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection&rsquo;s School Meals Programme.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has begun work on establishing a Working Group to oversee the development and roll-out of the pilot. As mentioned, the pilot will run in a sample of community and not-for-profit ELC settings which have not yet been decided on.  We will endeavour to be fair and impartial in the selection of setting but, in this regard, must be informed by the evaluator and working group in that the sample may need to include settings of various sizes and in various locations to be feasible.

This information provides statistical evidence of improvements to child welfare and protection services and highlights challenges and areas where further improvement is required. This data is published by Tusla both on a monthly and quarterly basis. In September 2019, the most recent date for which figures are available, Tusla received 4,903 child protection and welfare referrals. Of these, 858 were mandated reports, which constituted 17%  of the total referrals received.<\/p><p>In addition Tusla has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence (DSGBV). This includes, but is not limited to, violence experienced in the family home. <\/p><p>Tusla provides funding to 59 organisations nationwide that provide front-line services to individuals and families. This includes funding for emergency accommodation for individuals and families experiencing domestic violence; specialist counselling; advice and court accompaniment services; childcare for children affected by domestic violence; specialist programmes for children affected by domestic violence; and front-line sexual violence services to adults and young people.<\/p><p>Additional funding of &euro;1.5 million was provided to DSGBV services in 2019. This includes funding for 12 additional outreach workers for women and children affected by domestic violence in identified areas of need, the national roll out of a healing programme for children who have been impacted by domestic abuse, and the opening of a new domestic violence refuge in South Dublin. <\/p><p>Both Tusla and my Department are committed to overcoming the significant issues faced by families affected by domestic and sexual violence, which is experienced by all sectors of society. Tusla continues to work with stakeholders in streamlining and enhancing front line service provision to assist victims in the most effective and efficient way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000086#WRCC02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children in Care","counter":1489,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000086#WRCC02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1490,"qnumday":573,"qnumall":"[51833\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000086#WRCC02200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which she has access to safe and secure placement for children at risk; if this is sufficient to meet the demand; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1491,"content":"<p>Once a child has been received into care, by way of a voluntary agreement or a court order, the most crucial task for the social worker is to find a placement that matches that child's needs.

Over the last five Budgets (2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020) investment in childcare has increased by 137% which reflects the emphasis being placed on improving access to affordable, high quality services.<\/p><p>This increased investment includes funding of the After School Childcare (ASCC) scheme. ASCC is designed to support parents on eligible training courses, as well as certain categories of parents returning to work, by providing subsidised childcare places for eligible children between 4 and 13 years of age. <\/p><p>Under the National Childcare Scheme which opened for online applications on 20<sup>th<\/sup>November 2019, school-age childcare services who are registered with Tusla are able to avail of subsidies under the new scheme. As Tusla-registration is a requirement, The Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) (Registration of School Age Services) Regulations 2018, announced in December 2017, came into force on 18th February, 2019. These Regulations enable school-age childcare services to register with Tusla and participate in the National Childcare Scheme.These initial Regulations are limited in scope and intent, providing primarily for the registration process, and they will need to be replaced at the earliest opportunity by comprehensive Regulations, which are expected to address wider aspects of quality, including qualification requirements for staff. Earlier this year I launched a public consultation process on Standards and comprehensive Regulations for school-age childcare. This consultation process was launched in Mid-May with an open call for submissions and an online survey. In addition, a focus group session with school-age services and an Open Policy Debate were held in June.  <\/p><p>There has been little change in the proportion of childcare provision that is community-based. According to the Pobal annual sector profile, which is carried out on my Department's behalf, in 2013 approximately 26% of childcare services were community services. The latest data indicates that the proportion in 2018 is approximately 24%. <\/p><p>The annual survey suggests that supply of childcare places currently broadly matches demand. My Department is committed to keeping capacity in the sector under review. Staff from City and County Childcare Committees are available across the country to assist parents who may have difficulty in meeting their childcare needs.<\/p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government included a number of commitments to strengthen supports for school-age childcare. My Department chaired a group with the Department of Education and Skills to progress those commitments in a coherent way and to align relevant bodies of work under our respective areas of responsibility. The result of this work, the Action Plan for School Age Childcare, was published in 2017. <\/p><p>The Action Plan sets out a strategic direction and comprehensive action plan for school age childcare in Ireland, focusing on the 3-year period 2017-2020. It aims to strengthen the quality, access and affordability of School Age Childcare. <\/p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has published guidelines to assist school authorities on how their premises might be utilised for school-age childcare and other activities where it can be facilitated by the school patron\/trustees.<\/p><p>My Department has also provided a programme of capital grants, uptake of which has been very high. In 2019, there were 118<b><\/b>applications with a value of &euro;2,200,000 approved for the creation of 2,308 new School Age places under the school-age capital grant scheme.<\/p><p>While youth groups may choose to provide school-age childcare or other services, to date evidence of this is limited.

However, a self-employed person who is also an employee may satisfy the WFP employment condition (based on their status as an employee).

This is a reduction on the 2017 figure of 8.8% and the rate is now at its lowest since 2008 when it was 6.3%.  The 2018 at-risk-of-poverty rate for children was 15.9%, a reduction on the 2017 figure of 18.4% while the deprivation rate was 19.7%, down from 23.0% in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People (Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures) was published by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in 2014.  It includes a target to reduce the number of children in consistent poverty by at least two-thirds of the 2011 level by 2020.  In 2011, the consistent poverty rate for children was 9.3%, equating to roughly 107,000 children.  By 2013, this had risen significantly to 12.7% (roughly 150,000 children).  The 2018 consistent poverty rate for children of 7.7% equates to some 92,000 children. Therefore, meeting the 2020 target means lifting almost 55,000 children out of poverty by that date, which will be both a challenge and a priority.  <\/p>  <p>  Addressing child poverty was identified as a priority under the 'Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures' (BOBF) framework.  In conjunction with the BOBF Advisory Council, my Department formed an ad hoc group with the objective of working with key officials from other relevant Government Departments and NGOs towards the adoption of a whole of government, multi-dimensional approach to tackling child poverty.  The paper on a 'Whole of Government Approach to Tackling Child Poverty' was published by DEASP in October 2017.  It emphasises the need for a combined approach to tackling child poverty levels in Ireland, involving both income supports and services.  The value of this approach can be seen in the reduction in the child poverty figures over recent years.<\/p>  <p>  Recent Budgets have introduced a number of measures that have had and will continue to have a direct and positive impact on child poverty.  Across Budgets 2017 to 2020,  the Government increased maximum weekly welfare payments by &euro;15 per week with proportionate increases for qualified adult dependents; introduced a new qualified child rate for children over 12 years of age and increased weekly qualified child rates by &euro;6.20 for children under 12 and &euro;10.60 for those over-12.  There were also increases in the income thresholds for the Working Family Payment, and increases in earnings disregards for One Parent Family and Jobseeker Transition payments.<\/p>  <p>  It can take some time for the full impact of budgetary measures to reflected in data from the Survey on Income and Living Conditions.  Given the continuing economic recovery and the measures introduced in recent Budgets, I expect to see the poverty data for 2019 and 2020, when they become available, to show further improvements over the 2018 outcomes.  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the economic recovery is experienced in all regions and by all families, households and individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000088#WREE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Poverty Data","counter":1599,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000088#WREE01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1600,"qnumday":610,"qnumall":"[51306\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000088#WREE01200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons in consistent poverty here based on the latest SILC data; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":1601,"qnumday":611,"qnumall":"[51307\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000088#WREE01300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the national poverty target; the number of persons that will have to be taken out of poverty for the target to be met; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1602,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 610 and 611 together.<\/p>  <p>  The National Social Target for Poverty Reduction aims to reduce consistent poverty from the 2010 baseline of 6.3% to 2% or less by 2020. This was an ambitious target but one to which the Government has remained committed.  Data from the CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) show that consistent poverty rose sharply from the 2010 level, to a peak of 9.0% in 2013.  However the most recent SILC data from 2018 show that this had reduced to 5.6%, down from the 2017 figure of 6.7%.  <\/p>  <p>  Using the CSO estimated population figure for 2018 (4.857m people), the 2018 consistent poverty rate of 5.6% equates to some 272,000 people. Between 2016 (when the rate was 8.3%) and 2018, over 118,000 people were lifted out of consistent poverty.  This is a welcome and significant decrease. Nevertheless, a reduction of over 3.6 percentage points is required to meet the 2% target by 2020. Based on the 2018 estimated population figure, this equates to slightly less than 175,000 people.<\/p>  <p>  While this remains a challenge, I expect the poverty data for 2019 and 2020, when they become available, to show further improvement over the 2018 outcomes in light of the continuing economic recovery and measures introduced in the most recent Budgets.

It shows that the 2018 at-risk-of-poverty rate for people with a principal economic status (PES) of &lsquo;not at work due to illness of disability&rsquo; was 47.7%, an increase on the 2017 rate (35.4%).  In 2018, the at-risk-of-poverty (AROP) threshold for a single person increased by &euro;1,200 to &euro;13,723 per year.  This was primarily driven by an increase in employment income.  <\/p><p>The at-risk-of-poverty rate is determined by the percentage of individuals with an equivalised disposable income below 60% of the median equivalised disposable income. The calculation of equivalised income is based on household income, and thus is dependent on the income of others in the household.  <\/p><p>This is of importance when considering those with a PES of &lsquo;not at work due to illness\/disability&rsquo; in 2018.  Almost 68% of this group were living in households where nobody worked. As a result, the equivalised disposable income of those &lsquo;not working due to illness\/disability&rsquo; did not increase at the same rate as the AROP threshold in 2018.<\/p><p>It is interesting to note that the 2018 deprivation rate for this group was 36.7%, a reduction on the 2017 rate of 45.9%.

The LEEF Pensions Sub Group meets regularly to cover matters concerning pensions.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to provide for sustainable pensions and to facilitate a longer working life, successive Governments have considered the sustainability challenges faced by the Pensions system as a result of changing demographics in Ireland.  In 2007, Minister Cullen launched the Green Paper on Pensions, which proposed raising the Pension Age.  This was followed by a major public consultation exercise. Three years later, in 2010, Minister Hanafin launched the National Pensions Framework which, following a Government decision, set out the agenda of changes in the State Pension Age in 2014, 2021 and 2028.  This strategy was enacted via legislation introduced by then Minister Burton and passed in 2011 which provides for an increase in the State pension age in three separate stages.  In 2014, the State pension age was standardised at 66.  This will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028. <\/p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 has stated that future changes in State pension age after 2035 will be based on research into life expectancy.  This is in keeping with similar measures introduced by most EU and OECD countries.<\/p>  <p>  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  It is the only feasible solution which does not involve reducing pension rates to pensioners (which would result in an increase in the rate of poverty among older people), or reducing other significant areas of Government expenditure (such as other payments made by my Department). <\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that the gross cost to the State Pension (Contributory) of postponing the increase in State Pension Age would be approximately &euro;430m per annum, but the net cost is closer to &euro;217.5 million per annum.  The estimates factor in secondary costs such as foregone PRSI receipts and additional Household Benefit payments.  If the projected changes in 2021 and 2028 were both reversed the estimated net cost therefore, from 2028, would be &euro;435m per annum.

This resulted in quite a number of people who qualified for the State Pension Contributory after that date receiving lesser payments compared to those who qualified before it.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2018, I announced the Government Decision to introduce a new interim Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to the calculation of State Pension that will allow pensioners who reached pension age from September 2012 (i.e., those born on or after 1 September 1946), to have their pension entitlement calculated by an interim &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) which will include up to 20 years of new Home Caring Periods.  This approach benefited many people, particularly women, whose work history included an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  <\/p>  <p>  People whose pensions were decided under the 2000-2012 ratebands (in other words those born before 1 September 1946) were subject to a significantly more generous regime than those who qualified before or afterwards, as a Yearly Average of only 20 contributions per year (out of a maximum of 52) could attract a 98% pension.  The effect of those changes, as it impacted upon those new pensioners since September 2012, will be familiar to anyone who followed the debate on this matter over the last 6 years.  If pre-2012 pensioners were also allowed avail of Home Caring Credits, their arrangements, as a group, would continue to be significantly more generous than those of post-2012 pensioners.

The duties of pension scheme trustees include administering the scheme in accordance with the law and the terms of the trust deed and scheme rules as well as ensuring compliance with the requirements that apply to these schemes.

Changes to guidance issued by the Pensions Authority require the trustees of a pension scheme to notify groups representing the interest of scheme members of proposals to issue a direction under section 50 of the Pensions Act to restructure scheme benefits.  This affords the representative group an opportunity to make a submission to the trustees of a pension scheme in relation to proposals to restructure scheme benefits.  These changes facilitate engagement between groups representing the interests of pensioner and deferred scheme members, the Pension Authority and the trustees of a pension scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Groups representing the interests of pensioners and deferred scheme members have a right to appeal a section 50 direction by the Pensions Authority to the High Court on a point of law.<\/p>  <p>  While current legislation does not specifically provide that member trustees must include at least one or more members from each scheme membership cohort, namely active, deferred and pensioners, it does provide an opportunity for membership from each cohort and such members may avail of the opportunity to become scheme trustees or nominate others to act on their behalf. <\/p>  <p>  As you are aware, the General Scheme of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2017 (now the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017), was published in May 2017 and contained a number of key measures relating to DB pension schemes.  It is intended that these proposed measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act and will provide for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhance employer responsibilities for their schemes. <\/p>  <p>  In developing these measures, it is essential to recognise the current pension landscape in Ireland so that a balanced, proportionate approach is developed and that unintended negative consequences do not arise. <\/p>  <p>  Under existing pensions law, there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions to a scheme.  However, the provisions of this Bill will introduce a new regime into the Pensions Act 1990 which, amongst other things, will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting by providing a 12 month notification, and will enable the Pensions Authority to make a funding obligation direction specifying payments to be made by a sponsoring employer to the pension scheme where no agreement is reached, within a specified time period, to resolve a funding deficit. <\/p>  <p>  The defined benefit pension provisions are very technical and involve complex policy issues.  In order to achieve a resilient solution it has been necessary to consult with and obtain numerous legal advices from the Office of the Attorney General on various aspects of this policy.  When these matters have been resolved and amendments approved by Government, an early date for Committee Stage will be requested. <\/p>  <p>  The Pensions Authority is the regulatory body charged with the supervision of pension schemes and has the necessary powers under statute to investigate the conduct of a pension scheme should it become aware that a scheme is not in compliance with the provisions of the Pensions Act.  Where a pension scheme member is of the view that the scheme is not in compliance with legislative requirements he or she may make a formal complaint to the Pensions Authority.<\/p>  <p>  Any questions relating to access to the State's industrial relations machinery is a matter for the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000089#WRFF04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":1698,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000089#WRFF05000"},{"type":"question","counter":1699,"qnumday":644,"qnumall":"[51797\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000089#WRFF05100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of an appeal for a carer's allowance by a person (details supplied); if their attention was drawn to the decision; and if payment will be expedited.","asker":"1248","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1700,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that two appeals were registered in the name of the person concerned as they had applied for carer's allowance in respect of two carees.

Harnessing the off-balance sheet potential of private investment in social housing is an important contributor to meeting this objective and the social housing targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland over the period to 2021 reflect the ambition in that regard. Of the 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland, 10,000 will be leased by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) under leasing arrangements from a range of different sources and funded under the Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP).

The Government has increased significantly the delivery expected from local authorities through their social housing build programme, but it remains the case that more homes can be provided through leasing than could reasonably be expected to be delivered under construction and acquisition programmes alone. In addition, the cost of delivering social housing units under the traditional construction and acquisition model is not adequately captured by the up-front capital expenditure as each unit will carry a stream of ongoing costs over the long-term including management, maintenance and remediation. Furthermore, during the term of the lease, the responsibility for structural matters remains with the property owner and not the local authority.  At the end of the lease term, the dwelling can require major renovation or upgrading resulting in a substantial capital cost, which under leasing is borne by the owner rather than the local authority.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to increasing the supply of social housing and a primary focus continues to be the construction of new social housing homes.

In particular, it should be noted that the Planning Scheme requires the delivery of 15% of homes for social and affordable housing purposes, which is in addition to the statutory 10% requirement. I understand that NAMA is currently procuring a development partner for the wider site.   <\/p>  <p>  LIHAF is a key element of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan. The objective of the Fund is to provide public off-site infrastructure to relieve critical infrastructure blockages. This will enable the accelerated delivery of housing on key development sites in Dublin and in urban areas of high demand for housing. The LIHAF supports the delivery of up to 20,000 homes, 40% of which will be delivered through an affordable or cost reduced schemes.<\/p>  <p>  The question of affordability is a broader issue and does not arise by virtue of an SDZ designation.  To address this, my Department is focusing on continued increases in overall supply, with a mix of house types and tenure to meet the local demand, supplemented by specific targeted measures to enhance the delivery of social and affordable housing for those who cannot afford to purchase or rent at market prices.  The Government is taking a multi-stranded approach in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  The combination of investment, access to finance, fast track planning and changes to apartment and height guidance has resulted in significant increases in housing supply. Social housing output next year will be the highest at any time this century.<\/p>  <p>  Affordable housing output will steadily increase, with the commencement of the relevant provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 last year, to provide a statutory basis for affordable housing for purchase.  The new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan introduced in February 2018, has seen a drawdown of 1,253 loans, with a further 979 loans awaiting drawdown and the total scheme funding has reached &euro;563 million. <\/p>  <p>  Also in relation to affordability, &euro;310 million has been made available from 2019 until 2021 under the Serviced Site Fund (SSF). The SSF was established to provide key infrastructure, on public lands, to support the delivery of affordable homes to purchase or rent. At a maximum funding rate of &euro;50,000 per affordable home, at least 6,200 homes will be facilitated in total for affordable purchase or cost rental.<\/p>  <p>  The Help to Buy (HTB) scheme is designed to assist first-time buyers with the deposit required to purchase or self-build a new house or apartment to live in as their home. To date, 15,957 Help to Buy claims have been made, of which 15,255 are approved. The estimated total value of the approved HTB claims to date is in the order of &euro;226.3 million.<\/p>  <p>  The Land Development Agency (LDA), which was established by the Government in support of Project Ireland 2040, is advancing a number of projects on State lands, with a minimum requirement of 40% of the housing to be provided as affordable housing in addition to Part V affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that real progress is being made and through the measures outlined, the overall supply of housing is increasing, with a particular emphasis being placed on affordable housing.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000091#WRHH03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":1791,"qnumday":677,"qnumall":"[51712\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000091#WRHH03300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when a social housing development (details supplied) will be approved to award a contract to construct following the furnishing of a tender report to his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1792,"content":"<p>My Department has received a Stage 4 (post-tender) proposal from Limerick City and County Council, which is now being examined and a response will issue to the Council, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000091#WRHH03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Building Regulations Compliance","counter":1793,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000091#WRHH03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1794,"qnumday":678,"qnumall":"[51781\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000091#WRHH03600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if there is a remedy available for a person who is the victim of substandard building work relating to the construction of a new home; if a channel of recourse is open to the homeowner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1795,"content":"<p>Stronger compliance with building standards has been a key priority for Government and has manifested in the Building Control Reform Agenda, which was initiated in 2011, when, a high level working group reviewed the existing building control regulatory framework.

This Strategy, which I published July 2018, strives to provide a targeted, effective and co-ordinated approach to identifying and tackling vacancy across Ireland and draws together all of the strands of ongoing work in one document with a clear vision for moving forward in the next few years.<\/p><p>The strategy acts as an overarching roadmap and a focal point for the co-ordination and implementation of initiatives right across Government to ensure that we are utilising our existing housing stock to the fullest extent possible.

One such example is the innovative website vacanthomes.ie was developed by Mayo County Council in July 2017 on behalf of the local government sector to serve as a central portal for individuals to anonymously log possible vacant homes and to alert local authorities so that they can then follow up with the registered owners.  <\/p><p>It is a key tool in the effort to identify and bring long-term vacant homes back into use, and this source of locally generated information is proving useful in supplementing the country-wide analysis on vacancy and in mobilising communities to assist local authorities in developing and implementing a targeted approach.  The website provides useful information for property owners on how to bring their vacant properties back into use and on available financial supports. <\/p><p>The latest statistics indicate that some 3,422 properties have been registered to date. The breakdown by province is Leinster 48%, Munster 34%. Connacht 15%, and Ulster 3%.<\/p><p>The Action Plan for Rural Development also included a commitment to develop a pilot initiative to encourage increased residential occupancy in town and village centres.

These arrangements commenced in respect of vacant sites included on local authority vacant site registers prior to 1 January 2018 with payment of the levy due in January 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 (the 2018 Act), introduced amendments to the vacant site levy provisions which collectively aim to further strengthen these provisions.  In line with the commitment in Budget 2018, the principal amendment was to increase the rate of levy from 3% to 7% for sites on the vacant site register for the year 2019 onwards. The possibility of applying reduced or zero rates of levy for sites on registers that are subject to a site loan was also removed, reflecting the improved economic circumstances and higher property prices since the levy measure was originally introduced. I have no plans to further amend the vacant site levy provisions at this time. <\/p>  <p>  While application of the levy provisions is a matter for individual local authorities, my Department continues to monitor implementation of the levy to ensure that it is being effectively applied, in line with its intended purpose of incentivising the development of vacant or under-utilised sites in urban areas.  To support this work, progress reports were requested from local authorities and the responses received are currently being examined by my Department to see what further implementation supports may be required.<\/p>  <p>  With a view to further addressing the broader issue of land hoarding, the 2018 Act also amends existing provisions in the planning code relating to the extension of duration of planning permission with the aim of ensuring that planning permissions are activated earlier and that the development works are completed earlier.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the recent review of the Strategic Housing Development (SHD) provisions noted the lower than anticipated activation rates on foot of SHD permissions granted to date. Given the benefits for developers with regard to time savings and consistency in decision making, and taking into account the significant public resources invested in the SHD arrangements, I consider it appropriate that developers should be sufficiently motivated to commence development on foot of an SHD permission, in order to ensure the objectives of the SHD arrangements are more clearly met. <\/p>  <p>  Taking account of the relatively lower than expected activation rate of SHD permissions to date, and with a view to reducing the scope for the potential hoarding of sites with SHD permissions for the purpose of increasing site values, and notwithstanding the Review Group&rsquo;s recommendation to continue monitoring the activation rate for a further period, I consider that it would be timely to introduce a &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; measure now.

It supplements income from commercial rates, from the provision of goods and services and from government grants.<\/p><p>In 2019, 80% or &euro;393.8m of the overall LPT allocation is being used at the discretion of local authorities to support the provision of local services which benefit citizens directly such as parks, libraries, leisure amenities, fire and emergency services, street lighting, maintenance and cleaning of streets.  In addition,  20% or &euro;109.3m of LPT is supporting Housing and Roads services in 2019, supplementing the considerable exchequer funding also provided for these important services. <\/p><p>In 2020, I expect that LPT allocations will increase to &euro;516.8m. The increase is accounted for, in the most part, by the decisions of 19 local authorities to increase their LPT rates above the basic rate for 2020.  The 19 local authorities that voted to increase their LPT above the basic rate are expected to increase LPT income by &euro;19.7m, for their own use in 2020. The equivalent increase in LPT income over the basic rate for the same authorities in 2019 was &euro;3.4m.<\/p><p>Taxation policy, including in respect of LPT, is in the first instance a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform. In this regard, a &lsquo;Review of Local Property Tax&rsquo; was published by the Department of Finance in March of this year and referred by Minister Donohoe to the Budgetary Oversight Committee for its consideration. Chapter 2 and Appendix B of the LPT Review  provide a more detailed outline of LPT as a funding source for local authorities.

It is intended to drive both increased investment and production across the sector by implementing policy recommendations in 8 key areas. Implementation of the Plan is overseen by a high level Steering Group comprising representatives from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, Screen Ireland, the Department of Finance, the Department of Education and Skills, Revenue Commissioners, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland. <\/p><p>I am pleased to report that on 1 December 2019, the First Progress Report on Implementation of the Audiovisual Action Plan was published.  It provides a detailed description of the achievements under the Plan to date.Key highlights are: <\/p><p>- Clear ownership of the Implementation Plan with cross-departmental and agency engagement;<\/p><p>- Extension of the Section 481 tax credit to 2024;<\/p><p>- Revision of section 481 Regulations;<\/p><p>- Increase in funding to Screen Ireland which has led to increased investment in TV drama, skills development, support to visit markets and establishing ways to provide a stronger presence in key markets such as Los Angeles;<\/p><p>- Signing of the revised Council of Europe Convention on Cinematographic Co-production;<\/p><p>- Developments relating to reform of the TV Licence fee model;<\/p><p>- Introduction of the Regional Film Development Uplift;  <\/p><p>- Development of new skills development courses and enhanced training and skills development opportunities as part of section 481 revisions.<\/p><p>This Government highly values the cultural, creative and economic potential of Ireland&rsquo;s audiovisual industry and the growing animation sector is an intrinsic part of that industry. Government policy supports the audiovisual sector through <i>inter alia <\/i>the section 481 tax relief, international film co-production treaties and through funding provided to Screen Ireland, which is the development agency for the Irish Film industry. On 10 April 2018, my Department published &lsquo;Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018-2027&rsquo;, as part of Project Ireland 2040. As part of a commitment of close to &euro;1.2 billion in capital funding for culture and creativity over ten-year period, the Department allocated a &euro;200 million investment in media production and the audio-visual industry within same the period. This funding, is being delivered through Screen Ireland whose change of name from the Irish Film Board in early 2018, acknowledges the widened remit of the agency to develop talent throughout all stages of the film making process, in film, television and animation. Within Screen Ireland, Screen Skills Ireland is responsible for investing in people and skills development for the screen sectors in Ireland. Screen Skills Ireland designs, develops and delivers industry-focused skills development initiatives, encompassing film, TV, animation, games and visual effects, for all roles from new entrants to company leaders. The continuing growth of the audiovisual industry in Ireland relies in part on the continued development of skills and the provision of training to workers in the sector.  With its new role in relation to skills development as part of the section 481 application process, Screen Skills Ireland is working closely with companies right across Ireland, including in counties Carlow and Kilkenny to deliver on that objective. <\/p><p>The Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121000092#WRJJ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"}]
