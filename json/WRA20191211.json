In addition, each local authority has established a Vacant Homes Office and prepared a Vacant Homes Action Plan, supported by dedicated funding provided by my Department.<\/p><p>This approach has allowed the development of innovative approaches, such as the website vacanthomes.ie developed by Mayo County Council in July 2017 on behalf of the local government sector.  This site acts as a central portal for individuals to log possible vacant homes and is proving useful in supplementing the country-wide analysis on vacancy and in mobilising communities to assist local authorities in developing and implementing a targeted approach.  Some 3,422 properties have been registered to date. <\/p><p>The website provides useful information for property owners on how to bring their vacant properties back into use and on available financial supports.

Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.<\/p><p>The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.<\/p><p>However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.<\/p><p>The Government has introduced a number of affordability measures to support people who wish to purchase their own homes. In particular, following a review of the previous two existing local authority home loan schemes, the House Purchase Loan and the Home Choice Loan, a new loan offering, known as the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, was introduced with effect from 1 February 2018. The loan enables credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range.  The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first time buyers  with access to mortgage finance that they may not have otherwise been able to afford at a higher interest rate.<\/p><p>As with previous local authority house purchase loan finance, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is available to first time buyers only. This is to ensure the effective targeting of limited resources. <\/p><p>My Department publishes information on the overall number and value of (i) local authority loan approvals and (ii) local authority loan drawdowns for the RIHL. Local authority approval means that an official letter of offer has been sent to a borrower (and therefore relates to a specific property and loan amount). Information on the RIHL up to Quarter 2 2019, including in relation to the number and value of mortgage approvals and drawdowns and also average loan amounts, is available on the Department's website at the following link: <\/p><p>.<\/p><p>Additionally, the Help To Buy (HTB) incentive, announced in Budget 2017, is designed to assist first-time buyers with the deposit required to purchase or self-build a new house or apartment to live in as their home. The incentive provides for a refund of Income Tax and DIRT paid over the previous four tax years, limited to a maximum of 5% of the purchase value. The HTB refund is capped at &euro;20,000. As of 30 November 2019, 15,903 HTB claims had been approved, to a value of &euro;236m.<\/p><p>The Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure extended the initiative in its current form in Budget 2020.

This mainly comprises income from goods and services, commercial rates, Government grants and Local Property Tax.<\/p>  <p>  Between 2015 and 2019, Irish Water was not liable for commercial rates and approximately &euro;47m p.a. was paid to local authorities to compensate them for the water services-related rates income they would have previously received.   Having regard to a recommendation from the local government sector that this exemption from rates should be removed, Irish Water will become liable for commercial rates from 2020 and the compensation-related funding will cease.  Irish Water will pay commercial rates directly to individual local authorities, following the global valuation process undertaken by the Commissioner for Valuation, in a similar arrangement as applies to other utilities.  The majority of local authorities are expected to see an increase in their rates income arising from this process. <\/p>  <p>  Of course, this is just one of a number of variables that feed into local authority budgets.  For example, there have also been revaluations of other utilities and all of the local authorities likely to lose rates income from the Irish Water valuation would be likely to see their rates income increase from the ESB revaluation.   In addition, there is funding made available from the Local Government Fund (LGF) and the Exchequer funding of &euro;156m being made available through the Local Government Fund (LGF), on a like-for-like basis, will see local authorities receiving &euro;23 million more in Exchequer funding when compared to 2019. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has kept the anticipated financial impact of the changed approach to the rating of Irish Water under review, liaising directly with sectoral representatives and with the most impacted authorities, particularly in the case of the seven authorities who are expected to receive less in the resulting commercial rates than they received previously.  Taking account of other expected changes in incomes and the financial positions of the authorities concerned, Waterford City and County Council and Wicklow County Council were identified as facing significant challenges to deliver balanced budgets in the first year of the changeover.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, Minister Murphy and I are providing a once-off special payment of &euro;2 million to Waterford City and County Council and &euro;300,000 to Wicklow County Council to assist them in 2020 and to allow more time for the necessary rebalancing of income and expenditure.  <\/p>  <p>  Income from commercial rates is for use by local authorities at their discretion and, owing to its nature, is subject to fluctuations from time to time. My Department will continue to monitor the financial impact of the transition of Irish Water to a global utility undertaking for rates purposes, as part of its wider role  in supporting local authorities.

My Department has been examining how best to address this requirement in a proportionate and efficient way.  After approval in 2018 of a General Scheme of a Water Environment (Abstractions) Bill which would introduce a control and registration system over the abstraction of water, my Department undertook a public consultation, which resulted in 28 submissions.<\/p>  <p>  Following examination of those submissions and refinement of the policy approach, I will be returning to Government shortly with a revised General Scheme to give effect to our obligations under the Directive and to introduce a licensing and control system over the abstraction of water generally. <\/p>  <p>  In advance of the primary legislation, and in order to build up a nationwide picture of abstractions, a requirement to register water abstractions in excess of 25 cubic metres per day with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has already been introduced by way of secondary legislation under the European Union (Water Policy) (Abstractions Registration) Regulations 2018. This has been put in place to enable the EPA to assess where particular water pressures as a result of abstraction might exist and, accordingly, better manage abstractions in areas of high risk in the future.

It is estimated that this site can accommodate 484 homes in a high quality mixed-tenure development. It is envisaged that 375 homes will be cost rental, with the remaining homes reserved for social housing. Taken together with an adjacent development of integrated social housing for older people, the overall tenure mix for the area will be 30% social and 70% cost rental.<\/p>  <p>  The homes at Emmet Road will be complemented by commercial, retail, community and open space, including the existing Inchicore Community Sports Centre. To facilitate community engagement, Dublin City Council has established the Inchicore Regeneration Consultative Forum, bringing together local residents, business owners, and civil society organisations. It is envisaged that the development will form a central element in the longer term economic and social regeneration of the Inchicore and Kilmainham areas.<\/p>  <p>  Based on the agreed tenure mix, it is anticipated that the funding for the 30% social housing units will be provided by my Department through existing funding programmes. The 70% of homes that will be available for cost rental will be funded through borrowing, and officials from Dublin City Council and my Department have recently met with the EIB who have reiterated their interest in being involved in supporting this cost rental pilot.<\/p>  <p>  Cost rental is housing where the rents charged cover the cost of delivering, managing and maintaining the homes only. It is not designed to replace traditional social housing provision for low-income households, which remains a priority for the Government. Cost rental is a new tenure option for Ireland, and is one of several schemes which my Department is pursuing to deliver on the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan and ultimately provide more affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  While noting that the financial modelling for projects of this level is heavily influenced by the base case assumptions made, it is my understanding that initial projections by advisers engaged by Dublin City Council have estimated that rents of up to approximately 40% below market rates are achievable.<\/p>  <p>  In order for this project to succeed as a cost rental development, it is important that project funds are recouped on an ongoing basis. As the rent paid by a household in a cost rental tenancy simply reflects the cost of delivering, managing and maintaining the property, a number of measures can be used at the outset of a development in order to make rents more affordable. In the case of St Michael's, this includes the provision of land; the design of housing with value engineering and long term maintenance in mind; a potential State contribution to development costs via the Serviced Sites Fund, and the availability of low-cost, stable finance that is paid back over a long period of time.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to current progress on this project, a Development Framework Plan has been completed on behalf of Dublin City Council. Cost consultants have also completed a report on the construction costs of the plan and assessed the scheme in light of the objective to develop a pilot Cost Rental scheme. The Council is in the process of developing a Stage 1 Capital Works Management Framework application for the social housing element of the development and will submit this to my Department. The Council is also procuring an architect-led integrated design team, who will be responsible for designing the development and taking it as far as the planning stage. Tenders are due before year end and it is envisaged that the design team will be appointed in January 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100070#WRC04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":122,"content":"<p>Question No. 89 answered with Question No. 72.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payment Applications","counter":123,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100070#WRC04800"},{"type":"question","counter":124,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[51113\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100070#WRC04900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the waiting times for processing of HAP applications by each local authority; the additional resources he will release to ensure that waiting times are reduced down to one to two weeks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":125,"content":"<p>Limerick City and County Council provide a highly effective HAP transactional-shared service on behalf of all local authorities. The HAP Shared Services Centre (HAP SSC) manages all HAP-related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord. Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC. On average, HAP applications are processed by the HAP Shared Service Centre within 2 -3 working days of receipt. Any rental payment arising for a given month will then be made to a landlord on the last Wednesday of that month.<\/p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector and the tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord.  The HAP application form comes in two parts; Section A to be completed by the applicant tenant and Section B to be completed by the landlord or agent. An application for HAP will only be accepted by the local authority when both Section A and Section B are completed, signed and returned, along with the required supporting documentation.  Any delay in tenants and landlords supplying this information will impact on the processing time of the HAP application.  The earliest date a HAP payment to the landlord will apply from is the date a complete and valid HAP application has been received by the local authority. <\/p>  <p>  HAP application processing times within local authorities may vary. Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is entered on the system by the local authority and then submitted for processing and payment by the HAP Shared Service Centre.  If there are delays at the processing stage within a local authority, payment to the landlord will be backdated to the date on which a complete and valid application form was received by the local authority.   The landlord is therefore not penalised for any delay.<\/p>  <p>  An analysis of data from the HAP SSC indicates that the average processing time at the end of Q3 2019 within the 31 local authorities is 34 days. My Department has recently written to all local authorities to remind them of the critical need to keep processing times under review at a local level to ensure times are minimised to the greatest extent possible. <\/p>  <p>  To support local authorities in the implementation of the HAP scheme, my Department provides a once off administrative payment of &euro;150 per HAP household to all local authorities.  This administrative payment recognises the resources required to manage the HAP process.  The payment is made directly to local authorities, to offset HAP staffing and administrative costs.  Since 2015 over &euro;9m has been provided to local authorities in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  At the end of Q3 2019, there were over 50,000 households having their housing needs met via HAP and some 29,000 separate landlords and agents in receipt of monthly HAP payments.

Unfortunately, due to the absence of the Executive since early 2017, it has not been possible to convene a Review Meeting since December 2016. Nevertheless, work on implementation has continued as appropriate in each jurisdiction, and to the extent possible in the absence of the Executive.<\/p>  <p>  A key element of the Fresh Start Agreement relates to the ending of the legacy of paramilitarism. On 13 September 2016, the Irish and UK Governments signed an international agreement to establish the Independent Reporting Commission (IRC) and it was subsequently given effect to by legislation in both jurisdictions. The IRC reports annually on progress towards ending continuing paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland, and it published its second report on 4 November. This second IRC report is a sobering reminder of the continuing adverse impact that paramilitarism continues to have on society in Northern Ireland and brings an important and timely focus on what remains to be done to tackle it. The IRC has been active in pursuing its remit and has had a wide engagement with a range of relevant stakeholders, both North and South, and I commend the Commission for its valuable work so far and the efforts it has put into fulfilling its mandate. <\/p>  <p>  The Fresh Start Agreement also provided for the establishment of the Joint Agency Task Force on cross-border crime. That Task Force was launched in Dublin in December 2015, and is bringing forward operational actions in the six priority areas that have been agreed as the focus of operations: Rural Crime; Immigration-related Crime; Excise Fraud; Drugs; Financial Crime; and Human Trafficking. These priorities are, of course, kept under review. There has been very considerable operational activity, with a variety of different operations undertaken across all of the priority areas since the establishment of the Task Force. The Joint Agency Task Force is an important example of the extensive and vital North-South co-operation that is undertaken between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the PSNI and other law enforcement agencies in both jurisdictions aimed at tackling crime and enhancing the safety of all communities on this island.<\/p>  <p>  The Fresh Start Agreement affirmed the parties&rsquo; commitment to implementation of the Stormont House Agreement provisions for dealing with the past. Victims and survivors have had to wait for far too long for a suitable and effective system in Northern Ireland to deal with the legacy of the Troubles. I have engaged extensively with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and with all of the political parties to support a way forward to implement the Stormont House Agreement legacy framework. The Government remains firmly committed to the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement legacy framework, and will continue to engage with the next British Government to see this finally achieved.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Fresh Start Agreement, the Government made a number of financial commitments in support of the agreement, including &euro;75m in respect of the construction of the A5 through Northern Ireland, exploring the development of the Ulster Canal and the Narrow Water Bridge, and funding of &euro;2.5m to support the North West Development Fund. The latter commitment has been provided and the others are being progressed, overseen by a group of senior officials from the Government and the Executive as provided for under the Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  A number of elements of the Good Friday Agreement and the St Andrews Agreements have not yet been fully implemented, and the Government also continues to work to see this achieved. This includes the provision in the St Andrews Agreement in 2006 for an Irish Language Act in Northern Ireland to be enacted by the British Government. Regrettably to date, there has been no agreement within the Executive to take forward what is now a devolved matter. In the successive discussions at Stormont that have been held since March 2017 to support the formation of a new Executive, the Government made consistently our support for an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland, as envisaged under the St Andrews Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  I have engaged extensively with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland throughout these talks processes to encourage the parties to reach an accommodation. The multi-party inclusive talks process convened by the two Governments in May has included a specific working group to seek to reach agreement on rights, language and identity issues, which have proved intractable to date.<\/p>  <p>  All five political parties have engaged constructively in the talks process over the last number of months and progress has been made across a range of important issues. However, some key outstanding issues remain and finding final agreement on these issues will require genuine and courageous dialogue and leadership by the party leaders in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I remain in regular and ongoing contact with Secretary of State Smith on how the two Governments can support the parties in reaching an agreement that will get all of the institutions of the Agreement up and running again. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I have confirmed that the two Governments are ready to take talks in Northern Ireland forward again immediately following the UK general election. It is envisaged that talks will commence as soon as possible after the UK election, potentially on 16 December. This of course depends to some extent on the outcome of the UK election.<\/p>  <p>  People want the devolved power-sharing institutions up and running again to represent their interests and address issues of concern in Northern Ireland at present, including the implementation on an agreed basis of commitments from previous Agreements. The Government will continue to do everything in its power, in accordance with its responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions and the full and effective implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent Agreements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100071#WRD04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":176,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100071#WRD04400"},{"type":"question","counter":177,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[52019\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100071#WRD04500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the meetings the special envoy to the United States of America has had since his appointment; the date and locations of meetings; the travel costs incurred as a consequence of their appointment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":178,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach appointed Deputy John Deasy as Special Envoy to the United States Congress on the Undocumented Irish in June 2017.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  I have made enquiries in relation to the child, the subject of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, and can confirm that the school&rsquo;s NEPS psychologists has been consulting with his parents and the school in relation to the concerns raised in his regard.

The growth in demand for shopping online domestically and globally is driving the retail sector more broadly to develop its online capability in order to enhance its competitiveness.

Therefore, it is critical that our retail sector is both productive and competitive to sustain employment across the country, in the long term. <\/p>  <p>  Technological breakthroughs, as one of the global megatrends, has greatly affected retailing. The pace and progress of technological change has never been greater, and it is clear that this transformation &ndash; although exciting, is challenging for the sector.  The digital economy provides a different retail experience for consumers across Ireland and beyond. Digitalisation has increased the scope for competition in the retail sector, domestically and internationally, as reflected in the growth in online shopping and changing consumer preferences in terms of how people are shopping in town centres.  Sustaining physical retail outlets requires adaptation: many retailers now offer multiple sales channels to sell their goods, from physical stores, to social media, mobile apps and websites. <\/p>  <p>  I want Irish based retailers to compete at the forefront of the digital revolution and have prioritised supporting the retail sector to develop their online capability, in order for them to expand their market reach nationally and internationally and enhance their competitiveness.

The HSE has also begun the development of a Programme for Women's Health in Epilepsy, which will coordinate the national response to issues relating to sodium valproate.  <\/p>  <p>  I understand that the HSE intends to publish its report in the near future.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100076#WRJ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Consultant Recruitment","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100076#WRJ02400"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[51902\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100076#WRJ02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the arrangements made to replace a person (details supplied) who is due to leave his position; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":384,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Children's Health Ireland to respond to you directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100076#WRJ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Delays","counter":385,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100076#WRJ02700"},{"type":"question","counter":386,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[51913\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100076#WRJ02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of a hospital appointment for a person (details supplied) in view of the fact that the person has been on the waiting list for over three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":387,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.<\/p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.<\/p>  <p>  As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of almost &euro;2 billion annually. In 2019 to date, the HSE has approved 31 new medicines and 5 new indications for existing medicines for reimbursement in the public healthcare system. The approvals to date represent an additional investment by the HSE over five years of approximately &euro;220m in providing access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients. It is expected that over 3,000 patients will benefit from access to these new medicines over the next 5 years.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress on drug costs achieved from price reductions under the pricing framework agreed with industry and commercial negotiations conducted by the HSE, the Health Service is still facing very significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines.  The industry continues to develop very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area and the costs involved are a challenge for health systems even in countries with much greater resources than Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has received 2 applications for pricing and reimbursement of ocrelizumab (Ocrevus).  Application 1 is for use of Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. Following a number of rounds of commercial negotiations, an agreement was reached in relation to the commercial terms which will apply to this indication. The HSE intends to progress ocrelizumab for the RMS indication, which has been approved for funding from October 2019, on a patient-specific basis for this indication.<\/p>  <p>  Application 2 is for the use of ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) in terms of disease duration and level of disability, and with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity. On 4 October 2018 the NCPE completed its assessment for this indication. They did not recommend that ocrelizumab be reimbursed for this indication.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE and the manufacturer have had a number of rounds of commercial negotiations in relation to this indication. Commercial discussions have concluded and the medicine has been reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group.  The HSE Senior Leadership Team have received the Drugs Group recommendation. The HSE's final decision on reimbursement will take into consideration the criteria contained in the 2013 Health Act.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has also received an application for reimbursement of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol\/Cannabidiol, THC\/CBD (Sativex) which is indicated as treatment for symptom improvement in adult patients with moderate to severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis who have not responded adequately to other anti-spasticity medication and who demonstrate clinically significant improvement in spasticity related symptoms during an initial trial of therapy.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE commissioned a full HTA with respect to this indication in April 2018. On 12 August 2019, the NCPE received the applicant's submission and the HTA is currently underway.<\/p>  <p>On 14 November 2019, the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product siponimod (Mayzent), intended for the treatment of adult patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) with active disease. The EMA's decision on whether to grant marketing authorisation for siponimod will take into account CHMP's recommendation.<\/p>  <p>  The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced by the pharmaceutical industry in a viable and sustainable manner.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE are working on making greater efficiencies in medicines usage through a range of initiatives both domestically and internationally to ensure the greatest possible access to new treatments for patients in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Medicines Management Programme (MMP), incorporating the Preferred Drugs initiative, is overseeing the implementation of a number of actions to bring about greater value for the taxpayer through cost-effective provision of medicines. These measures include the designation of preferred products with a focus on high-cost prescribing areas, in particular optimising the use of biosimilars. <\/p>  <p>  I and officials have also been engaging over the past number of years with a number of voluntary EU forums.  In June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.  In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative which is being established as part of the work programme of Beneluxa.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100079#WRM01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme Applications","counter":503,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100079#WRM01400"},{"type":"question","counter":504,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[51974\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100079#WRM01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an application by a person (details supplied) for inclusion on the fair deal scheme will be expedited.","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":505,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100079#WRM01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":506,"content":"<p>Question No. 221 answered with Question No. 183.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Delays","counter":507,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100079#WRM01800"},{"type":"question","counter":508,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[51977\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100079#WRM01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will be called for a procedure; the reason for the delay in same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":509,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

There are many reasons for this, such as a patient undertaking the application process for NHSS, awaiting assessment for a home support package, homelessness, ward of court application, and the availability of resources.<\/p>  <p>  When possible, the HSE will use transitional care to accommodate the patient during the period between discharge and the finalisation of new care arrangements, but there can often be a delay, especially in cases where the patient and family are coming to terms with the new circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  This year, services are being stretched more than ever, with demand consistently outstripping supply, and we have seen an increase the number of delayed transfers of care. While the HSE maximises the use of resources, prioritising those requiring discharge from acute hospitals, there is a growing demand for egress support. In response, and in the context of planning and preparing for the challenges of the winter period, the Department and the HSE have been considering a comprehensive approach to the current high-level of DTOCs. However, recognising the urgency of the situation, approval was provided to the HSE to begin actions immediately to the value of &euro;5m in 2019.  As part of these measures the HSE released a significant number of funding approvals within NHSS in September, and provided additional home care and transitional care beds.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE Winter Plan was launched on Thursday 14 November. The aim of the Winter Plan is to ensure that service providers are prepared for the additional external pressures associated with the winter period, including the prolonged holiday period, severe winter weather, seasonal influenza, and the spread of norovirus and other healthcare associated infections.<\/p>  <p>  Nine Winter Action Teams, each aligned to a Community Healthcare Organisation and associated acute hospitals and Hospital Groups, have prepared Integrated Winter Plans. These plans focus on demand management and reduction, staffing availability, timely access to the most appropriate care pathway for patients, and appropriate timely discharge from acute hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE Winter Plan is supported by an additional &euro;26m in winter funding nationally.

As part of this review I have already sought the input from the State energy organisations on the challenges involved. The technical analysis for the review will be conducted by independent consultants to be commissioned following a public procurement exercise. The full terms of reference for this technical analysis of energy security and sustainability are being finalised. As I recently advised the House, I expect the terms of reference will be finalised in early 2020; a public consultation process may form part of the review process.<\/p>  <p>  The review into Ireland's energy security and sustainability will:<\/p>  <p>  -  Consider the optimal actions that need to be taken, in reaching 70% renewable electricity, to ensure Ireland's electricity system is backed up in a secure, safe and sustainable way. <\/p>  <p>  -  Assess the role of gas during the transition, as the lowest CO2 emitting fossil fuel, and consider how and from where it is sourced. <\/p>  <p>  -  Review the role that other technologies can play in the transition, including battery storage, pumped storage, the role of interconnection (both gas and electricity) and the possibilities for hydrogen and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). <\/p>  <p>  -  Consider what the roadmap for renewable electricity looks like in the period from 2030 to achieving carbon neutrality in 2050.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns regarding any conflict of interest by State Bodies, the normal process of policy development and formulation is through engagement with stakeholders, which includes State Agencies and Bodies having statutory responsibility in relation to energy security. In relation to any investments in energy projects by State bodies under the aegis of my Department that may materialise as a result of the review, these will be evaluated, where Ministerial consent is required, in the context of Government policy, including from security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability perspectives. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to energy efficiency, it is universally accepted that the first step towards security of supply and reduced emissions is to reduce the amount of energy used. Actions set out in the Climate Action Plan, which I launched in July, include the energy efficiency of buildings, including the upgrading of 500,000 homes to B2 rating, the delivery of efficient district heating systems, and the reduction in car journeys through better planning, better public transport and promoting home working, all of which are directed towards the efficient use of energy. The Plan also provides for 70% electricity from renewable sources, for 400,000 heat pumps, and for 950,000 electric vehicles by 2030. <\/p>  <p>  The review will have regard to the Climate Action Plan and other relevant information. The outcome of the review will feed into the formulation of future policy on the security and sustainability of our energy systems and structures. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100082#WRP00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Communications","counter":627,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100082#WRP01000"},{"type":"question","counter":628,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[52081\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100082#WRP01100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the details of his engagement, including meetings held with small and medium-sized business organisations, coffee shop owners, waste companies and environmental NGOs, regarding levies proposed for disposable cups prior to the commencement of the public consultation on proposed levies announced on 6 November 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":629,"content":"<p>How we use and dispose of our resources is crucial &ndash; in fact it accounts for 60% of our emissions.

This Forum was established in 2016 to bring together representatives of employers and trade unions with Government Ministers to exchange views on economic and employment issues as they affect the Labour Market and which are of mutual concern.  A Pensions Sub Group of LEEF meets regularly to cover matters concerning pensions.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to provide for sustainable pensions and to facilitate a longer working life, successive Governments have considered the sustainability challenges faced by the Pensions system as a result of changing demographics in Ireland.  In 2007, Minister Cullen launched the Green Paper on Pensions, which proposed raising the Pension Age.  This was followed by a major public consultation exercise. Three years later, in 2010, Minister Hanafin launched the National Pensions Framework which, following a Government decision, set out the agenda of changes in the State Pension Age in 2014, 2021 and 2028.  This strategy was enacted via legislation introduced by then Minister Burton and passed in 2011 which provides for an increase in the State pension age in three separate stages.  In 2014, the State pension age was standardised at 66.  This will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028. <\/p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 has stated that future changes in State pension age after 2035 will be based on research into life expectancy.  This is in keeping with similar measures introduced by most EU and OECD countries.<\/p>  <p>  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  It is the only feasible solution which does not involve reducing pension rates to pensioners (which would result in an increase in the rate of poverty among older people) or reducing other significant areas of Government expenditure (such as other payments made by my Department). <\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that the gross cost to the State Pension (Contributory) of postponing the increase in State Pension Age would be approximately &euro;430m per annum, with a net cost of around &euro;217.5 million per annum.  These estimates factor in secondary costs such as foregone PRSI receipts and additional Household Benefit payments.  Therefore, if the age changes legislated for in 2021 and 2028 were both reversed, the current estimated net cost from 2028 would be c.&euro;435m per annum.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100084#WRR02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":732,"content":"<p>Question No. 299 answered with Question No. 293.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Eligibility","counter":733,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100084#WRR02500"},{"type":"question","counter":734,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[52069\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100084#WRR02600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of a disability allowance suspension in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":735,"content":"<p>A review of this gentleman's disability allowance (DA) was carried out and it was established by a social welfare inspector (SWI) that the person concerned had means not previously disclosed to this department.

The purpose of the SSHA is to capture the total number of households qualified for social housing support across the country whose social housing need is not being met, in order to better understand the level of need for such support. The data garnered through the Summary will allow my Department to target the delivery of social housing supports under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness to those most in need.<\/p><p>Qualified households on social housing waiting lists can have a wide variety of housing needs and it is therefore important that there is a blend of social housing delivery mechanisms available that can meet those diverse needs in the most effective manner.  Under Rebuilding Ireland, the aim is to meet the housing needs of some 138,000 households over the 6 year period 2016 to 2021, and provision is made for this to be achieved through a mix of different mechanisms.  These include build, acquisition and leasing schemes delivered by local authorities or in partnership with Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS). <\/p><p>Over the period of Rebuilding Ireland, 2016 to end Quarter 3 2019, over 90,000 additional households across the country had their housing needs met.

Each quarter, I publish progress against those targets, and this morning I published the Quarter 3 2019 outputs, showing 66% delivery to end September. This data is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .<\/p><p>It is recognised that local authority building activity and the pace of such delivery must continue to increase. Against this background, additional resources, including technical resources, which during the inactive years had been lost to local authorities, continue to be replenished.

However, my message to local authorities has been consistent and it is a message that every possible effort must be made to, at minimum, achieve our targets, if not exceed them.

The full report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  The final numbers provided by the Housing Agency regarding the 2019 assessment show that 68,693 households were assessed as qualified and being in need of social housing support. This represents a decrease of 3,165 households or 4.4% on the last assessment in June 2018. Indeed, since the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan was launched in 2016, the numbers have decreased from 91,600 to 68,693, a reduction of 25%.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that social housing is a demand led service and for that reason it is difficult to predict the degree to which housing lists will decrease or increase over the next 12 months. The number of units delivered by local authorities in a given time period does not necessarily equate to the &lsquo;net need&rsquo; for social housing support reducing by an equivalent number. The nature of the list is dynamic.  As new households are added to it, others are removed as their housing needs are met or where the households themselves indicate that they no longer require State support. <\/p>  <p>  The undertaking of the SSHA assists in providing a more strategic picture of the dynamics of the numbers applying for social housing supports and emerging trends. The purpose of the SSHA is to capture the total number of households qualified for social housing support across the country whose social housing need is not being met, in order to better understand the level of need for such support. The data garnered through the Summary will allow my Department to target the delivery of social housing supports under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness to those most in need.<\/p>  <p>  While it is difficult to predict social housing need, it is important that Housing Authorities are aware in general terms of the potential demand when they are preparing their Housing Strategies as part of their Development Plan process.

This will be important in estimating likely future housing need across tenures.  <\/p>  <p>  Work on the development of the HNDA process has commenced in my Department and an expert advisory group is preparing guidance for local authorities to assist them in conducting a HNDA. This new evidence-based approach will form the basis of a more accurate and consistent projection of demand for different tenures of housing. The HNDA methodology, which it is hoped will be available in early 2020, will comprise guidance and an assessment tool, that will inform local authority HNDA preparation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100085#WRS04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Policy","counter":795,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100085#WRS04200"},{"type":"question","counter":796,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[52163\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100085#WRS04300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the action he will take in terms of reform to address the issue of families having to spend more than half the family income to meet rent payments; if provision will be made by which families can compete with investors in the market place to provide themselves with a home; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":797,"content":"<p>Our private rental market is experiencing ongoing upward pressures due to strong economic and demographic growth. Ultimately the most effective way to reduce and stabilise rents in the medium to long term is to increase supply and accelerate delivery of housing for the private and social rental sectors. At this point, affordability remains a significant issue in the rental market and the Government is tackling this in a number of different ways to help ensure that families can provide themselves with a home - whether that be in the rental market itself or via home purchase. <\/p>  <p>  Acknowledging that renters in Dublin and other major urban centres are facing significant housing access and affordability challenges, the Government is committed to the introduction of a Cost Rental sector in Ireland. Cost Rental relates to housing where the rents charged cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only as opposed to private sector rentals where rents are set by the market, which may lead to high rents in high demand areas. The rent paid by a household in a Cost Rental tenancy will not be driven by market demand. A core objective of Cost Rental is to offer moderate income households the choice of a more affordable and stable form of rental tenure. Over the longer term, as homes are delivered at scale, it is envisaged that Cost Rental will have a stabilising effect on the broader private rental market. Together with delivering more affordable and predictable rents, Cost Rental can make a sustainable impact on national competitiveness and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Strategy for the Rental Sector recognises that rapidly increasing rental inflation is the most significant challenge to security of tenure in the rental sector and that there is a need for a targeted, time-bound and transparent policy response to the issue of rising rents. To address this, the Government introduced the Rent Predictability Measure. This measure, which was provided for by the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, introduced the concept of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) to moderate the rate of rent increases in those areas of the country where rents are highest and rising quickly. <\/p>  <p>  At this stage, some 68% of the approximate 311,000 tenancies in the private rental sector are covered by RPZ designations and come under the 4% rent increase restriction. <\/p>  <p>  In order to support more robust enforcement of the RPZ regime, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 has provided the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) with additional powers and resources to carry out investigations and sanction landlords, if required, for any contravention of the 4% rent increase restriction in Rent Pressure Zones.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has also introduced a number of affordability measures to support people who wish to purchase their own homes. In particular, a new loan offering, known as the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, was introduced with effect from 1 February 2018. The loan enables credit-worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range. The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not have otherwise been able to afford at a higher interest rate.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the Help To Buy (HTB) incentive, announced in Budget 2017, is designed to assist first-time buyers with the deposit required to purchase or self-build a new house or apartment to live in as their home.<\/p>  <p>  The incentive provides for a refund of Income Tax and DIRT paid over the previous four tax years, limited to a maximum of 5% of the purchase value. The HTB refund is capped at &euro;20,000.<\/p>  <p>  As of 30 November 2019, Revenue has received 34,760 applications, and a total of 16,550 HTB claims have been made, of which 15,903 are approved. The estimated total value of approved HTB claims to date is in the order of &euro;236 million.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure, Pascal Donohoe TD, extended the initiative in its current form in Budget 2020. This means that the HTB initiative will remain for another two years until 31st December 2021.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  Increasing the supply of new homes at affordable prices is a key pillar of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan. <\/p>  <p>  Under Rebuilding Ireland the Government has introduced the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund. The objective of the fund is to provide public off-site infrastructure to relieve infrastructure blockages, thereby enabling the accelerated delivery of housing in Dublin and in other urban areas in high demand. Funding of &euro;200m has been allocated across 30 projects over the period to 2021 and work is underway to deliver the infrastructure with an associated housing delivery of up to 20,000 units. About 40% of these homes will be sold at rates which provide a discount on market prices. More than 3,000 will be social units and the remainder will be sold at market rates.<\/p>  <p>  &euro;310m has been made available under the Serviced Sites Fund over the period to 2021 for infrastructure works on local authority lands that will support the delivery of housing for rent or purchase at rates which provide a significant discount on open market costs. Two calls for proposals have been made to date which has resulted in &lsquo;Approval in Principle&rsquo; being given for an allocation of c. &euro;127m in funding to 35 projects and c. 3,200 more affordable homes. It is anticipated that a further call for proposals will issue in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, the affordability provisions set out in Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 came into force. Regulations in relation to a number of operational matters (including schemes of priority) were made earlier this year and further Regulations will be made in the coming months. Under affordable dwelling purchase arrangements, a maximum discount of 40% of the market price will be given. However, unlike previous affordable schemes, the percentage discount provided will remain a Local Authority equity charge until it is repaid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100085#WRS04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Provision","counter":799,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100086#WRT00200"},{"type":"question","counter":800,"qnumday":324,"qnumall":"[52164\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100086#WRT00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the amount of local authority-owned potential building lands available for local authority affordable housing in the greater Dublin area, with particular reference to those counties adjacent to Dublin; if particular reasons have emerged that may inhibit progress of a major house building campaign to meet the demands of the local authority waiting lists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":801,"content":"<p>The development of major local authority residential sites in Dublin and the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), where undersupply and the greatest affordability issues are being experienced, is a major priority for the Government. <\/p><p>In the first instance, it is a matter for each local authority and its elected members to agree the optimal approach to development and financing of its land bank, including the viability of sites for development.
