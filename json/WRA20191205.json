International law is clear that Israeli settlements in occupied territory are illegal, and Ireland and the EU have made their views on settlements known on multiple occasions. Most relevantly to this case, under international law they are not part of the State of Israel. <\/p>  <p>  Clear and non-misleading indication of origin for certain goods is an essential part of the EU's consumer policy. In the specific case of the occupied Palestinian territory, an Interpretative Notice on Indications of Origin was published by the European Commission on 12 November 2015. This provides guidance to importers and retailers on how EU rules on place of origin labelling should be applied in this case. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the case referred to the Court of Justice in June 2018, Ireland, as an interested Member State, lodged observations. The court&rsquo;s judgment, issued on 12 November 2019, found that foodstuffs originating in territories occupied by the State of Israel, must bear the indication of their territory of origin, and when these products originate from an Israeli settlement, this must also be made clear on the label. <\/p>  <p>  The Court of Justice&rsquo;s ruling is an interpretation of France&rsquo;s implementation of the Commission&rsquo;s Notice and associated EU Regulations.

The latest publicly available set of accounts are for 2018 and show that as at 31 December 2018, the financial assets held in the Escrow fund amounted to &euro;14.271 billion. The decrease in the value of the Fund was the result of changes in the value of financial assets, combined with interest expenses, resulting in an overall decrease of &euro;14 million in the value of the Fund. A further &euro;2 million operating expenses has been accrued at the year end. <\/p><p>The full report is available in the following link:  <\/p><p>The arrangements in the Escrow Framework Deed include the agreement that all claims of ownership and access to this money is suspended until the European Courts have concluded proceedings that the Government and Apple have brought.

Depending on the final outcome of the European Court proceedings it is likely that the balance of the Fund at that time will be made available to the successful party i.e. if Ireland and Apple are unsuccessful in their case to Ireland, and if Ireland and Apple are successful in their case to Apple.  <\/p><p>It is not possible at this stage to determine any potential losses or gains that may accrue to the Escrow Fund when the European Courts have made a final determination over the validity of the Commission's decision.

For illustrative purposes, the NTMA estimates that in the current negative interest rate environment, the escrow fund could decline by 0.5% per annum.

Following the Government decision in December 2018 to give greater priority to preparations for a &lsquo;No Deal&rsquo; Brexit, it was agreed to accelerate Revenue&rsquo;s recruitment plans. Revenue continuously adjusts its recruitment, training and deployment of staff in response to business needs including Brexit -related developments.  Revenue&rsquo;s current serving permanent staff number (as at 30 November 2019), is 6,638 (WTE).  Therefore, there are no vacancies at this time. To date in 2019, the average weekly serving permanent staff number is 6,443 (WTE). <\/p><p>To date in 2019, Revenue has appointed over 1,040 staff from open and interdepartmental competitions, at all levels and across a range of functions and specialist areas including tax; information technology; accounting and legal professionals; data analysts; economists; and for Brexit-related roles including Trade Facilitation. Revenue recruitment is an iterative process, critical posts are filled to meet business requirements and recruitment is undertaken to maintain and enhance capability. Revenue is currently recruiting or has recruitment plans in place to fill all critical posts in the context of projected retirements and business needs in 2020.  <\/p><p>Revenue have also advised me that its Vote for each of the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 provided for a staff complement of 5,924, 6014 and 6,114 WTE respectively and the average weekly serving WTE in each of those years was 5,911, 6,008 and 6,085 WTE respectively. Revenue&rsquo;s structure has evolved over time with a focus on ensuring that appropriate resources are applied in response to tax and duty risk. In particular, during 2018, Revenue changed its structure to align resources with risk in five new national Divisions. These changes are reflected in the tables in the following link, which set out the WTE staff complement by functional area, by month, from 2016 to date.  <\/p><p>  \">Payments<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500060#WRE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Appeals Commission","counter":176,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500060#WRE02600"},{"type":"question","counter":177,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[51028\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500060#WRE02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of open roles in the Tax Appeals Commission by functional area and position; the length time the role has remained unfilled in each case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":178,"content":"<p>There has been a significant increase in staffing at the Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) since its establishment in March 2016, increasing from 2 Commissioners and 5 administrative staff at end 2016 to 5 Commissioners and 22 administrative staff in 2019<\/p><p>This increase in staffing follows in large part from an independent review of the workload and operations of the Tax Appeals Commission that I commissioned in 2018.

This figure was reaffirmed in the Section 53 Annual Statement 2020 which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in October 2019. The realisation of the surplus depends on the success of NAMA&rsquo;s ongoing deleveraging and the completion of its Dublin Docklands SDZ and residential funding programmes.<\/p>  <p>  NAMA&rsquo;s &euro;4 billion surplus represents a projected entity return on investment (EROI) of 37%. The EROI is based on the comparison of NAMA&rsquo;s projected terminal surplus position with NAMA&rsquo;s initial investment, as adjusted to exclude the &euro;5.6 billion in State Aid which NAMA was required to pay to the participating institutions as part of the loan acquisition price. NAMA&rsquo;s EROI target benchmark, as approved by its Board in 2014, is 20%. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the surplus has yet to fully crystallise and that the transfer of surplus funds to the Central Fund can only begin after NAMA's remaining subordinated debt and equity obligations have been repaid in full, which is expected to be in mid-2020. It is envisaged that &euro;2 billion will be transferred to the Exchequer in 2020 with a further &euro;2 billion being transferred in 2021. This timeline is contingent on NAMA&rsquo;s projected surplus of &euro;4 billion remaining unchanged and prevailing market conditions that may determine the timing and disposal proceeds of residual assets.<\/p>  <p>  Any NAMA surplus paid, while Exchequer positive, will not impact the general government balance, in line with Eurostat rules. It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the framework of the fiscal rules at that time. The intention has always been to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our national debt and reduce our debt servicing costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500060#WRE04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Data","counter":192,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500060#WRE04200"},{"type":"question","counter":193,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[51034\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500060#WRE04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the annual cost of the research and development tax credit for the past five years including 2019; the number of companies that availed of the scheme in each of the years, by multinational and SME companies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[51035\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500060#WRE04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the annual cost of the knowledge development box in each year since its creation; the number of companies that availed of the scheme in each of the years, by multinational and SME companies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":195,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 78 together.<\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the annual cost of the Research and Development (R&amp;amp;D) tax credit and the number of companies that availed of it for years up to 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, is published on the Revenue website at the following link:<\/p><p>. <\/p><p>The available information in respect of multinational and SME companies is split between companies administered by Revenue&rsquo;s Large Corporates Division (LCD) and non-LCD companies.

I expect that these additional resources at Commissioner level, supported by additional administrative staff and case-managers, will allow significant progress to be made in addressing the existing backlogs.<\/p><p>The following table provides an overview of the number of appeals received and concluded in each month since the establishment of the Tax Appeals Commission on 21 March 2016:<\/p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th colspan=\"9\"><div>Tax Appeals CommissionNumber of Appeals Received and Closed from 21 March 2016 to date<\/div><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Month<\/td>       <td>Received 2016<\/td>       <td>Closed In 2016<\/td>       <td>Received 2017<\/td>       <td>Closed In 2017<\/td>       <td>Received 2018<\/td>       <td>Closed In 2018<\/td>       <td>Received 2019<\/td>       <td>Closed In 2019<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Jan<\/td>       <td>n\/a<\/td>       <td>n\/a<\/td>       <td>560<\/td>       <td>52<\/td>       <td>264<\/td>       <td>64<\/td>       <td>162<\/td>       <td>91<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Feb<\/td>       <td>n\/a<\/td>       <td>n\/a<\/td>       <td>75<\/td>       <td>39<\/td>       <td>134<\/td>       <td>319<\/td>       <td>114<\/td>       <td>59<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mar<\/td>       <td>1,646<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>177<\/td>       <td>74<\/td>       <td>159<\/td>       <td>148<\/td>       <td>116<\/td>       <td>107<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Apr<\/td>       <td>64<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td>91<\/td>       <td>53<\/td>       <td>104<\/td>       <td>141<\/td>       <td>101<\/td>       <td>92<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>May<\/td>       <td>62<\/td>       <td>15<\/td>       <td>106<\/td>       <td>131<\/td>       <td>195<\/td>       <td>121<\/td>       <td>116<\/td>       <td>120<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Jun<\/td>       <td>81<\/td>       <td>15<\/td>       <td>82<\/td>       <td>52<\/td>       <td>72<\/td>       <td>76<\/td>       <td>97<\/td>       <td>148<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Jul<\/td>       <td>97<\/td>       <td>29<\/td>       <td>105<\/td>       <td>51<\/td>       <td>114<\/td>       <td>115<\/td>       <td>128<\/td>       <td>153<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Aug<\/td>       <td>66<\/td>       <td>13<\/td>       <td>90<\/td>       <td>45<\/td>       <td>127<\/td>       <td>55<\/td>       <td>130<\/td>       <td>110<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Sep<\/td>       <td>78<\/td>       <td>16<\/td>       <td>107<\/td>       <td>19<\/td>       <td>108<\/td>       <td>90<\/td>       <td>109<\/td>       <td>174<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Oct<\/td>       <td>73<\/td>       <td>23<\/td>       <td>95<\/td>       <td>49<\/td>       <td>108<\/td>       <td>156<\/td>       <td>112<\/td>       <td>216<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Nov<\/td>       <td>90<\/td>       <td>40<\/td>       <td>107<\/td>       <td>42<\/td>       <td>115<\/td>       <td>72<\/td>       <td>136<\/td>       <td>176<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dec<\/td>       <td>96<\/td>       <td>44<\/td>       <td>152<\/td>       <td>83<\/td>       <td>189<\/td>       <td>81<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total<\/td>       <td>2,353<\/td>       <td>206<\/td>       <td>1,747<\/td>       <td>690<\/td>       <td>1,689<\/td>       <td>1,438<\/td>       <td>1,321<\/td>       <td>1,446<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>I am informed that since its establishment on 21 March 2016, the TAC has cleared appeals relating to &euro;1.4bn in disputed taxes.

This is achieved by providing simplified procedures to the greatest extent possible, user friendly on-line solutions that are available on a 24\/7 basis and high levels of customer support when required.<\/p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s risk identification systems and procedures constantly monitor tax returns to ensure compliance and where anomalies are identified interventions are carried out to confirm the accuracy of the data provided. The intervention type is dependent on the level of risk involved and the level of engagement displayed by the taxpayer. The intervention types include assurance checks for the more straight-forward issues up to tax audit and investigation with a view to prosecution for the more serious risks. Any additional liability identified is subjected to additional penalty and interest charges.  <\/p><p>Revenue also has a clear preference to engage with taxpayers experiencing temporary tax payment difficulties to agree mutually acceptable solutions, which will include an interest element, rather than deploying debt collection\/enforcement sanctions to secure outstanding liabilities. However, where there is no engagement or a lack of commitment to identifying and agreeing a solution then Revenue has no option other than to use its debt collection\/enforcement powers up to and including insolvency proceedings in the most egregious cases.<\/p><p>The number and value of penalties charged\/collected together with the amounts of interest charged\/collected by Revenue for the years 2012 to 2018 and to date in 2019 by tax head are set out in tables 1-4 below. Table 5 sets the number of insolvency cases by category for the years 2012 to 2018 and to date in 2019 that are monitored by Revenue. The monitoring process includes engaging with insolvency practitioners to maximise payment of liabilities, ensuring Company Law is enforced and working constructively with Personal Insolvency Practitioners (PIPs) and Approved Intermediaries.

The relief is granted at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20%), where an individual pays qualifying fees for an approved course, whether on his or her own behalf, or on behalf of another individual. Fees which are met from any other source, from a grant or scholarship fro example, are not allowable.  In addition, examination fees, administration fees and registration fees do not qualify for relief. <\/p>  <p>  The maximum amount of fees that can qualify for the relief is &euro;7,000 per course.  However, an amount must be disregarded from each claim, whether the claim is in respect of one or more students. &ldquo;Qualifying fees&rdquo; for the purposes of the relief mean tuition fees in respect of an approved course, at an approved college, reduced by the amount of the \"student contribution\". The disregarded \"student contribution\" amount is currently &euro;3,000 in the case of a full-time course and &euro;1,500 in the case of a part-time course, and it applies to all third level courses.  This means the first &euro;3,000 or &euro;1,500, as appropriate, of all fees claimed by an individual taxpayer does not attract tax relief. As a claim may relate to one or more students, generally claimants will get full tax relief on the tuition fees for each of the second and subsequent students in their claim. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that it is not possible to identify the number of courses per claimant, or the breakdown between full and part time courses, from the available data in relation to the disregard for third-level tuition fees. It is therefore not possible to provide an estimate of the tax cost associated with changes to the disregard amount, as outlined by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the estimated cost of increasing the maximum benefit from &euro;7,000 to &euro;10,000, &euro;15,000 and &euro;20,000; it is not possible to estimate such costs as it would depend on variables such as the amounts claimed and the numbers in respect of which claims are made. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, regarding allowing the third-level tuition fees relief to be claimed at the higher rate of tax and on the assumption that the Deputy is referring to allowing the relief on third level tuition fees to be claimed at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax; Revenue advise that this change has an estimated cost of &euro;8 million. This does not account for any changes in taxpayer behaviour associated with the increased rate of relief. It is also the case that equity issues would arise in the event of such a change taking place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500061#WRF02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears","counter":234,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500061#WRF03100"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[51070\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500061#WRF03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that banks and financial institutions which placed persons in mortgage distress on split mortgages some years ago as a response to the recession and crisis are now removing persons from the plans and pressurising them to make new arrangements with the banks; if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that this often entails new repayment plans that place enormous burdens on borrowers and unrealistic budgeting plans; his plans to help persons in such a situation; the number of persons placed on split mortgages; if the banks concerned have informed his Department or the Central Bank of their plans to remove persons from split mortgages; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":236,"content":"<p>The protection of borrowers in arrears is a key priority of this Government and the Central Bank of Ireland. The Central Bank's approach to mortgage arrears resolution is focused on ensuring the fair treatment of borrowers through a strong consumer protection framework and ensuring that regulated entities have appropriate arrears resolution strategies and operations in place. <\/p><p>The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013 (CCMA) is a statutory Code that ensures that lenders have fair and transparent processes in place for dealing with borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears.  Within this process, due regard must be given to the fact that each case is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits. All cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the regulated entity, with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his or her mortgage obligations. <\/p><p>The CCMA applies to a mortgage loan secured by a borrower&rsquo;s primary residence. A split mortgage, as referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, is considered to be a type of alternative repayment arrangement (ARA) under the CCMA. A regulated entity must ensure that the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) framework, as set out in the CCMA, is applied not only to cases where a mortgage account first enters into arrears or pre-arrears, but also where an ARA put in place breaks down or where the term comes to an end. The MARP includes obligations to assess the borrower&rsquo;s case based on the full circumstances of the borrower, and to explore all of the options for ARAs offered by that regulated entity in order to determine which options for ARAs are viable for a particular case.  When the term of an ARA comes to an end, the regulated entity must re-assess the borrower&rsquo;s case in accordance with the MARP.<\/p><p>The MARP also requires that a regulated entity must review an ARA at intervals that are appropriate, including at least 30 calendar days in advance of the ARA coming to an end, or at any time if requested by the borrower. Where there has been a change in the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances, the regulated entity must request an updated standard financial statement from the borrower and must consider the appropriateness of the ARA for the borrower. Where an ARA is offered to the borrower, the regulated entity must provide the borrower with a clear explanation of how the ARA works and the reasons why it is appropriate and sustainable for the borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances. The Central Bank has communicated its expectations that regulated entities must also provide the borrower with information on how the borrower&rsquo;s case was assessed, and the reasons why ARAs considered, but not offered to the borrower, are not appropriate and not sustainable for the borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances.<\/p><p>The regulated entity must have in place an appeals process which allows the borrower to appeal certain decisions, including where an ARA is offered but the borrower is not willing to accept, and where no ARA is offered.<\/p><p>The Central Bank carries out its supervision of regulated entities in a number of ways, which includes both desk based and on-site reviews of various activities. In early 2018, I asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible.This Report was published late last year and found that for borrowers who engaged with the process, the CCMA is working effectively as it is intended in the context of the sale of loans by regulated lenders.  Amongst one of the findings in the Report was that when a loan is sold by a bank, any existing ARAs in place with a borrower under the CCMA continues to be honoured until the agreed term of the ARA ends. There was no evidence that borrowers, whose circumstances have not changed, were being moved off existing ARAs during the term of the ARA.<\/p><p>In August 2019, the Central Bank wrote to banks, retail credit firms and credit servicing firms to set out its expectations of all firms in respect of loan sales (the industry letter). The industry letter sets out clear expectations of firms, in particular where a cooperating borrower is complying with the terms of an ARA and their loan is sold, that the new regulated entity cannot unilaterally change the ARA.  Additionally, the letter outlined that the new regulated entity should continue to honour an ARA until review, expiry or by agreement, as appropriate, including honouring timelines and terms and conditions for reviews of the ARA. In cases where the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances have changed, any change to the ARA must comply with the CCMA and be appropriate, sustainable and proportionate to any change(s) in the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances.<\/p><p>The industry letter is available on the Central Bank&rsquo;s <\/p><p>Finally, as at end-June 2019, 21,291 PDH mortgage accounts were in a split mortgage restructure. 85.4 per cent were deemed to be meeting the terms of this restructure type  - <\/p><p><i>of public statistical release <\/i><\/p><p><i>Source<\/i>: Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions Statistics and <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500061#WRF03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":238,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500061#WRF03350"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works","counter":237,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500061#WRF03325"},{"type":"question","counter":238,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[50755\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500061#WRF03350","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if information signs will be relocated at a graveyard (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":239,"content":"<p>Awaiting reply from Department.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Supervisors","counter":240,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500061#WRF03400"},{"type":"question","counter":241,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[50791\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500061#WRF03500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will meet with trade union representatives to discuss recent developments with the pension entitlements of community employment supervisors and related issues; his plans to convene the community sector high level forum to resolve outstanding matters relating to community employment supervisors and other workers' pension entitlements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":242,"content":"<p>This issue relates to a claim by community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors who have been seeking, through their union representatives, the allocation of Exchequer funding to implement a 2008 Labour Court recommendation relating to the provision of a pension scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The matter was the subject of extensive discussion at the Community Sector High Level Forum which was reconvened to examine certain issues pertaining to the Community Employment sector and in particular to ensure that the matter was fully examined having regard to both costs and precedent in the context of the wider Community and Voluntary sector.

My Department has to have regard to the full potential Exchequer exposure associated with setting such a precedent.<\/p>  <p>  It continues to be the position that state organisations are not the employer of the particular employees concerned and accordingly it is not for the State to provide funding for occupational pension scheme provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500061#WRF04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Data","counter":252,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500061#WRF04600"},{"type":"question","counter":253,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[50958\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500061#WRF04700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the funding allocated to flood risk management through the OPW in each of the years 2018 to 2027 that is already committed and due to be committed under the National Development Plan 2018-2027.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":254,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[50959\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500061#WRF04800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the flood defence schemes at construction stage; and the timelines for completion in tabular form.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":255,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[50960\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500061#WRF04900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the flood defence schemes planned from 2018 to 2027 under the National Development Plan 2018-2027; and the timeline for the completion of each in tabular form.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":256,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 to 102, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>Capital expenditure and investment on flooding projects and associated flood risk management measures and programmes for 2018 was &euro;64.64m.<\/p><p>The allocation for flood relief projects and associated flood risk management measures in the 2019 Revised Estimates Volume is &euro;73.127m.<\/p><p>Table 1 below sets out the capital allocation for the flood risk management area for the period 2020 to 2027 as allowed for in the National Development Plan 2018 - 2027.<\/p><p>Table 1 <table>    <tr>       <th>Year<\/th>       <th><\/th>       <th>2020<\/th>       <th>2021<\/th>       <th>2022<\/th>       <th>2023<\/th>       <th>2024<\/th>       <th>2025<\/th>       <th>2026<\/th>       <th>2027<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Allocation<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>&euro;90m<\/td>       <td>&euro;100m<\/td>       <td>&euro;100m<\/td>       <td>&euro;100m<\/td>       <td>&euro;100m<\/td>       <td>&euro;100m<\/td>       <td>&euro;100m<\/td>       <td>&euro;100m<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>The above allocations will allow the Office of Public Works (OPW) in collaboration with Local Authorities to continue implementation of its comprehensive programme of investment in flood relief schemes nationally as I announced in May 2018 at the launch of the 29 Flood Risk Management Plans under the CFRAM Programme.

In order to tackle educational disadvantage, the DEIS programme provides for smaller class sizes and other supports including additional teaching posts, Home School Community Liaison Coordinators, DEIS grants, enhanced book grants, curriculum supports, priority access to Continuing Professional Development and the School Excellence Fund for DEIS. Evidence from the evaluations of the DEIS programme to date demonstrate that it is having a positive effect on tackling educational disadvantage. <\/p>  <p>  The rationale for allocating resources and supports based on a schools&rsquo; level of concentrated disadvantage is based on the existence of a &lsquo;multiplier effect&rsquo;, whereby students attending a school with a high concentration of students from disadvantaged backgrounds have poorer academic outcomes, even taking account of individual social background. This approach is supported by national and international research and will continue to be my Departments approach to addressing educational disadvantage. <\/p>  <p>  In the 2019\/20 school year there are 891 schools in the DEIS Programme serving in excess of 185,000 pupils.

The recently enacted<i>Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Act <\/i>2019 contains provisions that will enable the introduction of the International Education Mark (IEM) alongside the establishment of a new national fund for the Protection for Enrolled Learners (PEL). <\/p><p>The IEM is a core component of the Government's policy for the English language sector.  Only those providers who meet the robust quality assurance procedures of Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) will be allowed to carry the Mark and to recruit international students.  Through the Code of Practice for the IEM, education providers will also be required to establish policies and procedures that address specific areas surrounding the employment of their education and teaching staff.  This will include key matters such as the recruitment, training and the cessation of employment of staff. <\/p><p>This new legislation will also empower QQI to establish a Learner Protection Fund. The fund will be used to &lsquo;teach out&rsquo; a programme in the event that a provider fails to provide it. Should this not be possible, the fund will be used to reimburse students for the most recent fees that have been paid.<\/p><p>In addition, this legislation also provides QQI with additional statutory powers to examine the bona fides and to perform corporate fitness checks of providers. This will allow QQI to assess the track record of providers in terms of their compliance with employment law, their financial robustness and the fit and proper person status of key personnel such as owners, directors and senior management.  <\/p><p>The employment terms and conditions of teachers in the English language education sector was an issue that was debated extensively as this legislation passed through the Oireachtas.  In addition to the measures outlined above, a mediator was appointed to engage with the English language education sector in January of this year. The mediator&rsquo;s remit was to work with employer and employee representative bodies to explore whether there was scope for a set of appropriate employment standards which could be agreed for the sector. The mediator&rsquo;s report, published in July 2019, recommended that an application be made to the Labour Court to establish a Joint Labour Committee (JLC), in accordance with industrial relations legislation, to address all aspects of the working conditions and pay of employees in English language schools with a view to the issuing of an Employment Regulation Order (ERO) for the sector.<\/p><p>Based on this report, Mr Pat Breen T.D., Minister of State for Trade, Employment, Business, EU Digital Single Market and Data Protection, referred the matter to the Labour Court for its consideration.  Following the completion of its deliberations and in accordance with industrial relations legislation, the Labour Court provided its recommendation to Minister Breen in respect of the establishment of a JLC for this sector.

The Bureau&rsquo;s remit is to target a person's assets, wherever situated, which derive, or are suspected to derive, directly or indirectly, from criminal conduct. Since its inception, the Bureau has been at the forefront of fighting organised crime in this jurisdiction and disrupting the activities of criminal gangs by depriving them of ill-gotten assets.<\/p><p>The Bureau is widely regarded as a best practice model in the context of combating organised crime.  It works closely with law enforcement bodies at national and international levels and continues to relentlessly pursue the illicit proceeds of organised crime activity.

The Bureau's budgetary allocation has gone up from &euro;7.042 million in 2016 to &euro;8.603m in 2019.

For the first time, it set out in statute what consent actually means - a free and voluntary agreement between people to engage in sexual activity.<\/p>  <p>  The 2017 Act also set out a non-exhaustive list of circumstances where consent is impossible, such as when a person is asleep or unconscious; if they are being held captive; if they cannot communicate their agreement due to physical inability or disability; if they are mistaken or misled about who the other person is, or what the activity is; or for example if they are so drunk or intoxicated that they are in no position to consider the activity and make up their mind.  <\/p>  <p>  In order for a jury to find a person guilty of rape, three things are necessary.<\/p>  <p>  - Sexual intercourse must have taken place;<\/p>  <p>  - the person must not have consented; and<\/p>  <p>  - the accused person must either have known that person didn&rsquo;t consent, or been reckless as to whether they consented or not.<\/p>  <p>  During the Oireachtas debate on the Bill, the issue of whether a person&rsquo;s belief in consent must be reasonably held was discussed in some detail. As the law stands, the mental element of the offence of rape is not present if the accused honestly believed consent was given, so long as that belief was genuine, no matter how unreasonable or irrational. As a result, a person who held a genuine but completely unreasonable belief that the other person consented would not be found guilty of rape.   <\/p>  <p>  It was on foot of those debates that the Attorney General and my predecessor as Minister discussed the matter and agreed to refer it to the Law Reform Commission, for detailed consideration.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Commission's recently published Report recommends a change in the law to state that the belief of the accused person in consent must be reasonably held. It also touches on some of the surrounding matters which are being examined elsewhere, such as rape myths and stereotypes, obstacles to prosecution in rape cases, the treatment of victims in rape cases and other related matters.<\/p>  <p>  The timing of the Commission's report is particularly welcome, given that the review of protections for vulnerable witness in the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences, chaired by an expert barrister Tom O&rsquo;Malley, is due to be completed by the end of this year.  I intend to consider these two sets of recommendations in tandem, with a view to bringing forward proposals for legislation to implement the recommendations as appropriate, while of course maintaining the necessary fairness and balance inherent in our criminal justice process. <\/p>  <p>  I have no role in the prosecution of offences or convictions for offences, these are entirely matters for the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Courts, who are independent in the exercise of their functions.

These Units are staffed by specially trained personnel and will support the delivery of a consistent and professional approach to the investigation of sexual and domestic crime. <\/p>  <p>  DPSUs are tasked with improving services to victims of domestic and sexual violence, improving the investigation of domestic and sexual violence incidents and identifying and managing risk. I am informed that to date, DPSUs have been established in 13 locations nationwide, namely Carlow, Cork City, DMR South Central, DMR West, Galway, Kerry, Kilkenny, Limerick, Louth and Waterford Garda Divisions as well as the newly established units in DMR East, DMR South and Tipperary.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is expected that DPSUs should be rolled-out to all Divisions on a phased basis by the end Q1, 2020.

The report and the submissions made to the public consultation are available on the LSRA&rsquo;s website at www.lsra.ie. <\/p>  <p>  Based on the evidence gathered, the expert report made a series of 14 proposals to reform legal education and training, including a move to a competency based framework and the establishment of a Legal Practitioner Education and Training (LPET) Committee which would be responsible for setting the statement of competence and defining standards which legal practitioners would achieve on qualification. The LPET Committee would require existing providers of legal education to demonstrate how they meet these standards and to enable new providers to explain how they would seek to meet them.  <\/p>  <p>  In its report to me, the Authority outlined that the implementation of these proposals would entail significant change and required careful consideration and informed debate and that legislative change would also be required.

In addition, a further &euro;1 million funding for the fleet will be included in additional funding to be provided to the Garda Vote before the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  This continuing investment is intended to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet and that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 as amended, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for management and control of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. He is also responsible for the efficient use of Garda resources. This includes responsibility for the allocation of Garda vehicles, in accordance with operational demand.  As Minister, I have no role in these matters. I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities no vans specifically fitted for Public Order Units were allocated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2018 but that 15 such vans have been allocated to date in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  While the issue raised referred to public order vans, the Deputy may also wish to be aware that 42 additional vehicles with a capacity for 4-5 Garda members and two individual cells for the transportation of prisoners were added to the Garda fleet in 2018 and a further 4 such vehicles were added to the fleet in 2019.  I am further advised by the Garda authorities that an additional eight such vehicles are due for allocation before year end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500063#WRH05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Equipment","counter":368,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500063#WRH05300"},{"type":"question","counter":369,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[50954\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500063#WRH05400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if funding has been secured in 2020 for the upgrade of existing boats or extra boats for the Garda water unit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":370,"content":"<p>The resources provided by Government to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached record levels, with an allocation for 2019 of &euro;1.76 billion, increasing to an unprecedented &euro;1.88 billion for 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The capital budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has also been significantly increased.

campaign which supports Ireland&rsquo;s small businesses and enterprises, by providing them with the right advice and training resources to enhance productivity and efficiency, identify opportunities in addressing productivity gaps in line with Future Jobs Ireland, embedding &ldquo;lean&rdquo; practices, greening their business and in reducing waste.\u00a0 This initiative will also focus on training and capability development thereby enhancing customer experience, time and performance management. <\/p>  <p>  The fund of &euro;500,000 is primarily aimed at supporting domestically focused small businesses to examine their current operations in order to identify opportunities in addressing productivity gaps, embedding &ldquo;lean&rdquo; practices, greening their business and in reducing waste.\u00a0 This initiative will also focus on training and capability development thereby enhancing customer experience, time and performance management. The scheme, which was opened to applications from the 14th of October is aimed at enterprises with a turnover or balance sheet total of less than &euro;10M and a workforce of fewer than 50 people across a variety of sectors.\u00a0 Small Irish businesses or enterprises can apply for one of the 200 productivity vouchers valued at &euro;2,500 each, to help them develop a more efficient and productive business operation.\u00a0 To qualify, businesses should examine their current operations and identify opportunities for addressing productivity gaps or improving efficiency in their business. There is a finite quantity of vouchers, so it is a competition to find the most deserving applicants. The applicant must make a convincing case, demonstrating how their business could make the best use of this funding opportunity.\u00a0 The productivity challenge aims to increase business productivity in any of the following ways:<\/p>  <p>  - Improve the quality of products<\/p>  <p>  - Reduce delivery times<\/p>  <p>  - Lower the cost of production<\/p>  <p>  - Reduce business waste <\/p>  <p>  - Increase the ability to generate more revenue<\/p>  <p>  The Productivity Voucher aims to improve the quality of what businesses make, reduce the costs of running the business and help deliver more, faster. It will help businesses find new ways to implement more efficient processes, innovative production techniques, improved delivery systems or find new ways to streamline the organisational methods within a business.<\/p>  <p>  The Productivity Voucher can be used in small businesses to engage and leverage experts who can consult with the businesses and help them assess their value chains and operations. This process can cover supply chain management, internal business and production operations, right through to logistics and distribution networks. Additionally, it can be used to Invest in training &amp;amp; capability development. It will support the development of a more effective, capable and efficient workforce through relevant training. <\/p>  <p>The closing date for applications for The Productivity Challenge Fund was on the 22nd November.\u00a0An Evaluation Panel is currently reviewing applications against the stated criteria to form a? shortlist of 200 businesses who will be selected to receive a Productivity Voucher worth &euro;2,500.\u00a0 Successful applicants will be informed prior to year-end 2019 ?by the Local Enterprise Office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500064#WRJ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Meetings","counter":409,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500064#WRJ03700"},{"type":"question","counter":410,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[50962\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500064#WRJ03800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the details of the discussions at the recent EU Competitiveness Council meeting in Helsinki and the proposals by the Finnish presidency and the European Commission on corporation tax reporting (details supplied); and the position taken by Ireland to safeguard national interests.","asker":"1250","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":411,"content":"<p>The proposal for a Directive to amend Directive 2013\/34\/EU (the Accounting Directive) as regards disclosure of income tax information by certain undertakings and branches (country by country reporting) was made by the European Commission in April 2016.

Moreover, we consider that this measure should have the benefit of tax expertise to ensure that it is consistent with existing reporting requirements and, importantly, with the international cooperation and exchange of information arrangements, which are based on confidentiality.

I want to have a situation where all regions are enabled to realise their potential as contributors to economic recovery and growth.<\/p>  <p>  Since Q1 2015, when the Regional Action Plans for Jobs (RAPJ) commenced there has been an increase of 312,500 people in employment across the State as at Q3 2019, with 195,600 people in the regions outside of Co. Dublin entering employment in that period. That is over 62% - or almost 3 out of every 5 jobs created. <\/p>  <p>  I was pleased to note the latest Labour Force Survey results for Q3 2019 which\u00a0show continued good progress on\u00a0regional employment in the past 12 months. In the year to Q3 2019, employment has increased in six of the eight regions. The West and Mid-East have experienced strong growth, with employment growing by 5.3%\u00a0and 5% respectively. This exceeds employment growth in the State overall of 2.4%.\u00a0 Moreover, the unemployment rate fell in five of the eight regions in the year to Q3 2019. The South-East with an\u00a0unemployment rate of 7.3% is currently the only region with an unemployment rate in excess of the national average by one percentage point.<\/p>  <p>  To continue to build on the progress on employment growth throughout the country, and to ensure that the jobs created are sustainable and of high quality, I launched nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020 earlier this year. The principle behind the Regional Enterprise Plans is collaboration between regional stakeholders on initiatives that can help to realise the region&rsquo;s enterprise development potential. These stakeholders include: Local Authorities, the LEOs, the enterprise agencies, the Regional Skills Forum, tourism bodies, private sector &lsquo;enterprise champions&rsquo;, the Higher Education Institutes and others. <\/p>  <p>  The Regional Enterprise\u00a0Plans continue to deliver to the\u00a0Government's RAPJ target to\u00a0generate\u00a0an uplift of\u00a010 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020 (from a Q1 2015 baseline), with the unemployment rate of each region reduced to not more than one percentage point above the national average.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This Government\u00a0introduced the Regional Enterprise Development Fund in 2017 to support the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects to sustain and add to employment at county, regional and national level in line with the overall ambition of the RAPJs and the current Regional Enterprise Plans initiative. To date, the REDF has been delivered through two competitive calls with 42 projects across all regions securing a total of just under &euro;60 million. <\/p>  <p>  On the 24 June 2019, I announced a further &euro;45 million Call 3 of the Fund.

The study concluded that exposure to nitrates and nitrites from food is not of concern.<\/p><p>The FSAI further advises that the safety of nitrate has been comprehensively evaluated by the European Union and international scientific experts, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the Joint Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the UN \/ World Health Organisation (WHO) Expert Committee on Food Additives.<\/p><p>The Authority states that salts of nitrate and nitrite have been used for curing meat and other perishable produce for decades.

The use of additives in food is strictly regulated by EU legislation which requires that only authorised food additives may be used in the manufacture or preparation of foodstuffs. At EU level, all additives approved for use in current legislation have been evaluated by EFSA or previously by its predecessor, the EU Scientific Committee on Food. Two main nitrite and nitrate salt forms are allowed as food additives. These are sodium and potassium nitrite and sodium and potassium nitrate. Nitrates and nitrites are permitted for use in foods such as raw and processed meats, processed fish, and cheese.<\/p><p>The FSAI points to a number of assessments\/evaluations of relevance, including:<\/p><p>- In June 2017, EFSA re-assessed the safety of nitrate as well as nitrite. EFSA concluded that the exposure to nitrate resulting from its use as a food additive did not lead to an exceedance of the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and was estimated to be less than 5% of the overall exposure to nitrate in food from all dietary sources. EFSA, however, noted that total dietary exposure to nitrate from all sources (food additives, natural presence and contamination) exceeded the current ADI in all European populations considered. Similar conclusions were drawn concerning dietary exposure to nitrites from all sources.  Nitrites contribute to the formation of a group of compounds known as nitrosamines, some of which are carcinogenic. EFSA concluded that the formation of nitrosamines in the body from use of food additives at approved levels was of low concern for human health. However, nitrite unintentionally present in meat products from other sources such as environmental contamination can also contribute to the formation of nitrosamines. EFSA concluded that these levels of nitrosamines could give rise to potential health concerns but that more research was needed to address uncertainties and knowledge gaps in this area.<\/p><p>- In 2008, an assessment carried out by EFSA&rsquo;s <i>Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain<\/i>identified vegetable consumption as the main origin of human exposure to nitrate and to a lesser extent water and other foods.<\/p><p>- On the 26th October 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an agency of the World Health Organization, published the results of its evaluation of the risk of developing cancer from the consumption of red meat and processed meat.  While processed meat was classified as Group 1, &ldquo;carcinogenic to humans&rdquo;, it is important to understand that the classification system indicates the weight of the evidence as to whether an agent is capable of causing cancer and does not measure the level of risk.

These measures represent a key biodiversity component within Ireland&rsquo;s national forest policy as well as contributing to our climate change objectives.<\/p><p>These measures are as follows:<\/p><p>- Native  Woodland Establishment (as represented by Grant &amp;amp; Premium Categories 9 and 10 under the Afforestation Grant &amp;amp; Premium Scheme), which funds the establishment of new native woodland on open &lsquo;greenfield&rsquo;  sites; and<\/p><p>- Native Woodland Conservation Scheme, which promotes the appropriate restoration  of existing native woodland (including the conversion of non-native forest to native woodland), through the provision of financial support to forest  holders towards the cost of appropriate works.<\/p><p>Both measures have been developed and implemented in partnership with Woodlands of Ireland, the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service (NPWS), the Heritage Council, Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) and other native woodland stakeholders.  It is envisaged that both measures will continue to develop over the coming years, based on the ongoing partnership, experiences gained and evolving priorities.<\/p><p>Following the mid-term review of the Forestry Programme, I increased grants and premium rates.  The grant available for Native Woodland Establishment, which both private land owners and local authorities can avail of, is &euro;5,620 per hectare. Under  the Native Woodland Conservation Scheme &ndash; Public Woodland a cost-based grant payment up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 per hectare is available to local authorities and other public land holders.<\/p><p>In this regard, Coillte Nature, a new not-for-profit entity within Coillte, has announced its commitment to converting nine commercial Coillte forests in the Dublin Uplands (Ticknock, Barnaslignan, Carrigolligan, Kilmashogue, Ballyedmonduff, Massey&rsquo;s Wood, Hell Fire, Cruagh and Tibradden) to forests with the primary purpose of recreation and biodiversity.  Conversion from commercial forests to recreational forests will involve a mixture of conventional tree felling and replanting with native tree species, continuous cover forestry (CCF) and long term retention of other tree species. The project is being jointly funded by Coillte and the three Dublin local authorities with grants for native woodland conversion being provided by my Department.<\/p><p>As part of my Department's strategy towards meeting our objectives under the Climate Action Plan and under the National Biodiversity Plan, we plan to actively engage with all public bodies in the near future to encourage them to identify possibilities within their land bank for the establishment of native woodlands.<\/p><p>No applications have been received from local authorities under the Native Woodland Establishment or Native Woodland Conservation, although they have shown significant interest in accessing the Neighbourwood scheme.  This Scheme brings communities and woodlands together by helping local authorities and other landowners, both public and private, to create &lsquo;close-to-home&rsquo; woodland amenities in partnership with communities, for local people to use and enjoy.<\/p><p>Funding is available under three separate elements:<\/p><p>- NeighbourWood (NBR) Establishment funds the establishment of new neighbourwood on open &lsquo;greenfield&rsquo; sites.<\/p><p>- NBR Enhancement funds the silvicultural enhancement of existing woodland already used as neighbourwood, or proposed for development as neighbourwood.<\/p><p>- NBR Facilities funds the installation and upgrade of appropriate recreational facilities within an area submitted under NBR Establishment or NBR Enhancement, or within an existing woodland suitable for recreation but not submitted under NBR Enhancement.<\/p><p>The following is a list of the applications received, and funding provided, to local authorities under the NeighbourWood Scheme:  <table>    <tr>       <th>Applicant<\/th>       <th>Number of Schemes<\/th>       <th>Amount Paid<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Ballina Town Council<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>&euro;123,696.80<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow Co.

The NCS will radically change how this country supports the cost of early learning and care and school age childcare.<\/p>  <p>  Research is on-going to determine areas of specific need that the NDP funding will address when it comes on stream in the coming years.

It removes many of the very restrictive eligibility requirements of the current schemes, linked to Social Protection payments or a Medical Card in order to receive supports. Moving to this new system will be a significant step forward in combating the poverty traps inherent in the current schemes. <\/p><p>Under the current targeted schemes, there are many families with low income-levels who are not currently able to access subsidised childcare, either because they are in low-paid employment or because they are rotating between short periods of employment, unemployment and training. The new Scheme will change this. Many parents will see an increase to the level of subsidy they currently receive, and many new families will benefit for the first time. <\/p><p>The OECD's 2017 Faces of Joblessness report compared the child care supports for lone parents previously available in Ireland with the expected impact of the National Childcare Scheme. It found significant improvement for lone parents. It found for example, that for certain lower paid lone parents working full time, the Scheme will bring net child care costs down from being the highest across the OECD, to 11th highest.<b><\/b>Of course, this analysis was conducted before Budgets 2019 and 2020 which have since further enhanced the Scheme for lone parents and other groups.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>Analysis of the impact of the new scheme conducted using the ESRI's SWITCH model indicated that, on average, the boost to disposable income by the NCS will be larger for one-parent families than for couples, reflecting the typically lower income profile of one-parent families. <\/p><p>Employed lone parents are the family type which will experience the greatest gains, with an effective average disposable income increase of &euro;48 per week.  <\/p><p>These findings reflect the very considerable work undertaken to poverty-proof the NCS<b><\/b>by ensuring that families at or below the relative income poverty line will benefit from the highest subsidy rates. The Scheme is designed so that families who need the most support can receive it. <\/p><p>Parents who are working, studying or who meet certain other conditions will qualify for an enhanced-hours subsidy, up to a maximum of 40 hours per week (rising to 45 hours from September 2020). This supports a key objective of the scheme which is labour activation and in particular female labour activation.  The definitions of &lsquo;work&rsquo; and &lsquo;study&rsquo; are set out in regulations made under the Childcare Support Act 2018 and are comprehensive, covering differing types of work and study arrangements, such as part-time, week on\/ week off and zero hour contract arrangements.  The legislation also provides for &ldquo;bridging periods&rdquo; when a parent is moving between work and study.  <\/p><p>These inclusive arrangements will ensure that parents in a variety of work\/study situations will be able to avail of the National Childcare Scheme.  <\/p><p>Arrangements are in place to monitor the success of the National Childcare Scheme in meeting its objectives, and the Scheme has been designed to be flexible and responsive. Section 26 of the Childcare Support Act 2018 provides for a review of the operation of the scheme to commence 12 months after the first payment of subsidies under the scheme. A report of this review will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The stated policy intention of section 26 of the legislation was to ensure an early review of the Scheme to identify, in a timely way, any key issues or challenges which need to be addressed rapidly. A longer-term review will also be carried out after three years. <\/p><p>The Scheme also has a Monitoring and Evaluation Framework in place to support both ongoing and periodic assessment of the Scheme&rsquo;s success in meeting its objectives, including its objectives in supporting labour market activation and female labour market activation. It sets out the measures which policy-makers will use to monitor the Scheme on a continual basis, as well as to evaluate the Scheme at regular intervals, through a system of regular reporting by Pobal to the Department. <\/p><p>Under Budget 2020, the existing &ldquo;saver&rdquo; arrangement was extended, to ensure that no one loses out in the initial transition to the new Scheme. In this Budget, additional funding was secured to extend the savers beyond August 2020. This means that persons who are registered on the CCS or TEC schemes before they close, and who retain their eligibility, will be able to remain on them indefinitely, for example, until they no longer require early learning and care or school age childcare.  <\/p><p>This and the other changes announced as part of Budget 2020 reflect the underpinning design of the Scheme to be flexible, allowing income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates to be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500073#WRY02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Years Sector","counter":876,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500073#WRY02200"},{"type":"question","counter":877,"qnumday":350,"qnumall":"[50868\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500073#WRY02300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her views on a proposal by an organisation (details supplied) for the establishment of an early years and school age agency to replace Departments and agencies in order to ensure a streamlined, seamless and all-encompassing system in order that early child education and welfare issues are responded to appropriately and to achieve better value for money; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":878,"content":"<p>In First Five, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, published in November 2018, my Department committed to complete a review of the operating model for Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC) in this country. <\/p>  <p>  The existing operating system developed over the years in response to emerging needs.

Ireland continues to enjoy the highest per capita concentration of Men&rsquo;s Sheds in the world.  I provided funding of &euro;500,000 to support the work of Men&rsquo;s Sheds in 2018 and this year I have built on that with a further &euro;500,000 in recognition of the contribution these groups are making to life in Ireland.

For example, during periods of unemployment, credits can cover these gaps in social insurance.  In order to qualify for unemployment credits a person must be fit for, available for and genuinely seeking work.  Credits can also be awarded for a day of notified incapacity for work, periods of statutory leave or while a person is in receipt of certain social welfare payments.<\/p>  <p>  In order to qualify for credits, an individual must previously have entered insurable employment and must have paid at least one PRSI contribution at Class A, B, C, D, E, H or P.  Contributions paid at Class J or S are not reckonable towards the award of credited contributions.<\/p>  <p>  In general, credited contributions can be awarded where a person has had a recent attachment to the workforce i.e. within the last  two  years.  Credits are usually awarded at the same class as the last paid PRSI contribution. For example, if a person paid Class A PRSI in their last employment and are eligible for credits, the credits will protect their potential entitlement to Class A social insurance benefits.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, voluntary contributions are designed to maintain the social insurance record of persons who are no longer employees, or are self-employed and no longer making compulsory PRSI contributions.  The Voluntary Contributions scheme facilitates the payment of contributions directly to the Department on a voluntary basis.<\/p>  <p>  Voluntary contributions can help a person to qualify for certain long-term social insurance payments such as pensions in the future but they do not cover short-term benefits such as illness, maternity or jobseeker's benefits. <\/p>  <p>  To become a voluntary contributor, a person must be under pensionable age, currently 66 years, and have paid at least 520 weeks of compulsory PRSI from either employment or self-employment prior to application.  A person can apply to join the scheme within 60 months from the end of the year in which contributions were last paid.

The recommendations of the Pyrite Panel, which informed the establishment of the pyrite remediation scheme, were premised on a number of pertinent factors.\u00a0 I would support the view that similar factors would need to be examined by the Pyrite Resolution Board in advance of extending the scheme to other areas, given the scheme is ultimately one of last resort.<\/p><p>As a minimum, in order to consider the appropriateness or otherwise of amending the scheme, I understand that the Board would require a report addressing the following information:<\/p><p>- the extent and severity of damage to dwellings in the local authority area caused by pyritic heave in the subfloor hardcore;<\/p><p>- verification, if available, that the damage has been caused by pyrite;<\/p><p>- the background to the occurrence of the damage;<\/p><p>- details of any structural warranty policies for the dwellings;<\/p><p>- the history of the estate&rsquo;s construction, numbers, type of dwellings etc;<\/p><p>- the source of the hardcore supplied to dwellings in the estate; and<\/p><p>- any supporting geological assessments.<\/p><p>In addition to the above, the Board may also make such further enquiries as it considers necessary in order to assist it in considering the matter.\u00a0 In this regard, it would be advisable for the residents to confirm the nature of the pyrite problems in the area, i.e. do the problems stem from reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material which is giving rise to pyritic heave and consequential significant pyritic damage.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The Board may be contacted by phone at Lo call 1890 252842 or by email to info@pyriteboard.ie or alternatively at oireachtasinfo@pyriteboard.ie <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500076#WRBB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing","counter":1041,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500076#WRBB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1042,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[50676\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120500076#WRBB01800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council will be instructed to buy the homes of tenants in receipt of a notice to quit at a location (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1043,"content":"<p>Funding is available to all Local Authorities from my department to acquire homes on a targeted basis for Social Housing use. \u00a0Ultimately, it is the local authorities that identify housing need in their area and oversee and prioritise the development of appropriate responses to meet this need.
