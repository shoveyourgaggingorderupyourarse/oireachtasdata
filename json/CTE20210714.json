I am pleased to bring before the committee two draft Government agreements giving force of law in Ireland to a new double taxation agreement with Kosovo and separately, a new protocol to the existing double taxation agreement with Germany.<\/p> <p>  The new double taxation agreement with Kosovo was signed by ambassador O&rsquo;Neill on behalf of Ireland and the acting head of mission, Ms Arrita Gjakova, on behalf of Kosovo on 25 June 2021 in London.  The protocol to the double taxation agreement with Germany was signed on 19 January 2021 by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and the German ambassador to Ireland, Ms Deike Potzel.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will recall, arising from the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process, Ireland ratified the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting in 2018.  The convention was discussed at this committee and in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and was included in the Finance Act 2018.<\/p> <p>  The BEPS multilateral convention came into force for Ireland in 2019 and updates the majority of Ireland&rsquo;s existing double taxation agreements to make them BEPS compliant.  As was previously indicated to the committee, however, our existing double taxation agreement with Germany was not updated by the multilateral convention but will instead be updated bilaterally to reflect BEPS changes.  This is what the German agreement before the committee seeks to do.<\/p><p>It is another important step in the implementation of the BEPS process and one which Ireland takes seriously in both signing and ratifying the multilateral convention.<\/p><p> Ireland has written to those partner jurisdictions that have not yet signed the convention to discuss options for implementing the BEPS recommendations.  We are committed to ensuring that all our double taxation agreements meet the minimum standards agreed in the BEPS process.<\/p><p> A common feature of both the new agreement with Kosovo and the protocol with Germany is the incorporation of strong tools for tackling tax treaty abuse and anti-avoidance measures.  Both contain the minimum standards committed to during the BEPS project, as well as several measures which are recommended best practices under BEPS, as agreed bilaterally.<\/p><p> Ireland first signed a double taxation agreement with Germany in Dublin in November 1962.  That treaty was replaced in 2011 and there has been one protocol to the new treaty in place since 2014.  In May 2017, the German Federal Ministry of Finance asked the Office of the Revenue Commissioners if the 2011 agreement between Ireland and Germany could be updated by protocol, instead of using the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS.  Ireland agreed to the request and negotiations successfully concluded in February 2020.  That protocol was signed in January of this year and is before the committee today.<\/p><p> The new double taxation agreement with Kosovo is comprehensive in scope and while it generally follows the OECD model convention, it also includes some provisions that feature in the UN model convention.  The agreement contains provisions to deal with BEPS and to make the new double tax agreements fully compliant with the minimum standards under the BEPS project.  As well as the minimum standards, the double taxation agreement contains several measures which are recommended best practices under the BEPS project, as agreed between Ireland and Kosovo.<\/p><p> The treaty with Kosovo will enhance economic relations and co-operation in tax matters between both countries.  Following an approach from Kosovo in 2017, the negotiations were successfully completed.  The treaty is designed to eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation.  The reduced rates of withholding tax on certain dividends, interest and royalties and the safeguards against discriminatory taxation in the agreement will support existing trade and facilitate further trade and investment between both states.<\/p><p> Our network of double taxation agreements is an important aspect of our competitiveness in attracting investment and facilitating Irish business in operating internationally.  In addition, double tax agreements are a cornerstone of Ireland's trade policy and are a key element in stimulating trade and investment flows between countries.  They provide greater certainty and fairness for taxpayers regarding their tax obligations in foreign jurisdictions and they are key to the prevention of double taxation.<\/p><p> The benefits of double taxation agreements are well known but concerns have been expressed that treaties may inadvertently facilitate aggressive tax planning.  This concern was central to the BEPS project and to the BEPS multilateral convention.  Updating our existing double taxation agreements, whether via the multilateral convention or bilaterally, helps to ensure they cannot be used for aggressive tax planning arrangements.<\/p><p> Ireland has been a strong supporter of the BEPS process since its inception and continues to engage positively at both EU and OECD level in addressing the tax challenges that arise from the digitalisation and globalisation of the economy.  Proactively updating our double taxation agreements is a key example of that support.<\/p><p> As indicated in the update to our corporation tax roadmap that I published in January, it is my intention to publish a treaty policy statement at the end of this year or early in 2022.  The proposals under discussion at the OECD have implications for the global network of tax treaties and it is important that any potential treaty outcomes agreed in that forum are reflected in the treaty policy statement.  The rationale for this statement is to take stock of our existing network and formalise our treaty policy.  As a small open economy, a robust treaty network is necessary to facilitate international trade.<\/p><p> We have come from a period of expansion of the network to the point where we have treaties with the vast majority of our international trading partners.  It is my intention that the policy statement will have a particular emphasis on tax treaties with developing countries, having regard to Ireland&rsquo;s development commitments.  We have an excellent reputation for our positive policies towards developing countries through Irish Aid and I want to ensure that our treaty policy is fully consistent with our development policy.  This is also in line with the Government commitment to domestic resource mobilisation policy the aim of which is to strengthen developing countries&rsquo; tax administrative capacity.<\/p><p> To inform the treaty policy statement, I launched a public consultation in April this year that ran until May and received 15 submissions, all of which are available on our website.  My officials have also held a series of stakeholder engagements to discuss the content of the submissions in detail and this will inform our future treaty policy.<\/p><p> If D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the making of these orders by Government, I will include the orders in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 by way of an amendment in the upcoming finance Bill.  This will enable Ireland to complete the necessary notifications to finalise the ratifications of both agreements.<\/p><p> I commend these draft orders to the committee.  I am happy to take questions on them.  I am also aware that the members of the committee have expressed a desire to discuss the ongoing work on the international tax framework at the OECD and I am also open to discussing that matter with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021071400002#A00300","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626217200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire chuig an gcoiste le pl&eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar na double taxation agreements idir Kosovo agus an Ghearm&aacute;in.

Why is that the case?  The Minister told us that in 2017 Germany requested that the 2011 agreement be updated by way of protocol.  Why was that request made?  Why is that the preference in this case?<\/p> <p>  The Minister also said the Government had written to some other jurisdictions that have not yet signed up to the BEPS multilateral convention to discuss options for implementing the BEPS recommendations.

While they are doing that, I will deal with the Deputy's first question as to why we are dealing with our colleagues in Germany through a protocol.  As he will be aware, most of our double tax agreements will be modified using a multilateral convention to implement tax treaty-related measures to prevent BEPS, which entered into force with respect to Ireland on 1 May 2019.  However, in some cases a treaty must be updated bilaterally by protocol.  This is generally where our treaty's partner's domestic law prevents it from implementing the BEPS changes through a multilateral instrument.  This is the case for Germany.  This is being done via a protocol as opposed to the broader multilateral instrument that we use elsewhere because of the compatibility of this issue with German domestic law.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked if I believed we should be adopting standards that are ahead of what is recommended in the OECD BEPS process.  I would generally be cautious about that because my appreciation of these matters is that their force derives from the consistent implementation of the same standards elsewhere and in Ireland.  If we were to develop or implement standards that are not consistent with the BEPS process, it might lead to issues of inconsistency with other jurisdictions.<\/p><p>The countries with which we have not signed a multilateral instrument and which we have contacted are Belarus, Botswana, Ethiopia, Ghana, Moldova, Montenegro, Thailand, the United States of America, Uzbekistan, Vietnam and Zambia.  We have written to all of these countries with regard to this process.  We have received an indication from some of them that they are willing to go ahead with a multilateral instrument.

The Minister has outlined to the committee, in response to questions I put to him, his determination to secure Ireland's interest and the 12.5% tax rate.  He committed to not having this rate increase in the foreseeable future.  Looking from this position, the Minister is spectacularly failing on these negotiations with regard to defending Ireland's interest.  A situation emerged on 9 July whereby 132 of the 139 member jurisdictions of the OECD signed up to the pillar 2 solution to address the tax challenge arising from the digitalisation of the economy.  Seven member states are holding out, including Kenya and Nigeria because, we understand, it does not go far enough.

We need to defend our national interest.  What is the roadmap ahead for the Minister for Finance in these negotiations given the level of support for pillar 2?

What is his strategy?  This is what we are trying to figure out.  What is the Minister's strategy as the international community is pushing ahead with pillar 2?  Yesterday, the US Secretary of the Treasury, Ms Yellen, commented that the hold-out countries are not needed, that the other counties can proceed without us and that the companies will pay the higher level of tax anyway.

If we are going to recognise that I have a prerogative here I also have to recognise that other finance ministers do also.  I am making the case for our rate.  I am making the case for the ability and role of small and medium-sized economies to be able to use a low rate as part of their competitive tax model.  What I will do in the coming period is to continue to engage with the OECD.  I will engage with a group of countries, including obviously our friends and partners in the United States of America.  I will better understand what their own intent is as we approach October.  We will continue to indicate that Ireland wants to be in the negotiations and in the process.  For us to be part of a final agreement we have to have more certainty and more predictability about what that agreement will be than we do at present.  This is the objective I am pursuing.

There are big influencers, as the Minister mentioned, such as the United States.  With 132 out of the 139 signing up to pillar 2, it appears the odds are very much against this country and against the Minister in succeeding to convince enough member states the 12.5% rate would be the appropriate effective tax rate that should be introduced in pillar 2.<\/p> <p>  We know the rate is one thing.  We also know there is potential for carve-outs under pillar 2.  The Minister has decided to maintain a hold-out position.  Is the Minister concerned at all about the reputational damage this has caused?  I made the point previously that the facilitation of some of the practices that went on in our tax code in the past and how our code interacted with others has reputationally damaged us.  I do think this is helpful in the context of these negotiations.  There is potential to provide for carve-outs.  Is this what the Minister will look at?  Does he envisage a situation in October whereby Ireland would still be outside the final agreement?  When the negotiations are finished, does he envisage a situation whereby we could be one of a small number of countries that would be outside the agreement?  As the US Secretary of the Treasury, Ms Yellen, said, the 15% corporate tax rate would apply.  The Minister for Finance, if he is still in position at the time, may not increase the rate but it would apply anyway because of what is contained in pillar 2.<\/p><p>It would just be the case that we would not benefit.

I have always made the case that we have made far more positive and proactive change to our corporate tax code than we have got credit or recognition for.  The final assessment of the reputational impact of the BEPS process will be on individual countries, not just who is in the agreement in October but, more particularly, who will be involved in actually implementing that agreement, what is the speed of that implementation and where countries stand with regard to it.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the different issues that are at play, I make the point respectfully to the committee that this is a negotiation we are involved in.

Having said that, I can still acknowledge that amidst the different issues that we need to have greater certainty on, such as what the base and the rate would be, the Deputy is right to say that there is a language in the current agreement in regard to the scope of carve-outs, but that language is, at the moment, still caveated.

On double tax agreements, many people are of the view that if someone is working in two countries, he or she cannot be paying tax in both and that there is a need for an arrangement to be put in place as a result.  In practice down through the years, however, double tax arrangements, in essence, facilitated large corporations in reducing the amount of tax they paid to a particular state, opting to shift profits to the state where tax is paid at a lower rate and saving themselves considerable sums of money in so doing.  I recognise that arrangements have been put in place to try to cut across that, but they have not succeeded 100% or anything like it.  Will the Minister comment on the extent to which large corporations might be able to continue to shift profits and pay tax at the lower rate?

The first is that double taxation agreements provide for the exchange of information between countries and facilitate Revenue investigations.  That exchange of information is vital in dealing with concerns tax authorities may have in regard to tax evasion.  In this context, double taxation agreements try to create a legal environment in which further progress can be made on the issue to which the Deputy referred.  They also prevent what is deemed to be treaty abuse.  This involves putting in place measures, such as a principal purpose test, to deny treaty benefits where one of the main purposes of a transaction is to obtain those benefits.  I refer to transactions that are put in place with the main aim of trying to utilise some of the benefits that would be available through double taxation agreements.

The requirement is not 35,000 or 38,000 houses but in the region of 70,000 to 75,000 houses in the first year and the second year and then we would need to review the situation.<\/p><p>This will become more acute as the country recovers from the pandemic, something we all expect and hope for.  The demand will be greater and the need for housing provision will be far more than it has been in the past.<\/p><p> I am not asking the Minister to give a commitment today but I am asking that it be borne in mind.  My experience and my humble knowledge of the housing situation and the manner in which I have had to deal with it over many years have long since led me to the conclusion that we should not do things over a five-year period or a ten-year period.  If we go that route, the children who are being born now will be adults before we reach a situation where we can say a person will have a house within a reasonable time.  It is all about affordability, availability and supply.  The only way that can be done is by a dramatic upsurge in the delivery of houses by whatever means possible.  Even if we have to appeal to building firms from abroad to do the construction work, we need to do it soon.<\/p><p> Another point relates to the national summer report and the plan.  In the United Kingdom there are indications of inflation above what was anticipated by the UK Government.  How are we heading in that direction?  How do we see it developing given that we have had to give, correctly, considerable incentives to employers and employees to maintain some semblance of support for the economy?  Some economists have said in the past that where such incentives are given there may be a necessity to control prices as well.  I can see where that is coming from.  How do we deal with that?  Do we ignore it?  Do we introduce any measures to discourage inflation given inflation on housing will be an even greater catastrophe than we have seen before?  They are my two questions.  Do I let the Minister reply or will I go on to the other questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021071400002#E01400","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626217200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I will ask the Minister to respond and then you can come back in again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021071400002#F00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1626217200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I will deal with the first question raised.  Of course we are going to do all we can to try to deliver a significant increase in the building of homes as quickly as we can.  I do not need to tell Deputy Durkan about the step back we have taken in home construction due to the impact of Covid-19.  This is why trying to open construction in Ireland safely is so important and that is what we are trying to do.  In the funding decisions we will make for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage we will try to ensure we have the level of funding in place to allow those involved to build as many homes as quickly as they can and in the greatest number.<\/p> <p>  That leads on to a point the Deputy made with me.  As much as we want to do this quickly, we have constraints in terms of the size of the construction sector as it rebuilds itself after Covid and in terms of the need to ensure we have sufficient planning permission available to be activated for building.  These are all issues Deputy Durkan is well aware of.  I would respond to the key point he is making by saying we are trying to put in place the funding and commitment to build as much as we can as quickly as we can.<\/p> <p>  The second issue raised related to inflation and price controls.  Deputy Durkan will be aware of the real legal obstacles in place when it comes to the installation of price controls.  He will know better than I do we operate within the Single Market and within the European Union.  Price controls are legally difficult to do.  Moreover, I am not sure they are always in the best interests of the consumer.<\/p> <p>  That being said, inflation is undoubtedly an issue we need to monitor closely in Ireland.  The inflation outlook for the Irish economy is moderate, at between 0.7% and 1% for the economy overall.  However, the inflation figures published in America yesterday were in excess of 5%.  This demonstrates to us the pressures under way elsewhere in the global economy.  What can we do to try to mitigate their effect in Ireland?  It is about supply and taking measures to drive efficiency in the economy.  Then it will be about safely opening in a sustainable way so that as higher demand for certain things materialises, fuelled by higher levels of savings within the economy, we have an economy that is operating as normally as possible to provide the goods and services to meet those demands.  These are the avenues through which we will be better able to deliver rather than by imposing price controls within our economy, for the reasons I have touched on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021071400002#F00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1626217200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I agree in general on the point that we are members of the European Union.  Mind you, we do not always get the same benefits in terms of various issues as some of our colleagues across the European Union.  That is why I raised the issue in the first place.<\/p><p>In the 1980s the construction sector had what was called a certificate of reasonable value.  That was dreaded by those in the construction industry on the basis that it was a big hold-up in the construction of houses.  It was not actually as the houses were constructed but it prevented interventions.  For instance, investment funds could not intervene unreasonably and impose an extra cost on the houses being built for consumers and the people.  I would like that to be borne in mind.  No one wanted it but it had an effect.  The fact is it has not been introduced since.  There was no need for it to be introduced as we were able to produce houses to meet the needs of people.<\/p><p>There is a double taxation agreement affecting Germany and other countries.

Is it generally acknowledged that Ireland is geographically on the periphery of Europe, even more so following Brexit?  This is a distinct disadvantage as we now know.  Notwithstanding the strong support we received from European colleagues, which we greatly appreciated, we should not allow ourselves to be lulled into a false sense of security or into the belief that we are through that.  We are now going to be judged on a different level and this could have serious consequences for us because we still have to transport goods and services throughout or around the neighbouring state and into the European Union before we come into the area where we are at the centre of activity.  Our hearts might be in Europe but our geographic location places us somewhat at a disadvantage.

That is deeply important.  If countries will move, they will do so in an expectation that others are doing so at roughly the same time.  All I can do now is acknowledge that the Deputy's question does cut to the heart of where the process is now and is one which requires much further clarification as we approach October.<\/p> <p>  On the means of collection, I think the Deputy was referring to the importance of tax measures that recognise innovation and research.

Employing many hundreds of thousands right across the country, these are the sectors that thrive when people congregate to enjoy time together and when local communities and businesses flourish.  All of them, however, have been dreadfully impacted by the restrictions imposed on our society during the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  Large parts of these sectors will be among the last to return to full operations as the country reopens.  Our cultural institutions and theatres, tourism destinations, hospitality businesses, sporting occasions, Gaeltacht communities and local media have endured great challenges since March of last year, yet these are the very sectors that have brought us light through the dark times and it has been demonstrated that without question, they are essential for our physical, social and mental well-being.<\/p> <p>  I am deeply conscious of the effects that measures taken in the interests of public health have had on businesses, in particular the hundreds of thousands of workers whose ability to make a living has been excruciatingly curtailed and for so long.  We should also recognise that these tough decisions have enabled all of us through collective action to protect the most vulnerable in our society and with the ongoing roll-out of the vaccination programme, we now find ourselves positioned where we can start to move on from the pandemic and focus our efforts on economic and social recovery.  Over the coming months, as the restrictions continue to ease and the vaccine programme continues its roll-out, we will see the safe and successful reopening of our society and with it, our tourism sector, arts and culture venues and events and the eventual welcoming back of fans to our sports grounds.<\/p> <p>  The 2021 Further Revised Estimates for my Department have been informed by ongoing engagement with sectoral representatives.  The additional funding is providing for a strong suite of significant measures as a robust and targeted response to this crisis.  It it will support resilience and recovery and ensure that Ireland can prosper once more on the global stage in the fields of tourism, culture, sport and linguistic heritage.  These sectors, individually and cumulatively, are an integral part of the fabric of our society, most particularly in rural and regional areas where they support economic activity and physical and societal well-being.  Well-being is a core principle underpinning the living with Covid plan and it will be fundamental to public confidence and resilience as we emerge from and manage the crisis over the longer term.<\/p> <p>  Total 2021 funding for the sectors supported by my Department is as follows.  There will be &euro;220.9 million for tourism services, including a &euro;55 million support fund for strategic tourism businesses and &euro;5 million for training and digitalisation support in the sector.  These measures are complementary to the employment wage subsidy scheme, the Covid restrictions support schemes and the restart scheme.  Thus far, three phases of the tourism business continuity schemes have been launched aimed at improving the competitiveness and viability of businesses in the sector.  I also launched a &euro;17 million outdoor dining enhancement scheme being delivered in partnership between F&aacute;ilte Ireland and local authorities across the country.  This scheme is providing funding for tourism and hospitality business to develop and increase their own outdoor seating capacity and is providing funding to local authorities to develop permanent outdoor public dining spaces in towns and urban centres similar to those that exist in various European cities.  In addition, the tourism sector has been able to avail of cross-Government supports, including the reduction in the VAT rate, which was recently extended to September 2022; the Covid restrictions support scheme and the rates waiver extension, representing a significant cross-Government response to the existential impact of Covid-19.<\/p><p> Total funding for the arts and culture sector in 2021 is &euro;341 million, an increase of 74% compared with the initial allocation in budget 2020.  The additional funding provides for a 2021 allocation of &euro;130 million for the Arts Council, an increase of 24% on 2020.  This additional investment empowers the Arts Council to help artists, arts workers and arts organisations come through this crisis and play their part in the national recovery.  Significant support is also being provided for live entertainment in the amount of &euro;50 million.  This funding has allowed for &euro;25 million to fund a new live performance support scheme, &euro;14 million for a new support scheme for live entertainment businesses, &euro;5 million to support local authorities for outdoor live performances, &euro;5 million capital supports for the live entertainment sector and &euro;1 million to fund the St. Patrick's Festival.<\/p><p> There is provision for &euro;8 million to facilitate the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra to the National Concert Hall.  This will be a significant step towards the objective of enabling the orchestra to be established as a world-class orchestra that will, with the National Concert Hall, provide a creative and imaginative programme strategy that will greatly enhance the offering of the combined organisation to the public.<\/p><p> The audiovisual industry was been one of the success stories of 2020, with on-screen success in the form of \"Normal People\" but also its track record in maintaining output in the face of Covid-19.  I am, therefore, very pleased to be able to increase Screen Ireland&rsquo;s funding by &euro;6 million to &euro;30.1 million in 2021.  Funding of &euro;280.5 million will be provided for media and broadcasting in 2021 in recognition of the critical communication role of this sector during the current crisis.  An additional &euro;3.5 million is being provided to TG4 and the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra to the National Concert Hall outlined earlier will also have reciprocal benefits for RT&Eacute; and is evidence of the synergies that can be brought to bear with the culture and broadcasting and media sectors now part of the same brief.<\/p><p> I am satisfied the increased allocation for my Department in 2021 of &euro;1.092 billion allows for the continuation and enhancement of its very diverse but critical work programmes.  As Minister, I intend to do everything possible to ensure that as we emerge from the shadow of Covid-19, we will have a world-renowned tourism industry, a vibrant arts and culture sector, a dynamic sports and media sector and a landscape in which our language and our engagement with it can continue to grow.

In addition, resources have been provided in 2021 to progress the first projects allocated funding under the new large-scale sport infrastructure fund.  Current funding support for Sport Ireland programmes totals &euro;91.91 million, enabling Sport Ireland to ensure our athletes are supported to achieve their potential at the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, to ensure core grant funding for our sporting bodies to sustain them through the challenging months to come and to fund Sport Ireland participation programmes.<\/p> <p>  This is a very considerable investment in sport.  The funding will allow grant funding for our sporting bodies to sustain them through this challenging period and I know clubs across the country have welcomed the sports capital programme, while the increase in dormant accounts funding will promote and sustain participation in sport and physical activity, particularly in hard to reach communities.

Phase 1 of that involves a major digital video campaign, which went live from 7 June with the slogan, \"Let's get back to Ireland\".  That is definitely the message we want.  We hope that online video will build anticipation for holidays in Ireland this summer.<\/p> <p>  From my engagement with Tourism Ireland, it is quite clear that there is pent-up demand to come here and we are tapping into that.  Tourism Ireland also hopes to launch the next phase of the campaign in the coming weeks in line with Government plans for the reopening of international travel.

In budget 2021, Screen Ireland was allocated an additional &euro;9 million over and above its 2020 allocation.  This increased funding has helped to address significant levels of feature film production delay and will assist with costs relating to the implementation of health and safety protocols.  Much of the groundwork for the success of the audiovisual sector in Ireland was laid in recent years, for example through the launch of the audiovisual action plan in 2018.  The budget 2021 announcements addressed two key elements of that action plan: the regional film development uplift, which will see the enhanced tax credit of 5% in place for an additional year, and the announcement that work will now commence on the development of a tax credit for the digital gaming sector.  Again, I am acutely aware, but it is no harm saying it on this platform, that this funding has made a difference.  I am aware of that as I go into the budget negotiations.
