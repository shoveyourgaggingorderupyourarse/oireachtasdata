Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine, proceeded in Ukrainian as follows:<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649235300,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.  Mr. Speaker, Taoiseach, dear Senators and Members of the Parliament, dear people of Ireland, this night our territory was again hit by Russian missiles.<\/p> <p>It was done cunningly and it hit civilian infrastructure.  The new fuel storage depot was hit.  This is viewed by Russia as a target.  This is their attribute.  They are destroying things that are sustaining livelihoods to people.  They are hitting places where we store fuel, food storage depots, agricultural equipment and fields.  They are putting mines into the fields.  They have also blocked all of our seaports, together with the vessels that already had agricultural cargos for export.  Why are they doing this?  Because for them, hunger is also a weapon &mdash; a weapon against us ordinary people as an instrument of domination.  Ukraine is one of the leading food-supplying countries in the world.  This is not just about the deficit and the threat of hunger for more than dozens of countries, Asia and Africa; it is about even more because there will be a shortage of food and the prices will go up.  This is reality for millions of people who are hungry.  It will be more difficult for them to feed their families, especially in north Africa.<\/p> <p> They are undermining our seeding time, they are destroying our infrastructure and they are deliberately provoking the food crisis.  What will happen as the result of this crisis?  At the least, there will be political turbulence.  At a maximum, there will be binges of violence and new refugees looking to save their lives.  Russia is using this hunger weapon.<\/p> <p> The worst thing is the city of Mariupol.  This city of 500,000 inhabitants was put under siege and Russia has blocked access from the soil and from the sea.  They are blocking the humanitarian cargo.  They are not allowing anything to come through, neither water nor medication.  While it was snowing, people could melt the snow to get water.  Now they do not have even that.<\/p> <p> They are bombing 24-7.  There are air strikes and bombings in Mariupol.  There is no single house left intact in a city of half a million.  None.  The dead and killed were simply buried in the yards of the condominiums.  In many cases, they could not even do that: the bodies were just left there lying on the streets and in the remnants of the buildings and basements.  We do not know how many citizens of Mariupol have been killed by Russia, but we know for sure this was part of general occupation tactics.  They have done the same or they have attempted to do the same with the cities of Chernihiv, Sumy, Okhtyrka, Kharkiv, Izyum, Volnovakha and many other Ukrainian cities.  Maybe you have not heard those geographic names yet but this is about millions of people that Russia has been continually trying to destroy.<\/p> <p> When you hear these things, it may seem that this is not possible.  It may seem that none in the present-day world would dare to do that, but these are real facts.  The fact is that Mariupol citizens were drawing the maps of how to find the bodies of the dead who were buried in their yards.  The fact is that Russian occupants were killing people on the roads when they were trying to escape.  They blocked cities.  Until today on the Ukrainian highways we have hundreds of shot in burned cars.  The fact is that Russian soldiers were not even trying to take these bodies out of the streets.  While Bucha and Irpin were under occupation, these dead bodies were simply lying on the streets, on the sideways, in the yards of the houses, anywhere.  The fact is that in the 42 days of the all-out Russian war, at least 167 children have been killed in Ukraine.<\/p> <p>We do not yet know all the atrocities of Mariupol and the victims in all the areas of Ukraine where the fighting is still going on.  The fact is that, as a result of Russian shelling, 927 educational institutions and 258 hospitals were damaged.  The Russians even shot at 78 ambulances.  They were targeting even churches and shelters where they knew for sure there was nobody but women and children.  This is a fact.<\/p> <p> The country that is doing this does not deserve to be in the circle of civilised countries.  It should be held responsible for everything it has done on Ukrainian soil.  The Russians have come to Ukraine as a colonising army.  Their state protagonists and their politicians are not even concealing what they want.  In the 21st century, they are looking at their country as a colonial empire which allegedly has the right to subdue neighbouring people, destroy the foundations of their independent life and destroy their identity, everything that makes us Ukrainians.  Russian soldiers were deliberately looking for and killing teachers in the occupied districts.  They are abducting local government leaders and they are killing community leaders.  Together with the Russian army, there were special groups coming in who were trying to destroy any political opposition.<\/p> <p> Now, when we are hearing new rhetoric about the sanctions against the Russian opposition, I cannot tolerate any indecisiveness after everything we have gone through in Ukraine and after everything that Russian troops have done.  Today, when the world knows about the crimes against our people, we still have to convince even some European companies to abandon the Russian market.  We still have to convince foreign politicians that we need to cut any ties of Russian banks with the global financial system.  We still have to convince Europe that Russian oil cannot feed the Russian military machine with new sources of funding.<\/p> <p> Ladies and gentlemen, the people of Ireland have been supporting good and have been supporting Ukraine since the very first days.  This is a fact.  They did not doubt starting to help us; they began doing this right away.  Although Ireland is a neutral country, it has not remained neutral to the disaster and to the mishaps that Russia has brought to Ukraine.  I am grateful to every citizen of Ireland.  Thank you for supporting sanctions against Russia, thank you for the humanitarian and financial support extended to our country and thank you for your care of our Ukrainian people who found shelter on your land.  Think about the fact that, as of today, 10 million Ukrainians have been left without shelter by Russia.  They had to leave their native cities because of this war.  This is something we cannot come to grips with.  It means that Russia has not yet abandoned its plans.  It is still looking to subdue and occupy all the Ukrainian people.<\/p> <p> We want you to help us to make sure that Russia will start looking for peace and leave us alone.  I ask you to show more leadership in our anti-war coalition.  I ask you to convince EU partners to introduce even more rigid sanctions against Russia that would really make sure that the Russian war machine will stop.  We have to put an end to trading with Russia.  We have to cut the ties of Russian banks to the global system and cut the sources of their income from oil that they use for their weapons and for killing.<\/p> <p>There are mechanisms through which this can be done.  The only thing we are lacking is a principled approach from some political and business leaders who still think war and war crimes are not as horrific as financial losses.  I am sure Ireland's leadership can make a difference and change this.  I am sure that the whole of Europe will be able to stop this war and bring peace and stability to the east of Europe.  We cannot delay any longer.  The longer Russia's aggression continues, the worse the consequences will be not only for our Continent, but for neighbouring regions.  <br\/><br\/>I say to Members and to the people of Ireland that our principled approach and courage have already turned a new page in the relationship between Ukraine and Ireland.  Our mutual understanding and mutual respect is already at a level whereby it is only a question of time before we can start living in a common European home.  Thank you for Ireland's support for the accelerated procedure to provide membership of the EU to Ukraine.  With your support, the process will be even faster and beneficial to both our nations.  We need to start thinking about the restoration of our country after the war.  We are inviting leading countries of the world to participate in rebuilding and restoring Ukraine.  Of course, Ireland is always welcome to participate, for example, in Kherson Oblast.  Ireland is known for its skill in valueing lives, its community development experience and its economic potential.  Let us bring our efforts together and show that, jointly, Ukraine and Ireland can do much more than the biggest country in the world was trying to destroy.  I am grateful to Ireland.  <i>Slava Ukraini<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600004#B00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

We have much to digest as this painful, awful war on our Continent&rsquo;s mainland continues apace.  As Ukrainian people continue to die, we must act.  What we have seen in recent days and the extent of the barbaric actions visited upon the people of Ukraine is simply horrendous.  We need international courts to give a transparent and fair reckoning for the bloodshed in these heinous crimes.<\/p>  <p>  Your Excellency, we salute your own personal bravery over the past weeks and we salute the outstanding bravery and resilience of the Ukrainian people in the face of unprovoked aggression.  While Ireland is a militarily neutral country, we are not politically neutral.  We do not stand idly by.  We will not, as W.B. Yeats might have said, forsake the little streets hurled upon the great.  We will continue to offer practical, on-the-ground support to our Ukrainian friends.  We will also continue to welcome those forced to leave Ukraine seeking safety on foreign shores.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. President, we Irish are aware of the pain of separation and the loss of our people to distant lands.  At this challenging time, those forced to leave Ukraine are welcome here in Ireland and they will be supported and assisted until such time as they are free to return to rebuild their damaged homeland, an exercise we will help you with.<\/p> <p>Most of us here in this Chamber became involved in politics and public life because we trust in people and we believe that most people are fundamentally good.  Last Tuesday at the Conference of Speakers of the European Union Parliaments in Ljubljana I called upon the 450 members of the Duma to shoulder their responsibility.  The law of averages suggests that among the 450 members of that Parliament there must be people who can see through the lies, fake news, propaganda and manipulation.  They must now find their courage - courage that the Ukrainian people demonstrate daily.  They must speak up, speak out, take their courage and reject the leadership they currently have.<\/p> <p> There are 143 million Russian people populating that country.  Again, the law of averages tells us that many of those people must be fine, decent and honourable people who have a respect for human rights.  President Zelenskyy, your people are being asked to show courage that goes beyond the bounds of human endurance.  Please God, the people of Russia will now find their courage to also reject what is being done wrongly and devastatingly in their name.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, Mr. President, thank you for honouring us and joining us today.

We thank President Zelenskyy for his heartfelt, honest, clear and, indeed, historic address to our Parliament this morning.  The strength of his commitment and that of the people of Ukraine to his country and to restoring its place as a free, safe, democratic and an independent country within the community of nations is both humbling and uplifting.<\/p>  <p>  We heard grave testimony from President Zelenskyy this morning and we have seen ourselves the most shocking and harrowing of images from Bucha, from Irpin, from Mariupol and from across Ukraine.  Russia will have to live with the shame and ignominy of what it has done in Ukraine for generations.  Those responsible will be held to account.   We are with Ukraine and I am certain that, in the end, Ukraine will prevail.<\/p>  <p>  We are a militarily neutral country.  However, we are not politically or morally neutral in the face of war crimes.  Quite the opposite.  Our position is informed by the principles that drive our foreign policy &ndash; support for international human rights, for humanitarian law and for a rules-based international order.  We are not neutral when Russia disregards all of these principles.  We are with Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  Ukraine&rsquo;s political, economic and humanitarian needs are now manifold and pressing.  Our efforts, as a friend and as a partner of Ukraine, are aimed at using all the levers at our disposal to bring a just end to this war - applying international pressure on Russia, pursuing accountability for violations of international law and meeting the humanitarian needs of those caught now in the midst of this terrible and immoral war.<\/p>  <p>  Thousands of people have been killed.  Millions have been driven from their homes.  This is a humanitarian crisis the likes of which Europe has not seen since the dark years of the Second World War.   This war touches us all.  That is why Ireland is supporting further European Union sanctions at European level.<\/p> <p>We need a sanctions regime that brings it home to Putin and his regime that he will not, he cannot, succeed.  We want the strongest possible sanctions against the Russian Federation and we will pursue those.<\/p> <p> That is why we support the establishment of a solidarity trust fund for Ukraine, agreed by European Union leaders when we met in Brussels on 24 March, to support the Government of Ukraine now, and when the war is over to support reconstruction.<\/p> <p> That is why I welcome and support Ukraine's application for EU membership.  I reiterate our support for that application this morning in this House.  It is the democratic right of Ukraine and the people of Ukraine to decide your political orientation.  You have chosen to apply for European Union membership.<\/p> <p> We know that EU enlargement has been a force for stabilisation and democratisation in the European Union&rsquo;s neighbourhood.  It is in the European Union&rsquo;s strategic interest.  It is in Ukraine&rsquo;s interest.  As I said to you, President Zelenskyy, when we spoke on 16 March, I will continue to support Ukraine&rsquo;s case.  That is why also we have committed &euro;20 million in direct humanitarian funding, delivered through proven international agencies active on the ground and we will do more.  This is to meet the urgent needs of those in need in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries - including shelter, medical care, health, water and sanitation.<\/p> <p> As well as financial support, through a collaborative effort, we are in the process of delivering medical equipment, including ambulances, ultrasound machines, mobile X-ray machines, ventilators, and incubators.  On 26 and 28 March, two despatches of urgently required medical equipment left Ireland and more will follow.  That is why Ireland has contributed our full share to the European peace facility&rsquo;s &euro;1 billion military assistance package for Ukraine.  We have also supplied provisions and body armour to the Ukrainian military.  We will also continue to support any avenue that can lead to an immediate ceasefire.<\/p> <p> In light of what is being revealed in the areas from which Russian troops have withdrawn, that task will now be even more difficult.  I therefore especially commend your commitment, President Zelenskyy, to continuing to try, despite the enormous challenges you face.  Please know that we are with you in that task, and that we stand ready to contribute to and to support any initiative that can lead to a just peace for the people of Ukraine.<\/p> <p> I know that the people of Mariupol cannot wait for talks to conclude.  Their needs are too urgent.  We need to see genuine humanitarian corridors opened and implemented.  Ireland, along with our partners, will continue to support any sincere efforts at the United Nations to ensure safe and unhindered access for humanitarian assistance.<\/p> <p> Thousands of Ukrainians have arrived in Ireland since the start of the conflict.  A Cheann Comhairle, if I may, I address these words to them.  I know that the ambassador of Ukraine, H.E. Ms Larysa Gerasko, is here in the Gallery for today&rsquo;s debate.  To those who have arrived here from Ukraine, I hope you find in Ireland safe harbour and friendship for as long as you need it.  Most of you, I know, look forward to the day when you can return to a peaceful and free Ukraine, to the family and friends you have left behind.  That day will come.  In the meantime, our home is your home.<\/p> <p> The war in Ukraine has sparked a crisis the likes of which we have not seen in Europe for decades.  It is no surprise to me that the Irish people have stood up to be counted in an unprecedented way in response.<\/p> <p>Over 18,000 Ukrainian people have arrived in Ireland.  Dedicated reception facilities are in place to provide temporary protection and access to other services immediately on arrival.  We are providing accommodation to those who have sought it and we are ramping up our efforts to meet the very challenging and increasing demands.  <br\/><br\/>We are also working to ensure that other supports are available to people arriving here, including access to health, social care services and education.  New arrivals are also being registered to ensure that they can access income supports as needed.  The heartfelt response of people across Ireland is clear in the whole range of initiatives at community level.  I would like to thank all of the people who have opened their hearts and, in some cases, their homes to people from Ukraine.  <br\/><br\/>President Zelenskyy, when you addressed the European Parliament you said, &quot;life will win over death, and light will win over darkness&quot;.  Even in the face of the bleak horrors of this week, I recall your words and the hope and determination they carry.  We stand with Ukraine.  <i>Slava Ukraini<\/i>. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600008#F00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649237100,"counter":21,"content":"<p>President Zelenskyy can no longer remain online with us, but this debate will be followed in Ukraine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600010#H00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1649237100,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank President Zelenskyy for joining us today and sharing with us the heartbreaking and inspiring story of his people's courage and endurance in the face of a grotesque and appalling aggression.

Thankfully, because of the brave Ukrainian resistance there is still time.<\/p><p>In the long history of our own country we have never invaded another, but we know what it is like to have been invaded and to have the very existence of our national identity questioned.  For these reasons, we feel for the idealism of the Ukrainian people, their defiance and their determination to face down a new evil empire.  As a country, we are heartbroken watching the scenes we see on television every night.  We are heartbroken to see what the people of Ukraine have had to endure for 42 days.  We are angry at the appalling human rights abuses against men, women and children and the terrible loss of life.  We promise that we will do everything we can to aid Ukraine in the struggle and to shelter the people of Ukraine.  We will stand by them in their greatest hour.<\/p><p>The abolitionist and civil rights leader, Frederick Douglass, liked to quote our own civil rights leader, Daniel O'Connell, who he met here in Dublin.  He said the history of the Irish people could be &quot;traced like a wounded man through a crowd, by the blood&quot;.  Today the history of Ukraine can be traced through its villages, towns and cities, by the suffering of its children, women and men, by the blood.<\/p><p>Today, President Zelenskyy showed a burning desire for freedom and self-determination, democracy and liberty, things we enjoy and sometimes take for granted.  He showed a desire for a European future for Ukraine, a place in that common European home that we helped to build, and we endorse that desire and support the Ukrainian people in their wish to join the European union.<\/p><p>A little over 100 years ago, the woman who is perhaps Ukraine's greatest national poet captured their dreams of freedom and courage.

You have raped and defiled the very principles of common humanity which bind us together in peace and harmony.

I want, if I can, to take some of the words we have heard previously, starting with former United States President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who spoke here some 59 years ago.  The words he spoke then are just as relevant today.  He stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAnd no nation, large or small, can be indifferent to the fate of others, near or far.  Modern economics, weaponry and communications have made us all realise, more than ever, that we are one human family and this one planet is our home.  <\/blockquote>  <p>He went on to say &quot;Ireland pursues an independent course in foreign policy, but it is not neutral between liberty and tyranny and never will be&quot;.  <\/p><p>That is what guides us today.  It guides us in the work we do in the United Nations Security Council, to which we were elected by the small non-aligned countries of this world to stand up for the rights of individual nation states.  It is in that spirit that our soldiers march to the hard conflict zones with blue helmets on their heads to try to hold the peace line.  It is in that spirit that our Naval Service sails to the Mediterranean to rescue the most destitute and in need.  Perhaps even inspired by this, our trawlers in west Cork were willing to head into international seas to uphold the rule of law.  It is in this spirit that we have worked through the United Nations and in the European Union calling for stiffer sanctions.  With real resolve we will answer President Zelenskyy's call to stop the flow of funds for the war by stopping the flow of fossil fuels, one of the weapons being used in this conflict.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600011#J00500","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649237400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600011#J00600","nonspeaker":"Senator David Norris"},{"type":"speech","time":1649237400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Norris.  It is great to see him here today.  That is the spirit which has people from our country bringing humanitarian aid to the conflict zone, with medicines to tend to the wounded and meals to feed the hungry people President Zelenskyy spoke about.  They bring defensive shields against the weapons of war.  It is in that spirit that the Irish people have opened and will open their doors to provide sanctuary and shelter for women and children in particular fleeing conflict while their men stay at home.  It is going to be difficult and challenging beyond compare, which we all know, but we are committed to this work.<\/p>  <p>  I will quote one of the other leaders who has spoken here, former Chancellor Kohl of Germany.  In addressing this House he said we are \"European by conviction\" and that is true.  It is our conviction as a small State and nation that allows us to strengthen when we work in co-operation and collaboration with European colleagues.  It is appropriate today to quote two lines from the preamble of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which governs this relationship.<\/p> <p>It states that the signatories are:<\/p><blockquote>\tINTENDING to confirm the solidarity which binds Europe and the overseas countries and desiring to ensure the development of their prosperity, in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, [and]<br \/><br \/>RESOLVED by thus pooling their resources to preserve and strengthen peace and liberty, and calling upon the other peoples of Europe who share their ideal to join in their efforts... <\/blockquote> <p>We heard today that just such a call has come from the people of a European nation to be part of those efforts.  I agree with the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste that our answer to widen and broaden the European family, on this most western outpost of Europe, is to say yes, that that ideal is not an exclusive one.  It should not be constrained.  It will be stronger when we spread those democratic ideals.<br\/><br\/>I will quote one last person, Nelson Mandela, who spoke here so eloquently after he had reached and achieved his freedom.  He said: &quot;Nothing can stop the evolution of humanity towards the condition of greater and ever-expanding freedom&quot;.  He went on to say: &quot;We ask that you stay the course with us, we need your support for the democratic perspectives that we represent.&quot;  On that call for support for democratic systems, our European democratic system is absolutely founded in realising that it requires us to follow the rule of law, with all the conflicts, contradictions, complexities and compromises that sometimes involves.  That is what we are standing up here for today and what we need to do.  It may take time.  We have to answer what Nelson Mandela called for us to do - to be willing to stay the course in the face of other challenges that it will present, as we stop the use of those fossil fuels and provide our homes, schools, healthcare and other social services.  Staying the course will be difficult, but I expect this House and our people are up for that challenge, one of the greatest of our time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600011#J00700","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649237700,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Uachtar&aacute;n Zelenskyy as ucht a &oacute;r&aacute;id ar maidin.  I want to extend our deep appreciation and gratitude to President Zelenskyy for his address on this historic day.  I want to acknowledge the presence of the diplomatic corps, but in particular, our friend, Ambassador Gerasko, and her staff.  I want to pay them a particular commendation for their work in these very trying times.<\/p>  <p>  We have heard directly from President Zelenskyy, in the rawest, most harrowing and heartbreaking of terms, testimony of the vicious war crimes committed by the Russian military in Ukraine.  We have been set a challenge.  Innocent civilians have been executed with their arms tied behind their backs.  There have been horrific accounts of rape and torture and the brutalisation by the powerful of vulnerable ordinary citizens in their war-torn country.  These are crime against the Ukrainian people and these are crimes against humanity.  Russia must be held accountable for its barbarism, and justice must be done.  These human rights violations and grave breaches of the Geneva Convention demand investigation by the International Criminal Court and prosecutions to follow.  The truth is that Russia has turned its back on dialogue and peace.  For 42 days and nights, it has chosen war.  It has chosen brutality.  It has chosen the violation of international law.  Russia has closed the door on dialogue and through its criminal actions it has thus far rejected avenues for diplomacy.<\/p> <p>Far from demonstrating a willingness to engage in peace negotiations, Russia has escalated its ferocious violence through the indiscriminate targeting of civilians.<\/p> <p> All the while, however, the Russian Embassy in Ireland and Ambassador Yury Filatov have acted as unwavering and unapologetic propagandists for his country's illegal invasion of Ukraine.  Yesterday, in the face of evidence of Russian war crimes in Bucha and other areas surrounding Kyiv, the embassy and the ambassador claimed that this evidence was fabricated. They described it as another stage of the disinformation war against Russia.  This shameful response demonstrates the depths to which the Putin regime will stoop to justify the savagery of Russia's military aggression.  The Russian ambassador wants us to ignore the evidence before our very eyes.  Well, Mr. Filatov, we have heard the accounts of murders carried out by your soldiers reported by numerous credible sources.  We have seen the aerial photographs of human remains left scattered by the side of the road.  We have seen the cars carrying white flags, indicating civilian passengers, riddled with shrapnel.  The evidence of such atrocities condemns Russia before the world, and the world will not turn a blind eye.  It is long past time for Ambassador Filatov to be expelled from Ireland.  Ba cheart ambasad&oacute;ir na R&uacute;ise in &Eacute;irinn a chur abhaile anois.  Caithfear an Rialtas &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh gan mhoill.  Yesterday Lithuania became the first EU member state to expel its Russian ambassador.  It did so as an action to uphold human rights and justice.  I commend Lithuania on that and believe our country should follow suit.  That would be a most powerful action for us to take as a militarily neutral, non-aligned State as we too stand for human rights and justice.  I call on the Taoiseach and the Government to act now.<\/p> <p> Of course, we must do more.  The people of Ireland stand with Ukraine.  We strongly support Ukraine's stated desire to join the European Union.  We must respond to the humanitarian crisis by providing refuge to those fleeing for their lives.  As an elected member of the UN Security Council, we must use every available avenue to press for the de-escalation of conflict, for a ceasefire, for dialogue and for a Russian withdrawal and an end to this terrible war.<\/p> <p> Ireland supports economic sanctions against Russia.  We must intensify those sanctions.  We should not have to convince anybody of the need to hit the Russian elites and oligarchs in every possible way.  The revelations of these war crimes and atrocities demand such an intensification of sanctions.  I welcome the announcement by the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, of a new round of measures, including the ban on the import of Russian coal, the transaction ban on four Russian banks and the ban on Russian vessels from EU ports.  The impact of these sanctions creates a real economic challenge for Ireland and across the EU, but Russia and Vladimir Putin must feel the full weight and consequences of this invasion.  Russia should not doubt our resolve or our solidarity with the beleaguered people of Ukraine, a people who, as we speak, fight for their lives, fight for their freedom and fight for the survival of their nation.  They fight a war of liberation from tyranny and for the right to endure and to go on, and they will.  We know that a nation is a living, breathing thing.  Ukraine lives, Ukraine breathes and Ukraine will go on.<\/p> <p>Through its heroic struggle, its people have reaffirmed in all of us the values of sovereignty, justice and democracy and one day the invader will retreat, the coloniser will leave, and Russia's armies will go home.  The strength of the Ukrainian people and the support of her allies will see to that.  On that day, Ukraine, deeply scarred but unconquered and unbowed, will start to heal and the people of Ukraine will begin again.  Shattered cities, broken homes and displaced families and communities will come together once more and shape Ukraine's destiny.<br\/><br\/>In that spirit of hope and standing on the foundation stones of our shared humanity, Ukraine will emerge once more into a new dawn of peace and freedom.  Ireland stands with you now in your dark days and we will stand with you yet in the light of a victory of humanity over injustice, of light over dark, of life over death.  <i>Slava Ukraini.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600012#K00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649238300,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas.

The strength, courage and resilience of President Zelenskyy and of the Ukrainian people have been an inspiration, not just for us here in Ireland, but for people all over the world.<\/p>  <p>  If Putin had imperial ambitions when he invaded Ukraine, those ambitions lie in tatters.  Putin has not increased Russia's prestige or its power on the world stage.  His despotic leadership has sapped its influence, destroyed its economy and turned Russia into a pariah state.  It will remain a pariah state as long as Putin remains in power.<\/p>  <p>  Thursday, 24 February 2022, the day Russia launched its barbaric and illegal invasion of Ukraine, is the date that will live in infamy.  Since then, the Ukrainian people have faced a relentless barrage of bombs, bullets, missiles, mortars and rockets.  War crimes have been committed on a daily basis.  Maternity hospitals, schools, care homes and residential buildings have all been targeted.  They have tried to wipe whole cities, such as Mariupol, off the map.  The latest horrors revealed in Bucha, the torture and summary execution of hundreds of innocent civilians, are a gross affront to all of our collective humanity.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland stands united with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people against this callous barbarism and depravity.  Putin's lies and propaganda hold no sway here.  He and his regime must be held accountable.  An unprecedented array of co-ordinated international sanctions have been unleashed to crush Putin's regime, including his oligarch acolytes and to destroy his ability to fund his murderous war.  We must go further.  We must ensure that those sanctions are absolutely copper-fastened.<\/p>  <p>  The EU must now also wean itself off Russian oil and gas, Putin's last economic lifeline.  While Russia is starved of economic support, financial support from the international community must flow into Ukraine.  What Putin has destroyed, Ukraine's allies must help to rebuild.  Humanitarian relief and support for the unprecedented number of refugees fleeing the war must also be sustained, unwavering.<\/p>  <p>  This support from the Irish people was instantaneous and overwhelming.  They have welcomed thousands of Ukrainians into communities throughout Ireland and will continue to do so.

We must all join in condemning the barbaric invasion by Vladimir Putin's forces of Ukraine and we must demand accountability for the horrific crimes against humanity and war crimes of which he is undoubtedly guilty.  There can be no doubt that the horrific scenes we saw in Bucha and are seeing in Mariupol and elsewhere are war crimes and Vladimir Putin should be held accountable for them.<\/p>  <p>  The people of Ukraine are victims of a barbaric and unjustified imperialist invasion.  Russia should end this bloody invasion and allow the people of Ukraine to determine their own future.<\/p> <p>It is absolutely right that we extend refuge to those who are fleeing Putin's bloody war in Ukraine.

Putin is undoubtedly guilty of war crimes for his unjustified invasion of Ukraine, but so also is the United States, the UK and some of their allies for their unjustified wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which they have never been held accountable.  They are also guilty of supporting the Israeli state, which has been indicted recently for crimes against humanity for its treatment of the Palestinian people by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.  They are also guilty of supporting the Saudi dictatorship in its brutal war in Yemen, arming that regime and blocking attempts to investigate their crimes against humanity.  <\/p> <p> We have no credibility in condemning, as we must, the crimes against humanity in Ukraine if we do not simultaneously oppose, condemn and demand accountability for all crimes against humanity, whether they are in Ukraine, Georgia, Afghanistan, Palestine or Yemen.  We will not eliminate crimes against humanity, warmongering or imperialism by being selective in our opposition to it.

When we consider the atrocities that took place in Bucha only a few days ago, we shudder to think what would have occurred had Kyiv fallen to the Russians.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to single out two ambassadors in the Gallery, the Finnish and Swedish ambassadors, both also representing military neutral states, but who recognised from the get-go the extent of the treachery that was about to unfold and provided thousands of defensive, protective anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine to protect its cities and a civilian population.  <\/p>  <p>  I would also like to single out the French ambassador in the Gallery for President Macron&rsquo;s efforts to achieve a ceasefire and humanitarian access to Mariupol, which our present-day generation&rsquo;s Srebenica, whether we accept it or not.  It is not surprising that President Macron&rsquo;s overtures have been turned down and have been unsuccessful.<\/p>  <p>  Every single person in this Chamber wants peace and end to the conflict.  However, unfortunately, the Russians do not want a diplomatic solution at this time.  They want a military solution.  They only way we can bring this to the negotiation table &ndash; it is unpalatable &ndash; is to defeat the Russian army in Ukraine.  That is just the reality.  On that basis, I very much welcome the provision of military stores direct from Irish Defence Forces stores to the Ukrainian defence forces.  It is absolutely important.  <\/p>  <p>  Following on from President Zelenskyy&rsquo;s address, he is looking for more.  He is looking for more leadership.<\/p> <p>One hour's drive from here in the Curragh Camp, there are hundreds of anti-tank rockets nearing the end of their shelf life that could very easily be transferred to the Ukraine defence forces.  The reason that is so important is that we know the Russians are preparing a massive offensive in the east at the moment and that this offensive is likely to be successful but it does not have to be this way.  We have learned from the successful defence of Kyiv that the future is not written in stone.  It has yet to be decided and it will be determined not just by fate but by decisions and actions of the people in this Chamber over the next few days.

In that decision, the Government is ignoring the fact that every single euro counts for workers and families and that many households are literally down to the cents.  If the Government proceeds with this, it will push ahead in the full knowledge that low-income workers, older people and rural communities have been hit especially hard.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach did acknowledge yesterday that what he termed a \"wider initiative\" is required to tackle this unprecedented cost-of-living crisis, which has been driven by inflation levels not seen since the 1980s and exacerbated by Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine.  I am glad the Taoiseach has finally recognised the need for a comprehensive set of measures and an inclusive process to get the living costs down.  This comes after months of resisting Sinn F&eacute;in's calls for exactly such a package.  In February, we brought forward a broad suite of measures that would make a real difference and bring genuine relief and breathing space for households.  We urged the Government to adopt these measures, which are realistic and deliverable.  The Taoiseach refused to do that.  We proposed a mini-budget that would target those areas during this crisis.  Does the Taoiseach now accept the need for a mini-budget?  Has the Government moved from its position of waiting until October to act?  In other words, when will see this comprehensive set of measures?  Will these measures include targeted cost-of-living payments to lower and middle-income workers and families?  Will it include relief for renters?  Will it include relief for childcare costs?  We have proposed cutting these initially by one third.  That is necessary to give parents breathing space.  Above all, urgency is required on this matter because the fuel allowance is due to end on Friday.  It is crucial that this payment is extended, initially for six weeks at the least, and that eligibility for it is expanded.<\/p>  <p>  T&aacute; mion-bhuis&eacute;ad ag teast&aacute;il uainn chun dul i ngleic leis na r&eacute;ims&iacute; at&aacute; i gcro&iacute;l&aacute;r na g&eacute;arch&eacute;ime sa chostas maireacht&aacute;la.

Although the Taoiseach clearly attaches little importance to this increase, the backbenchers in his own party and, it seems, in Fine Gael, have a very different view on this matter.  I am asking the Taoiseach to seize the moment, to introduce measures that will cushion households and help give them some breathing space and, of course, to cancel the hike in carbon tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600020#T00300","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1649240400,"counter":56,"content":"<p>First, the Deputy did not actually call for anything of the sort that I proposed in the House yesterday in terms of the comprehensive approach I and the Government want to take to what is, without question, a very serious issue for the Irish economy and the European economy.  That is manifested in the main at the moment by inflation.  I said yesterday that we have had two, if not three, shocks to our economic model.  The first was Brexit.  We dealt with that, as a country, as best we could.  The second was the pandemic, which was a once-in-a-century event.  Thankfully, because of the economic measures the Government took to protect jobs, incomes and businesses and to keep them intact, we have bounced back very significantly as an economy, largely speaking, in emerging from Covid.  The Central Bank's report today confirms that.  Government initiatives in the teeth of a major crisis, that is, the pandemic, worked, notwithstanding that the ending of the emergency phase of the pandemic has created a huge inflationary cycle.  Add a terrible war, the war on Ukraine, and energy prices have exponentially grown and risen.  The sanctions the European Union, the United States, Canada and other democracies have imposed on the Russian Federation within themselves create economic impacts and shocks, some of which we are not clear on yet.  The only thing from now to the end of the year, as far as I can see, is uncertainty.  I would not understate the economic recovery in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I fully accept the enormous pressures inflation is putting on households.  We are very concerned about those on low incomes.  Hence, we increased the fuel allowance from &euro;630 when we came into government to &euro;1,039.  When the &euro;200 cut in electricity bills is added, that is &euro;1,239, up from the base of &euro;630 when we came into office.  Other aspects of the economy also illustrate the point I was making yesterday.  The Central Bank is saying inflation could go to 6.5%.  It has revised downwards growth forecasts.  It expects the jobs market to remain strong with an increase in employment of about 88,000 this year.<\/p> <p>The Department of Finance is preparing the spring forecasts.<\/p> <p> We had the highest employment growth in the European Union last year, with the number of people work soaring by nearly 230,000 to just above 2.5 million, marking a record high and already surpassing our target for 2024, which was contained in the economic recovery plan.  Employment has increased for all age groups and across all geographic regions.  GDP went up by about 13% but it is modified domestic demand that we are focused on and that grew by 6.5%, which is now 7% above the pre-pandemic level.  The unemployment rate is at 5.2%, which is close to full employment.  Those are the plus points but there is one huge negative, namely, inflation.  The challenge for us is not to undermine progress in other parts of the economy.  I am saying the best way to do that is work with the social partners, trade unions and employers on the pay policy dimension to this, which is important as there are tax, social welfare, income protection and climate change implications.  Then there is the issue of the costs for people on low incomes and for those who are going into work every day.  In the &euro;800 million package we put in place since the budget we have already reduced transport and medical costs.  That is an intelligent way to go about this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600020#T00400","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649241000,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I have asked the Taoiseach to set out what this comprehensive approach will amount to.

Costs for goods and services everywhere are rising rapidly and household budgets have been vaporised.  This particularly impacts on those with low to middle incomes and on those with fixed incomes.  I have listened to what the Taoiseach has said about this crisis carefully and he has repeatedly stated that the Government cannot bring in separate measures every week.  Nobody is asking the Government to do that.  We want to see a credible and meaningful response that would provide real relief to those who are struggling, those who are worried and those who are already in trouble.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a lot of political debate about the carbon tax in recent weeks, much of it ignoring the taxation elephant in the room, which is VAT.  The Taoiseach has said that next month, the carbon tax increase will mean an average increase in household bills of &euro;1.40 per month.  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that VAT is considerably more and it is ever-increasing given the enormous prices rises in energy, which provides an unprecedented windfall to the Government.  Last year alone, for example, the Government took in &euro;3 billion more in VAT than it did in 2020.  A large chunk of that was from energy costs.  Up until February of this year the Taoiseach was telling the House that the VAT derogation was impossible because of EU rules.  On 9 March, when a cut in excise duty was announced, we were told the Government was working with EU colleagues to see whether we could introduce greater relief or flexibility in that area.  Last week the Taoiseach told us that a VAT derogation had been sought.  It also was reported last week that the Taoiseach told his parliamentary party that we can expect some hard proposals on energy from the EU by the end of April.<\/p>  <p>  Maybe the Taoiseach can provide some details to the House on that.  When exactly did the Government apply for that VAT derogation?  Was it separate or was it combined with other member states?  Did the Taoiseach personally make that application to the European Council on 24 and 25 March?  Has the Government applied for a specific derogation on VAT, reducing it to levels of 9% or 5%, for example?  When will we get an indication of when that application will be successful?  The Taoiseach said the application was made yesterday.  The Taoiseach said the Government is considering offsetting the carbon tax increase.  Is that impacted by VAT or the public service obligation, PSO, level?  Can the Taoiseach give us some sort of an indication and a timeline for that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600021#U02300","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1649241000,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising those points.  Members are looking for initiatives every week and I understand that.  We have to stand back, however, and take a more considered view on how we respond to this fairly unique crisis, which has been caused by the combination of a pandemic, emerging from that pandemic and the imbalance of supply and demand which that created and a terrible war, the likes of which we have not seen since the Second World War that is happening on the Continent of Europe and that is creating huge issues for all of us.  We have to look at this in the medium term, rather than just from week to week.  I believe the Deputy accepts that and I appreciate the point she has made on that.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the European Union and European Commission approach to the energy market.  There have been considerable discussions in recent months at European Council level on the market, on how it is designed and on whether that market can be adjusted or changed to reduce the cost of energy.  Different member states have different perspectives on that and we have consistently put forward the view that we need more flexibility on the legislation and the directives, including the energy tax and the VAT directives.  We already enjoy a historic derogation on the VAT rate on fuels of 13.5%.  We have told the Commission, including prior to the last meeting and prior to Versailles, that there should be flexibilities in the current situation that would not endanger the historic derogation we have.  If we had simply reduced energy prices below that 13.5% rate, there was no guarantee under the existing laws that we could stay at 13.5% when the crisis was over but rather, we would have to go to 23%.  That was something we were anxious to avoid.<\/p> <p>We put forward an amendment to the conclusions of the last meeting, which was accepted, to try to head off that situation.  It still has to involve discussions with the Commission.  We want to be absolutely clear and certain.  This is to allow us flexibility.  We have different options and know what we can and cannot do.  With the laws as they were, we were not in a position to do it all along, which we made clear to the House.  We reduced excise duties significantly, by between 15% and 20%.  The Central Bank spokesperson said that had an impact on reducing the costs on people from what they would otherwise have been.<\/p> <p> The other side of the argument is that the Commission itself acknowledges that the market needs to be revisited with regard to the domination of gas in dictating the price of all energy in the European Union market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600021#U02400","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649241600,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600022#V00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1649241600,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Hopefully, by the end of April, there will be a further return to this, with a fuller reform of the market by the end of May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600022#V00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1649241600,"counter":84,"content":"<p>For many people, there is a personal crisis and a family crisis.

As the Taoiseach knows, the Irish people have never been shy when it comes to supporting those most in need.  When the call for support came, Irish people answered in their thousands.  In many cases, they even travelled to airports to collect Ukrainian refugees who fled.  Over the past weeks, I have had many calls and visits from the families who took in Ukrainian refugees to outline the difficulties that they face.  It is important to put on record that those people have not for one minute regretted their decision to take in Ukrainian refugees, and if they had to do it again, they would not hesitate.<\/p>  <p>  The issue people are having is that they feel isolated, with no support.  They have very little, if any, contact from the relevant Departments.  They feel they have nowhere to go for support and advice.  They have no regrets about opening their homes to Ukrainian refugees but they are finding it difficult and financially challenging.  They have increased energy and food bills and, on top of this, there are massive hikes in energy prices.  When they look for assistance from the Departments, they feel they are being ignored.  The commercial hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation are being paid to house Ukrainian refugees.  The people who opened their homes to the same refugees are not getting any support.<\/p>  <p>  This is wrong and must be addressed.  It is wrong that these people are left isolated without any support or assistance.  They were good enough to open their homes at a time of great need but now they feel ignored.  They seek support from various Departments and get no response.  This morning, President Zelenskyy outlined the support that Ukrainians need right now.  We all need to continue to support the Ukrainian people in a time of great need.  We also need to support the Irish people who have been good enough to open their homes.  In many instances, they and their families have made considerable sacrifices.  It is simply not fair that these people receive absolutely no support while hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation receive full support for taking in refugees.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach to assist with this issue and get proper support to the many thousands of Irish people and families who have opened their homes to Ukrainian refugees.  This morning, the Taoiseach told the Ukrainian president, \"our home is your home.\"  Thousands of Irish people have opened their homes to Ukrainian refugees.  I believe this is the right place for them to be.  It is a family atmosphere.  Irish people have always put their shoulders to the wheel when needed.  Irish people are not complaining and would do this again and again but they are getting no support.  They get bills, including electricity bills, pick up Ukrainian children to bring them to school every day, and are looking for nothing.  Everything is increasing.

We have never had to respond so quickly to such a refugee crisis before.  I pay a warm tribute to the public servants, as Deputy Michael Healy-Rae did earlier today, who have done exceptional work, working late into the evenings, to secure accommodation for refugees.  There are nearly 2,500 children attending our schools so far.  I thank the education community.

That has been our immediate focus.<\/p>  <p>  We are establishing community response forums in each local authority to co-ordinate local responses to the Ukraine crisis.  That forum will bring together all of the community and voluntary organisations which are active locally, as well as the mayor or cathaoirleach of each local authority.  These local forums are best placed to put arrangements in place to help the new arrivals from Ukraine to access services.  We believe these forums are an important part of what the Deputy has articulated with regard to providing supports on the ground for families, to enable them to integrate in our society more effectively.  We are asking local authorities to take a leadership role in those community forums to enable people to come together to provide additional supports and services at that local level.  We are witnessing this all over the country.  Communities are responding in that way and we appreciate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600022#V01100","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1649242200,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I said it before that we cannot put a price on a family atmosphere.

The Taoiseach said to President Zelenksyy this morning that, &ldquo;Our home is your home&rdquo;.  These families are saying, &ldquo;Our homes are the refugees&rsquo; homes&rdquo;.  They thought this war would last maybe four or five weeks.  Now all of a sudden it might go on for two more weeks or six more weeks.  The families do not know.

The Taoiseach knows it was the last straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back.  This is the price that the country and the people of Ireland, young and old, have to pay so that the Taoiseach will have the continued support of the Green Party to remain Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has already torn down Bord na M&oacute;na.  Every day since then, the cost of electricity has gone up.  The Taoiseach promised the people of north Kerry when he was canvassing there that he would support Shannon LNG, but now he is against it.  Surely, the Taoiseach knows what is happening around the world.  China is building massive electricity-generating stations.  Russia is mining coal and oil.  The USA is still using massive passenger eight-cylinder vehicles, such as Cadillacs, Lincoln Continental, Chevrolet, massive 5.7 l and 7.8 l eight-cylinder engines.  Petrol is $3.80 a gallon there.  Here, most people are driving 1.6 l and 2 l cars.  Deputy Eamon Ryan is saying that we are still wrong.  He wants to price us off the road.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will break the country with it targets.  Russia, China, India and Africa will keep doing what they are doing.  They will do more harm to the environment in one year than Ireland would do in 1,000 years.  The Government will close the country down.  It will finish up exporting our youth, as happened in the 1950s and early 1960s.  The true influence that the war is having on our energy costs has not been felt yet.  Hauliers and construction are in serious trouble.  Roadbridge has seen the loss of 1,000 jobs.  It will have a ripple effect and many others are on the brink.  Already ten construction companies have gone down in the UK.  We will follow.  If every light was turned off and we all left this country, it would only make 0.13% in the worldwide context.  We are all under the one sky.  The one sun and the one moon is over us all.  The Government can cripple our people, cause the loss of thousands of jobs and can break the people, paralyse our farmers and curtail their ability to continue producing food.  Nobody has calculated the cost of importing food from places like Brazil or what emissions this will create.

We need balance and perspective in the debate.  I fully accept that the cost-of-living increases are having a significant impact on people.  These are caused by a war and caused by a pandemic.  Without question, the pandemic and the war have caused extraordinary increase in energy prices globally.  This is happening now all over the world, not because of the carbon tax or anything else like that, but because of the impact on the energy market, because of restrictions on fuel and because of the enormous uncertainty that has created.  As a result, the Government did take measures to help hauliers.  There were measures taken in tillage to assist farmers, as well as on the broader issue of reducing the excise duty etc. on the cost of fuel between 15 and 20 cent.  These are very significant measures costing about &euro;900 million, when including the medical cost reductions, the transport cost reductions, to &euro;200 electricity cut etc.  That is on the top of a budget of &euro;1 billion that was given last October in tax for this year.

This was the third meeting of EU leaders within a month and since Russia's brutal and illegal invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February.  Prior to my attendance at the most recent meeting, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, updated the House on my participation at the other meetings - a special meeting of the European Council on 24 February and an informal meeting of the European Council in Versailles on 10 and 11 March.<\/p><p>The European Council of the 24 and 25 March had a full agenda addressing the most pressing issues facing the Union and our neighbourhood.  While our meeting took place in advance of the evidence emerging in recent days of large-scale horrific crimes against civilians, EU leaders have condemned the war since the start as immoral and unjustifiable, and we did so again on 24 March.<\/p><p>We discussed the impact of Russia's aggression from a range of perspectives: humanitarian, migration, energy, nuclear security and safety, and reconstruction.  We agreed to establish a Ukraine solidarity trust fund.  We discussed security and defence and endorsed the strategic compass.  This is a strategy document that will provide enhanced political direction for the Union's approach to security and defence policy for the next five to ten years.  We discussed energy, including energy prices, storage, energy security and phasing out dependence on Russian coal, gas and oil.<\/p><p>We agreed conclusions on economic issues, including building a more robust and open economic base, realising the full potential of the Single Market, and food security.  We also took stock of developments with Covid-19, including EU co-ordination efforts and global health solidarity and governance, and we discussed the EU's external relations, including the European Union-China Summit, which subsequently took place on 1 April, and the political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.We also re-elected Mr. Charles Michel as President of the European Council for a second term ending in November 2024.<\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, will address economic issues and external relations in his wrap-up.  I will address all other items.<\/p><p>At the start of our meeting, we heard from the President of the European Parliament, Ms Roberta Metsola.  She is of the view, with which I agree, that informed hope and belief will help to sustain the people of Ukraine.  For this, they need to know that the European Union and the international community are supporting them.President Metsola has since travelled to Kyiv to convey in person a powerful message of solidarity on behalf of the European Parliament to the members of the Ukrainian Parliament.<\/p><p>We also had an exchange of views with the President of the United States, Mr. Joe Biden, which underlined the strength and importance of the transatlantic relationship in the struggle between democracy and autocracy.  Our co-operation on issues such as sanctions has already proven to be impactful.<\/p> <p>We will continue to work together on a range of other areas from cybersecurity to energy.<br\/><br\/>President Zelenskyy also joined us via video link.  As he did in this House this morning, he called for strengthened EU sanctions, accountability for the perpetrators of unspeakable crimes in Ukraine and an accelerated process to allow Ukraine to join the EU.  He has my full support.  In the discussion that followed, leaders condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine, which are a gross violation of international law causing appalling loss of life and injury to civilians and destroying the vital infrastructure of a peaceful country.  President Putin's regime and its supporters should be in no doubt that justice will rise up and those responsible will be held accountable for their crimes.  Leaders also reaffirmed the Versailles declaration, acknowledging the European aspirations and European choice of Ukraine.  Just as Ireland has over time made its own informed choices about who we are, our priorities and with whom we align ourselves, so too should Ukraine be able to make its choices.<br\/><br\/>The EU will continue to provide co-ordinated political, financial, material and humanitarian support.  We call on the European Commission to continue to provide technical assistance to Ukraine to undertake the steps necessary to facilitate its path to EU candidate status.  Looking to the future, we agreed to develop a Ukraine solidarity trust fund to support the costs of the government of Ukraine, which is continuing to work on behalf of its people despite the immense challenges it faces, and to help support the reconstruction of the country when the time comes.  Leaders called on all countries to align with existing sanctions, which are having a massive impact on Russia and Belarus.  Ireland stands ready to adopt further robust sanctions with our EU partners and ensure that any attempts to circumvent sanctions or to aid Russia by other means are stamped out.<br\/><br\/>We also discussed the impact of the conflict on displaced people, refugees and hosting states, especially those on Ukraine's borders.  We recognise the need for collective efforts to support and provide for refugees.  Irish people moved quickly to provide protection to Ukrainians driven from their homes.  It will not be without cost and challenge but it is the right thing to do.  Recognising the pressures across the EU, we call for work to be completed on European Commission proposals to support member states in this regard.<br\/><br\/>I will speak further on the question of energy shortly, but in the context of Ukraine we underlined our commitment to ensuring continuous and uninterrupted electricity and gas flows to the country.  The recent synchronisation of Ukrainian and Moldovan electricity grids with the EU's grids is a remarkable achievement and shows that our futures are now interconnected.  It is also enormously important that the safety of Ukrainian nuclear facilities is ensured, including through the support of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  This will also remain a focus.<br\/><br\/>We endorsed the strategic compass.  This is a strategy document that will provide enhanced political direction for the EU's approach to security and defence policy for the next five to ten years.  Ireland has always engaged constructively in the development of the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, guided by our traditional policy of military neutrality and our contribution to crisis management and peacekeeping.  That continues to be the case.  We have played an active role in shaping the strategic compass, working to ensure it reflects the core values that underpin our approach to CSDP, including our commitment to the United Nations and the rules-based international order.  The text sets out the significant security and defence challenges faced by the EU, including existing and emerging threats, the increasingly contested multipolar world and the strategic implications for the EU.  It provides a strategic perspective for the next decade and sets out the tools and initiatives required to enable the EU to act more quickly and decisively when facing crises, to become better equipped to anticipate and mitigate threats, to stimulate investment and innovation to develop our capabilities and technologies, and to deepen cooperation with partners, including the UN, which remains the essential core of international peace and security.<br\/><br\/>While work began on the strategic compass some months back, the text also reflects the immediate security situation following Russia's unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine.  Different member states have different traditions and approaches in the area of security and defence.  This is fully understood and respected by all partners.  For Ireland, we are clear that our active participation in CSDP does not prejudice the specific character of our security and defence policy or our obligations.<br\/><br\/>We held an important discussion on energy issues and reaffirmed the agreement reached in Versailles last month to phase out Europe's dependence on Russian gas, oil and coal imports as soon as possible.  This can be achieved by reducing our overall reliance on fossil fuels faster, diversifying supplies and routes, developing an EU hydrogen market, accelerating the development of renewables, and improving the interconnection of European electricity and gas networks.We will also work to reinforce EU contingency planning for security of supply, and enhance energy efficiency and management of energy consumption.<br\/><br\/>On energy security, work will continue to complete and improve gas and electricity interconnections in Europe.  I welcome the agreement whereby member states can opt in to collective purchase arrangements for gas, liquid natural gas, LNG, and hydrogen to secure better prices.  The European Commission will work to pool demand by drawing on the collective strength of the EU, which is a model that worked for the purchase of Covid-19 vaccines.  Ahead of next winter, member states will work with the Commission to ensure that gas storage facilities are replenished, helping to mitigate against supply disruption.  In his presentation to us at the start of our meeting, President Biden committed to helping Europe with additional LNG supplies.  This will see the United States work to ensure the provision of an additional 15 billion cu. m to the EU this year.  This energy partnership with the US will help phase out EU fuel dependence on Russia and will also work to support energy-efficiency solutions and the rapid deployment of clean energy technologies.<br\/><br\/>I am acutely aware of the negative impact high prices are having on households and businesses, especially our vulnerable citizens and SMEs.  We looked at various options to cushion the impact.  A number of measures aimed at curbing rising energy prices were discussed, drawing on options presented by the Commission.  To provide relief to consumers, member states were encouraged to continue to make the best use of the toolbox of measures identified by the Commission, including the application of the state aid temporary crisis framework as a time-limited departure from the <i>status quo<\/i>, temporary taxation of windfall profits and various direct supports to consumers.<br\/><br\/>We asked the Commission and member states to urgently assess further short-term options that could help to reduce gas and electricity prices.  We discussed how to take work forward on monitoring and optimising the functioning of the electricity market.  The findings of the final reports from the EU's Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators and the European Securities and Markets Authority will feed into these deliberations in the coming weeks.  The Commission will come forward with a REPowerEU plan in May.  It is important that any proposals to address the problem of excessive electricity prices do not have unintended consequences for the integrity of the Single Market, that they maintain incentives for the green transition and, above all, preserve security of supply.  Leaders will keep this important matter under regular review.<br\/><br\/>Covid-19 has been a standing item on the agenda of the European Council and we again took stock of the epidemiological situation across Europe.  Our focus was on co-ordinating efforts in response to the pandemic, as well as the strengthening of pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.  We also welcomed the progress made recently in the World Trade Organization, WTO, concerning the issue of intellectual property rights.  While Omicron remains the dominant variant and is highly transmissible, thankfully, it has not caused the same degree of threat as previous variants.  Many member states have taken the opportunity to ease restrictions and shorten the isolation and quarantine periods for close contacts.  Collectively, it is important to maintain an appropriate level of vigilance against Covid-19, which continues to circulate in our communities.<\/p> <p>We also re-elected the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, for a second term ending in November 2024.  I congratulated him on his re-election and look forward to continued positive collaboration with him, including at future meetings of the European Council. <\/p> <p> We find ourselves at a historic inflection point.  European Union leaders are working together in an unprecedented way to leverage our collective economic, strategic and political power and influence to stop Russia's war in Ukraine.  We want to see a just end to this war and will continue to apply targeted and increased pressure to bring that about, in partnership with like-minded global partners.  Ukraine deserves no less.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan will address economic issues and external relations in his wrap-up remarks.  <\/p> <p> Leaders agreed to hold a special meeting of the European Council to follow up on the issues discussed.  This will take place in advance of the scheduled meeting the European Council in June.  I will continue to report to the House on these discussions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600027#AA04600","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649245800,"counter":263,"content":"<p>The recent meeting of the European Council provided leaders with a prime opportunity to address the cost of living crisis and in particular the skyrocketing energy bills that have hammered workers and families for more than a year now.  For more than five months, Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling on the Government to engage with the European Commission to cut VAT on these extortionate bills.  Unfortunately this is something that the Taoiseach and the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform have pushed back against.  All the while, the price of energy has soared and households found it increasingly difficult to light and heat their homes or to put fuel in the car to get to work.<\/p>  <p>  Given the intense pressure people are under, and given that a VAT break is a common-sense solution, it is astonishing that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, wrote to the European Commission only three weeks ago, on 10 March, months after the idea was first raised with the Government in the D&aacute;il.  The constant refrain from the Taoiseach and from the Minister was that barriers presented by Europe prevented the Government from implementing a VAT cut.  Time and again, Government representatives said they were awaiting movement from the EU and the Commission for further cost-of-living measures.  This Council meeting surely provided the Taoiseach and the Government with the platform to make it clear to our European partners that workers and families in Ireland desperately need a VAT cut on energy bills.  Therefore, I am very disappointed that the Taoiseach did not elaborate on this specific point in his contribution.  He stated, \"A number of measures aimed at curbing rising energy prices were discussed, drawing on options presented by the European Commission.\"  I, for one, would have appreciated clarity on the VAT issue because movement on that will make a big difference for many families who do not have a spare euro to give and who saw the Government's &euro;200 credit wiped out before it was delivered.  I assume, given the intensity of the crisis faced by workers and families, that the Taoiseach has taken the opportunity to request a special derogation on fuels and energy; on electricity, gas and home heating oil.  Indeed, the statement outlining the conclusions from the European Council meeting makes clear that there is flexibility from the Commission for member states to seek a reduction on VAT on energy bills for consumers.  The Government now explicitly has the space it said it required from Europe to implement a VAT cut.  The urgency required must be demonstrated to do what needs to be done to give hard-pressed households the break they so desperately need. <\/p>  <p>  I ask that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, tell us whether the Government has, in fact, formally requested a special derogation on the VAT directives.  We are in a real crisis and people need to get real help and support from the Government.  There can be no doubt about it.  Across the State, people are faced with the choice of heating or eating.  I have said this many times in this Chamber but I want to give one example, as it is of value to place it on the record.  My colleague, Deputy Kerrane, conducted a cost-of-living study recently.  The stories we were told are utterly heartbreaking.  I will give one.  One person responded that they and their partner are both students in their final year of college.  So these are young people.  They said that there are days we have had to miss college and their daughter has missed preschool because they could not afford petrol to drive there.  Other days they have had to lie that we forgot our daughter&rsquo;s lunch because they had no lunch box options left in the fridge.  That is the reality of it.  I am sure that everyone recognises those types of stories.  There can be no more excuses and there cannot be further delay.  The Government cannot hide behind an alibi of complexity although, of course, these matters are complex.  I have told the Taoiseach many times that the Government cannot do everything, and there is no expectation that it can do everything to get living costs down, but it can certainly do much more and it must do so.  That includes cutting VAT on energy bills as an emergency measure.  This must be done as soon as possible.  It will make a real and substantial difference for those struggling to make ends meet and who simply need breathing space.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600029#CC00200","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1649245800,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I will continue with some of the questions I brought up previously.  Maybe there will be an opportunity, when the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, takes questions later, that we might get some answers.  President Zelenskyy stated clearly what Ukraine is facing, including Russian war crimes.  We have all seen the images out of Bucha.  We welcomed Anastasia, the little girl who was in the Chamber, and heard how her father is at this time fighting for his homeland.  That is what the Ukrainians are dealing with.  We have to do whatever we can that has an impact on the ability of Russia and the Putin regime to fight this war.  We need answers on due diligence being done on section 110 and the money that has sloshed through the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, but also in respect of the list the ambassador, Ms Larysa Gerasko, had given to the Department of Foreign Affairs of companies that were still trading with Russia.  I understand there has been movement in this regard but we need to ensure that as much as possible is done to remove Russia's ability to fight this war.  It would be good manners to get an answer back to the ambassador and her team.  We all understand the difficulty that arises with the embeddedness and connectivity of business but we need to do due diligence and get to where we need to be on that.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach spoke a lot about energy security.  We all understand the situation that we are dealing with.  When we talk about sanctions and Russia, that means fuel.  We need to see movement at a European Union level on block-buys.  It is vital that the Minister of State would give the House updates on all the interactions there have been on seeking the derogation on the VAT rate that would allow us a tool to reduce the pain people are suffering here at present.  During the pandemic we made many decisions on the basis of keeping the ship afloat, keeping families safe, keeping businesses afloat and ensuring that we had an economy afterwards.  We need to ensure that again in these circumstances and at this time.  The block-buys are huge.  We know that in the long term we need to escalate everything we are doing to move towards renewable energy.  We know we can be a wind energy hub or superpower.  That is where it needs to go but in the short term, we need to ensure that people have fuel and energy and that they have electricity that is affordable and that we do not push them into further poverty.  That is a given.  We need whatever plans can be put in place from the European Union and here as soon as possible.  May will just not come quickly enough for that. <\/p>  <p>  Can we get details on any conversations that have taken place on China and its current relationship with Russia?  <\/p> <p>We would like to see the Chinese not supporting what is a disgraceful war in Ukraine.  I am sure they realise it does not suit them in the long term.<\/p> <p> I welcome the fact there have been conversations around Bosnia.  I, among others, have met the Bosnian ambassador and he spoke of some of the hybrid threats we have been dealing with from Russia, its power plays, how this has impacted and the obvious difficulty with Republika Srpska.  I would like an update on that.<\/p> <p> We support providing a roadmap to the likes of Ukraine for accession to the EU.  Moldova is doing a huge amount of heavy lifting with the current humanitarian difficulties.  Deputy Brady is there with a delegation from the EU affairs committee to look at what is happening from a human point of view and what can be done to make that roadmap clear.<\/p> <p> We are talking security and defence so it is straight to say any moves, or even making moves that look like we are moving the EU towards a military alliance, could create difficulties if, as we hope, Vladimir Putin gets to a place where he needs a way out.  We do not need that to be part of the negotiating gambit.<\/p> <p> We still have a huge body of work to do on the humanitarian aspect, especially where housing is concerned.  There is going to be need for imagination.  There is going to be free flow of credit.  We will have to make up for the mistakes we have not dealt with in relation to addressing the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600029#CC00300","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649246400,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600030#DD00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1649246400,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I will finish on the point that Irish unity is coming.

The European Council met on 24 and 25 March.  Unfortunately, it did not deliver the additional sanctions against Russia, supports for the Ukrainian people or the much-needed derogation on VAT we require to allow us reduce the costs of energy for struggling households.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party is in strong support of Ukraine joining the EU and we as a union need to speak as one voice to expedite that.  We have consistently called for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador.  The crimes against humanity uncovered in Bucha are just some of the atrocities the Russian Army has carried out across the territory of Ukraine.  Mariupol, Sumy, Chernihiv and hundreds of other cities, towns and villages have borne witness to Russian barbarity.  Let us not forget Russian forces never expected to have their crimes in Bucha uncovered.  They expected that territory to stay conquered.  We must respond to the horrors perpetrated by Russian soldiers.  Ireland has expelled four Russian diplomats but that still leaves 27 officials here, at least ten of whom are accredited diplomats under the Vienna Convention.  They must go and it is no longer acceptable.  There is no legitimate reason for that number of Russian diplomats to be based here.<\/p>  <p>  The Ukrainian people have fought valiantly and defeated the Russian army in the Kyiv region but they face new challenges in the south and east.  There will now be a fifth package of EU sanctions with bans on Russian coal, on ships accessing EU ports, blocks on road transport operators, bans on the export of advanced semiconductors and machinery and a ban on Russian companies tendering for contracts across the EU.  However, it simply does not go far enough.  The Taoiseach said earlier Ireland wants the strongest possible sanctions against Russia.  We must continue to increase the economic pressure on the Russian Federation.  The Labour Party is calling for an embargo on Russian oil and gas.  EU countries have paid &euro;35 billion to Russia in energy payments since the start of the year.  That is funding Putin's war effort and it must cease.  President Zelenskyy wants us to do this.  The remaining Russian banks and financial institutions must be cut off from SWIFT and financial sanctions must be rigourously enforced.  That means resourcing teams to track down those trying to circumvent and avoid them.  Secondary sanctions must also be implemented to ensure current measures cannot be circumvented and other measures considered to target commercial activity that takes place outside the EU and US.  The Labour Party calls once more on the Government to expedite our Magnitsky Bill to crack down on human rights abusers.  We must also bring transparency to the IFSC and name those who are the beneficial owners of section 110 special purpose vehicles that are subject to sanctions.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland can and must keep the door open to Ukrainian refugees and do all we can to support those who reach our shores.  However, we must massively increase our humanitarian support to those remaining in Ukraine with food, medical supplies and cash.  We have contributed to the EU &euro;500 million defence package with non-lethal aid and provided &euro;20 million of humanitarian aid but multiples of that will be required.  We must be ready to rebuild Ukraine when peace eventually comes.  Now is the time to start looking at how we finance that and requisition those Russian assets that have been frozen around the world and deploy them to build a new Ukraine following the wanton destruction caused by Putin's army.  Methods to reduce and cancel Ukrainian debt must also be part of that future.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, since last November the Labour Party has advocated a reduction in the VAT rate on electricity and gas supplies, which is currently 13.5%.  In January we tabled a motion in the House explicitly calling on the Government to seek a derogation from the EU that would allow us to reduce this VAT rate and restore it back to that pre-crisis level.  We again call on the Government to secure that derogation to help tackle the cost of living crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600030#DD00800","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1649246400,"counter":273,"content":"<p>The special European Council meeting held on 24 February and the informal meeting held in Versailles on 10 and 11 March, as well as the scheduled Council meeting that took place on 24 and 25 March were all dominated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and rightly so.  The situation in Ukraine is becoming more horrific by the day.  What has been revealed in the town of Bucha and around Kyiv following the retreat of the Russian forces is appalling.  Innocent victims have been targeted.  Sexual violence, torture and summary executions have been carried out by Russian troops.  No doubt this was done with President Putin's knowledge.  President Zelenskyy has described these events as genocide.<\/p>  <p>  Our solidarity with Ukraine and the solidarity of EU member states must remain firm.  Ireland has not been found wanting in our response to this war.  We have consistently supported comprehensive sanctions on Russia, including the fifth round announced yesterday, which involves a ban on Russian coal imports and on Russian ships entering EU ports, among other things.  I understand a ban on Russian oil is also being worked on and I hope this can be agreed on at the earliest opportunity.  We got behind the measures proposed under the European peace facility.  We fully responded to the enormous humanitarian crisis now unfolding.  We wholeheartedly backed Ukraine's application for EU membership and I hope the European Commission's opinion in this regard will be available quickly and that it will be a positive one.  President Zelenksyy, in his address to both Houses this morning, thanked Ireland for our financial and humanitarian support and also asked us, through our Taoiseach, to bring pressure to bear on the European Council and indeed the Commission to go further with the sanctions.  In his response the Taoiseach said he would do that, which I welcome.  We must do everything possible to bring this war to an end, stop the slaughter of innocent civilians and have a ceasefire put in place as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  President Biden has stated the Russian invasion of Ukraine has brought the world to a tipping point of fundamental change with a battle for supremacy between democracy and autocracy.<\/p> <p>That is certainly an interesting analysis.  In this context, I want to draw attention to the meeting in recent days between the Presidents of the European Commission and the European Council with the Chinese President and Prime Minister.  The response of China to the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been ambiguous.  The EU must insist that China does not try to assist Russia in evading sanctions or to supply Russia with weaponry.  China should be proactive in trying to bring about an end to the conflict and encourage a Russian withdrawal from Ukraine.  We have lots of reasons to be critical of China but it would be doing the world a great favour if it embarked on this diplomatic course of action.<\/p> <p> Questions have also been asked about India's position on the war in Ukraine and the Taoiseach has also raised this issue.  India has not agreed to sanctions or condemned the Russian invasion.  Recently Russia's foreign minister, Mr. Serge\u012d Lavrov, has actually praised the neutral stance taken by Prime Minister Modi with regard to the war.  This is disappointing and must surely have consequences, as countries take sides in the aforementioned democracy vs autocracy conflict.  <\/p> <p> As we know, there have been many calls to expel the Russian ambassador to Ireland, Mr. Yury Filatov, and in effect, to break off diplomatic relations with Russian, given the blatant lies he has told us on national television and elsewhere.  At the very least, that man needs to do a course in Carr Communications or maybe our former colleague, Mr. Ivan Yates could assist him when he is doing television appearances.  I am aware of the advice given by the Government on this matter, having regard to the provisions of the 1961 Vienna Convention.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has said that any move to expel the ambassador as well as staff and so-called operatives would result in reciprocal action being taken by the Russian authorities in respect of our embassy in Moscow.  This could jeopardise our strategic interests, including the need to obtain on the ground, first-hand information and also the prospect of assisting Irish citizens in need in the region.  He has also said that any action in this regard will be taken in co-ordination with our EU partners.  Of course, he was dead right to block the planning application by the embassy to greatly expand its buildings on the Russian embassy site.  As we know, four Russian diplomats based in the Russian embassy in Ireland have been expelled.  Other EU member states have taken similar action.  In diplomatic speak, the expelled Russian diplomats in Ireland were engaged in activities that were \"not in accordance with international standards of diplomatic behaviour\".  There is no doubt in my mind that these so-called diplomats were military spies engaged in the collection of intelligence and espionage and sources close to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have said as much.  The suggestion is that the four were part of the Russian military agency known as the GRU.  There are still many more Russian diplomats based in Orwell Road and the option of expelling the ambassador or more staff and operatives must be kept under active consideration.  <\/p> <p> The European Commission agreed to phase out our dependency on Russian oil, gas and coal by 2027.  At the moment 40% of Europe's gas and 25% of Europe's oil comes from Russia.  Arising from this, there have been huge increases in the price of fuel generally.  It seems that there was agreement in principle at the European Council meeting to reduce VAT on fuel to 9%.  Further engagement with the Commission in this regard is underway.  As we know, the current rate is 13.5% in Ireland as a result of a derogation we obtained previously.  If nothing changes and we implemented a temporary cut in VAT, the rate would revert to the standard rate of 23% afterwards.  I hope that we can hear back from the European Commission on this matter in the near future.<\/p> <p> I am pleased that the strategic compass has also been agreed by the European Council.  Our traditional policy of military neutrality has been the cornerstone of our foreign policy and there should be no question of us joining a military alliance.  That said, we should continue to play an active part in the development of the EU's common security and defence policy, having regard to the new challenges confronting Europe at this time.  The demands for crisis management and peacekeeping should remain our guiding principle as regards the common security and defence policy and the associated strategic compass.<\/p> <p> Finally, I would like to comment on the Conference on the Future of Europe.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the issues arising from that have given the conference an added impetus.  It is hoped that the conference will conclude its business by 9 May next.  This is an ambitious target.  Concerns have been expressed about the methodology to be utilised to finalise the report.  I hope that the voices of citizens will not be drowned out as this process concludes and that real and lasting improvements to the future workings of the EU and its institutions will be the outcome of this extensive consultation and deliberation by so many people.  <\/p> <p> The 50th anniversary of Ireland's referendum on joining the EU falls on 10 May next.  The Government will be putting in place an EU 50 programme.  I look forward to that celebration of our membership of the EU and the democratic values that it represents<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600030#DD00900","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649247000,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Usually the Taoiseach or the Minister of State with responsibility for Europe would be present for these debates.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy O' Donovan, to kindly ensure that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue and, more importantly, his departmental officials are provided with a transcript of what I am about to say because it has major implications for our fishing industry.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State knows that our industry is in the worst state that it has ever been in, following a number of blows, the first of which was Brexit and the EU, UK trade agreement.  This resulted in another huge reduction in quota for Irish fishermen.  It is a mortal sin that we have 12% of the waters of all of the European Union but only around 4% of the fish.  We actually get about 15% of the fish in our own waters.  That is why we are now in a situation where the Government is asking the industry to decommission another 60 vessels.  If we compare the situation 15 years ago to today, we will have only one third of the fleet that was over 18 m.  This is coupled with the pandemic, the impact on the markets for our industry and the latest disastrous blow which is the huge increase in fuel costs.  Incredibly, there has been no real substantive intervention by the Minister to deal with this.<\/p>  <p>  Why do I raise all of this now?  I raise it because many of the problems we have are due to the fact that access to our fisheries is governed by the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP and Europe is the place to make that fight and get our fair share.  What we are doing in this country is punishing fishermen more and more.  As we speak, a Norwegian vessel has been forced to land in Derry rather than Killybegs because of a decision of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA regarding the blue whiting on that vessel and on another vessel from Denmark.  The whiting is for human consumption and is destined for places like west Africa.  It is a really important and affordable source of protein for communities in West Africa.  It was supposed to go through a fish producer and processor in Killybegs but the SFPA said that the water had to be separated from the fish.  That essentially turns the blue whiting into fish meal so rather than turn food into fish meal, the Danish vessel turned away and today, the Norwegian vessel has had to go to Derry.  The processor in Derry operates under the same European Union rules but commonsense is in play.  This means that approximately 40 lorry loads of fish will be coming from Derry to Killybegs while we get lectured about climate change and our responsibilities.  This is the madness and insanity of the way we interpret EU rules.  An episode of \"Father Ted\" would not compare to what we are seeing right now in Killybegs.  <\/p> <p> It is madness to ask fishermen to turn food for human consumption, destined for places like West Africa, into fish meal.  This matter was raised earlier by Deputy Doherty.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that the transcript of my contribution is urgently given to his colleague in Cabinet, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue in order that he can he intervene as a matter of urgency.  We are making a laughing stock of ourselves here in terms of our fishing industry.

We must all condemn in the strongest possible terms the treatment of the civilian population in Ukraine by the invading forces from Russia, the bombardment of cities and civilians, the use of hunger as a weapon, as mentioned by President Zelenskyy, the humanitarian disaster in the besieged city of Mariupol and the atrocities at Bucha, where innocent civilians were murdered with their hands tied behind their backs.  We have heard of children being murdered while trying to escape with their families in cars while waving white flags.<\/p>  <p>  Condemnation is never enough.  We need action.  Irish people want the Government to do everything it can to support the people of the Ukraine.  It is very important to recognise that there has been very significant help and assistance given to date.  However, it has not been enough.  Ireland, the European Union and the international community must do everything they can to stop these atrocities.  Measures taken to date have not been sufficiently effective.  The Russian ambassador should be expelled immediately, as should the entire Russian embassy staff.  There must be much stronger sanctions and much stronger practical assistance given to the Ukrainian people.  We are at a point where partial measures simply are not enough.  This is a moment of truth for the European Union.  Will it not just stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine?  Will it also act in the strongest possible way to defend them?<\/p>  <p>  We must stand up against the aggression, the war crimes and the slaughter of innocent civilians.  If we do not do that now and with full measures, when will we do it?  We cannot allow the short-term economic interests of some countries to take precedence over stopping these atrocities.  There is the point that the longer this war goes on, the longer will be the economic damage to various economies, including European economies, and the longer it will result in food shortages and unaffordable, high food prices, especially in lower income countries, as pointed out earlier by President Zelenskyy.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of taking the toughest possible action and doing that in regard to diplomatic staff, our first instinct should always be to use diplomatic means.  We should always support efforts to de-escalate and diplomatic efforts to find peace.  However, this invasion is not the first act of aggression by Russia towards Ukraine.  It follows years of aggressive armed occupation of parts of eastern Ukraine and years of use of gas as a weapon to undermine the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.  It follows the breaking of international agreements, including the guarantees that Russia gave Ukraine when it surrendered its nuclear weapons shortly after independence and the break-up of the Soviet Union, and the failure of Russia to withdraw its troops from eastern Ukraine, as promised under the Minsk agreements.<\/p>  <p>  On Leaders' Questions, my colleague, Deputy Catherine Murphy,  raised with the Taoiseach issues relating to energy, energy security and the cost of energy.  She made a point about the personal crisis that many families are facing and contrasted that with the unintended windfall for the Government in terms of increased VAT receipts.  There is a need to address this matter as quickly as possible.  It is welcome that it has been raised at the European Council, that flexibility is being sought and that some progress is being made, but families and households need urgency on that.  Last week and this week, people are being obliged to make impossible decisions about whether to pay rent, make mortgage repayments, pay utility bills or do their weekly shop in order that they can put food on the table.  These are impossible decisions.  We need urgent action on this matter.  This is key to building cohesion within the European Union.  Building the ability of the European Union to act cohesively means that, in conjunction with governments, it does everything it can to provide the flexibility to allow cost of living and energy costs to come down for people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600032#FF00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1649247600,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I greatly appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this very important debate.  I am grateful to the Taoiseach for updating us on the special European Council meeting that took place on 24 and 25 March.  I will not lie.  The results of this are extremely disappointing.  The fifth round of sanctions that were announced yesterday at the ECOFIN meeting, while very welcome, are yet another piecemeal approach to this situation.  If we truly want to have an impact and cut off the financing of President Vladimir Putin's vicious war machine, we need to stop messing around.  We need to go straight to the level of meaningful and far-reaching sanctions that will have an impact.  That the EU is still paying Russia for oil, gas and, up until a couple of days from now, coal is abhorrent.  This money is going directly into financing the guns, tanks and bombs that are ruining Ukraine and taking the lives of women, children, men and fighters on an hourly basis.<\/p>  <p>  I was appalled this morning when an Irish Member of the European Parliament stated that the latest round of sanctions make her sick.  What makes me sick are the images of children having their names and address written on their backs, some of whom are the same age as my daughter and wearing nappies, and those of children who have been raped and murdered lying strewn on the street.  That particular Members of this House could not have the good grace and courtesy to applaud a man who is leading his country against a vicious war machine was absolutely reprehensible.  The whataboutery and the sheer mental and ethical gymnastics utilised to excuse this lack of dignity, for a brief moment made me ashamed to be a Member of this House.  The vast majority of Members of this House, like the vast majority of people across this country, know that what is happening in Ukraine is a fight between good and evil.  The evil is very much being directed from Moscow by President Vladimir Putin and the stooges and oligarchs who surround him.  They are the people who the European Union is continuing to allow access SWIFT completely.  They are the people who are lining their pockets while they send young boys off as conscripts to murder women and children in Ukraine.  It is an absolutely appalling state of affairs, the likes of which have not been seen on this Continent since the darkest days of the Second World War.  That is why at the next emergency European Council meeting, because there will be another meeting held in an emergency status and another round of sanctions, we need to see the most meaningful, purposeful sanctions and to see the Irish Minister take the lead at that meeting.  No more whataboutery and no increments.<\/p>  <p>  This afternoon, we heard the absolute appalling comment by the newly re-elected Prime Minister of Hungary, Mr. Viktor Orb&aacute;n, when he said that he has no problem paying the Russians in roubles for their gas.  What sort of a cretinous line is that to take?  The EU cannot just be strong with its own members; it also has to look at its partner countries around the world and ask them to state clearly if they are with us or against us.  It needs to look at the United Arab Emirates and countries far closer to home such as Serbia, which aspires to join the European Union, and Brazil, Russia, India and China - the BRIC countries - and the North African countries that are happy to continue to facilitate and service the Russian war machine.  They need to be cut-off from European markets.<\/p>  <p>  The EU needs to take its place as the leader of the free and open Western world.  The EU is the largest economic bloc.  We have spent the past number of years talking about the power and importance of he Single Market.  Where will that power and importance be when the people of Bucha return to their homes and see them levelled and the bodies their loved ones lying not in a ditch or a shallow grave but strewn along the roadway?  We have seen the tactics of this vile and brutal Russian machine in these cities.  No doubt, when the Ukrainian Army liberates Mariupol, it will uncover the sort of sites and scenes that will make us all genuinely sick to our stomachs.  We will sickened not by faux words about sanctions, but by genuine scenes.  The approach of the Russian Government to the people of Ukraine and the people of Europe is appalling.<\/p> <p>The response of the European Council at its most recent meeting and at ECOFIN yesterday simply is not good enough.  I am probably the most pro-European Member of this House.  I spend pretty much every day talking about the importance of Europe but I have no problem being critical when I need to be.  The European response to the war in Ukraine so far has not been good enough.  I know our response will strengthen.  We thought the first round of sanctions again Russia would be good enough.  We are now on the fifth round of sanctions.  <\/p> <p> Decisions will, unfortunately, also have to be made in Ireland.  We talk about solidarity and we received the warm words of President Zelenskyy this morning.  We must ask if we are doing enough and if we have a credible plan to do enough, not just for the Ukrainian people but for our partners in the European Union as we deal with the fallout of this brutal war.<\/p> <p> There are two more areas I would like to raise, the first of which relates to our response to receiving refugees and the need for a co-ordinated European Union plan.  I do not believe a plan has been fully worked out yet.  We need a plan for the next couple of months and for relief efforts to buttress the efforts of Poland, Moldova, Slovakia and other member states but we must also realise that our guests from Ukraine are going to be in our countries for a number of years.  That realisation needs to be accompanied by a genuine Europe-wide plan for their relocation and shelter, and for the provision of employment opportunities and social protection.  We must also bear in mind that these people are coming from a war-torn area and a traumatic situation and will be facing into many more months when traumatic stories from war-torn areas will be coming to their homes.  How are they going to react when they get news that their 19-year-old son, their brother or husband has been killed in action?  How will they feel when they see the images coming from Bucha or Mariupol, knowing well that they could be their neighbourhoods, as they sit in Lisdoonvarna, Killiney, Roscommon or wherever they might be?  We need to be able to take this approach.  Some 10 million Ukrainians have lost their homes in the largest displacement of people since the Second World War and we need a level of joined-up thinking.<\/p> <p> The cost of living crisis is one that everyone across this House talks about on a daily basis.  Everyone presents different solutions.  We must listen to each other and disagree when we need to.  It is key that we consider the European approach to the cost of living crisis.  I was disappointed that the read-out from the European Council meeting showed that the European Commission asked member states to look at the open toolbox of opportunities.  What is needed is clear.  The Irish Government needs to bring to the next European Council meeting a resolve to achieve a derogation on VAT rates for fuel.  The ability to cut VAT has saved other sectors of our economy during tough economic times in the past.  This is about providing genuine relief to households and businesses across the country quickly.  It would be far more meaningful than many of the other suggestions that are being made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600032#FF00300","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649248200,"counter":280,"content":"<p>Today we heard the powerful and moving testimony of President Zelenskyy.

Back in 2020, the EU Commission issued letters of formal notice to Cyprus and Malta regarding their golden passport schemes.  Both countries are major havens for laundering Russian money.  In March, the EU Commissioner for Justice noted that the phasing out of citizenship by investment schemes \"is fully in line with the Commission's priorities\".  <\/p>  <p>  I note that the Government has now frozen applications for these visas and passports for Russian investors.

These must be punished and Putin must be held responsible.<\/p>  <p>  We are witnessing increased violence in Palestine at the hand of apartheid Israel.  There are illegal settlements and administrative detentions.  The voices of Michael Lynk and Amnesty International are among an increasing number of reputable voices calling out Israel's apartheid nature.  If we are going to be consistent in our condemnation of terror, Israel must be sanctioned for its crimes, which have made a two-state solution virtually impossible.<\/p>  <p>  War in Yemen is destroying countless lives with the arms industry in Europe the only beneficiary as it makes eye-watering profits.  If we are going to be consistent, Saudi Arabia must be sanctioned for its crimes.<\/p>  <p>  From the Council of Europe to the UN Security Council, Ireland needs to be a progressive voice and a leader for developing nations such as Western Sahara, which for years was under European colonial rule and is now under Moroccan occupation.  Ireland is a small nation and needs to be a voice for other small nations such as Western Sahara.  We must promote the right of the Western Saharan people to self-determination and allow them to complete the process of decolonisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600033#GG00300","speaker":"1555"},{"type":"speech","time":1649248200,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I express our solidarity with the people of Ukraine.  People across the world have been horrified and moved by the graphic pictures of horror and brutality unleashed by the invading imperialist Russian forces that have emerged.  Those images cannot but move people and give them a sense of the extreme horror of war.<\/p>  <p>  I will address the point that was made by Deputy Richmond which was, in some ways, an attempt to suggest that People Before Profit and others on the left are in some way pro-Putin because we do not support further escalation by the West or the ratcheting up of sanctions.  It is important to remember that while the West was rolling out the red carpet for Putin, it was the socialist left which consistently opposed him as a despot and warmonger.  Many of those who today are attacking the left were silent when Putin was committing brutal war crimes against the people of Chechnya.  Let us not forget that during that invasion, Putin was given a state visit to the UK by Tony Blair and Fianna F&aacute;il's own Bertie Ahern shook his bloodstained hand while socialists were protesting outside.  The socialist left were the ones who spoke out against that war.  Even at the start of this year when Russian troops were sent to Kazakhstan as part of a Collective Security Treaty Organization, CSTO, operation to put down and intimidate a workers' uprising, it was the socialist left that spoke out and organised international events in solidarity with Kazakh trade unionists and socialists.  The Department of Foreign Affairs was utterly silent on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett today reiterated our total opposition to Putin and his bloody war.  We stood with the people of Ukraine today and we stand with them in their struggle against the Russian invasion.  However, that does not mean we have to go along with the calls for the escalation of the conflict by the West.  For example, what does a NATO no-fly zone mean in reality?  It means a hot conflict and an air war between NATO forces and Russia over the territory of Ukraine.  It is a recipe for a global conflict and, potentially, a global nuclear conflict.  The French finance minister has described the escalation of sanctions as \"total economic war\".  They have been described as the harshest sanctions that have ever existed.<\/p> <p>What is the impact of these sanctions?  What is their impact on the ordinary Russian people who are not responsible for this war?  There is an impressive anti-war movement from below.  People look back now at the wars in Iraq.  What came before the first war in Iraq were horrendous sanctions that were responsible for the deaths of 500,000 children.  Everybody acknowledges that was wrong.  Sanctions that impact on ordinary people are wrong.  They also serve to undermine what we need, which is for the anti-war movement to grow.  They bolster Putin in the polls by portraying this as coming from the outside, as opposed to showing ordinary Russian people that they do not benefit from his warmongering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600033#GG00400","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649248800,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I note the re-election of a far-right, racist and homophobic Government in Hungary at the weekend.

His words were thoughtful and reflective.  The truths he told about the appalling things that are happening to his fellow citizens in Ukraine are shocking and horrifying.  Worse is probably yet to come.  Putin's soldiers are massacring civilians and razing cities to the ground just like the Nazis did in the Second World War.  What is happening is shocking and unbelievable.<\/p><p>Some people in this House have spoken about Israel.  That is fine.  That is their right and their entitlement.  During the Second World War, one in every four Jews killed was massacred by the Nazis in Ukraine.

He will be remembered forever for the evil he has done.  Coming from Drogheda, I am reminded of a previous evil person, Oliver Cromwell, who slaughtered most of the inhabitants of my town.  Just as Cromwell slaughtered inhabitants and deported citizens of Ireland at that time, Putin is doing the same by removing people from where they live in Ukraine and bringing them under arrest to Russia.  That is entirely unacceptable.<\/p><p>The lessons we are learning today are very serious and will be long-lasting.  The world has changed utterly.  Ireland is taking the right steps in the right way at the heart of our policy on Europe.  President Zelenskyy clarified his support for what the Government is doing and stated the need to continue to support Ukraine's policy.  Any steps we can take in the United Nations to further support the advent of peace in this war must be accepted and lauded.  For the generations to come, for the young people being born today, for my grandchildren, other Members' children and so on, we need to ensure Europe is stable, with Ireland at its heart.  This dictator, Putin, must be put down by any means necessary.  As a neutral country, we can only go so far but every possible effort we can make must be supported and advanced.  At the heart of all of this is the fact that evil can never triumph and good must win in the end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600034#HH00300","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1649248800,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak following the European Council meeting the week before last.  On the mind of everybody in this House, as well as across the country and across Europe, is the energy crisis.  That crisis is leading to a very severe cost-of-living crisis that is making life difficult for our people.  Our short-term challenge is solving the energy crisis.  This has already been spoken about in the House today and on many previous occasions in recent weeks and months.<\/p><p>I want to talk about the medium- and long-term energy crisis.  There has been some debate about that but I do not think there has been enough debate or that it has been good enough.  There is a tendency from many commentators to double down on some of the technologies and solutions of the past.  Those solutions may have served us well but, especially given the publication of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changereport on Monday, of which colleagues will be aware, we do not have any time to lose in transitioning to a clean energy economy.  Ireland has vast renewable energy resources off our coasts, particularly the west coast.  If we put our minds to it and if we seek the help of Europe, we can provide ten times as much energy as we will ever need.  We can satisfy our domestic need and we can help Europe get off its addiction to Russian fossil fuels.  This is the medium and long-term challenge that we must follow.<\/p><p>We are at a fork in the road.  The Ceann Comhairle and the Minister of State will probably appreciate me quoting Robert Frost:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I&mdash;<br \/><br \/>I took the one less traveled by,<br \/><br \/>And that has made all the difference. <\/blockquote>  <p>We are at the fork in the road.  We are looking at the path diverging and we have a choice.  Will we do what we did in the 1970s during the oil crisis?  We built a coal-fired power station, unlike the Danes, who invested heavily in renewable energy.  That was quite a new concept at the time.  Now, because they did that in the 1970s, the Danes have a &euro;10 billion industry.  They got behind the Germans, the Spanish and the Americans to some extent.  Ireland played it safe and built a coal-fired power station, and now we are in a very challenging situation.  We should not make the same mistake again.<\/p><p>We have an opportunity to be world leaders and innovators.  We are innovators in many sectors and we can be innovators in the development of offshore wind technology, including both floating and fixed technology.  To make this work, we have to develop a green hydrogen economy.  This is not a technological challenge but a societal and economic one.  We have to be the first to do it.  We should do it because we have the energy - more clean energy than nearly any other country.  While the solution for many countries across Europe and the world might be LNG or nuclear power, these are not the solutions for Ireland.  Ireland has a clear and clean path that it can follow.  If we speak to Europe, and to the European need for clean energy, and ask for help to scale up, escalate and expedite the delivery of clean energy from the western flank of Europe, we can get there much more quickly than we had planned heretofore.<\/p> <p>Let us be under no illusion that it is a huge challenge but it is the right path and the one we should follow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600034#HH00400","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649249400,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I was honoured to be in this Chamber this morning to listen to the address of the Ukrainian President, Mr. Zelenskyy.  There is a serious need for us to support the Ukrainian people and to push the UN, European Commission and other relevant bodies to investigate the war crimes that are being committed in Ukraine every day.  Alongside this, we cannot forget the plight of those in Syria, Afghanistan, Palestine, Yemen and other countries where parents put their children to bed every night without knowing what the following day will bring.  We must stand against all atrocities against humanity.  We have a proud history of military neutrality in global conflicts.

It is clear from the meeting that the EU recognises that we have a cost-of-living crisis and that a significant part of this is energy costs.  While the EU is willing to act we need clarity on how it will do so as soon as possible.  In the meantime, the Government must act to alleviate the pressure people are under.  I spoke to a lady yesterday who had just received her two-month electricity bill and it came to &euro;490.  She is genuinely fearful for her family's solvency and if a similar bill comes next time she does not know what she will do.  She is not alone.  The Government must stop offering ridiculous money-saving suggestions if it will not put its money where its mouth is.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council also discussed the worsening situation in Ukraine.  I would like to express my condemnation of the 9 March Russian air strike on the maternity hospital in Mariupol.  Russian soldiers have forcibly deported the surviving staff and patients of the hospital, sending more than 70 people into Russia.  Under the Geneva Conventions, it is a war crime for an occupying power to deport people to any other country during an international conflict.  The perpetrators must be held to account for this atrocity and for their deliberate targeting of the most vulnerable in Ukrainian society.  We need to send a message that Russian aggression will not be tolerated and that message should be sent home to Russia, along with the Russian ambassador.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600035#JJ00300","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1649249400,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I want to pick up where Deputy Leddin left off.  Last December, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann unanimously passed a motion that, among other things, called on the Government to design a strategy in conjunction with the European Commission to fund and construct an Atlantic electricity interconnector that would connect west coast and south-west coast renewable electricity directly to the mainland European grid.  This would provide large quantities of clean and green electricity to the EU and create tens of thousands of jobs along the western seaboard in the next decade, bringing about balanced regional development in this country.  That is something that has been talked about for a long time and this is the opportunity to implement that.  This measure would also significantly reduce the cost of electricity for Irish homes, providing us with the cheapest electricity in Europe.  To do that, we need to establish an offshore renewable development authority to drive the type of change and strategic thinking needed in this country to make this opportunity a reality.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with that, the Government needs to engage directly at European Council level to push for the need to develop this Atlantic interconnector and connect it to the European grid.  In so doing, we would bring Irish-generated clean electricity into the heart of Europe.  We will be pushing an open door on this with the European Commission and with our European colleagues but the initiative must come from the Government.  I am focusing on this issue because I have personal experience of dealing with the Celtic interconnector and of how imperative it was for Ireland to take a leadership role on that.  We brought our French colleagues along that road with us and tremendous work had to be done on that.  We did that and we secured the support of the European Commission for it.  We need to take a similar approach today if we are going to bring about this project as a reality.  The Commission is already looking at having major grid interconnection from the western seaboard to the European grid but we need to see this prioritised because if we get a positive decision from the Commission on this and if we put a strategic authority in place to drive this project in Ireland to develop our offshore renewable energy then we can be to the fore, not just in Europe but globally, in offshore wind technology.  Earlier this week the German ambassador went to Cork to meet the researchers involved in this and to meet some of the businesses investing in this.  Germany sees the huge opportunity we have in Ireland and it is about time that we took up that mantle and ran with this issue to ensure we can provide the type of interconnection needed to maximise the potential off our coast.  In tandem with that, we also need to develop our opportunity with hydrogen, which is another mechanism to transport renewable and clean energy from Ireland to the European energy network.  Funnily enough, Ireland is one of the few European countries that has yet to establish a green hydrogen strategy and this needs to happen immediately.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue in European co-operation that I want to raise is rare diseases.  Rare diseases are not rare.  In Ireland, approximately one in 12 people will at some stage in their lives be affected by such a condition.  Some 825,000 people are impacted by rare diseases when family members, many of whom are carers, are included.  Sadly, the west and north west have among the highest incidence rates of rare disease in Europe.  While most rare diseases appear early in life, with approximately 30% of children affected dying before their fifth birthdays, many of them are not diagnosed until adulthood.  There is nothing worse than being unwell and not being believed, even though you know something is fundamentally wrong; except of course if it is your child who is unwell and you are being dismissed by the medics as just another over-anxious parent.  Accurate diagnosis is often only made late into the disease.  Some 37% of people spend five years trying to get a diagnosis, by which time the patient will have already been treated for many months, or even years, for other more common diseases.  This puts an unnecessary financial burden on our health service.  We can speed up this diagnosis process through genomics.  There is an EU-wide initiative, Beyond One Million Genomes.  This initiative brings together 22 EU countries, along with Norway and the UK, looking to sequence at least 1 million genomes over the next period and to share that data securely across Europe.<\/p> <p>Ireland today remains an observer country to that initiative.  We need to put the legislative mechanism and funding structure in place to become fully part of that programme and to utilise the information that is being generated all over Europe to treat and help our people in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600035#JJ00400","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649250000,"counter":292,"content":"<p>The war in Ukraine rightly dominated the agenda of the European Council.

This is the only way we will get through to Vladimir Putin, because he does not understand humanity.  He is a war criminal.  The past four or five days have exposed the true deeds of his army, including genocide and breaches of the Geneva Conventions.  This man does not understand humanity, but he understands the value of the rouble.  His oligarchs and all his associates understand the value and greening of money.  At the beginning of this war, an analysis stated it was costing $2 billion per day for Russia to wage war.  In the past week, that figure, in analysis by economists, has crept up to $20 billion per day.  That is not just the cost of the army, weapons and military salaries, but the cost to the economy collectively, seven days a week, and I believe this will ultimately grind him down.<\/p><p>Addressing this House in June 1963, President John F. Kennedy stated: &quot;Ireland pursues an independent course in foreign policy, but it is not neutral between liberty and tyranny and never will be.&quot;  Although that is from six decades ago, that perfectly encapsulates the psyche of the Irish people and the view and policy of Government.

An incredible project is being planned off the west shore of County Clare, the Green Atlantic project.  It will be one of Europe's largest wind farms, capitalising on the significant winds coming in from the Atlantic.  It is three times more efficient than onshore wind.  There will be capacity onshore at the former Moneypoint station to process the wind energy coming in and to store it as hydrogen.  That will have knock-on effects for Shannon Airport, where we are trying to devise more sustainable and greener ways of putting planes into our sky.  Ireland is leading the way.  It does not always show that.  We need to lead the way across all European nations in being to the forefront of sustainable aviation and green energy.<\/p><p>A previous speaker mentioned Ambassador Filatov and his residence on Orwell Road.  He has shown contempt for the people of Ukraine and for the good people of his own country who do not wish to wage war.

This is all because of the failure of this Government to act.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has been asked to cap the price of the tax on fuel.  It has refused to help us on that.  It brought out a system yesterday for &euro;18 million, but it is only given to one sector of the truckers.  It only covers people who have a road haulier licence.  Every supplier in this country does not have a road haulier licence.  Every producer does not have a road haulier licence.  Only the people who transport, the subcontractors, do.  The Government therefore has not helped anyone in our rural area, such as the producers who elected the Minister of State to represent County Limerick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600037#LL00300","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1649250600,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Much of the European Council statements were rightly focused around the Russian military aggression against Ukraine.  We must continue to condemn Russia's bloody and destructive attack on Ukraine at every opportunity we get.  I am glad that this was the main focus of the European Council talks.  We stand with Ukraine and its people.  We should continue to condemn Russia at every opportunity we get.  We also must continue to maintain and strengthen our military neutrality at every opportunity.  Both are not mutually exclusive.  This is not to say that we are morally neutral in the face of war crimes either.  We never have been and we never will be.  President Zelenskyy himself when addressing the D&aacute;il earlier said although Ireland is a neutral country, it has not remained neutral to the disaster Russia has brought to Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  Our response has rightly been victim focused.  Our role as a neutral voice that condemns violations of international law and supports victims is internationally recognised.  It is important that we continue to protect this neutral voice.  I welcome that the European Council agreed to develop a Ukrainian solidarity trust fund to help to provide support to Ukraine for its immediate needs and for the reconstruction of Ukraine, following the incredible destruction and loss suffered there.  I was concerned, however, about the European Union's endorsement of a strategic compass, which intends to provide a shared assessment of the strategic environment in which the EU is operating and of the threats and challenges the Union supposedly faces.<\/p>  <p>  I know that the Commission, in conjunction with the European Defence Agency, EDA, intends to look at defensive investment gaps and to introduce initiatives to strengthen the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base, EDTIB, next month.  We need to tread very carefully here on this.  We need to ensure that our neutrality is not compromised when such discussions take place.  The European Council has stated that it intends to harness EU funding instruments and initiatives to strengthen the defence capabilities of member states.  We cannot allow them to rope Ireland into this.  We cannot allow them to get involved in the way we conduct our Defence Forces.  We must stay strong in our neutrality.  We all know that in the House that the EU will have willing partners here to weaken our neutrality and we need to watch out for that.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of energy issues, I am glad to see that the national circumstances will be taken into account and I think that we should look at all the options that are provided for.  The Government is quick to make the point that it cannot act on VAT on energy costs and that may be so, but the Commission is pointing out the options that are available, such as temporary taxation of or regulatory interventions on windfall profits.  Those options are available from the Commission itself.  What is being done about that?<\/p>  <p>  We have that we have been constantly led to believe that that is the only game in town but now we see that it is not.  It is interesting that we have been very vocal on the import of oil and gas from Russia and have said that we should stop them straight away and rightly so.  Yet, that it is a stance that would cause hardship for the citizens who depend on them.  Yet, interestingly, there are not many Irish citizens who depend on gas from Russia.  There may be a knock-on effect if a ban comes into force and time will tell in relation to that.  At the same time, we appear to be protecting the Aughinish Alumina plant from sanctions.  That is hypocritical of us.  If we need to protect that plant, the Government should be considering taking it over straight away and to take it out of the hands of the oligarchs.  Why should we protect that plant for an oligarch?  Should the Government not take it into public control so that we can run it ourselves?  We can dispose of it at a later stage, rather than protecting it and keeping it free from sanctions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600037#LL00400","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1649250600,"counter":301,"content":"<p>We now have 20 minutes for a question-and-answer session.

This is where I want his help.  The pig farmers were here last week.  The introduction of the subsidies for fuel for heavy goods vehicles is only available to people who hold road haulier licences.  That counts out the quarries that own vehicles and supply their own goods.  It takes out the pig industry that runs the produce to the factories using its own vehicles.  It takes the farming and agricultural sector out of it by using their own vehicles.  It only covers people who have a road haulage license.  That is 38% of the HGVs in this country.  Therefore, 62% of the HGVs are getting no subsidy.  I am asking the Minister of State to take this to Government.  Should it not cover everyone?  Everyone who has a HGV is covered under the RSA.  They also have to go for the Road Safety Authority, RSA, MOTs.  Then, they tax their vehicles on a commercial basis under HGV goods.  The right way of doing a subsidy would have been that anyone who is compliant with a current MOT on a HGV with the RSA and is taxed should qualify for the fuel subsidy.  That would cover everyone.  We could take this to Europe because it would work for everyone, for every person in Ireland.  The Government could cap the tax on fuel at &euro;1.30.  After that, we would pay the increase in the fuel, but we would not pay tax on it.  That is something that the Government can introduce now.<\/p> <p>It would actually help every householder in this country whether he or she is working, elderly or retired.  It would cover every person in this country.  People would see it first-hand at the pumps.  This would help people.  It would also help registered businesses that do not qualify at the moment under any other scheme that is available.<\/p> <p> My last question is about public transport, which does not cover everyone outside of the towns and villages in this country.  If somebody wants public transport, it means that we must have infrastructure.  As I said earlier, there are 2 million vehicles and 2.4 million people working in this country.  That means public transport only covers 400,000 people plus those who live in an area where they have public transport.  It does not cover 2 million people, however.  Where is all the taxation going on the fuels?  It is coming from fuel taxes.  I want the Minister of State to help me make a difference to every household.  I want him to stand up here for the people of County Limerick who elected him to help all industry for the area he represents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600037#LL00600","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649251200,"counter":304,"content":"<p>In fairness to the Minister of State, he can only respond on behalf of the Government rather than on behalf of the people of County Limerick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600038#MM00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1649251200,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I will put it in terms of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600038#MM00300","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1649251200,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle.  I have been here for 12 years now representing the people of County Limerick.  In response to Deputy O'Donoghue, I do not need to be reminded of my job.  I am well capable of being reminded of that by the people of County Limerick.  Having been returned by them three times now, I must be doing something right.  A number of questions were asked.  I will try to do my best.  Most of the Deputies who asked them are not in the Chamber now.  Many of the questions pertain to different Departments.  We have made records of them and we will reply to them in writing because they do not actually relate to the European Council at all.<\/p><p>I will take the last questions first, which relate specifically to the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Transport.  I will refer Deputy O'Donoghue's questions to the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan and get a reply to him.<\/p><p>In general, with regard to rural infrastructure, I note that in the <i>Limerick Leader<\/i>, <i>Weekly Observer<\/i>and <i>Vale Mallow Star and Observer<\/i>, the Deputy is very quick to welcome much of the Government's investment in rural roads.  As someone who works in construction, I note the Deputy is very praiseworthy of the Government's increased investment in roads all over County Limerick.  We are doing a very good job in investing in roads in County Limerick.  The Deputy is also very praiseworthy of the Government's rural transport infrastructure improvements, which have been done all over County Limerick.  We are, therefore, doing an awful lot of very positive things as well.  The Deputy gets a lot of speaking time in this Chamber.  He is no stranger to taking a lot of credit for some of the stuff the Government is doing in County Limerick.  During some of the times he uses that speaking time here, he might put in the odd plug for the positive stuff we are doing as well, because it is not all negative.<\/p><p>I will start at the beginning of the questions.  Deputy McDonald raised the issue, as did many Deputies, including previous speakers, of the area of VAT.  In his opening remarks the Taoiseach said this issue relates not only to Ireland.  All member states have asked that this be dealt with.  In fairness, Deputy McDonald did say, and I wrote it down, that &quot;the Government cannot do everything&quot; and that she recognises this is a very complicated issue.  Every speaker who came in here said the Government cannot do everything and then went on to say the Government should do everything.  It is a case of the oxymorons; the Government cannot do everything.  I recognise that the cost of living in every household in the country has gone through the roof.  A person would want to be living on a different planet not to recognise that.  The Government simply cannot do everything but it is trying to respond, as every member state of the European Union is doing.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach was one of the first out of the blocks with regard to being one of the first Prime Ministers to raise the issue of VAT.  Further work with the European Commission is required to do this because previous speakers, who I think were from Sinn F&eacute;in, said that once this war passes - and it will pass - there will be a requirement for the VAT rate to go back up.  When that does happen, I am sure many people will be clamouring to tell the Government not to do that.  The Taoiseach is very conscious of that issue.<\/p><p>Many speakers raised the issue of where we are specifically around EU-China affairs and about EU-India affairs.  Credit must again go to the Taoiseach.  He was the first Prime Minister to raise the issue of India's position on the atrocities that are happening in Ukraine at the moment.  I also wish to make a personal comment, a Cheann Comhairle.  Being a Minister of State, one does not get speaking time like many Deputies do on different matters.  I wish to mention some specific issues that have been raised.  Ireland's relations with China are closely linked to the EU perspective.  The EU strategy of managing complex relations is a good one.  We understand and accept the differing elements that need to be addressed in a strategic and united matter when it comes to China.  The same issue runs through with regard to India.  The Taoiseach has been very clear in relation to that.<\/p><p>Deputy Cian O&rsquo;Callaghan said that condemnation is not enough and we need action, and that practical assistance will be required.  However, then other speakers and questioners said that practical assistance cannot involve Ireland getting involved militarily.  This is, therefore, the dilemma in which the country is involved.  How far do we move towards getting involved that does not see this country being practically militarily involved?  That is a dilemma the country has confronted from the outset of this war.  We have confronted it in a very practical sense by making sure we provide humanitarian aid but also by providing very practical assistance.<\/p><p>I wish to pay tribute to the Ceann Comhairle's initiative of inviting the President of Ukraine to address us this morning.  In many ways, it was historic.  We can use every kind of clich&eacute; we want.  It was also a source of terrible embarrassment, however, to be in a Chamber where colleagues refused to clap.  I come from a part of the world where we use an expression that goes when you are in a hole, you should stop digging.  They came in then and tried to give an explanation as to why they did not clap.  One can see in his face and from his facial expressions, by his demeanour and from photographs that have been taken of him, how this war has run President Zelenskyy down and how it has destroyed his country and his people.  They used these mar dhea excuses, together with their colleagues in the European Parliament in some sort of warped ideology, not to support him.  They say they will support his country but they will not support him.  I feel sorry for them that as parliamentarians, they would do that today.  They brought shame on themselves but they also brought a degree of shame on us because as colleagues of theirs, we have to share a room with them.  I ask them to reflect on it and to come back and apologise for it.  One of them happens to be an officeholder of this Parliament.  To me, that is a source of embarrassment.<\/p><p>Outside being a Member of this Parliament, I am a husband and father to three young children.  One image has really stuck in my mind in the last couple of weeks.  It is an image of what people say is potentially a three-year-old child who is gagged, blindfolded, with hands tied and possibly raped.  I have a seven-year-old, a three-year-old and a two-year-old.  That three-year-old could potentially be mine in any other circumstance.  There can be no equivocation in this.  There can be no hiding places and no excuses.  There can be no press statement saying they did not clap because of X, Y or Z.  To me, this is very black and white.  A person is either in or our out with regard to these atrocities.<\/p><p>I did not get a chance to speak to the whole Ukrainian situation during the statements that were given the previous week.  To me, the Ceann Comhairle's position this morning really summed up the question of whether we are neutral.  We are not neutral.  How can we be neutral in this?How could we not have a position with regard to right or wrong?  Before I came into the D&aacute;il, I was a primary teacher.  Deputy O'Donoghue took issue one morning on Live 95 with the fact that I was a primary teacher.  He said there were too many primary teachers in the D&aacute;il.  I was also an engineer, by the way.  I was an industrial chemist, to satisfy the Deputy's curiosity in that respect as well.<\/p>  <p>I always told children that if they ever had a doubt about something being right or wrong, it was probably wrong.  Some Deputies had an issue earlier relating to whether they should clap in response to President Zelenskyy&rsquo;s address.  Some of them began clapping, looked to their colleagues and then stopped clapping.  To me, they are a source of embarrassment to this Parliament and to us as colleagues.  They should reflect on what they have done, come back to the Chamber and set the record straight.  They should make a personal statement to the House and apologise for their actions.  Given what has been said on Twitter, they have invited unnecessary commentary on what was an otherwise very positive initiative on the part of the Ceann Comhairle.<\/p> <p> Turning to some of the issues Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell raised in respect of the IFSC, which Deputy Sherlock also raised in the context of legislation proposed by his Labour Party colleague, they will be referred to the Minister for Finance.<\/p> <p> I have dealt with the issue raised by People Before Profit regarding solidarity.<\/p> <p> I agree entirely with Deputy Leddin regarding the issue of green energy but, unfortunately, like Robert Frost's line about two roads diverging in a yellow wood, I am going to take a different road.  He is going to take the road of green energy in the medium term, but our definitions of \"medium term\" might differ.  That we have gas storage, which we need, in a different jurisdiction proves we need a policy on gas storage in this country in the short term.  We cannot rely on a third country, outside of the European Union, to store our gas, which is happening at the moment.  An LNG facility in a country outside of the European Union is storing our gas and that policy is not sustainable into the short and medium terms, by which I mean ten years.  We need a policy on green energy that will allow electricity to be brought into Moneypoint to be converted into hydrogen, stored, transferred across the grid and sold to France - I am all for that - but what will we do between now and then?<\/p> <p> We need to be able to import gas from different sources such as the Gulf of Mexico and the United States, with conditions applied to that, rather than simply finding an Irish solution for an Irish problem, which has been done for other, social elements in the past to deal with problems we wanted to sweep under the carpet in this country.  We have dealt with issues by exporting them to the United Kingdom.  We did that very unsuccessfully, historically in this country, to our shame in respect of other issues, and we are now doing it with gas importation.  We are already importing fracked gas through a gas interconnector, and it suits the narrative of some people whereby just because it is done from the UK, we need not talk about it.<\/p> <p> We do need to talk about it and have a discussion in this country about our energy security.  The discussion needs to be honest and open and it needs to be held here and now.  We need to start talking about gas storage.  Deputy Leddin is correct in respect of the coal-fired station, but we are damn lucky we have it now.  If we had not built it in the 1980s, what would we have now?  I would probably be talking to the House under candlelight because the lights would have gone out if not for Moneypoint.  Moneypoint is going gangbusters at the moment and God help us if we did not have it.  While we are lucky to have onshore wind, it is not reliable.<\/p> <p> Deputy Naughten referred to offshore wind electricity.  Again, we will refer those issues to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, but I nonetheless fully concur.<\/p> <p> Deputy Pringle, who is no longer in the Chamber, referred to an issue that concerns my constituency and Aughinish Alumina.  It is a pity when people get their information from online sources, which tend to be based on rumour and innuendo.  If he had asked somebody like me, or perhaps Deputy O'Donoghue, who might know something about Aughinish Alumina, he would know that what he said about the operation of the plant was an utter fallacy.  The plant employs well over 1,000 people in my constituency and it is not in any way connected to a war machine.  In fact, it provides Europe with up to 30% of the alumina required for the Continent&rsquo;s construction and aircraft and car manufacturing and is an integral part of Europe's alumina industry.  It is not connected, as some people might want to suggest, to any sort of Russian empire.<\/p> <p> If there are any points I have not responded to, I will come to them in my closing remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600038#MM00400","speaker":"1494","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649251800,"counter":308,"content":"<p>We are fortunate to have so many robust contributors from County Limerick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600039#NN00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1649251800,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600039#NN00300","speaker":"1494"},{"type":"speech","time":1649251800,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister of State might not have all the details to hand, but can we get an update for the Ukrainian ambassador, H.E.

As the Taoiseach indicated, I will address some of the economic and EU external issues discussed at the most recent meeting.  The European Council in March endorsed the political emphasis of the Versailles declaration insofar as strengthening Europe's economic base is concerned.  This includes unlocking the full potential of the Single Market to underpin the green and digital transitions essential to Europe's future prosperity and well-being.  The leaders also endorsed the strategic priorities of the Commission's annual sustainable growth survey and invited member states to reflect them in their national reform programmes and stability programme updates to be submitted this month as part of their European semester process.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland agrees that the annual sustainable growth survey produced by the European Commission in November provides the correct political emphasis for economic policy co-ordination at this time.  It highlights four key dimensions of competitive sustainability as guiding principles for Europe's economic renewal.  They are also consistent with the strategic direction established by the recovery and resilience facility forming the core component of the historic Next Generation EU budgetary package.  The four dimensions comprise environmental sustainability, productivity, fairness and macroeconomic stability.  The Commission will update its assessment of the economic outlook in May and has acknowledged significant downside risks since its February forecast, which did not take account of the impacts of the war in Ukraine.  Given the renewed uncertainties and risks, Ireland's view is the EU needs to remain agile and flexible in our political response to the current circumstances and we welcome the conclusions adopted at the Council meeting in March.<\/p>  <p>  On 24 and 25 March, the leaders also exchanged views on the EU-China summit, which subsequently took place on 1 April.  The leaders discussed relations with China in the changed and urgent context of the situation.  At the EU-China summit, the EU and China extensively discussed Russia's military aggression against Ukraine, which is endangering global security and the world economy.  It is the EU's assessment that the shared interests of the EU and China should be to work together to stop Russia's war in Ukraine as soon as possible.  From the EU's perspective, we view the EU and China to have a common responsibility to support peace, stability and a sustainable and safe world.  While the focus of the summit was very much on Ukraine, EU and Chinese leaders also discussed the state of bilateral relations and areas of shared interest such as climate change, biodiversity and health, as well as ways to ensure a more balanced and reciprocal trade relationship.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council also discussed the prolonged and political crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina, reiterating its commitment to a European perspective of that country and the western Balkans more generally.  The EU wants to see leaders in Bosnia and Herzegovina demonstrate a strong commitment to constitutional electoral reform, which is vital for the stability and full functionality of that country, an essential precursor to obtaining EU candidate status.  The EU stands ready to continue high-level engagement in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  I thank all the Deputies for their statements and questions.  The Taoiseach will continue to report to the House following the regular meetings of the Council.  We will try to respond in writing to any questions that have been collated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600039#NN00800","speaker":"1494"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649251800,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an D&aacute;il ar fionra&iacute; ar 3.20 p.m. agus cuireadh t&uacute;s leis ar&iacute;s ar 4.21 p.m.\r\n\r\nSitting suspended 3.20 p.m. and resumed at 4.21 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
