Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine, proceeded in Ukrainian as follows:<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649235300,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.  Mr. Speaker, Taoiseach, dear Senators and Members of the Parliament, dear people of Ireland, this night our territory was again hit by Russian missiles.<\/p> <p>It was done cunningly and it hit civilian infrastructure.  The new fuel storage depot was hit.  This is viewed by Russia as a target.  This is their attribute.  They are destroying things that are sustaining livelihoods to people.  They are hitting places where we store fuel, food storage depots, agricultural equipment and fields.  They are putting mines into the fields.  They have also blocked all of our seaports, together with the vessels that already had agricultural cargos for export.  Why are they doing this?  Because for them, hunger is also a weapon &mdash; a weapon against us ordinary people as an instrument of domination.  Ukraine is one of the leading food-supplying countries in the world.  This is not just about the deficit and the threat of hunger for more than dozens of countries, Asia and Africa; it is about even more because there will be a shortage of food and the prices will go up.  This is reality for millions of people who are hungry.  It will be more difficult for them to feed their families, especially in north Africa.<\/p> <p> They are undermining our seeding time, they are destroying our infrastructure and they are deliberately provoking the food crisis.  What will happen as the result of this crisis?  At the least, there will be political turbulence.  At a maximum, there will be binges of violence and new refugees looking to save their lives.  Russia is using this hunger weapon.<\/p> <p> The worst thing is the city of Mariupol.  This city of 500,000 inhabitants was put under siege and Russia has blocked access from the soil and from the sea.  They are blocking the humanitarian cargo.  They are not allowing anything to come through, neither water nor medication.  While it was snowing, people could melt the snow to get water.  Now they do not have even that.<\/p> <p> They are bombing 24-7.  There are air strikes and bombings in Mariupol.  There is no single house left intact in a city of half a million.  None.  The dead and killed were simply buried in the yards of the condominiums.  In many cases, they could not even do that: the bodies were just left there lying on the streets and in the remnants of the buildings and basements.  We do not know how many citizens of Mariupol have been killed by Russia, but we know for sure this was part of general occupation tactics.  They have done the same or they have attempted to do the same with the cities of Chernihiv, Sumy, Okhtyrka, Kharkiv, Izyum, Volnovakha and many other Ukrainian cities.  Maybe you have not heard those geographic names yet but this is about millions of people that Russia has been continually trying to destroy.<\/p> <p> When you hear these things, it may seem that this is not possible.  It may seem that none in the present-day world would dare to do that, but these are real facts.  The fact is that Mariupol citizens were drawing the maps of how to find the bodies of the dead who were buried in their yards.  The fact is that Russian occupants were killing people on the roads when they were trying to escape.  They blocked cities.  Until today on the Ukrainian highways we have hundreds of shot in burned cars.  The fact is that Russian soldiers were not even trying to take these bodies out of the streets.  While Bucha and Irpin were under occupation, these dead bodies were simply lying on the streets, on the sideways, in the yards of the houses, anywhere.  The fact is that in the 42 days of the all-out Russian war, at least 167 children have been killed in Ukraine.<\/p> <p>We do not yet know all the atrocities of Mariupol and the victims in all the areas of Ukraine where the fighting is still going on.  The fact is that, as a result of Russian shelling, 927 educational institutions and 258 hospitals were damaged.  The Russians even shot at 78 ambulances.  They were targeting even churches and shelters where they knew for sure there was nobody but women and children.  This is a fact.<\/p> <p> The country that is doing this does not deserve to be in the circle of civilised countries.  It should be held responsible for everything it has done on Ukrainian soil.  The Russians have come to Ukraine as a colonising army.  Their state protagonists and their politicians are not even concealing what they want.  In the 21st century, they are looking at their country as a colonial empire which allegedly has the right to subdue neighbouring people, destroy the foundations of their independent life and destroy their identity, everything that makes us Ukrainians.  Russian soldiers were deliberately looking for and killing teachers in the occupied districts.  They are abducting local government leaders and they are killing community leaders.  Together with the Russian army, there were special groups coming in who were trying to destroy any political opposition.<\/p> <p> Now, when we are hearing new rhetoric about the sanctions against the Russian opposition, I cannot tolerate any indecisiveness after everything we have gone through in Ukraine and after everything that Russian troops have done.  Today, when the world knows about the crimes against our people, we still have to convince even some European companies to abandon the Russian market.  We still have to convince foreign politicians that we need to cut any ties of Russian banks with the global financial system.  We still have to convince Europe that Russian oil cannot feed the Russian military machine with new sources of funding.<\/p> <p> Ladies and gentlemen, the people of Ireland have been supporting good and have been supporting Ukraine since the very first days.  This is a fact.  They did not doubt starting to help us; they began doing this right away.  Although Ireland is a neutral country, it has not remained neutral to the disaster and to the mishaps that Russia has brought to Ukraine.  I am grateful to every citizen of Ireland.  Thank you for supporting sanctions against Russia, thank you for the humanitarian and financial support extended to our country and thank you for your care of our Ukrainian people who found shelter on your land.  Think about the fact that, as of today, 10 million Ukrainians have been left without shelter by Russia.  They had to leave their native cities because of this war.  This is something we cannot come to grips with.  It means that Russia has not yet abandoned its plans.  It is still looking to subdue and occupy all the Ukrainian people.<\/p> <p> We want you to help us to make sure that Russia will start looking for peace and leave us alone.  I ask you to show more leadership in our anti-war coalition.  I ask you to convince EU partners to introduce even more rigid sanctions against Russia that would really make sure that the Russian war machine will stop.  We have to put an end to trading with Russia.  We have to cut the ties of Russian banks to the global system and cut the sources of their income from oil that they use for their weapons and for killing.<\/p> <p>There are mechanisms through which this can be done.  The only thing we are lacking is a principled approach from some political and business leaders who still think war and war crimes are not as horrific as financial losses.  I am sure Ireland's leadership can make a difference and change this.  I am sure that the whole of Europe will be able to stop this war and bring peace and stability to the east of Europe.  We cannot delay any longer.  The longer Russia's aggression continues, the worse the consequences will be not only for our Continent, but for neighbouring regions.  <br\/><br\/>I say to Members and to the people of Ireland that our principled approach and courage have already turned a new page in the relationship between Ukraine and Ireland.  Our mutual understanding and mutual respect is already at a level whereby it is only a question of time before we can start living in a common European home.  Thank you for Ireland's support for the accelerated procedure to provide membership of the EU to Ukraine.  With your support, the process will be even faster and beneficial to both our nations.  We need to start thinking about the restoration of our country after the war.  We are inviting leading countries of the world to participate in rebuilding and restoring Ukraine.  Of course, Ireland is always welcome to participate, for example, in Kherson Oblast.  Ireland is known for its skill in valueing lives, its community development experience and its economic potential.  Let us bring our efforts together and show that, jointly, Ukraine and Ireland can do much more than the biggest country in the world was trying to destroy.  I am grateful to Ireland.  <i>Slava Ukraini<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600004#B00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

We have much to digest as this painful, awful war on our Continent&rsquo;s mainland continues apace.  As Ukrainian people continue to die, we must act.  What we have seen in recent days and the extent of the barbaric actions visited upon the people of Ukraine is simply horrendous.  We need international courts to give a transparent and fair reckoning for the bloodshed in these heinous crimes.<\/p>  <p>  Your Excellency, we salute your own personal bravery over the past weeks and we salute the outstanding bravery and resilience of the Ukrainian people in the face of unprovoked aggression.  While Ireland is a militarily neutral country, we are not politically neutral.  We do not stand idly by.  We will not, as W.B. Yeats might have said, forsake the little streets hurled upon the great.  We will continue to offer practical, on-the-ground support to our Ukrainian friends.  We will also continue to welcome those forced to leave Ukraine seeking safety on foreign shores.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. President, we Irish are aware of the pain of separation and the loss of our people to distant lands.  At this challenging time, those forced to leave Ukraine are welcome here in Ireland and they will be supported and assisted until such time as they are free to return to rebuild their damaged homeland, an exercise we will help you with.<\/p> <p>Most of us here in this Chamber became involved in politics and public life because we trust in people and we believe that most people are fundamentally good.  Last Tuesday at the Conference of Speakers of the European Union Parliaments in Ljubljana I called upon the 450 members of the Duma to shoulder their responsibility.  The law of averages suggests that among the 450 members of that Parliament there must be people who can see through the lies, fake news, propaganda and manipulation.  They must now find their courage - courage that the Ukrainian people demonstrate daily.  They must speak up, speak out, take their courage and reject the leadership they currently have.<\/p> <p> There are 143 million Russian people populating that country.  Again, the law of averages tells us that many of those people must be fine, decent and honourable people who have a respect for human rights.  President Zelenskyy, your people are being asked to show courage that goes beyond the bounds of human endurance.  Please God, the people of Russia will now find their courage to also reject what is being done wrongly and devastatingly in their name.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, Mr. President, thank you for honouring us and joining us today.

We thank President Zelenskyy for his heartfelt, honest, clear and, indeed, historic address to our Parliament this morning.  The strength of his commitment and that of the people of Ukraine to his country and to restoring its place as a free, safe, democratic and an independent country within the community of nations is both humbling and uplifting.<\/p>  <p>  We heard grave testimony from President Zelenskyy this morning and we have seen ourselves the most shocking and harrowing of images from Bucha, from Irpin, from Mariupol and from across Ukraine.  Russia will have to live with the shame and ignominy of what it has done in Ukraine for generations.  Those responsible will be held to account.   We are with Ukraine and I am certain that, in the end, Ukraine will prevail.<\/p>  <p>  We are a militarily neutral country.  However, we are not politically or morally neutral in the face of war crimes.  Quite the opposite.  Our position is informed by the principles that drive our foreign policy &ndash; support for international human rights, for humanitarian law and for a rules-based international order.  We are not neutral when Russia disregards all of these principles.  We are with Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  Ukraine&rsquo;s political, economic and humanitarian needs are now manifold and pressing.  Our efforts, as a friend and as a partner of Ukraine, are aimed at using all the levers at our disposal to bring a just end to this war - applying international pressure on Russia, pursuing accountability for violations of international law and meeting the humanitarian needs of those caught now in the midst of this terrible and immoral war.<\/p>  <p>  Thousands of people have been killed.  Millions have been driven from their homes.  This is a humanitarian crisis the likes of which Europe has not seen since the dark years of the Second World War.   This war touches us all.  That is why Ireland is supporting further European Union sanctions at European level.<\/p> <p>We need a sanctions regime that brings it home to Putin and his regime that he will not, he cannot, succeed.  We want the strongest possible sanctions against the Russian Federation and we will pursue those.<\/p> <p> That is why we support the establishment of a solidarity trust fund for Ukraine, agreed by European Union leaders when we met in Brussels on 24 March, to support the Government of Ukraine now, and when the war is over to support reconstruction.<\/p> <p> That is why I welcome and support Ukraine's application for EU membership.  I reiterate our support for that application this morning in this House.  It is the democratic right of Ukraine and the people of Ukraine to decide your political orientation.  You have chosen to apply for European Union membership.<\/p> <p> We know that EU enlargement has been a force for stabilisation and democratisation in the European Union&rsquo;s neighbourhood.  It is in the European Union&rsquo;s strategic interest.  It is in Ukraine&rsquo;s interest.  As I said to you, President Zelenskyy, when we spoke on 16 March, I will continue to support Ukraine&rsquo;s case.  That is why also we have committed &euro;20 million in direct humanitarian funding, delivered through proven international agencies active on the ground and we will do more.  This is to meet the urgent needs of those in need in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries - including shelter, medical care, health, water and sanitation.<\/p> <p> As well as financial support, through a collaborative effort, we are in the process of delivering medical equipment, including ambulances, ultrasound machines, mobile X-ray machines, ventilators, and incubators.  On 26 and 28 March, two despatches of urgently required medical equipment left Ireland and more will follow.  That is why Ireland has contributed our full share to the European peace facility&rsquo;s &euro;1 billion military assistance package for Ukraine.  We have also supplied provisions and body armour to the Ukrainian military.  We will also continue to support any avenue that can lead to an immediate ceasefire.<\/p> <p> In light of what is being revealed in the areas from which Russian troops have withdrawn, that task will now be even more difficult.  I therefore especially commend your commitment, President Zelenskyy, to continuing to try, despite the enormous challenges you face.  Please know that we are with you in that task, and that we stand ready to contribute to and to support any initiative that can lead to a just peace for the people of Ukraine.<\/p> <p> I know that the people of Mariupol cannot wait for talks to conclude.  Their needs are too urgent.  We need to see genuine humanitarian corridors opened and implemented.  Ireland, along with our partners, will continue to support any sincere efforts at the United Nations to ensure safe and unhindered access for humanitarian assistance.<\/p> <p> Thousands of Ukrainians have arrived in Ireland since the start of the conflict.  A Cheann Comhairle, if I may, I address these words to them.  I know that the ambassador of Ukraine, H.E. Ms Larysa Gerasko, is here in the Gallery for today&rsquo;s debate.  To those who have arrived here from Ukraine, I hope you find in Ireland safe harbour and friendship for as long as you need it.  Most of you, I know, look forward to the day when you can return to a peaceful and free Ukraine, to the family and friends you have left behind.  That day will come.  In the meantime, our home is your home.<\/p> <p> The war in Ukraine has sparked a crisis the likes of which we have not seen in Europe for decades.  It is no surprise to me that the Irish people have stood up to be counted in an unprecedented way in response.<\/p> <p>Over 18,000 Ukrainian people have arrived in Ireland.  Dedicated reception facilities are in place to provide temporary protection and access to other services immediately on arrival.  We are providing accommodation to those who have sought it and we are ramping up our efforts to meet the very challenging and increasing demands.  <br\/><br\/>We are also working to ensure that other supports are available to people arriving here, including access to health, social care services and education.  New arrivals are also being registered to ensure that they can access income supports as needed.  The heartfelt response of people across Ireland is clear in the whole range of initiatives at community level.  I would like to thank all of the people who have opened their hearts and, in some cases, their homes to people from Ukraine.  <br\/><br\/>President Zelenskyy, when you addressed the European Parliament you said, &quot;life will win over death, and light will win over darkness&quot;.  Even in the face of the bleak horrors of this week, I recall your words and the hope and determination they carry.  We stand with Ukraine.  <i>Slava Ukraini<\/i>. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600008#F00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649237100,"counter":21,"content":"<p>President Zelenskyy can no longer remain online with us, but this debate will be followed in Ukraine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600010#H00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1649237100,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank President Zelenskyy for joining us today and sharing with us the heartbreaking and inspiring story of his people's courage and endurance in the face of a grotesque and appalling aggression.

Thankfully, because of the brave Ukrainian resistance there is still time.<\/p><p>In the long history of our own country we have never invaded another, but we know what it is like to have been invaded and to have the very existence of our national identity questioned.  For these reasons, we feel for the idealism of the Ukrainian people, their defiance and their determination to face down a new evil empire.  As a country, we are heartbroken watching the scenes we see on television every night.  We are heartbroken to see what the people of Ukraine have had to endure for 42 days.  We are angry at the appalling human rights abuses against men, women and children and the terrible loss of life.  We promise that we will do everything we can to aid Ukraine in the struggle and to shelter the people of Ukraine.  We will stand by them in their greatest hour.<\/p><p>The abolitionist and civil rights leader, Frederick Douglass, liked to quote our own civil rights leader, Daniel O'Connell, who he met here in Dublin.  He said the history of the Irish people could be &quot;traced like a wounded man through a crowd, by the blood&quot;.  Today the history of Ukraine can be traced through its villages, towns and cities, by the suffering of its children, women and men, by the blood.<\/p><p>Today, President Zelenskyy showed a burning desire for freedom and self-determination, democracy and liberty, things we enjoy and sometimes take for granted.  He showed a desire for a European future for Ukraine, a place in that common European home that we helped to build, and we endorse that desire and support the Ukrainian people in their wish to join the European union.<\/p><p>A little over 100 years ago, the woman who is perhaps Ukraine's greatest national poet captured their dreams of freedom and courage.

You have raped and defiled the very principles of common humanity which bind us together in peace and harmony.

I want, if I can, to take some of the words we have heard previously, starting with former United States President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who spoke here some 59 years ago.  The words he spoke then are just as relevant today.  He stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAnd no nation, large or small, can be indifferent to the fate of others, near or far.  Modern economics, weaponry and communications have made us all realise, more than ever, that we are one human family and this one planet is our home.  <\/blockquote>  <p>He went on to say &quot;Ireland pursues an independent course in foreign policy, but it is not neutral between liberty and tyranny and never will be&quot;.  <\/p><p>That is what guides us today.  It guides us in the work we do in the United Nations Security Council, to which we were elected by the small non-aligned countries of this world to stand up for the rights of individual nation states.  It is in that spirit that our soldiers march to the hard conflict zones with blue helmets on their heads to try to hold the peace line.  It is in that spirit that our Naval Service sails to the Mediterranean to rescue the most destitute and in need.  Perhaps even inspired by this, our trawlers in west Cork were willing to head into international seas to uphold the rule of law.  It is in this spirit that we have worked through the United Nations and in the European Union calling for stiffer sanctions.  With real resolve we will answer President Zelenskyy's call to stop the flow of funds for the war by stopping the flow of fossil fuels, one of the weapons being used in this conflict.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600011#J00500","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649237400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600011#J00600","nonspeaker":"Senator David Norris"},{"type":"speech","time":1649237400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Norris.  It is great to see him here today.  That is the spirit which has people from our country bringing humanitarian aid to the conflict zone, with medicines to tend to the wounded and meals to feed the hungry people President Zelenskyy spoke about.  They bring defensive shields against the weapons of war.  It is in that spirit that the Irish people have opened and will open their doors to provide sanctuary and shelter for women and children in particular fleeing conflict while their men stay at home.  It is going to be difficult and challenging beyond compare, which we all know, but we are committed to this work.<\/p>  <p>  I will quote one of the other leaders who has spoken here, former Chancellor Kohl of Germany.  In addressing this House he said we are \"European by conviction\" and that is true.  It is our conviction as a small State and nation that allows us to strengthen when we work in co-operation and collaboration with European colleagues.  It is appropriate today to quote two lines from the preamble of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which governs this relationship.<\/p> <p>It states that the signatories are:<\/p><blockquote>\tINTENDING to confirm the solidarity which binds Europe and the overseas countries and desiring to ensure the development of their prosperity, in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, [and]<br \/><br \/>RESOLVED by thus pooling their resources to preserve and strengthen peace and liberty, and calling upon the other peoples of Europe who share their ideal to join in their efforts... <\/blockquote> <p>We heard today that just such a call has come from the people of a European nation to be part of those efforts.  I agree with the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste that our answer to widen and broaden the European family, on this most western outpost of Europe, is to say yes, that that ideal is not an exclusive one.  It should not be constrained.  It will be stronger when we spread those democratic ideals.<br\/><br\/>I will quote one last person, Nelson Mandela, who spoke here so eloquently after he had reached and achieved his freedom.  He said: &quot;Nothing can stop the evolution of humanity towards the condition of greater and ever-expanding freedom&quot;.  He went on to say: &quot;We ask that you stay the course with us, we need your support for the democratic perspectives that we represent.&quot;  On that call for support for democratic systems, our European democratic system is absolutely founded in realising that it requires us to follow the rule of law, with all the conflicts, contradictions, complexities and compromises that sometimes involves.  That is what we are standing up here for today and what we need to do.  It may take time.  We have to answer what Nelson Mandela called for us to do - to be willing to stay the course in the face of other challenges that it will present, as we stop the use of those fossil fuels and provide our homes, schools, healthcare and other social services.  Staying the course will be difficult, but I expect this House and our people are up for that challenge, one of the greatest of our time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600011#J00700","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649237700,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Uachtar&aacute;n Zelenskyy as ucht a &oacute;r&aacute;id ar maidin.  I want to extend our deep appreciation and gratitude to President Zelenskyy for his address on this historic day.  I want to acknowledge the presence of the diplomatic corps, but in particular, our friend, Ambassador Gerasko, and her staff.  I want to pay them a particular commendation for their work in these very trying times.<\/p>  <p>  We have heard directly from President Zelenskyy, in the rawest, most harrowing and heartbreaking of terms, testimony of the vicious war crimes committed by the Russian military in Ukraine.  We have been set a challenge.  Innocent civilians have been executed with their arms tied behind their backs.  There have been horrific accounts of rape and torture and the brutalisation by the powerful of vulnerable ordinary citizens in their war-torn country.  These are crime against the Ukrainian people and these are crimes against humanity.  Russia must be held accountable for its barbarism, and justice must be done.  These human rights violations and grave breaches of the Geneva Convention demand investigation by the International Criminal Court and prosecutions to follow.  The truth is that Russia has turned its back on dialogue and peace.  For 42 days and nights, it has chosen war.  It has chosen brutality.  It has chosen the violation of international law.  Russia has closed the door on dialogue and through its criminal actions it has thus far rejected avenues for diplomacy.<\/p> <p>Far from demonstrating a willingness to engage in peace negotiations, Russia has escalated its ferocious violence through the indiscriminate targeting of civilians.<\/p> <p> All the while, however, the Russian Embassy in Ireland and Ambassador Yury Filatov have acted as unwavering and unapologetic propagandists for his country's illegal invasion of Ukraine.  Yesterday, in the face of evidence of Russian war crimes in Bucha and other areas surrounding Kyiv, the embassy and the ambassador claimed that this evidence was fabricated. They described it as another stage of the disinformation war against Russia.  This shameful response demonstrates the depths to which the Putin regime will stoop to justify the savagery of Russia's military aggression.  The Russian ambassador wants us to ignore the evidence before our very eyes.  Well, Mr. Filatov, we have heard the accounts of murders carried out by your soldiers reported by numerous credible sources.  We have seen the aerial photographs of human remains left scattered by the side of the road.  We have seen the cars carrying white flags, indicating civilian passengers, riddled with shrapnel.  The evidence of such atrocities condemns Russia before the world, and the world will not turn a blind eye.  It is long past time for Ambassador Filatov to be expelled from Ireland.  Ba cheart ambasad&oacute;ir na R&uacute;ise in &Eacute;irinn a chur abhaile anois.  Caithfear an Rialtas &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh gan mhoill.  Yesterday Lithuania became the first EU member state to expel its Russian ambassador.  It did so as an action to uphold human rights and justice.  I commend Lithuania on that and believe our country should follow suit.  That would be a most powerful action for us to take as a militarily neutral, non-aligned State as we too stand for human rights and justice.  I call on the Taoiseach and the Government to act now.<\/p> <p> Of course, we must do more.  The people of Ireland stand with Ukraine.  We strongly support Ukraine's stated desire to join the European Union.  We must respond to the humanitarian crisis by providing refuge to those fleeing for their lives.  As an elected member of the UN Security Council, we must use every available avenue to press for the de-escalation of conflict, for a ceasefire, for dialogue and for a Russian withdrawal and an end to this terrible war.<\/p> <p> Ireland supports economic sanctions against Russia.  We must intensify those sanctions.  We should not have to convince anybody of the need to hit the Russian elites and oligarchs in every possible way.  The revelations of these war crimes and atrocities demand such an intensification of sanctions.  I welcome the announcement by the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, of a new round of measures, including the ban on the import of Russian coal, the transaction ban on four Russian banks and the ban on Russian vessels from EU ports.  The impact of these sanctions creates a real economic challenge for Ireland and across the EU, but Russia and Vladimir Putin must feel the full weight and consequences of this invasion.  Russia should not doubt our resolve or our solidarity with the beleaguered people of Ukraine, a people who, as we speak, fight for their lives, fight for their freedom and fight for the survival of their nation.  They fight a war of liberation from tyranny and for the right to endure and to go on, and they will.  We know that a nation is a living, breathing thing.  Ukraine lives, Ukraine breathes and Ukraine will go on.<\/p> <p>Through its heroic struggle, its people have reaffirmed in all of us the values of sovereignty, justice and democracy and one day the invader will retreat, the coloniser will leave, and Russia's armies will go home.  The strength of the Ukrainian people and the support of her allies will see to that.  On that day, Ukraine, deeply scarred but unconquered and unbowed, will start to heal and the people of Ukraine will begin again.  Shattered cities, broken homes and displaced families and communities will come together once more and shape Ukraine's destiny.<br\/><br\/>In that spirit of hope and standing on the foundation stones of our shared humanity, Ukraine will emerge once more into a new dawn of peace and freedom.  Ireland stands with you now in your dark days and we will stand with you yet in the light of a victory of humanity over injustice, of light over dark, of life over death.  <i>Slava Ukraini.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600012#K00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649238300,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas.

The strength, courage and resilience of President Zelenskyy and of the Ukrainian people have been an inspiration, not just for us here in Ireland, but for people all over the world.<\/p>  <p>  If Putin had imperial ambitions when he invaded Ukraine, those ambitions lie in tatters.  Putin has not increased Russia's prestige or its power on the world stage.  His despotic leadership has sapped its influence, destroyed its economy and turned Russia into a pariah state.  It will remain a pariah state as long as Putin remains in power.<\/p>  <p>  Thursday, 24 February 2022, the day Russia launched its barbaric and illegal invasion of Ukraine, is the date that will live in infamy.  Since then, the Ukrainian people have faced a relentless barrage of bombs, bullets, missiles, mortars and rockets.  War crimes have been committed on a daily basis.  Maternity hospitals, schools, care homes and residential buildings have all been targeted.  They have tried to wipe whole cities, such as Mariupol, off the map.  The latest horrors revealed in Bucha, the torture and summary execution of hundreds of innocent civilians, are a gross affront to all of our collective humanity.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland stands united with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people against this callous barbarism and depravity.  Putin's lies and propaganda hold no sway here.  He and his regime must be held accountable.  An unprecedented array of co-ordinated international sanctions have been unleashed to crush Putin's regime, including his oligarch acolytes and to destroy his ability to fund his murderous war.  We must go further.  We must ensure that those sanctions are absolutely copper-fastened.<\/p>  <p>  The EU must now also wean itself off Russian oil and gas, Putin's last economic lifeline.  While Russia is starved of economic support, financial support from the international community must flow into Ukraine.  What Putin has destroyed, Ukraine's allies must help to rebuild.  Humanitarian relief and support for the unprecedented number of refugees fleeing the war must also be sustained, unwavering.<\/p>  <p>  This support from the Irish people was instantaneous and overwhelming.  They have welcomed thousands of Ukrainians into communities throughout Ireland and will continue to do so.

We must all join in condemning the barbaric invasion by Vladimir Putin's forces of Ukraine and we must demand accountability for the horrific crimes against humanity and war crimes of which he is undoubtedly guilty.  There can be no doubt that the horrific scenes we saw in Bucha and are seeing in Mariupol and elsewhere are war crimes and Vladimir Putin should be held accountable for them.<\/p>  <p>  The people of Ukraine are victims of a barbaric and unjustified imperialist invasion.  Russia should end this bloody invasion and allow the people of Ukraine to determine their own future.<\/p> <p>It is absolutely right that we extend refuge to those who are fleeing Putin's bloody war in Ukraine.

Putin is undoubtedly guilty of war crimes for his unjustified invasion of Ukraine, but so also is the United States, the UK and some of their allies for their unjustified wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which they have never been held accountable.  They are also guilty of supporting the Israeli state, which has been indicted recently for crimes against humanity for its treatment of the Palestinian people by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.  They are also guilty of supporting the Saudi dictatorship in its brutal war in Yemen, arming that regime and blocking attempts to investigate their crimes against humanity.  <\/p> <p> We have no credibility in condemning, as we must, the crimes against humanity in Ukraine if we do not simultaneously oppose, condemn and demand accountability for all crimes against humanity, whether they are in Ukraine, Georgia, Afghanistan, Palestine or Yemen.  We will not eliminate crimes against humanity, warmongering or imperialism by being selective in our opposition to it.

When we consider the atrocities that took place in Bucha only a few days ago, we shudder to think what would have occurred had Kyiv fallen to the Russians.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to single out two ambassadors in the Gallery, the Finnish and Swedish ambassadors, both also representing military neutral states, but who recognised from the get-go the extent of the treachery that was about to unfold and provided thousands of defensive, protective anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine to protect its cities and a civilian population.  <\/p>  <p>  I would also like to single out the French ambassador in the Gallery for President Macron&rsquo;s efforts to achieve a ceasefire and humanitarian access to Mariupol, which our present-day generation&rsquo;s Srebenica, whether we accept it or not.  It is not surprising that President Macron&rsquo;s overtures have been turned down and have been unsuccessful.<\/p>  <p>  Every single person in this Chamber wants peace and end to the conflict.  However, unfortunately, the Russians do not want a diplomatic solution at this time.  They want a military solution.  They only way we can bring this to the negotiation table &ndash; it is unpalatable &ndash; is to defeat the Russian army in Ukraine.  That is just the reality.  On that basis, I very much welcome the provision of military stores direct from Irish Defence Forces stores to the Ukrainian defence forces.  It is absolutely important.  <\/p>  <p>  Following on from President Zelenskyy&rsquo;s address, he is looking for more.  He is looking for more leadership.<\/p> <p>One hour's drive from here in the Curragh Camp, there are hundreds of anti-tank rockets nearing the end of their shelf life that could very easily be transferred to the Ukraine defence forces.  The reason that is so important is that we know the Russians are preparing a massive offensive in the east at the moment and that this offensive is likely to be successful but it does not have to be this way.  We have learned from the successful defence of Kyiv that the future is not written in stone.  It has yet to be decided and it will be determined not just by fate but by decisions and actions of the people in this Chamber over the next few days.

In that decision, the Government is ignoring the fact that every single euro counts for workers and families and that many households are literally down to the cents.  If the Government proceeds with this, it will push ahead in the full knowledge that low-income workers, older people and rural communities have been hit especially hard.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach did acknowledge yesterday that what he termed a \"wider initiative\" is required to tackle this unprecedented cost-of-living crisis, which has been driven by inflation levels not seen since the 1980s and exacerbated by Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine.  I am glad the Taoiseach has finally recognised the need for a comprehensive set of measures and an inclusive process to get the living costs down.  This comes after months of resisting Sinn F&eacute;in's calls for exactly such a package.  In February, we brought forward a broad suite of measures that would make a real difference and bring genuine relief and breathing space for households.  We urged the Government to adopt these measures, which are realistic and deliverable.  The Taoiseach refused to do that.  We proposed a mini-budget that would target those areas during this crisis.  Does the Taoiseach now accept the need for a mini-budget?  Has the Government moved from its position of waiting until October to act?  In other words, when will see this comprehensive set of measures?  Will these measures include targeted cost-of-living payments to lower and middle-income workers and families?  Will it include relief for renters?  Will it include relief for childcare costs?  We have proposed cutting these initially by one third.  That is necessary to give parents breathing space.  Above all, urgency is required on this matter because the fuel allowance is due to end on Friday.  It is crucial that this payment is extended, initially for six weeks at the least, and that eligibility for it is expanded.<\/p>  <p>  T&aacute; mion-bhuis&eacute;ad ag teast&aacute;il uainn chun dul i ngleic leis na r&eacute;ims&iacute; at&aacute; i gcro&iacute;l&aacute;r na g&eacute;arch&eacute;ime sa chostas maireacht&aacute;la.

Although the Taoiseach clearly attaches little importance to this increase, the backbenchers in his own party and, it seems, in Fine Gael, have a very different view on this matter.  I am asking the Taoiseach to seize the moment, to introduce measures that will cushion households and help give them some breathing space and, of course, to cancel the hike in carbon tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600020#T00300","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1649240400,"counter":56,"content":"<p>First, the Deputy did not actually call for anything of the sort that I proposed in the House yesterday in terms of the comprehensive approach I and the Government want to take to what is, without question, a very serious issue for the Irish economy and the European economy.  That is manifested in the main at the moment by inflation.  I said yesterday that we have had two, if not three, shocks to our economic model.  The first was Brexit.  We dealt with that, as a country, as best we could.  The second was the pandemic, which was a once-in-a-century event.  Thankfully, because of the economic measures the Government took to protect jobs, incomes and businesses and to keep them intact, we have bounced back very significantly as an economy, largely speaking, in emerging from Covid.  The Central Bank's report today confirms that.  Government initiatives in the teeth of a major crisis, that is, the pandemic, worked, notwithstanding that the ending of the emergency phase of the pandemic has created a huge inflationary cycle.  Add a terrible war, the war on Ukraine, and energy prices have exponentially grown and risen.  The sanctions the European Union, the United States, Canada and other democracies have imposed on the Russian Federation within themselves create economic impacts and shocks, some of which we are not clear on yet.  The only thing from now to the end of the year, as far as I can see, is uncertainty.  I would not understate the economic recovery in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I fully accept the enormous pressures inflation is putting on households.  We are very concerned about those on low incomes.  Hence, we increased the fuel allowance from &euro;630 when we came into government to &euro;1,039.  When the &euro;200 cut in electricity bills is added, that is &euro;1,239, up from the base of &euro;630 when we came into office.  Other aspects of the economy also illustrate the point I was making yesterday.  The Central Bank is saying inflation could go to 6.5%.  It has revised downwards growth forecasts.  It expects the jobs market to remain strong with an increase in employment of about 88,000 this year.<\/p> <p>The Department of Finance is preparing the spring forecasts.<\/p> <p> We had the highest employment growth in the European Union last year, with the number of people work soaring by nearly 230,000 to just above 2.5 million, marking a record high and already surpassing our target for 2024, which was contained in the economic recovery plan.  Employment has increased for all age groups and across all geographic regions.  GDP went up by about 13% but it is modified domestic demand that we are focused on and that grew by 6.5%, which is now 7% above the pre-pandemic level.  The unemployment rate is at 5.2%, which is close to full employment.  Those are the plus points but there is one huge negative, namely, inflation.  The challenge for us is not to undermine progress in other parts of the economy.  I am saying the best way to do that is work with the social partners, trade unions and employers on the pay policy dimension to this, which is important as there are tax, social welfare, income protection and climate change implications.  Then there is the issue of the costs for people on low incomes and for those who are going into work every day.  In the &euro;800 million package we put in place since the budget we have already reduced transport and medical costs.  That is an intelligent way to go about this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600020#T00400","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649241000,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I have asked the Taoiseach to set out what this comprehensive approach will amount to.

Costs for goods and services everywhere are rising rapidly and household budgets have been vaporised.  This particularly impacts on those with low to middle incomes and on those with fixed incomes.  I have listened to what the Taoiseach has said about this crisis carefully and he has repeatedly stated that the Government cannot bring in separate measures every week.  Nobody is asking the Government to do that.  We want to see a credible and meaningful response that would provide real relief to those who are struggling, those who are worried and those who are already in trouble.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a lot of political debate about the carbon tax in recent weeks, much of it ignoring the taxation elephant in the room, which is VAT.  The Taoiseach has said that next month, the carbon tax increase will mean an average increase in household bills of &euro;1.40 per month.  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that VAT is considerably more and it is ever-increasing given the enormous prices rises in energy, which provides an unprecedented windfall to the Government.  Last year alone, for example, the Government took in &euro;3 billion more in VAT than it did in 2020.  A large chunk of that was from energy costs.  Up until February of this year the Taoiseach was telling the House that the VAT derogation was impossible because of EU rules.  On 9 March, when a cut in excise duty was announced, we were told the Government was working with EU colleagues to see whether we could introduce greater relief or flexibility in that area.  Last week the Taoiseach told us that a VAT derogation had been sought.  It also was reported last week that the Taoiseach told his parliamentary party that we can expect some hard proposals on energy from the EU by the end of April.<\/p>  <p>  Maybe the Taoiseach can provide some details to the House on that.  When exactly did the Government apply for that VAT derogation?  Was it separate or was it combined with other member states?  Did the Taoiseach personally make that application to the European Council on 24 and 25 March?  Has the Government applied for a specific derogation on VAT, reducing it to levels of 9% or 5%, for example?  When will we get an indication of when that application will be successful?  The Taoiseach said the application was made yesterday.  The Taoiseach said the Government is considering offsetting the carbon tax increase.  Is that impacted by VAT or the public service obligation, PSO, level?  Can the Taoiseach give us some sort of an indication and a timeline for that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600021#U02300","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1649241000,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising those points.  Members are looking for initiatives every week and I understand that.  We have to stand back, however, and take a more considered view on how we respond to this fairly unique crisis, which has been caused by the combination of a pandemic, emerging from that pandemic and the imbalance of supply and demand which that created and a terrible war, the likes of which we have not seen since the Second World War that is happening on the Continent of Europe and that is creating huge issues for all of us.  We have to look at this in the medium term, rather than just from week to week.  I believe the Deputy accepts that and I appreciate the point she has made on that.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the European Union and European Commission approach to the energy market.  There have been considerable discussions in recent months at European Council level on the market, on how it is designed and on whether that market can be adjusted or changed to reduce the cost of energy.  Different member states have different perspectives on that and we have consistently put forward the view that we need more flexibility on the legislation and the directives, including the energy tax and the VAT directives.  We already enjoy a historic derogation on the VAT rate on fuels of 13.5%.  We have told the Commission, including prior to the last meeting and prior to Versailles, that there should be flexibilities in the current situation that would not endanger the historic derogation we have.  If we had simply reduced energy prices below that 13.5% rate, there was no guarantee under the existing laws that we could stay at 13.5% when the crisis was over but rather, we would have to go to 23%.  That was something we were anxious to avoid.<\/p> <p>We put forward an amendment to the conclusions of the last meeting, which was accepted, to try to head off that situation.  It still has to involve discussions with the Commission.  We want to be absolutely clear and certain.  This is to allow us flexibility.  We have different options and know what we can and cannot do.  With the laws as they were, we were not in a position to do it all along, which we made clear to the House.  We reduced excise duties significantly, by between 15% and 20%.  The Central Bank spokesperson said that had an impact on reducing the costs on people from what they would otherwise have been.<\/p> <p> The other side of the argument is that the Commission itself acknowledges that the market needs to be revisited with regard to the domination of gas in dictating the price of all energy in the European Union market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600021#U02400","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649241600,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600022#V00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1649241600,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Hopefully, by the end of April, there will be a further return to this, with a fuller reform of the market by the end of May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600022#V00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1649241600,"counter":84,"content":"<p>For many people, there is a personal crisis and a family crisis.

As the Taoiseach knows, the Irish people have never been shy when it comes to supporting those most in need.  When the call for support came, Irish people answered in their thousands.  In many cases, they even travelled to airports to collect Ukrainian refugees who fled.  Over the past weeks, I have had many calls and visits from the families who took in Ukrainian refugees to outline the difficulties that they face.  It is important to put on record that those people have not for one minute regretted their decision to take in Ukrainian refugees, and if they had to do it again, they would not hesitate.<\/p>  <p>  The issue people are having is that they feel isolated, with no support.  They have very little, if any, contact from the relevant Departments.  They feel they have nowhere to go for support and advice.  They have no regrets about opening their homes to Ukrainian refugees but they are finding it difficult and financially challenging.  They have increased energy and food bills and, on top of this, there are massive hikes in energy prices.  When they look for assistance from the Departments, they feel they are being ignored.  The commercial hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation are being paid to house Ukrainian refugees.  The people who opened their homes to the same refugees are not getting any support.<\/p>  <p>  This is wrong and must be addressed.  It is wrong that these people are left isolated without any support or assistance.  They were good enough to open their homes at a time of great need but now they feel ignored.  They seek support from various Departments and get no response.  This morning, President Zelenskyy outlined the support that Ukrainians need right now.  We all need to continue to support the Ukrainian people in a time of great need.  We also need to support the Irish people who have been good enough to open their homes.  In many instances, they and their families have made considerable sacrifices.  It is simply not fair that these people receive absolutely no support while hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation receive full support for taking in refugees.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach to assist with this issue and get proper support to the many thousands of Irish people and families who have opened their homes to Ukrainian refugees.  This morning, the Taoiseach told the Ukrainian president, \"our home is your home.\"  Thousands of Irish people have opened their homes to Ukrainian refugees.  I believe this is the right place for them to be.  It is a family atmosphere.  Irish people have always put their shoulders to the wheel when needed.  Irish people are not complaining and would do this again and again but they are getting no support.  They get bills, including electricity bills, pick up Ukrainian children to bring them to school every day, and are looking for nothing.  Everything is increasing.

We have never had to respond so quickly to such a refugee crisis before.  I pay a warm tribute to the public servants, as Deputy Michael Healy-Rae did earlier today, who have done exceptional work, working late into the evenings, to secure accommodation for refugees.  There are nearly 2,500 children attending our schools so far.  I thank the education community.

That has been our immediate focus.<\/p>  <p>  We are establishing community response forums in each local authority to co-ordinate local responses to the Ukraine crisis.  That forum will bring together all of the community and voluntary organisations which are active locally, as well as the mayor or cathaoirleach of each local authority.  These local forums are best placed to put arrangements in place to help the new arrivals from Ukraine to access services.  We believe these forums are an important part of what the Deputy has articulated with regard to providing supports on the ground for families, to enable them to integrate in our society more effectively.  We are asking local authorities to take a leadership role in those community forums to enable people to come together to provide additional supports and services at that local level.  We are witnessing this all over the country.  Communities are responding in that way and we appreciate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600022#V01100","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1649242200,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I said it before that we cannot put a price on a family atmosphere.

The Taoiseach said to President Zelenksyy this morning that, &ldquo;Our home is your home&rdquo;.  These families are saying, &ldquo;Our homes are the refugees&rsquo; homes&rdquo;.  They thought this war would last maybe four or five weeks.  Now all of a sudden it might go on for two more weeks or six more weeks.  The families do not know.

The Taoiseach knows it was the last straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back.  This is the price that the country and the people of Ireland, young and old, have to pay so that the Taoiseach will have the continued support of the Green Party to remain Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has already torn down Bord na M&oacute;na.  Every day since then, the cost of electricity has gone up.  The Taoiseach promised the people of north Kerry when he was canvassing there that he would support Shannon LNG, but now he is against it.  Surely, the Taoiseach knows what is happening around the world.  China is building massive electricity-generating stations.  Russia is mining coal and oil.  The USA is still using massive passenger eight-cylinder vehicles, such as Cadillacs, Lincoln Continental, Chevrolet, massive 5.7 l and 7.8 l eight-cylinder engines.  Petrol is $3.80 a gallon there.  Here, most people are driving 1.6 l and 2 l cars.  Deputy Eamon Ryan is saying that we are still wrong.  He wants to price us off the road.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will break the country with it targets.  Russia, China, India and Africa will keep doing what they are doing.  They will do more harm to the environment in one year than Ireland would do in 1,000 years.  The Government will close the country down.  It will finish up exporting our youth, as happened in the 1950s and early 1960s.  The true influence that the war is having on our energy costs has not been felt yet.  Hauliers and construction are in serious trouble.  Roadbridge has seen the loss of 1,000 jobs.  It will have a ripple effect and many others are on the brink.  Already ten construction companies have gone down in the UK.  We will follow.  If every light was turned off and we all left this country, it would only make 0.13% in the worldwide context.  We are all under the one sky.  The one sun and the one moon is over us all.  The Government can cripple our people, cause the loss of thousands of jobs and can break the people, paralyse our farmers and curtail their ability to continue producing food.  Nobody has calculated the cost of importing food from places like Brazil or what emissions this will create.

We need balance and perspective in the debate.  I fully accept that the cost-of-living increases are having a significant impact on people.  These are caused by a war and caused by a pandemic.  Without question, the pandemic and the war have caused extraordinary increase in energy prices globally.  This is happening now all over the world, not because of the carbon tax or anything else like that, but because of the impact on the energy market, because of restrictions on fuel and because of the enormous uncertainty that has created.  As a result, the Government did take measures to help hauliers.  There were measures taken in tillage to assist farmers, as well as on the broader issue of reducing the excise duty etc. on the cost of fuel between 15 and 20 cent.  These are very significant measures costing about &euro;900 million, when including the medical cost reductions, the transport cost reductions, to &euro;200 electricity cut etc.  That is on the top of a budget of &euro;1 billion that was given last October in tax for this year.

This was the third meeting of EU leaders within a month and since Russia's brutal and illegal invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February.  Prior to my attendance at the most recent meeting, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, updated the House on my participation at the other meetings - a special meeting of the European Council on 24 February and an informal meeting of the European Council in Versailles on 10 and 11 March.<\/p><p>The European Council of the 24 and 25 March had a full agenda addressing the most pressing issues facing the Union and our neighbourhood.  While our meeting took place in advance of the evidence emerging in recent days of large-scale horrific crimes against civilians, EU leaders have condemned the war since the start as immoral and unjustifiable, and we did so again on 24 March.<\/p><p>We discussed the impact of Russia's aggression from a range of perspectives: humanitarian, migration, energy, nuclear security and safety, and reconstruction.  We agreed to establish a Ukraine solidarity trust fund.  We discussed security and defence and endorsed the strategic compass.  This is a strategy document that will provide enhanced political direction for the Union's approach to security and defence policy for the next five to ten years.  We discussed energy, including energy prices, storage, energy security and phasing out dependence on Russian coal, gas and oil.<\/p><p>We agreed conclusions on economic issues, including building a more robust and open economic base, realising the full potential of the Single Market, and food security.  We also took stock of developments with Covid-19, including EU co-ordination efforts and global health solidarity and governance, and we discussed the EU's external relations, including the European Union-China Summit, which subsequently took place on 1 April, and the political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.We also re-elected Mr. Charles Michel as President of the European Council for a second term ending in November 2024.<\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, will address economic issues and external relations in his wrap-up.  I will address all other items.<\/p><p>At the start of our meeting, we heard from the President of the European Parliament, Ms Roberta Metsola.  She is of the view, with which I agree, that informed hope and belief will help to sustain the people of Ukraine.  For this, they need to know that the European Union and the international community are supporting them.President Metsola has since travelled to Kyiv to convey in person a powerful message of solidarity on behalf of the European Parliament to the members of the Ukrainian Parliament.<\/p><p>We also had an exchange of views with the President of the United States, Mr. Joe Biden, which underlined the strength and importance of the transatlantic relationship in the struggle between democracy and autocracy.  Our co-operation on issues such as sanctions has already proven to be impactful.<\/p> <p>We will continue to work together on a range of other areas from cybersecurity to energy.<br\/><br\/>President Zelenskyy also joined us via video link.  As he did in this House this morning, he called for strengthened EU sanctions, accountability for the perpetrators of unspeakable crimes in Ukraine and an accelerated process to allow Ukraine to join the EU.  He has my full support.  In the discussion that followed, leaders condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine, which are a gross violation of international law causing appalling loss of life and injury to civilians and destroying the vital infrastructure of a peaceful country.  President Putin's regime and its supporters should be in no doubt that justice will rise up and those responsible will be held accountable for their crimes.  Leaders also reaffirmed the Versailles declaration, acknowledging the European aspirations and European choice of Ukraine.  Just as Ireland has over time made its own informed choices about who we are, our priorities and with whom we align ourselves, so too should Ukraine be able to make its choices.<br\/><br\/>The EU will continue to provide co-ordinated political, financial, material and humanitarian support.  We call on the European Commission to continue to provide technical assistance to Ukraine to undertake the steps necessary to facilitate its path to EU candidate status.  Looking to the future, we agreed to develop a Ukraine solidarity trust fund to support the costs of the government of Ukraine, which is continuing to work on behalf of its people despite the immense challenges it faces, and to help support the reconstruction of the country when the time comes.  Leaders called on all countries to align with existing sanctions, which are having a massive impact on Russia and Belarus.  Ireland stands ready to adopt further robust sanctions with our EU partners and ensure that any attempts to circumvent sanctions or to aid Russia by other means are stamped out.<br\/><br\/>We also discussed the impact of the conflict on displaced people, refugees and hosting states, especially those on Ukraine's borders.  We recognise the need for collective efforts to support and provide for refugees.  Irish people moved quickly to provide protection to Ukrainians driven from their homes.  It will not be without cost and challenge but it is the right thing to do.  Recognising the pressures across the EU, we call for work to be completed on European Commission proposals to support member states in this regard.<br\/><br\/>I will speak further on the question of energy shortly, but in the context of Ukraine we underlined our commitment to ensuring continuous and uninterrupted electricity and gas flows to the country.  The recent synchronisation of Ukrainian and Moldovan electricity grids with the EU's grids is a remarkable achievement and shows that our futures are now interconnected.  It is also enormously important that the safety of Ukrainian nuclear facilities is ensured, including through the support of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  This will also remain a focus.<br\/><br\/>We endorsed the strategic compass.  This is a strategy document that will provide enhanced political direction for the EU's approach to security and defence policy for the next five to ten years.  Ireland has always engaged constructively in the development of the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, guided by our traditional policy of military neutrality and our contribution to crisis management and peacekeeping.  That continues to be the case.  We have played an active role in shaping the strategic compass, working to ensure it reflects the core values that underpin our approach to CSDP, including our commitment to the United Nations and the rules-based international order.  The text sets out the significant security and defence challenges faced by the EU, including existing and emerging threats, the increasingly contested multipolar world and the strategic implications for the EU.  It provides a strategic perspective for the next decade and sets out the tools and initiatives required to enable the EU to act more quickly and decisively when facing crises, to become better equipped to anticipate and mitigate threats, to stimulate investment and innovation to develop our capabilities and technologies, and to deepen cooperation with partners, including the UN, which remains the essential core of international peace and security.<br\/><br\/>While work began on the strategic compass some months back, the text also reflects the immediate security situation following Russia's unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine.  Different member states have different traditions and approaches in the area of security and defence.  This is fully understood and respected by all partners.  For Ireland, we are clear that our active participation in CSDP does not prejudice the specific character of our security and defence policy or our obligations.<br\/><br\/>We held an important discussion on energy issues and reaffirmed the agreement reached in Versailles last month to phase out Europe's dependence on Russian gas, oil and coal imports as soon as possible.  This can be achieved by reducing our overall reliance on fossil fuels faster, diversifying supplies and routes, developing an EU hydrogen market, accelerating the development of renewables, and improving the interconnection of European electricity and gas networks.We will also work to reinforce EU contingency planning for security of supply, and enhance energy efficiency and management of energy consumption.<br\/><br\/>On energy security, work will continue to complete and improve gas and electricity interconnections in Europe.  I welcome the agreement whereby member states can opt in to collective purchase arrangements for gas, liquid natural gas, LNG, and hydrogen to secure better prices.  The European Commission will work to pool demand by drawing on the collective strength of the EU, which is a model that worked for the purchase of Covid-19 vaccines.  Ahead of next winter, member states will work with the Commission to ensure that gas storage facilities are replenished, helping to mitigate against supply disruption.  In his presentation to us at the start of our meeting, President Biden committed to helping Europe with additional LNG supplies.  This will see the United States work to ensure the provision of an additional 15 billion cu. m to the EU this year.  This energy partnership with the US will help phase out EU fuel dependence on Russia and will also work to support energy-efficiency solutions and the rapid deployment of clean energy technologies.<br\/><br\/>I am acutely aware of the negative impact high prices are having on households and businesses, especially our vulnerable citizens and SMEs.  We looked at various options to cushion the impact.  A number of measures aimed at curbing rising energy prices were discussed, drawing on options presented by the Commission.  To provide relief to consumers, member states were encouraged to continue to make the best use of the toolbox of measures identified by the Commission, including the application of the state aid temporary crisis framework as a time-limited departure from the <i>status quo<\/i>, temporary taxation of windfall profits and various direct supports to consumers.<br\/><br\/>We asked the Commission and member states to urgently assess further short-term options that could help to reduce gas and electricity prices.  We discussed how to take work forward on monitoring and optimising the functioning of the electricity market.  The findings of the final reports from the EU's Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators and the European Securities and Markets Authority will feed into these deliberations in the coming weeks.  The Commission will come forward with a REPowerEU plan in May.  It is important that any proposals to address the problem of excessive electricity prices do not have unintended consequences for the integrity of the Single Market, that they maintain incentives for the green transition and, above all, preserve security of supply.  Leaders will keep this important matter under regular review.<br\/><br\/>Covid-19 has been a standing item on the agenda of the European Council and we again took stock of the epidemiological situation across Europe.  Our focus was on co-ordinating efforts in response to the pandemic, as well as the strengthening of pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.  We also welcomed the progress made recently in the World Trade Organization, WTO, concerning the issue of intellectual property rights.  While Omicron remains the dominant variant and is highly transmissible, thankfully, it has not caused the same degree of threat as previous variants.  Many member states have taken the opportunity to ease restrictions and shorten the isolation and quarantine periods for close contacts.  Collectively, it is important to maintain an appropriate level of vigilance against Covid-19, which continues to circulate in our communities.<\/p> <p>We also re-elected the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, for a second term ending in November 2024.  I congratulated him on his re-election and look forward to continued positive collaboration with him, including at future meetings of the European Council. <\/p> <p> We find ourselves at a historic inflection point.  European Union leaders are working together in an unprecedented way to leverage our collective economic, strategic and political power and influence to stop Russia's war in Ukraine.  We want to see a just end to this war and will continue to apply targeted and increased pressure to bring that about, in partnership with like-minded global partners.  Ukraine deserves no less.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan will address economic issues and external relations in his wrap-up remarks.  <\/p> <p> Leaders agreed to hold a special meeting of the European Council to follow up on the issues discussed.  This will take place in advance of the scheduled meeting the European Council in June.  I will continue to report to the House on these discussions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600027#AA04600","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649245800,"counter":263,"content":"<p>The recent meeting of the European Council provided leaders with a prime opportunity to address the cost of living crisis and in particular the skyrocketing energy bills that have hammered workers and families for more than a year now.  For more than five months, Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling on the Government to engage with the European Commission to cut VAT on these extortionate bills.  Unfortunately this is something that the Taoiseach and the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform have pushed back against.  All the while, the price of energy has soared and households found it increasingly difficult to light and heat their homes or to put fuel in the car to get to work.<\/p>  <p>  Given the intense pressure people are under, and given that a VAT break is a common-sense solution, it is astonishing that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, wrote to the European Commission only three weeks ago, on 10 March, months after the idea was first raised with the Government in the D&aacute;il.  The constant refrain from the Taoiseach and from the Minister was that barriers presented by Europe prevented the Government from implementing a VAT cut.  Time and again, Government representatives said they were awaiting movement from the EU and the Commission for further cost-of-living measures.  This Council meeting surely provided the Taoiseach and the Government with the platform to make it clear to our European partners that workers and families in Ireland desperately need a VAT cut on energy bills.  Therefore, I am very disappointed that the Taoiseach did not elaborate on this specific point in his contribution.  He stated, \"A number of measures aimed at curbing rising energy prices were discussed, drawing on options presented by the European Commission.\"  I, for one, would have appreciated clarity on the VAT issue because movement on that will make a big difference for many families who do not have a spare euro to give and who saw the Government's &euro;200 credit wiped out before it was delivered.  I assume, given the intensity of the crisis faced by workers and families, that the Taoiseach has taken the opportunity to request a special derogation on fuels and energy; on electricity, gas and home heating oil.  Indeed, the statement outlining the conclusions from the European Council meeting makes clear that there is flexibility from the Commission for member states to seek a reduction on VAT on energy bills for consumers.  The Government now explicitly has the space it said it required from Europe to implement a VAT cut.  The urgency required must be demonstrated to do what needs to be done to give hard-pressed households the break they so desperately need. <\/p>  <p>  I ask that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, tell us whether the Government has, in fact, formally requested a special derogation on the VAT directives.  We are in a real crisis and people need to get real help and support from the Government.  There can be no doubt about it.  Across the State, people are faced with the choice of heating or eating.  I have said this many times in this Chamber but I want to give one example, as it is of value to place it on the record.  My colleague, Deputy Kerrane, conducted a cost-of-living study recently.  The stories we were told are utterly heartbreaking.  I will give one.  One person responded that they and their partner are both students in their final year of college.  So these are young people.  They said that there are days we have had to miss college and their daughter has missed preschool because they could not afford petrol to drive there.  Other days they have had to lie that we forgot our daughter&rsquo;s lunch because they had no lunch box options left in the fridge.  That is the reality of it.  I am sure that everyone recognises those types of stories.  There can be no more excuses and there cannot be further delay.  The Government cannot hide behind an alibi of complexity although, of course, these matters are complex.  I have told the Taoiseach many times that the Government cannot do everything, and there is no expectation that it can do everything to get living costs down, but it can certainly do much more and it must do so.  That includes cutting VAT on energy bills as an emergency measure.  This must be done as soon as possible.  It will make a real and substantial difference for those struggling to make ends meet and who simply need breathing space.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600029#CC00200","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1649245800,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I will continue with some of the questions I brought up previously.  Maybe there will be an opportunity, when the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, takes questions later, that we might get some answers.  President Zelenskyy stated clearly what Ukraine is facing, including Russian war crimes.  We have all seen the images out of Bucha.  We welcomed Anastasiia, the little girl who was in the Chamber, and heard how her father is at this time fighting for his homeland.  That is what the Ukrainians are dealing with.  We have to do whatever we can that has an impact on the ability of Russia and the Putin regime to fight this war.  We need answers on due diligence being done on section 110 and the money that has sloshed through the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, but also in respect of the list the ambassador, Ms Larysa Gerasko, had given to the Department of Foreign Affairs of companies that were still trading with Russia.  I understand there has been movement in this regard but we need to ensure that as much as possible is done to remove Russia's ability to fight this war.  It would be good manners to get an answer back to the ambassador and her team.  We all understand the difficulty that arises with the embeddedness and connectivity of business but we need to do due diligence and get to where we need to be on that.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach spoke a lot about energy security.  We all understand the situation that we are dealing with.  When we talk about sanctions and Russia, that means fuel.  We need to see movement at a European Union level on block-buys.  It is vital that the Minister of State would give the House updates on all the interactions there have been on seeking the derogation on the VAT rate that would allow us a tool to reduce the pain people are suffering here at present.  During the pandemic we made many decisions on the basis of keeping the ship afloat, keeping families safe, keeping businesses afloat and ensuring that we had an economy afterwards.  We need to ensure that again in these circumstances and at this time.  The block-buys are huge.  We know that in the long term we need to escalate everything we are doing to move towards renewable energy.  We know we can be a wind energy hub or superpower.  That is where it needs to go but in the short term, we need to ensure that people have fuel and energy and that they have electricity that is affordable and that we do not push them into further poverty.  That is a given.  We need whatever plans can be put in place from the European Union and here as soon as possible.  May will just not come quickly enough for that. <\/p>  <p>  Can we get details on any conversations that have taken place on China and its current relationship with Russia?  <\/p> <p>We would like to see the Chinese not supporting what is a disgraceful war in Ukraine.  I am sure they realise it does not suit them in the long term.<\/p> <p> I welcome the fact there have been conversations around Bosnia.  I, among others, have met the Bosnian ambassador and he spoke of some of the hybrid threats we have been dealing with from Russia, its power plays, how this has impacted and the obvious difficulty with Republika Srpska.  I would like an update on that.<\/p> <p> We support providing a roadmap to the likes of Ukraine for accession to the EU.  Moldova is doing a huge amount of heavy lifting with the current humanitarian difficulties.  Deputy Brady is there with a delegation from the EU affairs committee to look at what is happening from a human point of view and what can be done to make that roadmap clear.<\/p> <p> We are talking security and defence so it is straight to say any moves, or even making moves that look like we are moving the EU towards a military alliance, could create difficulties if, as we hope, Vladimir Putin gets to a place where he needs a way out.  We do not need that to be part of the negotiating gambit.<\/p> <p> We still have a huge body of work to do on the humanitarian aspect, especially where housing is concerned.  There is going to be need for imagination.  There is going to be free flow of credit.  We will have to make up for the mistakes we have not dealt with in relation to addressing the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600029#CC00300","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649246400,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600030#DD00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1649246400,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I will finish on the point that Irish unity is coming.

The European Council met on 24 and 25 March.  Unfortunately, it did not deliver the additional sanctions against Russia, supports for the Ukrainian people or the much-needed derogation on VAT we require to allow us reduce the costs of energy for struggling households.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party is in strong support of Ukraine joining the EU and we as a union need to speak as one voice to expedite that.  We have consistently called for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador.  The crimes against humanity uncovered in Bucha are just some of the atrocities the Russian Army has carried out across the territory of Ukraine.  Mariupol, Sumy, Chernihiv and hundreds of other cities, towns and villages have borne witness to Russian barbarity.  Let us not forget Russian forces never expected to have their crimes in Bucha uncovered.  They expected that territory to stay conquered.  We must respond to the horrors perpetrated by Russian soldiers.  Ireland has expelled four Russian diplomats but that still leaves 27 officials here, at least ten of whom are accredited diplomats under the Vienna Convention.  They must go and it is no longer acceptable.  There is no legitimate reason for that number of Russian diplomats to be based here.<\/p>  <p>  The Ukrainian people have fought valiantly and defeated the Russian army in the Kyiv region but they face new challenges in the south and east.  There will now be a fifth package of EU sanctions with bans on Russian coal, on ships accessing EU ports, blocks on road transport operators, bans on the export of advanced semiconductors and machinery and a ban on Russian companies tendering for contracts across the EU.  However, it simply does not go far enough.  The Taoiseach said earlier Ireland wants the strongest possible sanctions against Russia.  We must continue to increase the economic pressure on the Russian Federation.  The Labour Party is calling for an embargo on Russian oil and gas.  EU countries have paid &euro;35 billion to Russia in energy payments since the start of the year.  That is funding Putin's war effort and it must cease.  President Zelenskyy wants us to do this.  The remaining Russian banks and financial institutions must be cut off from SWIFT and financial sanctions must be rigourously enforced.  That means resourcing teams to track down those trying to circumvent and avoid them.  Secondary sanctions must also be implemented to ensure current measures cannot be circumvented and other measures considered to target commercial activity that takes place outside the EU and US.  The Labour Party calls once more on the Government to expedite our Magnitsky Bill to crack down on human rights abusers.  We must also bring transparency to the IFSC and name those who are the beneficial owners of section 110 special purpose vehicles that are subject to sanctions.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland can and must keep the door open to Ukrainian refugees and do all we can to support those who reach our shores.  However, we must massively increase our humanitarian support to those remaining in Ukraine with food, medical supplies and cash.  We have contributed to the EU &euro;500 million defence package with non-lethal aid and provided &euro;20 million of humanitarian aid but multiples of that will be required.  We must be ready to rebuild Ukraine when peace eventually comes.  Now is the time to start looking at how we finance that and requisition those Russian assets that have been frozen around the world and deploy them to build a new Ukraine following the wanton destruction caused by Putin's army.  Methods to reduce and cancel Ukrainian debt must also be part of that future.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, since last November the Labour Party has advocated a reduction in the VAT rate on electricity and gas supplies, which is currently 13.5%.  In January we tabled a motion in the House explicitly calling on the Government to seek a derogation from the EU that would allow us to reduce this VAT rate and restore it back to that pre-crisis level.  We again call on the Government to secure that derogation to help tackle the cost of living crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600030#DD00800","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1649246400,"counter":273,"content":"<p>The special European Council meeting held on 24 February and the informal meeting held in Versailles on 10 and 11 March, as well as the scheduled Council meeting that took place on 24 and 25 March were all dominated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and rightly so.  The situation in Ukraine is becoming more horrific by the day.  What has been revealed in the town of Bucha and around Kyiv following the retreat of the Russian forces is appalling.  Innocent victims have been targeted.  Sexual violence, torture and summary executions have been carried out by Russian troops.  No doubt this was done with President Putin's knowledge.  President Zelenskyy has described these events as genocide.<\/p>  <p>  Our solidarity with Ukraine and the solidarity of EU member states must remain firm.  Ireland has not been found wanting in our response to this war.  We have consistently supported comprehensive sanctions on Russia, including the fifth round announced yesterday, which involves a ban on Russian coal imports and on Russian ships entering EU ports, among other things.  I understand a ban on Russian oil is also being worked on and I hope this can be agreed on at the earliest opportunity.  We got behind the measures proposed under the European peace facility.  We fully responded to the enormous humanitarian crisis now unfolding.  We wholeheartedly backed Ukraine's application for EU membership and I hope the European Commission's opinion in this regard will be available quickly and that it will be a positive one.  President Zelenksyy, in his address to both Houses this morning, thanked Ireland for our financial and humanitarian support and also asked us, through our Taoiseach, to bring pressure to bear on the European Council and indeed the Commission to go further with the sanctions.  In his response the Taoiseach said he would do that, which I welcome.  We must do everything possible to bring this war to an end, stop the slaughter of innocent civilians and have a ceasefire put in place as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  President Biden has stated the Russian invasion of Ukraine has brought the world to a tipping point of fundamental change with a battle for supremacy between democracy and autocracy.<\/p> <p>That is certainly an interesting analysis.  In this context, I want to draw attention to the meeting in recent days between the Presidents of the European Commission and the European Council with the Chinese President and Prime Minister.  The response of China to the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been ambiguous.  The EU must insist that China does not try to assist Russia in evading sanctions or to supply Russia with weaponry.  China should be proactive in trying to bring about an end to the conflict and encourage a Russian withdrawal from Ukraine.  We have lots of reasons to be critical of China but it would be doing the world a great favour if it embarked on this diplomatic course of action.<\/p> <p> Questions have also been asked about India's position on the war in Ukraine and the Taoiseach has also raised this issue.  India has not agreed to sanctions or condemned the Russian invasion.  Recently Russia's foreign minister, Mr. Serge\u012d Lavrov, has actually praised the neutral stance taken by Prime Minister Modi with regard to the war.  This is disappointing and must surely have consequences, as countries take sides in the aforementioned democracy vs autocracy conflict.  <\/p> <p> As we know, there have been many calls to expel the Russian ambassador to Ireland, Mr. Yury Filatov, and in effect, to break off diplomatic relations with Russian, given the blatant lies he has told us on national television and elsewhere.  At the very least, that man needs to do a course in Carr Communications or maybe our former colleague, Mr. Ivan Yates could assist him when he is doing television appearances.  I am aware of the advice given by the Government on this matter, having regard to the provisions of the 1961 Vienna Convention.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has said that any move to expel the ambassador as well as staff and so-called operatives would result in reciprocal action being taken by the Russian authorities in respect of our embassy in Moscow.  This could jeopardise our strategic interests, including the need to obtain on the ground, first-hand information and also the prospect of assisting Irish citizens in need in the region.  He has also said that any action in this regard will be taken in co-ordination with our EU partners.  Of course, he was dead right to block the planning application by the embassy to greatly expand its buildings on the Russian embassy site.  As we know, four Russian diplomats based in the Russian embassy in Ireland have been expelled.  Other EU member states have taken similar action.  In diplomatic speak, the expelled Russian diplomats in Ireland were engaged in activities that were \"not in accordance with international standards of diplomatic behaviour\".  There is no doubt in my mind that these so-called diplomats were military spies engaged in the collection of intelligence and espionage and sources close to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have said as much.  The suggestion is that the four were part of the Russian military agency known as the GRU.  There are still many more Russian diplomats based in Orwell Road and the option of expelling the ambassador or more staff and operatives must be kept under active consideration.  <\/p> <p> The European Commission agreed to phase out our dependency on Russian oil, gas and coal by 2027.  At the moment 40% of Europe's gas and 25% of Europe's oil comes from Russia.  Arising from this, there have been huge increases in the price of fuel generally.  It seems that there was agreement in principle at the European Council meeting to reduce VAT on fuel to 9%.  Further engagement with the Commission in this regard is underway.  As we know, the current rate is 13.5% in Ireland as a result of a derogation we obtained previously.  If nothing changes and we implemented a temporary cut in VAT, the rate would revert to the standard rate of 23% afterwards.  I hope that we can hear back from the European Commission on this matter in the near future.<\/p> <p> I am pleased that the strategic compass has also been agreed by the European Council.  Our traditional policy of military neutrality has been the cornerstone of our foreign policy and there should be no question of us joining a military alliance.  That said, we should continue to play an active part in the development of the EU's common security and defence policy, having regard to the new challenges confronting Europe at this time.  The demands for crisis management and peacekeeping should remain our guiding principle as regards the common security and defence policy and the associated strategic compass.<\/p> <p> Finally, I would like to comment on the Conference on the Future of Europe.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the issues arising from that have given the conference an added impetus.  It is hoped that the conference will conclude its business by 9 May next.  This is an ambitious target.  Concerns have been expressed about the methodology to be utilised to finalise the report.  I hope that the voices of citizens will not be drowned out as this process concludes and that real and lasting improvements to the future workings of the EU and its institutions will be the outcome of this extensive consultation and deliberation by so many people.  <\/p> <p> The 50th anniversary of Ireland's referendum on joining the EU falls on 10 May next.  The Government will be putting in place an EU 50 programme.  I look forward to that celebration of our membership of the EU and the democratic values that it represents<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600030#DD00900","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649247000,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Usually the Taoiseach or the Minister of State with responsibility for Europe would be present for these debates.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy O' Donovan, to kindly ensure that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue and, more importantly, his departmental officials are provided with a transcript of what I am about to say because it has major implications for our fishing industry.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State knows that our industry is in the worst state that it has ever been in, following a number of blows, the first of which was Brexit and the EU, UK trade agreement.  This resulted in another huge reduction in quota for Irish fishermen.  It is a mortal sin that we have 12% of the waters of all of the European Union but only around 4% of the fish.  We actually get about 15% of the fish in our own waters.  That is why we are now in a situation where the Government is asking the industry to decommission another 60 vessels.  If we compare the situation 15 years ago to today, we will have only one third of the fleet that was over 18 m.  This is coupled with the pandemic, the impact on the markets for our industry and the latest disastrous blow which is the huge increase in fuel costs.  Incredibly, there has been no real substantive intervention by the Minister to deal with this.<\/p>  <p>  Why do I raise all of this now?  I raise it because many of the problems we have are due to the fact that access to our fisheries is governed by the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP and Europe is the place to make that fight and get our fair share.  What we are doing in this country is punishing fishermen more and more.  As we speak, a Norwegian vessel has been forced to land in Derry rather than Killybegs because of a decision of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA regarding the blue whiting on that vessel and on another vessel from Denmark.  The whiting is for human consumption and is destined for places like west Africa.  It is a really important and affordable source of protein for communities in West Africa.  It was supposed to go through a fish producer and processor in Killybegs but the SFPA said that the water had to be separated from the fish.  That essentially turns the blue whiting into fish meal so rather than turn food into fish meal, the Danish vessel turned away and today, the Norwegian vessel has had to go to Derry.  The processor in Derry operates under the same European Union rules but commonsense is in play.  This means that approximately 40 lorry loads of fish will be coming from Derry to Killybegs while we get lectured about climate change and our responsibilities.  This is the madness and insanity of the way we interpret EU rules.  An episode of \"Father Ted\" would not compare to what we are seeing right now in Killybegs.  <\/p> <p> It is madness to ask fishermen to turn food for human consumption, destined for places like West Africa, into fish meal.  This matter was raised earlier by Deputy Doherty.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that the transcript of my contribution is urgently given to his colleague in Cabinet, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue in order that he can he intervene as a matter of urgency.  We are making a laughing stock of ourselves here in terms of our fishing industry.

We must all condemn in the strongest possible terms the treatment of the civilian population in Ukraine by the invading forces from Russia, the bombardment of cities and civilians, the use of hunger as a weapon, as mentioned by President Zelenskyy, the humanitarian disaster in the besieged city of Mariupol and the atrocities at Bucha, where innocent civilians were murdered with their hands tied behind their backs.  We have heard of children being murdered while trying to escape with their families in cars while waving white flags.<\/p>  <p>  Condemnation is never enough.  We need action.  Irish people want the Government to do everything it can to support the people of the Ukraine.  It is very important to recognise that there has been very significant help and assistance given to date.  However, it has not been enough.  Ireland, the European Union and the international community must do everything they can to stop these atrocities.  Measures taken to date have not been sufficiently effective.  The Russian ambassador should be expelled immediately, as should the entire Russian embassy staff.  There must be much stronger sanctions and much stronger practical assistance given to the Ukrainian people.  We are at a point where partial measures simply are not enough.  This is a moment of truth for the European Union.  Will it not just stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine?  Will it also act in the strongest possible way to defend them?<\/p>  <p>  We must stand up against the aggression, the war crimes and the slaughter of innocent civilians.  If we do not do that now and with full measures, when will we do it?  We cannot allow the short-term economic interests of some countries to take precedence over stopping these atrocities.  There is the point that the longer this war goes on, the longer will be the economic damage to various economies, including European economies, and the longer it will result in food shortages and unaffordable, high food prices, especially in lower income countries, as pointed out earlier by President Zelenskyy.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of taking the toughest possible action and doing that in regard to diplomatic staff, our first instinct should always be to use diplomatic means.  We should always support efforts to de-escalate and diplomatic efforts to find peace.  However, this invasion is not the first act of aggression by Russia towards Ukraine.  It follows years of aggressive armed occupation of parts of eastern Ukraine and years of use of gas as a weapon to undermine the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.  It follows the breaking of international agreements, including the guarantees that Russia gave Ukraine when it surrendered its nuclear weapons shortly after independence and the break-up of the Soviet Union, and the failure of Russia to withdraw its troops from eastern Ukraine, as promised under the Minsk agreements.<\/p>  <p>  On Leaders' Questions, my colleague, Deputy Catherine Murphy,  raised with the Taoiseach issues relating to energy, energy security and the cost of energy.  She made a point about the personal crisis that many families are facing and contrasted that with the unintended windfall for the Government in terms of increased VAT receipts.  There is a need to address this matter as quickly as possible.  It is welcome that it has been raised at the European Council, that flexibility is being sought and that some progress is being made, but families and households need urgency on that.  Last week and this week, people are being obliged to make impossible decisions about whether to pay rent, make mortgage repayments, pay utility bills or do their weekly shop in order that they can put food on the table.  These are impossible decisions.  We need urgent action on this matter.  This is key to building cohesion within the European Union.  Building the ability of the European Union to act cohesively means that, in conjunction with governments, it does everything it can to provide the flexibility to allow cost of living and energy costs to come down for people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600032#FF00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1649247600,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I greatly appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this very important debate.  I am grateful to the Taoiseach for updating us on the special European Council meeting that took place on 24 and 25 March.  I will not lie.  The results of this are extremely disappointing.  The fifth round of sanctions that were announced yesterday at the ECOFIN meeting, while very welcome, are yet another piecemeal approach to this situation.  If we truly want to have an impact and cut off the financing of President Vladimir Putin's vicious war machine, we need to stop messing around.  We need to go straight to the level of meaningful and far-reaching sanctions that will have an impact.  That the EU is still paying Russia for oil, gas and, up until a couple of days from now, coal is abhorrent.  This money is going directly into financing the guns, tanks and bombs that are ruining Ukraine and taking the lives of women, children, men and fighters on an hourly basis.<\/p>  <p>  I was appalled this morning when an Irish Member of the European Parliament stated that the latest round of sanctions make her sick.  What makes me sick are the images of children having their names and address written on their backs, some of whom are the same age as my daughter and wearing nappies, and those of children who have been raped and murdered lying strewn on the street.  That particular Members of this House could not have the good grace and courtesy to applaud a man who is leading his country against a vicious war machine was absolutely reprehensible.  The whataboutery and the sheer mental and ethical gymnastics utilised to excuse this lack of dignity, for a brief moment made me ashamed to be a Member of this House.  The vast majority of Members of this House, like the vast majority of people across this country, know that what is happening in Ukraine is a fight between good and evil.  The evil is very much being directed from Moscow by President Vladimir Putin and the stooges and oligarchs who surround him.  They are the people who the European Union is continuing to allow access SWIFT completely.  They are the people who are lining their pockets while they send young boys off as conscripts to murder women and children in Ukraine.  It is an absolutely appalling state of affairs, the likes of which have not been seen on this Continent since the darkest days of the Second World War.  That is why at the next emergency European Council meeting, because there will be another meeting held in an emergency status and another round of sanctions, we need to see the most meaningful, purposeful sanctions and to see the Irish Minister take the lead at that meeting.  No more whataboutery and no increments.<\/p>  <p>  This afternoon, we heard the absolute appalling comment by the newly re-elected Prime Minister of Hungary, Mr. Viktor Orb&aacute;n, when he said that he has no problem paying the Russians in roubles for their gas.  What sort of a cretinous line is that to take?  The EU cannot just be strong with its own members; it also has to look at its partner countries around the world and ask them to state clearly if they are with us or against us.  It needs to look at the United Arab Emirates and countries far closer to home such as Serbia, which aspires to join the European Union, and Brazil, Russia, India and China - the BRIC countries - and the North African countries that are happy to continue to facilitate and service the Russian war machine.  They need to be cut-off from European markets.<\/p>  <p>  The EU needs to take its place as the leader of the free and open Western world.  The EU is the largest economic bloc.  We have spent the past number of years talking about the power and importance of he Single Market.  Where will that power and importance be when the people of Bucha return to their homes and see them levelled and the bodies their loved ones lying not in a ditch or a shallow grave but strewn along the roadway?  We have seen the tactics of this vile and brutal Russian machine in these cities.  No doubt, when the Ukrainian Army liberates Mariupol, it will uncover the sort of sites and scenes that will make us all genuinely sick to our stomachs.  We will sickened not by faux words about sanctions, but by genuine scenes.  The approach of the Russian Government to the people of Ukraine and the people of Europe is appalling.<\/p> <p>The response of the European Council at its most recent meeting and at ECOFIN yesterday simply is not good enough.  I am probably the most pro-European Member of this House.  I spend pretty much every day talking about the importance of Europe but I have no problem being critical when I need to be.  The European response to the war in Ukraine so far has not been good enough.  I know our response will strengthen.  We thought the first round of sanctions again Russia would be good enough.  We are now on the fifth round of sanctions.  <\/p> <p> Decisions will, unfortunately, also have to be made in Ireland.  We talk about solidarity and we received the warm words of President Zelenskyy this morning.  We must ask if we are doing enough and if we have a credible plan to do enough, not just for the Ukrainian people but for our partners in the European Union as we deal with the fallout of this brutal war.<\/p> <p> There are two more areas I would like to raise, the first of which relates to our response to receiving refugees and the need for a co-ordinated European Union plan.  I do not believe a plan has been fully worked out yet.  We need a plan for the next couple of months and for relief efforts to buttress the efforts of Poland, Moldova, Slovakia and other member states but we must also realise that our guests from Ukraine are going to be in our countries for a number of years.  That realisation needs to be accompanied by a genuine Europe-wide plan for their relocation and shelter, and for the provision of employment opportunities and social protection.  We must also bear in mind that these people are coming from a war-torn area and a traumatic situation and will be facing into many more months when traumatic stories from war-torn areas will be coming to their homes.  How are they going to react when they get news that their 19-year-old son, their brother or husband has been killed in action?  How will they feel when they see the images coming from Bucha or Mariupol, knowing well that they could be their neighbourhoods, as they sit in Lisdoonvarna, Killiney, Roscommon or wherever they might be?  We need to be able to take this approach.  Some 10 million Ukrainians have lost their homes in the largest displacement of people since the Second World War and we need a level of joined-up thinking.<\/p> <p> The cost of living crisis is one that everyone across this House talks about on a daily basis.  Everyone presents different solutions.  We must listen to each other and disagree when we need to.  It is key that we consider the European approach to the cost of living crisis.  I was disappointed that the read-out from the European Council meeting showed that the European Commission asked member states to look at the open toolbox of opportunities.  What is needed is clear.  The Irish Government needs to bring to the next European Council meeting a resolve to achieve a derogation on VAT rates for fuel.  The ability to cut VAT has saved other sectors of our economy during tough economic times in the past.  This is about providing genuine relief to households and businesses across the country quickly.  It would be far more meaningful than many of the other suggestions that are being made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600032#FF00300","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649248200,"counter":280,"content":"<p>Today we heard the powerful and moving testimony of President Zelenskyy.

Back in 2020, the EU Commission issued letters of formal notice to Cyprus and Malta regarding their golden passport schemes.  Both countries are major havens for laundering Russian money.  In March, the EU Commissioner for Justice noted that the phasing out of citizenship by investment schemes \"is fully in line with the Commission's priorities\".  <\/p>  <p>  I note that the Government has now frozen applications for these visas and passports for Russian investors.

These must be punished and Putin must be held responsible.<\/p>  <p>  We are witnessing increased violence in Palestine at the hand of apartheid Israel.  There are illegal settlements and administrative detentions.  The voices of Michael Lynk and Amnesty International are among an increasing number of reputable voices calling out Israel's apartheid nature.  If we are going to be consistent in our condemnation of terror, Israel must be sanctioned for its crimes, which have made a two-state solution virtually impossible.<\/p>  <p>  War in Yemen is destroying countless lives with the arms industry in Europe the only beneficiary as it makes eye-watering profits.  If we are going to be consistent, Saudi Arabia must be sanctioned for its crimes.<\/p>  <p>  From the Council of Europe to the UN Security Council, Ireland needs to be a progressive voice and a leader for developing nations such as Western Sahara, which for years was under European colonial rule and is now under Moroccan occupation.  Ireland is a small nation and needs to be a voice for other small nations such as Western Sahara.  We must promote the right of the Western Saharan people to self-determination and allow them to complete the process of decolonisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600033#GG00300","speaker":"1555"},{"type":"speech","time":1649248200,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I express our solidarity with the people of Ukraine.  People across the world have been horrified and moved by the graphic pictures of horror and brutality unleashed by the invading imperialist Russian forces that have emerged.  Those images cannot but move people and give them a sense of the extreme horror of war.<\/p>  <p>  I will address the point that was made by Deputy Richmond which was, in some ways, an attempt to suggest that People Before Profit and others on the left are in some way pro-Putin because we do not support further escalation by the West or the ratcheting up of sanctions.  It is important to remember that while the West was rolling out the red carpet for Putin, it was the socialist left which consistently opposed him as a despot and warmonger.  Many of those who today are attacking the left were silent when Putin was committing brutal war crimes against the people of Chechnya.  Let us not forget that during that invasion, Putin was given a state visit to the UK by Tony Blair and Fianna F&aacute;il's own Bertie Ahern shook his bloodstained hand while socialists were protesting outside.  The socialist left were the ones who spoke out against that war.  Even at the start of this year when Russian troops were sent to Kazakhstan as part of a Collective Security Treaty Organization, CSTO, operation to put down and intimidate a workers' uprising, it was the socialist left that spoke out and organised international events in solidarity with Kazakh trade unionists and socialists.  The Department of Foreign Affairs was utterly silent on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett today reiterated our total opposition to Putin and his bloody war.  We stood with the people of Ukraine today and we stand with them in their struggle against the Russian invasion.  However, that does not mean we have to go along with the calls for the escalation of the conflict by the West.  For example, what does a NATO no-fly zone mean in reality?  It means a hot conflict and an air war between NATO forces and Russia over the territory of Ukraine.  It is a recipe for a global conflict and, potentially, a global nuclear conflict.  The French finance minister has described the escalation of sanctions as \"total economic war\".  They have been described as the harshest sanctions that have ever existed.<\/p> <p>What is the impact of these sanctions?  What is their impact on the ordinary Russian people who are not responsible for this war?  There is an impressive anti-war movement from below.  People look back now at the wars in Iraq.  What came before the first war in Iraq were horrendous sanctions that were responsible for the deaths of 500,000 children.  Everybody acknowledges that was wrong.  Sanctions that impact on ordinary people are wrong.  They also serve to undermine what we need, which is for the anti-war movement to grow.  They bolster Putin in the polls by portraying this as coming from the outside, as opposed to showing ordinary Russian people that they do not benefit from his warmongering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600033#GG00400","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649248800,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I note the re-election of a far-right, racist and homophobic Government in Hungary at the weekend.

His words were thoughtful and reflective.  The truths he told about the appalling things that are happening to his fellow citizens in Ukraine are shocking and horrifying.  Worse is probably yet to come.  Putin's soldiers are massacring civilians and razing cities to the ground just like the Nazis did in the Second World War.  What is happening is shocking and unbelievable.<\/p><p>Some people in this House have spoken about Israel.  That is fine.  That is their right and their entitlement.  During the Second World War, one in every four Jews killed was massacred by the Nazis in Ukraine.

He will be remembered forever for the evil he has done.  Coming from Drogheda, I am reminded of a previous evil person, Oliver Cromwell, who slaughtered most of the inhabitants of my town.  Just as Cromwell slaughtered inhabitants and deported citizens of Ireland at that time, Putin is doing the same by removing people from where they live in Ukraine and bringing them under arrest to Russia.  That is entirely unacceptable.<\/p><p>The lessons we are learning today are very serious and will be long-lasting.  The world has changed utterly.  Ireland is taking the right steps in the right way at the heart of our policy on Europe.  President Zelenskyy clarified his support for what the Government is doing and stated the need to continue to support Ukraine's policy.  Any steps we can take in the United Nations to further support the advent of peace in this war must be accepted and lauded.  For the generations to come, for the young people being born today, for my grandchildren, other Members' children and so on, we need to ensure Europe is stable, with Ireland at its heart.  This dictator, Putin, must be put down by any means necessary.  As a neutral country, we can only go so far but every possible effort we can make must be supported and advanced.  At the heart of all of this is the fact that evil can never triumph and good must win in the end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600034#HH00300","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1649248800,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak following the European Council meeting the week before last.  On the mind of everybody in this House, as well as across the country and across Europe, is the energy crisis.  That crisis is leading to a very severe cost-of-living crisis that is making life difficult for our people.  Our short-term challenge is solving the energy crisis.  This has already been spoken about in the House today and on many previous occasions in recent weeks and months.<\/p><p>I want to talk about the medium- and long-term energy crisis.  There has been some debate about that but I do not think there has been enough debate or that it has been good enough.  There is a tendency from many commentators to double down on some of the technologies and solutions of the past.  Those solutions may have served us well but, especially given the publication of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changereport on Monday, of which colleagues will be aware, we do not have any time to lose in transitioning to a clean energy economy.  Ireland has vast renewable energy resources off our coasts, particularly the west coast.  If we put our minds to it and if we seek the help of Europe, we can provide ten times as much energy as we will ever need.  We can satisfy our domestic need and we can help Europe get off its addiction to Russian fossil fuels.  This is the medium and long-term challenge that we must follow.<\/p><p>We are at a fork in the road.  The Ceann Comhairle and the Minister of State will probably appreciate me quoting Robert Frost:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I&mdash;<br \/><br \/>I took the one less traveled by,<br \/><br \/>And that has made all the difference. <\/blockquote>  <p>We are at the fork in the road.  We are looking at the path diverging and we have a choice.  Will we do what we did in the 1970s during the oil crisis?  We built a coal-fired power station, unlike the Danes, who invested heavily in renewable energy.  That was quite a new concept at the time.  Now, because they did that in the 1970s, the Danes have a &euro;10 billion industry.  They got behind the Germans, the Spanish and the Americans to some extent.  Ireland played it safe and built a coal-fired power station, and now we are in a very challenging situation.  We should not make the same mistake again.<\/p><p>We have an opportunity to be world leaders and innovators.  We are innovators in many sectors and we can be innovators in the development of offshore wind technology, including both floating and fixed technology.  To make this work, we have to develop a green hydrogen economy.  This is not a technological challenge but a societal and economic one.  We have to be the first to do it.  We should do it because we have the energy - more clean energy than nearly any other country.  While the solution for many countries across Europe and the world might be LNG or nuclear power, these are not the solutions for Ireland.  Ireland has a clear and clean path that it can follow.  If we speak to Europe, and to the European need for clean energy, and ask for help to scale up, escalate and expedite the delivery of clean energy from the western flank of Europe, we can get there much more quickly than we had planned heretofore.<\/p> <p>Let us be under no illusion that it is a huge challenge but it is the right path and the one we should follow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600034#HH00400","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649249400,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I was honoured to be in this Chamber this morning to listen to the address of the Ukrainian President, Mr. Zelenskyy.  There is a serious need for us to support the Ukrainian people and to push the UN, European Commission and other relevant bodies to investigate the war crimes that are being committed in Ukraine every day.  Alongside this, we cannot forget the plight of those in Syria, Afghanistan, Palestine, Yemen and other countries where parents put their children to bed every night without knowing what the following day will bring.  We must stand against all atrocities against humanity.  We have a proud history of military neutrality in global conflicts.

It is clear from the meeting that the EU recognises that we have a cost-of-living crisis and that a significant part of this is energy costs.  While the EU is willing to act we need clarity on how it will do so as soon as possible.  In the meantime, the Government must act to alleviate the pressure people are under.  I spoke to a lady yesterday who had just received her two-month electricity bill and it came to &euro;490.  She is genuinely fearful for her family's solvency and if a similar bill comes next time she does not know what she will do.  She is not alone.  The Government must stop offering ridiculous money-saving suggestions if it will not put its money where its mouth is.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council also discussed the worsening situation in Ukraine.  I would like to express my condemnation of the 9 March Russian air strike on the maternity hospital in Mariupol.  Russian soldiers have forcibly deported the surviving staff and patients of the hospital, sending more than 70 people into Russia.  Under the Geneva Conventions, it is a war crime for an occupying power to deport people to any other country during an international conflict.  The perpetrators must be held to account for this atrocity and for their deliberate targeting of the most vulnerable in Ukrainian society.  We need to send a message that Russian aggression will not be tolerated and that message should be sent home to Russia, along with the Russian ambassador.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600035#JJ00300","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1649249400,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I want to pick up where Deputy Leddin left off.  Last December, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann unanimously passed a motion that, among other things, called on the Government to design a strategy in conjunction with the European Commission to fund and construct an Atlantic electricity interconnector that would connect west coast and south-west coast renewable electricity directly to the mainland European grid.  This would provide large quantities of clean and green electricity to the EU and create tens of thousands of jobs along the western seaboard in the next decade, bringing about balanced regional development in this country.  That is something that has been talked about for a long time and this is the opportunity to implement that.  This measure would also significantly reduce the cost of electricity for Irish homes, providing us with the cheapest electricity in Europe.  To do that, we need to establish an offshore renewable development authority to drive the type of change and strategic thinking needed in this country to make this opportunity a reality.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with that, the Government needs to engage directly at European Council level to push for the need to develop this Atlantic interconnector and connect it to the European grid.  In so doing, we would bring Irish-generated clean electricity into the heart of Europe.  We will be pushing an open door on this with the European Commission and with our European colleagues but the initiative must come from the Government.  I am focusing on this issue because I have personal experience of dealing with the Celtic interconnector and of how imperative it was for Ireland to take a leadership role on that.  We brought our French colleagues along that road with us and tremendous work had to be done on that.  We did that and we secured the support of the European Commission for it.  We need to take a similar approach today if we are going to bring about this project as a reality.  The Commission is already looking at having major grid interconnection from the western seaboard to the European grid but we need to see this prioritised because if we get a positive decision from the Commission on this and if we put a strategic authority in place to drive this project in Ireland to develop our offshore renewable energy then we can be to the fore, not just in Europe but globally, in offshore wind technology.  Earlier this week the German ambassador went to Cork to meet the researchers involved in this and to meet some of the businesses investing in this.  Germany sees the huge opportunity we have in Ireland and it is about time that we took up that mantle and ran with this issue to ensure we can provide the type of interconnection needed to maximise the potential off our coast.  In tandem with that, we also need to develop our opportunity with hydrogen, which is another mechanism to transport renewable and clean energy from Ireland to the European energy network.  Funnily enough, Ireland is one of the few European countries that has yet to establish a green hydrogen strategy and this needs to happen immediately.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue in European co-operation that I want to raise is rare diseases.  Rare diseases are not rare.  In Ireland, approximately one in 12 people will at some stage in their lives be affected by such a condition.  Some 825,000 people are impacted by rare diseases when family members, many of whom are carers, are included.  Sadly, the west and north west have among the highest incidence rates of rare disease in Europe.  While most rare diseases appear early in life, with approximately 30% of children affected dying before their fifth birthdays, many of them are not diagnosed until adulthood.  There is nothing worse than being unwell and not being believed, even though you know something is fundamentally wrong; except of course if it is your child who is unwell and you are being dismissed by the medics as just another over-anxious parent.  Accurate diagnosis is often only made late into the disease.  Some 37% of people spend five years trying to get a diagnosis, by which time the patient will have already been treated for many months, or even years, for other more common diseases.  This puts an unnecessary financial burden on our health service.  We can speed up this diagnosis process through genomics.  There is an EU-wide initiative, Beyond One Million Genomes.  This initiative brings together 22 EU countries, along with Norway and the UK, looking to sequence at least 1 million genomes over the next period and to share that data securely across Europe.<\/p> <p>Ireland today remains an observer country to that initiative.  We need to put the legislative mechanism and funding structure in place to become fully part of that programme and to utilise the information that is being generated all over Europe to treat and help our people in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600035#JJ00400","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649250000,"counter":292,"content":"<p>The war in Ukraine rightly dominated the agenda of the European Council.

This is the only way we will get through to Vladimir Putin, because he does not understand humanity.  He is a war criminal.  The past four or five days have exposed the true deeds of his army, including genocide and breaches of the Geneva Conventions.  This man does not understand humanity, but he understands the value of the rouble.  His oligarchs and all his associates understand the value and greening of money.  At the beginning of this war, an analysis stated it was costing $2 billion per day for Russia to wage war.  In the past week, that figure, in analysis by economists, has crept up to $20 billion per day.  That is not just the cost of the army, weapons and military salaries, but the cost to the economy collectively, seven days a week, and I believe this will ultimately grind him down.<\/p><p>Addressing this House in June 1963, President John F. Kennedy stated: &quot;Ireland pursues an independent course in foreign policy, but it is not neutral between liberty and tyranny and never will be.&quot;  Although that is from six decades ago, that perfectly encapsulates the psyche of the Irish people and the view and policy of Government.

An incredible project is being planned off the west shore of County Clare, the Green Atlantic project.  It will be one of Europe's largest wind farms, capitalising on the significant winds coming in from the Atlantic.  It is three times more efficient than onshore wind.  There will be capacity onshore at the former Moneypoint station to process the wind energy coming in and to store it as hydrogen.  That will have knock-on effects for Shannon Airport, where we are trying to devise more sustainable and greener ways of putting planes into our sky.  Ireland is leading the way.  It does not always show that.  We need to lead the way across all European nations in being to the forefront of sustainable aviation and green energy.<\/p><p>A previous speaker mentioned Ambassador Filatov and his residence on Orwell Road.  He has shown contempt for the people of Ukraine and for the good people of his own country who do not wish to wage war.

This is all because of the failure of this Government to act.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has been asked to cap the price of the tax on fuel.  It has refused to help us on that.  It brought out a system yesterday for &euro;18 million, but it is only given to one sector of the truckers.  It only covers people who have a road haulier licence.  Every supplier in this country does not have a road haulier licence.  Every producer does not have a road haulier licence.  Only the people who transport, the subcontractors, do.  The Government therefore has not helped anyone in our rural area, such as the producers who elected the Minister of State to represent County Limerick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600037#LL00300","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1649250600,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Much of the European Council statements were rightly focused around the Russian military aggression against Ukraine.  We must continue to condemn Russia's bloody and destructive attack on Ukraine at every opportunity we get.  I am glad that this was the main focus of the European Council talks.  We stand with Ukraine and its people.  We should continue to condemn Russia at every opportunity we get.  We also must continue to maintain and strengthen our military neutrality at every opportunity.  Both are not mutually exclusive.  This is not to say that we are morally neutral in the face of war crimes either.  We never have been and we never will be.  President Zelenskyy himself when addressing the D&aacute;il earlier said although Ireland is a neutral country, it has not remained neutral to the disaster Russia has brought to Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  Our response has rightly been victim focused.  Our role as a neutral voice that condemns violations of international law and supports victims is internationally recognised.  It is important that we continue to protect this neutral voice.  I welcome that the European Council agreed to develop a Ukrainian solidarity trust fund to help to provide support to Ukraine for its immediate needs and for the reconstruction of Ukraine, following the incredible destruction and loss suffered there.  I was concerned, however, about the European Union's endorsement of a strategic compass, which intends to provide a shared assessment of the strategic environment in which the EU is operating and of the threats and challenges the Union supposedly faces.<\/p>  <p>  I know that the Commission, in conjunction with the European Defence Agency, EDA, intends to look at defensive investment gaps and to introduce initiatives to strengthen the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base, EDTIB, next month.  We need to tread very carefully here on this.  We need to ensure that our neutrality is not compromised when such discussions take place.  The European Council has stated that it intends to harness EU funding instruments and initiatives to strengthen the defence capabilities of member states.  We cannot allow them to rope Ireland into this.  We cannot allow them to get involved in the way we conduct our Defence Forces.  We must stay strong in our neutrality.  We all know that in the House that the EU will have willing partners here to weaken our neutrality and we need to watch out for that.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of energy issues, I am glad to see that the national circumstances will be taken into account and I think that we should look at all the options that are provided for.  The Government is quick to make the point that it cannot act on VAT on energy costs and that may be so, but the Commission is pointing out the options that are available, such as temporary taxation of or regulatory interventions on windfall profits.  Those options are available from the Commission itself.  What is being done about that?<\/p>  <p>  We have that we have been constantly led to believe that that is the only game in town but now we see that it is not.  It is interesting that we have been very vocal on the import of oil and gas from Russia and have said that we should stop them straight away and rightly so.  Yet, that it is a stance that would cause hardship for the citizens who depend on them.  Yet, interestingly, there are not many Irish citizens who depend on gas from Russia.  There may be a knock-on effect if a ban comes into force and time will tell in relation to that.  At the same time, we appear to be protecting the Aughinish Alumina plant from sanctions.  That is hypocritical of us.  If we need to protect that plant, the Government should be considering taking it over straight away and to take it out of the hands of the oligarchs.  Why should we protect that plant for an oligarch?  Should the Government not take it into public control so that we can run it ourselves?  We can dispose of it at a later stage, rather than protecting it and keeping it free from sanctions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600037#LL00400","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1649250600,"counter":301,"content":"<p>We now have 20 minutes for a question-and-answer session.

This is where I want his help.  The pig farmers were here last week.  The introduction of the subsidies for fuel for heavy goods vehicles is only available to people who hold road haulier licences.  That counts out the quarries that own vehicles and supply their own goods.  It takes out the pig industry that runs the produce to the factories using its own vehicles.  It takes the farming and agricultural sector out of it by using their own vehicles.  It only covers people who have a road haulage license.  That is 38% of the HGVs in this country.  Therefore, 62% of the HGVs are getting no subsidy.  I am asking the Minister of State to take this to Government.  Should it not cover everyone?  Everyone who has a HGV is covered under the RSA.  They also have to go for the Road Safety Authority, RSA, MOTs.  Then, they tax their vehicles on a commercial basis under HGV goods.  The right way of doing a subsidy would have been that anyone who is compliant with a current MOT on a HGV with the RSA and is taxed should qualify for the fuel subsidy.  That would cover everyone.  We could take this to Europe because it would work for everyone, for every person in Ireland.  The Government could cap the tax on fuel at &euro;1.30.  After that, we would pay the increase in the fuel, but we would not pay tax on it.  That is something that the Government can introduce now.<\/p> <p>It would actually help every householder in this country whether he or she is working, elderly or retired.  It would cover every person in this country.  People would see it first-hand at the pumps.  This would help people.  It would also help registered businesses that do not qualify at the moment under any other scheme that is available.<\/p> <p> My last question is about public transport, which does not cover everyone outside of the towns and villages in this country.  If somebody wants public transport, it means that we must have infrastructure.  As I said earlier, there are 2 million vehicles and 2.4 million people working in this country.  That means public transport only covers 400,000 people plus those who live in an area where they have public transport.  It does not cover 2 million people, however.  Where is all the taxation going on the fuels?  It is coming from fuel taxes.  I want the Minister of State to help me make a difference to every household.  I want him to stand up here for the people of County Limerick who elected him to help all industry for the area he represents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600037#LL00600","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649251200,"counter":304,"content":"<p>In fairness to the Minister of State, he can only respond on behalf of the Government rather than on behalf of the people of County Limerick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600038#MM00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1649251200,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I will put it in terms of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600038#MM00300","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1649251200,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle.  I have been here for 12 years now representing the people of County Limerick.  In response to Deputy O'Donoghue, I do not need to be reminded of my job.  I am well capable of being reminded of that by the people of County Limerick.  Having been returned by them three times now, I must be doing something right.  A number of questions were asked.  I will try to do my best.  Most of the Deputies who asked them are not in the Chamber now.  Many of the questions pertain to different Departments.  We have made records of them and we will reply to them in writing because they do not actually relate to the European Council at all.<\/p><p>I will take the last questions first, which relate specifically to the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Transport.  I will refer Deputy O'Donoghue's questions to the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan and get a reply to him.<\/p><p>In general, with regard to rural infrastructure, I note that in the <i>Limerick Leader<\/i>, <i>Weekly Observer<\/i>and <i>Vale Mallow Star and Observer<\/i>, the Deputy is very quick to welcome much of the Government's investment in rural roads.  As someone who works in construction, I note the Deputy is very praiseworthy of the Government's increased investment in roads all over County Limerick.  We are doing a very good job in investing in roads in County Limerick.  The Deputy is also very praiseworthy of the Government's rural transport infrastructure improvements, which have been done all over County Limerick.  We are, therefore, doing an awful lot of very positive things as well.  The Deputy gets a lot of speaking time in this Chamber.  He is no stranger to taking a lot of credit for some of the stuff the Government is doing in County Limerick.  During some of the times he uses that speaking time here, he might put in the odd plug for the positive stuff we are doing as well, because it is not all negative.<\/p><p>I will start at the beginning of the questions.  Deputy McDonald raised the issue, as did many Deputies, including previous speakers, of the area of VAT.  In his opening remarks the Taoiseach said this issue relates not only to Ireland.  All member states have asked that this be dealt with.  In fairness, Deputy McDonald did say, and I wrote it down, that &quot;the Government cannot do everything&quot; and that she recognises this is a very complicated issue.  Every speaker who came in here said the Government cannot do everything and then went on to say the Government should do everything.  It is a case of the oxymorons; the Government cannot do everything.  I recognise that the cost of living in every household in the country has gone through the roof.  A person would want to be living on a different planet not to recognise that.  The Government simply cannot do everything but it is trying to respond, as every member state of the European Union is doing.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach was one of the first out of the blocks with regard to being one of the first Prime Ministers to raise the issue of VAT.  Further work with the European Commission is required to do this because previous speakers, who I think were from Sinn F&eacute;in, said that once this war passes - and it will pass - there will be a requirement for the VAT rate to go back up.  When that does happen, I am sure many people will be clamouring to tell the Government not to do that.  The Taoiseach is very conscious of that issue.<\/p><p>Many speakers raised the issue of where we are specifically around EU-China affairs and about EU-India affairs.  Credit must again go to the Taoiseach.  He was the first Prime Minister to raise the issue of India's position on the atrocities that are happening in Ukraine at the moment.  I also wish to make a personal comment, a Cheann Comhairle.  Being a Minister of State, one does not get speaking time like many Deputies do on different matters.  I wish to mention some specific issues that have been raised.  Ireland's relations with China are closely linked to the EU perspective.  The EU strategy of managing complex relations is a good one.  We understand and accept the differing elements that need to be addressed in a strategic and united matter when it comes to China.  The same issue runs through with regard to India.  The Taoiseach has been very clear in relation to that.<\/p><p>Deputy Cian O&rsquo;Callaghan said that condemnation is not enough and we need action, and that practical assistance will be required.  However, then other speakers and questioners said that practical assistance cannot involve Ireland getting involved militarily.  This is, therefore, the dilemma in which the country is involved.  How far do we move towards getting involved that does not see this country being practically militarily involved?  That is a dilemma the country has confronted from the outset of this war.  We have confronted it in a very practical sense by making sure we provide humanitarian aid but also by providing very practical assistance.<\/p><p>I wish to pay tribute to the Ceann Comhairle's initiative of inviting the President of Ukraine to address us this morning.  In many ways, it was historic.  We can use every kind of clich&eacute; we want.  It was also a source of terrible embarrassment, however, to be in a Chamber where colleagues refused to clap.  I come from a part of the world where we use an expression that goes when you are in a hole, you should stop digging.  They came in then and tried to give an explanation as to why they did not clap.  One can see in his face and from his facial expressions, by his demeanour and from photographs that have been taken of him, how this war has run President Zelenskyy down and how it has destroyed his country and his people.  They used these mar dhea excuses, together with their colleagues in the European Parliament in some sort of warped ideology, not to support him.  They say they will support his country but they will not support him.  I feel sorry for them that as parliamentarians, they would do that today.  They brought shame on themselves but they also brought a degree of shame on us because as colleagues of theirs, we have to share a room with them.  I ask them to reflect on it and to come back and apologise for it.  One of them happens to be an officeholder of this Parliament.  To me, that is a source of embarrassment.<\/p><p>Outside being a Member of this Parliament, I am a husband and father to three young children.  One image has really stuck in my mind in the last couple of weeks.  It is an image of what people say is potentially a three-year-old child who is gagged, blindfolded, with hands tied and possibly raped.  I have a seven-year-old, a three-year-old and a two-year-old.  That three-year-old could potentially be mine in any other circumstance.  There can be no equivocation in this.  There can be no hiding places and no excuses.  There can be no press statement saying they did not clap because of X, Y or Z.  To me, this is very black and white.  A person is either in or our out with regard to these atrocities.<\/p><p>I did not get a chance to speak to the whole Ukrainian situation during the statements that were given the previous week.  To me, the Ceann Comhairle's position this morning really summed up the question of whether we are neutral.  We are not neutral.  How can we be neutral in this?How could we not have a position with regard to right or wrong?  Before I came into the D&aacute;il, I was a primary teacher.  Deputy O'Donoghue took issue one morning on Live 95 with the fact that I was a primary teacher.  He said there were too many primary teachers in the D&aacute;il.  I was also an engineer, by the way.  I was an industrial chemist, to satisfy the Deputy's curiosity in that respect as well.<\/p>  <p>I always told children that if they ever had a doubt about something being right or wrong, it was probably wrong.  Some Deputies had an issue earlier relating to whether they should clap in response to President Zelenskyy&rsquo;s address.  Some of them began clapping, looked to their colleagues and then stopped clapping.  To me, they are a source of embarrassment to this Parliament and to us as colleagues.  They should reflect on what they have done, come back to the Chamber and set the record straight.  They should make a personal statement to the House and apologise for their actions.  Given what has been said on Twitter, they have invited unnecessary commentary on what was an otherwise very positive initiative on the part of the Ceann Comhairle.<\/p> <p> Turning to some of the issues Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell raised in respect of the IFSC, which Deputy Sherlock also raised in the context of legislation proposed by his Labour Party colleague, they will be referred to the Minister for Finance.<\/p> <p> I have dealt with the issue raised by People Before Profit regarding solidarity.<\/p> <p> I agree entirely with Deputy Leddin regarding the issue of green energy but, unfortunately, like Robert Frost's line about two roads diverging in a yellow wood, I am going to take a different road.  He is going to take the road of green energy in the medium term, but our definitions of \"medium term\" might differ.  That we have gas storage, which we need, in a different jurisdiction proves we need a policy on gas storage in this country in the short term.  We cannot rely on a third country, outside of the European Union, to store our gas, which is happening at the moment.  An LNG facility in a country outside of the European Union is storing our gas and that policy is not sustainable into the short and medium terms, by which I mean ten years.  We need a policy on green energy that will allow electricity to be brought into Moneypoint to be converted into hydrogen, stored, transferred across the grid and sold to France - I am all for that - but what will we do between now and then?<\/p> <p> We need to be able to import gas from different sources such as the Gulf of Mexico and the United States, with conditions applied to that, rather than simply finding an Irish solution for an Irish problem, which has been done for other, social elements in the past to deal with problems we wanted to sweep under the carpet in this country.  We have dealt with issues by exporting them to the United Kingdom.  We did that very unsuccessfully, historically in this country, to our shame in respect of other issues, and we are now doing it with gas importation.  We are already importing fracked gas through a gas interconnector, and it suits the narrative of some people whereby just because it is done from the UK, we need not talk about it.<\/p> <p> We do need to talk about it and have a discussion in this country about our energy security.  The discussion needs to be honest and open and it needs to be held here and now.  We need to start talking about gas storage.  Deputy Leddin is correct in respect of the coal-fired station, but we are damn lucky we have it now.  If we had not built it in the 1980s, what would we have now?  I would probably be talking to the House under candlelight because the lights would have gone out if not for Moneypoint.  Moneypoint is going gangbusters at the moment and God help us if we did not have it.  While we are lucky to have onshore wind, it is not reliable.<\/p> <p> Deputy Naughten referred to offshore wind electricity.  Again, we will refer those issues to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, but I nonetheless fully concur.<\/p> <p> Deputy Pringle, who is no longer in the Chamber, referred to an issue that concerns my constituency and Aughinish Alumina.  It is a pity when people get their information from online sources, which tend to be based on rumour and innuendo.  If he had asked somebody like me, or perhaps Deputy O'Donoghue, who might know something about Aughinish Alumina, he would know that what he said about the operation of the plant was an utter fallacy.  The plant employs well over 1,000 people in my constituency and it is not in any way connected to a war machine.  In fact, it provides Europe with up to 30% of the alumina required for the Continent&rsquo;s construction and aircraft and car manufacturing and is an integral part of Europe's alumina industry.  It is not connected, as some people might want to suggest, to any sort of Russian empire.<\/p> <p> If there are any points I have not responded to, I will come to them in my closing remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600038#MM00400","speaker":"1494","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649251800,"counter":308,"content":"<p>We are fortunate to have so many robust contributors from County Limerick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600039#NN00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1649251800,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600039#NN00300","speaker":"1494"},{"type":"speech","time":1649251800,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister of State might not have all the details to hand, but can we get an update for the Ukrainian ambassador, H.E.

As the Taoiseach indicated, I will address some of the economic and EU external issues discussed at the most recent meeting.  The European Council in March endorsed the political emphasis of the Versailles declaration insofar as strengthening Europe's economic base is concerned.  This includes unlocking the full potential of the Single Market to underpin the green and digital transitions essential to Europe's future prosperity and well-being.  The leaders also endorsed the strategic priorities of the Commission's annual sustainable growth survey and invited member states to reflect them in their national reform programmes and stability programme updates to be submitted this month as part of their European semester process.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland agrees that the annual sustainable growth survey produced by the European Commission in November provides the correct political emphasis for economic policy co-ordination at this time.  It highlights four key dimensions of competitive sustainability as guiding principles for Europe's economic renewal.  They are also consistent with the strategic direction established by the recovery and resilience facility forming the core component of the historic Next Generation EU budgetary package.  The four dimensions comprise environmental sustainability, productivity, fairness and macroeconomic stability.  The Commission will update its assessment of the economic outlook in May and has acknowledged significant downside risks since its February forecast, which did not take account of the impacts of the war in Ukraine.  Given the renewed uncertainties and risks, Ireland's view is the EU needs to remain agile and flexible in our political response to the current circumstances and we welcome the conclusions adopted at the Council meeting in March.<\/p>  <p>  On 24 and 25 March, the leaders also exchanged views on the EU-China summit, which subsequently took place on 1 April.  The leaders discussed relations with China in the changed and urgent context of the situation.  At the EU-China summit, the EU and China extensively discussed Russia's military aggression against Ukraine, which is endangering global security and the world economy.  It is the EU's assessment that the shared interests of the EU and China should be to work together to stop Russia's war in Ukraine as soon as possible.  From the EU's perspective, we view the EU and China to have a common responsibility to support peace, stability and a sustainable and safe world.  While the focus of the summit was very much on Ukraine, EU and Chinese leaders also discussed the state of bilateral relations and areas of shared interest such as climate change, biodiversity and health, as well as ways to ensure a more balanced and reciprocal trade relationship.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council also discussed the prolonged and political crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina, reiterating its commitment to a European perspective of that country and the western Balkans more generally.  The EU wants to see leaders in Bosnia and Herzegovina demonstrate a strong commitment to constitutional electoral reform, which is vital for the stability and full functionality of that country, an essential precursor to obtaining EU candidate status.  The EU stands ready to continue high-level engagement in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  I thank all the Deputies for their statements and questions.  The Taoiseach will continue to report to the House following the regular meetings of the Council.  We will try to respond in writing to any questions that have been collated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600039#NN00800","speaker":"1494"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649251800,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an D&aacute;il ar fionra&iacute;

establish a framework for the supply and installation of prefabricated 3D volumetric modular homes, which can significantly reduce the construction time for social and affordable housing. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>I am happy to open this debate on behalf of the Regional Group.  It is ostensibly about the housing crisis that is being driven by the lack of available dwellings for temporary or permanent habitation, increasing input costs and rising inflation to finished construction costs.  This is creating an affordability crisis for many in our population, especially those with aspirations to buy and live in their own homes.<\/p><p>Supply deficits are also affecting the rental market.  Monthly rents have totally eclipsed most average monthly mortgage payments and, for many individuals and families, renting is becoming unsustainable.  The housing crisis is also creating great difficulty for local authorities tasked with making housing available to the vulnerable and those qualifying on low incomes.  We have dysfunction in builder housing finance availability and the overarching regulatory requirements stifle new-build timelines and opportunity.  This is significantly slowing the housing delivery process and adding to the costs.  <\/p><p>Our motion calls on Government to introduce initiatives that will bring the significant stock of vacant and derelict properties sitting unoccupied in the State back into use.  Activating this housing stock for sale to new homeowners or supply to the rental market will go some way towards alleviating the supply crisis and the upward trajectory in housing costs.<\/p><p>More than 90,000 vacant properties have been identified throughout the State.  These could form the basis of a recyclable housing stock with the right initiatives.  Many need retrofitting and refurbishment but a sale into use price would reflect that.  Many of these homes are located in our regional towns and villages and developing them could breathe new life into our regional economy while venting pressure from our large urban centres, which cannot cope with the current housing demand.  <\/p><p>In my region, the south east, there are over 53,000 young people aged between 18 and 49 living at home.  Those competing for the local authority housing list in my county of Waterford, for example, will, if they qualify, join a queue of 3,000 on the housing list for an annual local authority allocation of 300 homes.  Across the south east, there are more than 23,000 vacant homes, excluding holiday units, and some 500 are vacant under the fair deal scheme.  The Government must move to make the houses locked up in the fair deal scheme available for rental agreements and to the rental market.  There must be several ways of creating innovative financial solutions to ensure the State gets fair recompense in terms of the fair deal, while allowing these houses to be made available to the rental sector.<\/p><p>The Government is making &euro;4 billion available to tackle the housing situation and new modular building methods may be a significant step forward.  At present, a company in Carlow can provide new one-bedroom units for &euro;75,000 to &euro;100,000.  Adding some site valuation could deliver first-time buyer mortgages of just &euro;400 to &euro;600 per month in large parts of the country.  <\/p><p>An initiative has been suggested to me which I offer to the Minister of State.  I believe it is worth considering under the Housing for All strategy.  It requires that over a 12-month period under Housing for All, a tax credit could be used and converted from unallocated finances to first-time buyers of vacant homes.  This credit could target, for example, vacant homes of &euro;200,000 valuation, where the allocated buyer grant delivers &euro;100,000 spend capacity.  A similar grant could target first-time buyers for new modular home construction at less than &euro;200,000. <\/p><p>In Waterford, for instance, the local authority's Housing for All allocation is &euro;125 million per year.  If the council failed to allocate 30%, this would amount to &euro;37 million that could be reallocated to a new housing grant that could deliver between 180 and 360 new developed properties.  This could deliver a significant number of new homes from vacant housing stock.  These homes would meet both supply and affordability criteria and would allow many people to get the housing start they desperately need.  Delivering this affordable solution would also allow these families and individuals to retain some discretionary spending each month, which would deliver benefit to the regional and local economy.<\/p><p>Significant initiatives are available to the Government to help deal with the housing crisis but they require Government to have an open mind and need the Department of Finance to show latitude in terms of providing new innovative debt solutions to the domestic housing sector.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600040#UU00400","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1649252400,"counter":320,"content":"<p>It has been more than 30 years since homeownership peaked in Ireland.  In 1991, 80% of Irish people were homeowners, while private rental accounted for 8% and social rental stood at 10%.  At that time, there were 2,700 people registered as homeless.  The Ireland of today is vastly different to the Ireland of 1991.  There are more than 9,000 people classified as homeless and 67% of Irish people are homeowners.  While across Europe homeownership rates are increasing, in Ireland they are falling.  The age at which people apply for their first mortgage is increasing, largely due to the fact that the cost of renting is extortionate and the ability to save towards the cost of buying is diminishing more every year.  <\/p>  <p>  The cost of buying a home has soared by an average of 14% across the country.  The supply of affordable homes available for purchase is historically low.  The availability of rental properties is sparse, which leads to frightening rents being demanded. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has set a target to promote the construction of up to 400,000 houses over the next decade.  This averages 40,000 homes per year.  It is worth noting that this figure was announced before the need was identified to provide homes for Ukrainian refugees who have been forced to take up residence in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's figures are ambitious.  Are they even close to being realistic?  According to 20 of the country&rsquo;s top developers, the figures are far from realistic.  Their target is closer to 125,000 homes over the coming ten years, which is far removed from Government&rsquo;s aspirations.<\/p>  <p>  The reason for pessimism is that not enough land is zoned across the country for residential building.  Developers are describing the unavailability of fully serviced land for housebuilding as a crisis.  Combined with the spiralling cost of building materials, this adds another layer of crisis to the ever-escalating housing calamity.  <\/p>  <p>  The construction industry has expressed a view that it will run out of land in the next two to three years.  One leading developer has stated publicly that they may have to stop building houses completely for at least six years.  Yet housing must be provided.  Homes must be made available to meet the growing needs of Irish people and those who have made Ireland their new home. <\/p>  <p>  The solution to the crisis must lie, to a significant extent, in investing in renovating vacant properties.  Every city, town and village in the country has a number of vacant properties that could be renovated and refurbished to become family homes.  Across Ireland, there are more than 90,000 vacant properties.  In Tipperary alone, it is estimated there are up to 3,000 empty dwellings located across urban and rural areas.<\/p> <p>Some of these houses fell into disrepair after they were repossessed by lending institutions and left idle.  Some were left vacant after the passing of the owners.  There are endless reasons that a house can become vacant.  For the most part, these endless reasons provide significant opportunities to address the need to provide social housing or private homes.  These opportunities need to be examined as a matter of urgency.<\/p> <p> A time limit needs to be introduced on how long a property can be left in limbo at a time when people across the country are crying out for homes.  This should be coupled with low-interest loans for home buyers so as to make taking on a renovation project more appealing.  This is a vital incentive.  Without addressing this aspect of bringing vacant houses back into use, the idea will die before it ever has a chance to prove its worth.<\/p> <p> If the focus was switched away from acquiring high-cost serviced land to provide new build homes on the outskirts of cities, towns and villages, it would have multiple positive impacts.  Repurposing vacant houses in towns would help to revitalise town centres.  Apart from the obvious bonus of making them more attractive, population growth invariably leads to increased demand for services.  These services, such as shops, schools and high-speed broadband, not only meet the needs of newcomers to the community, but also improve day-to-day life for everyone in the area.  Rather than focusing attention on the almost impossible task of acquiring serviced land for new developments, incentives should be put in place for builders and tradesmen to turn vacant properties into family homes.  This, in turn, would create employment in the building sector.<\/p> <p> At the present time, we not only need to think outside the box, but to act as well.  There are options, there are solutions, and they should be put in place.  People need homes now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600040#UU00500","speaker":"1609","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649253000,"counter":322,"content":"<p>It is a fact that Ireland ranks tenth highest in the world in terms of the proportion of homes that are vacant.  Almost all of the concentration on finding solutions to our chronic shortage of accommodation has been centred on building new homes.  Although necessary, this takes a great amount of time and money.  For many years, there has been a considerable shortfall in the number of homes being built.  While the rate of construction has stepped up considerably, it will be a long time before supply catches up with demand, if it ever does.<\/p>  <p>  There are thousands upon thousands of habitable homes lying idle in our villages, towns and cities.  Many of them only need a little attention to bring them up to a standard where they can become homes for families.  Others only need an adjustment by the Government of the rules governing the fair deal scheme to see them made available on the rental market.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent GeoDirectory residential buildings report showed that there were more than 90,000 vacant dwellings across the country, with the bulk along the west coast.  More than one third of those vacant dwellings are located in counties Mayo, Donegal and Galway.  The census of population that is currently under way will give a good picture of vacancy rates throughout the country, but I do not see there being any improvement on the figures in the previous census.  For example, that census showed that there were 17,500 homes lying vacant in Galway city and county, or almost one in five of the total housing stock.  Although many of them were vacant holiday homes, there were still almost 14,000 habitable homes lying empty and unused.  I stress that these were not derelict buildings, but homes that could, with just a little attention in many cases, be perfectly suitable for families desperately seeking somewhere to live.  This shows that, even in the areas of highest housing demand, there is a large number of homes that are just waiting to accommodate families.<\/p>  <p>  Steps have been taken by many a Government to try to address the issue of vacant homes, but the success of those has been insignificant.  For instance, the vacant housing reuse strategy has failed to produce the hoped for results, making little impact on the overall numbers.  Recently, the Minister for Social Protection, who is also the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, confirmed a spend of more than &euro;18 million on 99 projects throughout the country under the town and village renewal scheme.  While the programme for Government is committed to an expansion of this scheme to bring vacant and derelict buildings back into use and promote residential occupancy, few if any of the projects to be supported will provide residential accommodation.  A far more ambitious programme is required to tackle the issue of vacant homes lying idle, which would have the added advantage of bringing new life to many rural communities.<\/p>  <p>  There are many excellent proposals contained in this Private Members' motion, which I wholeheartedly support.  One of them can make an immediate impact on the availability of accommodation.  Currently, anyone who moves into a nursing home under the fair deal scheme and rents out his or her own home has to pay 80% of any rental income towards the cost of his or her care.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has promised to exempt rental income from the assessment of means, which by his own estimation could release several thousand homes onto the rental market.  That is a large number of properties.  However, we are still waiting for it to happen.  It cannot come soon enough, as many of these homes are in turnkey condition and are ready for people to walk into overnight.<\/p>  <p>  Research carried out by a UK price comparison website, based on data from the OECD, put Ireland in the unenviable position of being the tenth worst in the world for vacant housing.  Tackling this issue and getting a substantial return does not have to cost a great deal of money.  It will not solve our country's chronic shortage of accommodation, but it could have a serious impact.  The well-thought-out proposals outlined in the motion would go a long way towards easing pressure on the accommodation market.  I urge the Government to support and implement them as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I compliment our administrator, Ms C&aacute;it Nic Amhlaoibh, on the tremendous amount of work she has done with us on getting the motion to the floor of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600041#VV00200","speaker":"1576"},{"type":"speech","time":1649253000,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute and I thank my colleagues in the Regional Group for tabling this motion before the House.  Over the past number of years, I have lost count of the amount of times I have raised the issue of vacant homes in my constituency of Louth.  You can walk through any residential area in Dundalk and be sure to see vacant homes.  It is clear that this is a problem in every county.<\/p>  <p>  In tabling this motion, we in the Regional Group want to highlight the problem while also offering real solutions to the Government.  The bottom line is that housing should be affordable and available.  Unfortunately, it is neither.  Since 2015, national house prices have risen by more than 35%.  In 2021 alone, prices rose by more than 14%.  This year, a survey has revealed that house prices are rising at &euro;100 per day.  To put that in context, that is more than &euro;36,000 in a year.  This is not sustainable.  When we look at rents, we see that they are 40% above the pre-crisis levels in Dublin and 20% higher in the rest of the country.  In my home town of Dundalk, house rents are simply out of reach for most families.<\/p>  <p>  In tabling this motion, we in the Regional Group want to highlight the potential that vacant properties, if developed properly, could have for tackling the housing crisis.  The GeoDirectory residential buildings report has highlighted that there are more than 90,000 vacant dwellings across the country and that more than 22,000 residential addresses are classified as derelict.  The Northern and Western Regional Assembly's latest report on regional vacancy and dereliction has shown that there are almost 45,000 empty residential and commercial properties in the west, north west and Border area.  Nearly three quarters of the towns and villages in the region have recorded a residential vacancy rate above the national average.<\/p>  <p>  Our motion also highlights the issues that the fair deal nursing home support scheme has created.  Every year, up to 4,500 people leave behind empty homes when they enter into long-term nursing home care, but only 400 of these homes are subsequently rented out.  The reason for this is simple.  The scheme charges an older person three separate times if he or she rents out his or her home.<\/p>  <p>  My colleagues in the Regional Group and I are looking for cross-party support for the motion.  We feel that it will offer real solutions to the housing crisis while bringing back into the stock the many thousands of vacant and derelict homes in our towns and villages.  We are calling on the Government to provide once and for all the necessary resources to regenerate the derelict and vacant properties in our towns, villages and cities.  We want a change to the repair-and-leasing scheme that is being operated by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage so as to remove the test for social housing in the area, which would immediately release additional housing for social needs and private renters.  We are also calling on the Government to provide a first-time buyer's grant of at least &euro;30,000 for the refurbishment of vacant and derelict houses.  We want an extension of the help-to-buy scheme to first-time buyers of second-hand and vacant homes.  We need to see the local authority home loan scheme being expanded to include refurbishment costs in addition to the purchase costs.  We need a Government-supported 0% loan scheme for retrofitting homes where the repayments are made through the utility companies in the form of reduced energy costs.<\/p> <p>We also need the Government to engage with the Irish League of Credit Unions to establish an interest-free loan scheme for home retrofitting.  The Government must look at incentivising the development of clustered bungalow housing close to services for our older generation, which would allow them to downsize and will in turn free up family homes.  We need to remove the financial barrier in the fair deal nursing home scheme to renting out a property which, again, would release vacant family homes in our towns, villages and cities.  We also call on the Government to review housing grant limits due to the dramatic rise in construction costs.<\/p> <p> The Government has consistently called on Members to engage with it and work together to help solve the housing crisis.  The Regional Group believes that our motion offers real solutions to the Government.  We are not trying to play party politics but only trying to offer real solutions to a very real problem.  I call on all Deputies to fully support our motion.  I look forward to working with each and every one of them in order  to find a solution.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State has been doing the rounds over the past number of weeks.  He visited County Louth last week.  When he hands a family the keys to a house, whether it is a social house, council house or whatever, he sees that there is nothing better and it is all families want.  I do not know what is going on with the Government at present but we should put more emphasis on building more houses.  As the Minister of State knows, we have a lot of land in County Louth that can be used to build houses.  I welcome that he came to County Louth last week.  I hope he spoke to those in the local authorities there and that he will come back again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600041#VV00300","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649253600,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for tabling this motion and the valuable contributions they have made in the process of doing so.  As set out in A Programme for Government: Our Shared Future, the Government believes that everybody should have access to good-quality housing to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard and located close to essential services, offering a high quality of life.  We understand that the provision of more affordable housing has a profound benefit socially and economically.  We believe the State has a fundamental role in enabling the delivery of new homes and ensuring that best use is made of existing stock.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss and debate these very important issues.<\/p>  <p>  We have now translated our programme for Government mission, Housing for All, into a strategic housing plan for Ireland, which is a radical one that sets out four pathways to a sustainable housing system.  The plan is backed by historic levels of investment in excess of &euro;20 billion through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency, LDA, and the Housing Finance Agency over the next five years.  The plan provides for an optimal mix of social, affordable and private housing for sale and rent.  The plan is underpinned by measures to support availability of the land, the workforce, the funding and the capacity to enable the public and private sectors to meet targets.<\/p>  <p>  The LDA has an immediate focus on managing the State&rsquo;s lands to develop new homes, the majority of which will be social and affordable homes.  The transfer of State lands to the LDA, with potential to produce 15,000 homes, is under way.  Work at two sites, St. Kevin&rsquo;s Hospital, Cork, and Shanganagh Castle, Dublin, will commence this year.  These sites will deliver a total of 861 social and affordable homes.  In addition, the LDA recently submitted a planning application for 977 social and affordable homes on the Central Mental Hospital site in Dundrum, with further planning applications on other sites to be submitted this month.  The LDA has also launched Project Tosaigh to accelerate delivery of 5,000 homes on non-State lands where planning permission has already been granted but not yet activated. The first delivery stream of this LDA initiative to bring privately developed units to market affordably and quickly will be launched later this year, targeting schemes in excess of 150 units per development in the greater Dublin area, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  The first of those homes, cost rental and affordable purchase, should be delivered towards the end of this year.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputies for raising the important issue of vacancy.  As they know, this issue is a priority for the Department and the Government.  It is why one of the four main pillars of Housing for All is solely dedicated to this issue.  At a time when supply of homes is a challenge, it is clear that every appropriate, available avenue must be exhausted.  Addressing vacancy by making the best use of our existing stock is crucial in light of the current housing crisis.  It is for those reasons that the Government has developed a multifaceted approach to addressing the issue.<\/p>  <p>  We are ensuring that robust, up-to-date data is available to understand the quantity, locations and characteristics of long-term vacant dwellings and the reasons they are vacant.  The most recent figures available from census 2016 indicate there were more than 183,000 vacant homes nationwide.  While this is a 20% reduction on figures reported in census 2011 of more than 230,000, we are nonetheless still not at a sustainable level for a properly functioning housing market.  The vacant property tax consideration being pursued by the Department of Finance includes the work under way through the current local property tax returns to assess present vacancy levels.  This forthcoming new data evidence base will underpin and inform the implementation of a range of policy initiatives in this area as outlined in Housing for All.<\/p>  <p>  An important area of innovation will be the new Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns fund initiative, which will be delivered by local authorities.  This funding stream will provide serviced sites for housing in towns and villages as well as supporting the refurbishment of vacant properties enabling people to live in towns and villages.  Other areas include utilising a new local authority-led programme to help local authorities buy or compulsorily purchase 2,500 vacant houses in their areas that can then be sold on the open market, which will ensure houses are brought back into use as homes.<\/p>  <p>  The Derelict Sites Act 1990 confers significant powers upon local authorities, including requiring owners or occupiers to take appropriate measures on derelict sites, acquiring derelict sites by agreement or compulsorily, and applying a derelict sites levy on sites.  My Department is continuing to engage with local authorities on the operation of the vacant site levy pending its replacement with the vacant property tax and, in particular, the derelict sites levy, to identify issues and challenges that have arisen in the operation of the two levies to date with the objective of improving their effectiveness.  In the meantime, local authorities are encouraged to continue to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas and to ensure more productive and effective enforcement of the provisions of the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  On the legislative front, the fair deal scheme has been reformed to remove disincentives for the sale of vacant properties.  Further reforms are being progressed by the Department of Health to remove the disincentive to the rental of vacant properties by participants in the fair deal scheme, which will be brought forward shortly.  In addition, the Planning and Development Act (Exempted Development) Regulations 2022 extends planning regulations that exempt certain vacant commercial properties, including over-the-shop spaces, from requiring planning permission for change of use for residential purposes to 2025, and includes vacant public houses within the scope of the regulations.<\/p>  <p>  All of the initiatives under Housing for All addressing vacancy will not only support housing but supply, which will be profoundly positive from a social and sustainability perspective, utilising existing space, re-imaging and regenerating vacant properties and cutting down on the volume of commuters, leading to cleaner air and less congested urban areas that will ultimately provide commuters and communities with greater vibrancy.  Addressing vacancy and the efficient use of existing stock makes sense on a number of levels and is of major importance to this Government.  Most importantly, addressing vacancy will provide homes to families and, in some cases, stock is within our reach.  It is imperative that we do so, even as we roll out record levels of new-build social and affordable homes over the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  The reuse of vacant properties will be a key criteria in future funding rounds for the rural regeneration and development fund and urban regeneration and development funds.  Utilising existing stock, and unlocking the potential for the reactivation of vacant and derelict home properties, will breathe new life into towns and villages, boosting schools, the local economy and local communities.  Coming at a time when blended working has been accelerated and the availability of access to high-quality broadband and remote work spaces is growing daily, such incentives as the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns fund are coming at precisely the right time to bolster this new approach to work-life in towns and villages.  Addressing vacancy, therefore, remains a significant element of Government policy.  When combined with the broader unprecedented level of Exchequer investment in housing in respect of &euro;4 billion in multi-annual funding, this will have a significant impact on putting the country on a sustainable path.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the difficulties faced by people in sourcing affordable homes to rent and buy.  These difficulties are not unique to Ireland and are experienced in many countries across the EU and further afield.  We are taking significant measures that will deliver and make a very real difference to affordability and quality of life in the everyday lives of our people.  The clearest demonstration of this commitment is the record State investment of &euro;4 billion that has been allocated to the housing programme for 2022, which is a 20% increase on 2021.<\/p> <p>In 2022, 11,800 social homes will be delivered, including 9,000 new-build homes.  The focus of this funding, is, therefore, very much on the delivery of construction of new social homes.  However, it is also important that the best use is made of existing vacant stock and Housing for All provides the clear pathway to addressing vacancy and efficient use of existing stock.  We will realise this potential and opportunity to increase residential development in cities and towns with a consequent emphasis on amenities and quality of life.<\/p> <p> Deputies have made valuable points in the debate.  Through Housing for All, we are ensuring that vacancy is reprioritised.  By the second quarter of this year, each of the 31 local authorities will have a full-time vacant homes officer to ensure that sufficient priority is given to it.  The Law Reform Commission is examining the compulsory purchase process and will report on it.<\/p> <p> I wish to make a point regarding the zoning of land.  We must get into activation.  We have a lot of zoned land already and a large number of vacant houses.  It is activation that we need now.  People should remember that in 2008 we had enough zoned land in the country to accommodate the growth of the population to 10 million.  No one could predict where the infrastructure would go.  We were left with a massive problem.  Now we need to focus on the activation of existing zoned land.  With the zoned land tax and the land value capture mechanism coming down the line, we are telling developers or people sitting on land that if they do not activate it there is a massive stick coming down the line.  First, we have to work with the carrot through the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme and providing funds to unlock viability.  We are working hard to try to ensure that people have sufficient housing stock ready and waiting for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600042#WW00200","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649254200,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I am pleased to be associated with today's motion by the Regional Group on derelict and vacant properties.  I reiterate our thanks to C&aacute;it, our administrator.<\/p>  <p>  On a leisurely walk through any town or city in Ireland one will find many derelict or vacant properties.  This is particularly the case in towns and city centres but it is also the position in rural areas.  These properties are owned by someone.  I fully support the rights of people to own private property.  However, we need to incentivise people who own a derelict property or a vacant site to do something beneficial with it, especially when we have a severe shortage of houses and an ever-increasing list of people looking for places to live, and a broken planning policy in the way of their ever becoming homeowners.  The motion states that the D&aacute;il recognises that \"the overarching goals of housing policy should be affordability, sustainability, equality and social inclusion\".  Affordability is clearly an issue for many people.  First-time buyers are being priced out of the market for various reasons.  One of those reasons is the dreadful practice of county councils trying to increase their stock of social housing by competing in the market with first-time buyers.  This practice is counterproductive and merely serves to make it more difficult for first-time buyers.<\/p>  <p>  The motion also recognises that \"Rebuilding Ireland failed to meet its annual target every year and was 41,000 units below its overall target\".  Unfortunately, this should really come as no surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to the way our planning laws are being applied or the way in which certain officials are implementing their own version of these laws.  In some cases, they are inventing rules of their own.<\/p>  <p>  The  Office of the Planning Regulator&rsquo;s role in curtailing and putting barriers in the way of housing development over a number of years must be highlighted.  What has happened in this regard must be corrected before the problem gets worse.  Every barrier put in the way of a house being built is just another straw to break the back of the struggling first-time buyer.  I appeal to the Minister to take his head out of the sand and deal with the issue.<\/p>  <p>  The motion notes that there are more than 90,000 vacant dwellings across the country.  Some 22,096 residential addresses have been classified as derelict.  Every year up to 4,500 people leave behind empty homes when they enter long-term nursing home care, yet just 400 of these homes are rented out as the fair deal nursing home support scheme charges an older person three separate times if they decide to rent out their home.   Government regulation is actively discouraging people from renting out their properties.  This is despite the fact that there is a rental crisis as a result of over-regulation and bureaucracy.  The bricks and mortar are there in many places. <\/p>  <p>  With those issues and others in mind, we are calling on the Government to do a number of things.  We need to provide the resources to regenerate derelict and vacant properties in cities, towns, and village as a major priority action and provide first-time buyer grants of &euro;30,000 for the refurbishment of vacant and derelict properties as homes.  Stimulating demand for derelict houses may encourage people to sell run-down properties they own but are not using.  This is especially so in light of the current cost of a new build and the difficulties in getting planning permission.   The motion also calls for reform of the fair deal nursing home scheme to remove the financial barrier to renting out a property.  This would release vacant family homes across our cities, towns, and rural areas for rent.  The fair deal nursing home scheme is a godsend to many people who, without it, would struggle to afford appropriate care for their loved ones, but it is not perfect.  Thousands of vacant properties lie idle because of the cost and bureaucracy associated with renting out a property under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In recent days I read with great disappointment a report about a family having to leave a Gaeltacht area due to difficulty in getting planning permission.  This happened on Inis Me&aacute;in.  If our planning laws are not made less onerous and restrictive, they will contribute to the death of rural Ireland, local parishes, rural GAA clubs and thousands of communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600043#XX00200","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1649254200,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I am delighted to speak on this very important motion on vacant and derelict housing.  I pay tribute to Deputy Denis Naughten and our group administrator, Ms C&aacute;it Nic Amhlaoibh, who did most of the heavy lifting in preparing the motion.<\/p>  <p>  I very much support the motion.  It provides a comprehensive and detailed blueprint.  I endorse all the recommendations it contains.  I will highlight three proposals in particular.  The first is one which the Minister of State highlighted, namely, that the Government should provide additional resources to tackle the issue of derelict houses.  I take his point but the case for investment alone is compelling.  From the Government perspective, it is one of minimum input and maximum return.  We are all practising Deputies here.  We are members of a constructive Opposition.  We recognise that there are finite resources in the country.  However, every euro put into a derelict house will return five times the amount.<\/p>  <p>  Second, expanding the existing local authority home loan scheme is extremely important, in particular for those with poor credit ratings or low-income households which do not have access to normal banking finance.  Introducing a 0% home retrofit loan scheme is also a key component.  The Government should engage with the credit union movement.  Everyone in the House will be familiar with the movement.  It is actively seeking greater community financing options.  It is totally on board with this.  Any influence the Minister of State can bring to bear in respect of that proposal would be greatly appreciated.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State appreciates that housing is a very important and emotive political issue in the country at the moment, and for good reason.  If you are not adequately housed, you cannot progress professionally or personally.  You are always looking over your shoulder when you are precariously housed and you cannot really develop.  It is particularly acute now with the influx of Ukrainian refugees, although it is no fault of theirs.  Up to Easter, an expected 30,000 Ukrainians will have come here.  That imposes a massive problem on top of an existing one.  As with most issues and problems, however, the solution is often under our nose.  Vacant and derelict housing is a perfect example.  The Minister of State gave a statistic that there were 183,000 vacant properties nationwide according to the previous census.  That is staggering.  That is six years of housing supply if we can get it reactivated and back on the market.  Renovation is the cheapest way to build a house in terms of cost and from a carbon perspective.<\/p>  <p>  I will conclude by mentioning a housing crisis within the housing crisis.  The military housing crisis is especially acute in my constituency, Kildare South.  Its origins are clear.  Some 25 years ago, our Defence Forces had more personnel.  In the intervening period, successive Government have closed almost half the military installations across the country.  That has caused a military housing crisis.<\/p> <p>We now have troops commuting hundreds of kilometres every day and they cannot afford to put fuel in their vehicles. It is especially acute in the Curragh Camp.  I am not sure how familiar the Minister of State is with the Curragh but he would be most welcome at any time and I would be happy to show him around.  There are more than 50 houses lying derelict in the camp.  It is completely unacceptable.  They are boarded up.  We are familiar with dereliction in every town in Ireland but some of it can be explained as the bank owning the house, or a house being in receivership or awaiting probate.  However, these more than 50 houses in the Curragh are all publicly owned, which is staggering.  They are owned by the Department of Defence.  The Department says it is not its core function to provide housing.  I argue against that.  If its core function is to provide for the defence and security of the country then it is appropriate that it looks after military families as well.  To be fair to the Minister of State's Department, while I accept it should be in the lead in responding to the housing crisis, it should not be exclusively so.  Every Government Department should play a supporting role and try to address this issue.  I am not sure what the Minister of State's own thoughts are on this but there is room here for an AHB to go to the Department of Defence and offer to take the houses if the Department is happy to offload them and have the housing body provide them to military families on military land.  It makes sense as well because it would take military families off the social housing lists and free them up for other families based in garrison towns around the country.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, I very much welcome and support this motion.  It is very comprehensive and detailed and is a blueprint for addressing the vacant and derelict housing crisis in this country, and in turn assists in tackling the larger housing crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600043#XX00300","speaker":"1587","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649254800,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete the following words:<br \/><br \/>&quot;&mdash;extend the Help to Buy scheme to first-time buyers of second hand and vacant properties;&quot; <\/blockquote>  <p>I thank the Regional Group of Independents for bringing forward this motion.  It is a very timely motion.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in welcome any opportunity to contribute to a debate about vacant homes and how we need to do better on being in a position to return them to use.<\/p><p>GeoDirectory indicates there are around 90,000 vacant properties across the State.  This is a scandal.  No-one would come into the House and say anything else other than that this is an absolute scandal.  It is evidence the Government schemes have not worked.  Whatever has been done to date has not worked and 90,000 vacant properties indicate this.  We must do much better in this regard.  We know that when it comes to refurbishing and bringing homes back to life, or whatever word you want to put on it, this approach is much more environmentally-friendly than building from scratch.  We all know this and need to be conscious of it.  It is also cheaper than building from scratch.  I do not understand why more cannot be done.  The Minister of State spoke about the need for activation.  There is a real need for activation, that is, for every single lever the Government has at its disposal to be pulled.  Every single opportunity to house a family that needs a home should be taken.  In our alternative budget, Sinn F&eacute;in allocated 20% of our public housing target to be delivered via vacant homes.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in broadly supports the motion before us this afternoon.  The amendment we have put down is intended to be a friendly one.  We understand the recommendation to extend the help-to-buy scheme to second hand and vacant homes is very well-intentioned but we cannot support it.  Help-to-buy as it currently stands is inflationary.  It increases house prices.  This is clear when you look at the house price inflation taking place across the State.  The latest CSO figures show house prices have increased by 14.8%.  Prices in Dublin are rising by 13.3%.  I am conscious of how anyone who is struggling to save up to get their first home - I do not use the awful phrase &quot;getting onto the property ladder&quot; as it is no more a ladder than I am the man in the moon - might feel when hearing of 13.3% rise in prices in Dublin and a 14.8% rise nationally.  House price inflation is astronomical at this stage.  The Border regions continue to experience extreme house price inflation of up to 24.7%.  Extending the help-to-buy scheme will only add to these inflationary figures and therefore we cannot support this point.  We also have some concern about the first-time buyer grants of &euro;30,000 for the refurbishment of vacant and derelict properties.  Again, I understand the motivation behind this measure but I have concerns about how it would work in practice.  How would it be ensured the &euro;30,000 is not just swallowed up and then added on to the selling price, which would again crease the people who are trying to buy their first homes?  Would this be the maximum amount available?  Would smaller grants be available?  How would it be ensured the grants are tailored to households that really need them?  As I have said, the amendment we have put down is intended to be a friendly one but we have some questions and concerns.<\/p><p>I referred to my next point a few minutes ago.  The Minister of State talked about the need for activation and in the minute and 20 seconds remaining to me I raise an issue I have raised with the senior Minister in the Department, the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach, the Department of Health and the HSE.  It is grand for the Minister of State to talk about activation but actually doing it would bring into use12 homes in my area that are vitally needed.  There are 12 units at the entrance to St. Ita's Hospital.  They are in the ownership of the HSE and have been vacant for some time.  I understand the HSE is amenable to leasing the units to the council for a nominal fee.  The council, it appears, is not hostile to developing these 12 units.  I raised this in the previous D&aacute;il with the Department of Health so it is perhaps five years since I first raised it.  It seems no progress can be made.  I urge the Minister of State to look at the St. Ita's site and the potential to bring 12 homes back into use.  It would be significantly cheaper than knocking them and rebuilding and there is a real need for housing in my area.  The Minister of State's Department and the council have discussed the capital assistance scheme, CAS, potentially being useful.  That would be a good point to start with but I ask the Minister of State to take a look at this and put the word &quot;activation&quot; into active use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600044#YY00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1649254800,"counter":331,"content":"<p>The number of vacant properties across the State is staggering.  As this motion from the Regional Group of Independents states, there are 90,000 vacant dwellings across the country.  Some of this stock of dwellings could, and should, be used to address some of the issues around our housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  In my home country of Limerick there are 4,000 vacant properties.  These range from dwellings to office buildings that are being allowed to fall into disrepair.  While we have a vacant site levy, the collection of it is haphazard.  In response to a parliamentary question I asked in January, it was confirmed that in Limerick there was almost &euro;1 million outstanding in vacant site levies over a two-year period.  It is extremely disappointing these properties are not made available for use.  It is astounding that when they are left vacant there is no urgency to collecting the amounts owed.  In contrast, if a council tenant ends up in arrears on his or her rent the local council energetically pursues him or her to ensure the owed money is rightly paid.<\/p>  <p>  My office deals daily with people desperate to be housed.  They often live in overcrowded, small homes with multiple generations of the family living cheek by jowl.  I am also contacted quite frequently by those living adjacent to vacant sites or boarded-up homes.  Disuse of these dwellings creates negative conditions for those who live next to them.  In my experience, the longer a site is vacant the greater the chance of illegal dumping, vermin infestation and structural damage to the adjacent homes.  It is simply not fair to those living next to them.  Your home is your refuge and your safe place and something that, in the main, people take great pride in.<\/p>  <p>  In February I joined the derelict site walking tour of Limerick City.  It was a cross-party, non-party event where we visited several vacant sites within the city.  These sites ranged from former office buildings to vacant houses and apartments.  One of the locations we visited was the Watergate Flats complex in the heart of the city centre.  This is an apartment complex with 100 units.  The locals who live there are angry and frustrated and tell me at least six of these flats are boarded up and vacant and have been idle for a number of years.  Many are ready to be let and are sitting empty.  Across Limerick there are many other dwellings that could be refurbished and made available, yet they also remain idle.<\/p>  <p>  National house prices are rising by an average of 7% per year.  Those who allow sites to lie vacant are profiting while our people are desperate.  Those who leave properties vacant must be pursued vigorously to show the levies owed are collected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600044#YY00300","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1649254800,"counter":332,"content":"<p>Last month one of the local papers, The Connaught Tribune, reported there were 7,500 vacant properties across Galway.

Why, after more than a decade of a housing crisis, can we not say with certainty what the figure for vacant properties across this State actually is?

I often raise this with the local authorities in my area when trying to find out the exact number of vacant properties but they find it difficult to tell me.

Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling for long time for a vacant property levy to disincentivise speculative vacancy and I am glad the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is finally on board with this.  It is morally wrong, in the middle of a housing crisis, that the Government allows property owners to leave homes sitting vacant.  It is unbelievable that this practice has been allowed to continue for so long.  Our concern, however, is that the Government may wait until budget 2023 to introduce this tax, which could mean that it will not come into practice for another year or possibly two.  We need assurances that this tax will be introduced urgently and it must be punitive if it is to have any real impact.  However, that will not solve the crisis.

The difference is that in the inner city, Dublin City Council is responsible for these empty homes.  A short walk from here I could show the Minister ten empty flats that are boarded up.  That is ten homes that could house people in homelessness or in overcrowded or unsafe conditions.  Dublin City Council flats can be empty for months.  There needs to be a speedier process to reactivate the flats.  In some cases, flats are empty for nearly a year.<\/p>  <p>  Some flats are empty while plans are put in place for regeneration or redevelopment but the process of redeveloping flats is tortuously slow and as a consequence, homes are left empty for a very long time.  One development that is a five-minute walk from here on Fenian Street is a very good example.  The council met residents of St. Andrew's Court three or four years ago and put proposals to them for redevelopment.  It is a big redevelopment plan and while people were concerned and anxious about it, generally it was welcomed.  People were happy that public housing would be built on public land.  However, the process is absolutely crawling and the homes at St. Andrew's Court have been empty for years.  Approximately 15 flats are just sitting there, empty and the project is only at the design team stage.  <\/p>  <p>  Pearse House residents are also facing a regeneration scheme but if it is going to take as long as St. Andrew's Court, it will be a disaster for residents living in the inner city who are under huge pressure and in desperate need of housing.

People who are living in horrendous conditions are looking at flats that are boarded up, empty and derelict.  The turnaround of voids and the process for the regeneration of flat complexes such as Pearse House and St. Andrew's Court needs to be fast-tracked.  If it is not fast-tracked, it amounts to neglect of the residents who are living in accommodation that nobody in 2022 should be expected to live in.  It is often said that Pearse House is a beautifully built art deco building and, indeed, the architecture is lovely but for people having to live there, it is a sentence.  That is just not acceptable and it must be changed.  Redevelopment must be fast-tracked.

There is significant dereliction in every small town.  Houses are lying empty and shops, pubs and other business premises in once-thriving communities are dying on their feet because of the changes in how people conduct their commerce.  They now shop in big towns and so on.  We have a huge problem with that in the private sector and a carrot-and-stick approach is needed to resolve it.  The problem for a lot of the people who own these properties is that they are not really assets but liabilities, often inherited, and they do not know what to do with them.  Something needs to be done to assist people with that particular problem.  The other side of it is that there are people who sit on properties and do not, or will not, develop them.  That is also an enormous problem.  We must try to get the balance right.  We need to do something that will provide housing for people and, in doing so, we will also provide work.  We need to get all of this right.  Of course, I recognise that some advancements have been made, particularly with the grant aid scheme that is now in place to properly insulate homes, regenerate them and bring them back into use.  All of those measures are positive but, unfortunately, people still have to get into debt to do it and that is a big issue for a lot of people who own property.<\/p>  <p>  The other side of this relates to the local authorities.<\/p> <p>Throughout my constituency in counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon there are issues with empty local authority houses and properties.  The local authorities are taking a long time to bring them back into use in order that people can live in them again.  Much of that is down to funding and so on.  In the past, local authorities had large teams who would carry out that type of work.  When a house became vacant, the local authorities had staff to do the work to bring them back into use, but that no longer happens.  Currently, properties are placed on a list and a contractor is employed to do the work, but a contractor will not be called in to refurbish only one house.  The local authorities wait until ten or 15 houses become vacant before employing a contractor, which means a house could lie empty for a year or up to two years in some areas.  There needs to be a re-examination of that policy.  Some might suggest that the old system was wasteful and that it is more efficient to do the work via a contractor, but the length of time houses remain empty dispels that argument.  We clearly need to return to a situation where local authorities can employ people directly to do that work.  I hope that will be one of the proposals considered in respect of this issue. <\/p> <p> The buy and renew scheme, which allows councils to buy old properties and bring them back into use, needs to be rolled out across the board, in particular in our town centres and small urban areas and rural towns.  We need to get those types of properties back into use and to get people living in town centres again.  That is vital.  If the correct funding is put in place for local authorities to do that, it would make a huge difference.  <\/p> <p> The vacant homes tax is a measure that is required in a lot of areas to try to get properties back into use.  People will sit on and do nothing with them, but if they are incentivised to bring them back into use or to move them on or otherwise be hit with a tax bill that would put the pressure on.  Everything that can be done to get people homes needs to be done.  As we know, thousands of people are coming here from the Ukraine.  They are very welcome.  People here are trying to accommodate them in their homes and in other houses, some of which are properties that have not been used in the past.  There is also a huge problem here with people not being able to afford to buy or rent a home or to find a home in any circumstances.  We need to recognise that and ensure that we put every effort into providing houses for our people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600045#ZZ00400","speaker":"1607","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649256000,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I support the motion.  I wish to refer to Question No. 688, which I tabled on 5 April to the Minister for Health, in which I asked him if he would report on the Housing for All plan for an amended fair deal scheme to remove disincentives for sale and rental of vacant properties.  The question was answered by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tMy Department is actively collaborating with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and other Departments in the development of a mechanism in relation to the rental of vacant properties &quot;in a way that is targeted, equitable, evidence-based and provides appropriate safeguards for vulnerable older people&quot;, as committed to in Housing for All action 19.8.  Complex policy questions are currently being resolved in order to meet these criteria and mitigate the high risks and costs associated with unintended consequences, with a view to introducing legislation as soon as possible once this is complete.  I expect to be in a position to bring legislation forward in the coming months. <\/blockquote>  <p>When we receive these replies, we try to dig into the language of what they mean.  I take some solace that where the Minister states, &quot;I expect to be in a position to bring legislation forward in the coming months&quot;, she means what she says in that regard.  There is a legitimate expectation on the part of Members and the public that this legislation would be promulgated as soon as possible for the simple reason that there are so many houses out there that are vacant as a result of people being in nursing homes or participants on an elder care scheme or the nursing homes support scheme.  I ask that some urgency be given to that legislation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, in responding to the motion might give us some sense of a timeline for when that legislation might be brought before us.<\/p><p>The language used in replies to parliamentary questions is sometimes quite dense.  As outlined above, the reply states, &quot;Complex policy questions are currently being resolved in order to meet these criteria and mitigate the high risks and costs associated with unintended consequences...&quot;.  I have a sense of what that might mean, but I would prefer clarity on what exactly it means and on the stumbling blocks to that happening.  If that hurdle was jumped and the legislation was brought before us, it would create a supply line of houses for many people.  That seems to be low-hanging fruit.  Within our constituencies, we all see the evidence of vacant homes as a result of people being in nursing homes through the nursing homes support scheme.  If Government could do that one thing as an early win, perhaps before the end of this year, it would release a lot of houses for people to live in.  Ultimately, the motion is about getting people into houses.  <\/p><p>I agree with the spirit of the motion and the request for urgency.  If the sense of urgency that we applied to the Covid response, where we acted collaboratively, was applied to the getting the supply of housing in this country sorted, the Government would find itself pushing an open door.  It would take a lot of the political heat and rhetoric out of the issue.  It would also take a lot of the personalities and the egos out of it.  In terms of some of the egos that have informed this debate, it is a little bit unedifying, especially when we are trying to provide housing for people who genuinely need it.  If that same sense of urgency was applied to this issue, the Government would be pushing an open door with many Deputies across the House.  If appropriate, I would like a specific response to the query that I have raised in respect of the nursing homes scenario because that has come up time and again in this motion.  If is an overarching theme of this motion.  If we could get a real response to that, we would be very grateful.<\/p><p>As of November 2020, there were 61,880 households on the social housing waiting lists.  Those are the latest figures we have, but there may be updated figures.  The Minister of State and I know that much of our work in constituencies is around advocating for people to access local authority housing.  There are unintended consequences of being on a list for those in private rented accommodation.  More people are coming to us stating that their rental agreements are coming to an end or that their landlord is selling the property.  Many accidental landlords are getting out of the market and that is having an untold knock-on effect.  It is not just about a lack of housing supply; it is the other stressor that creates within families as a result of not having the security or fixity of tenure that was so often a staple of political discourse in this country long before even this House was established.  The idea of fixity of rent and fixity of tenure, security and a roof over one's head are fundamental principles embedded in the Irish psyche.  <\/p><p>I do not want to be negative.  I am trying to be proactive and progressive in seeking to support the Government when the Government is worthy of support.  I sense from the answer I received to my question on the nursing homes support scheme and the already stated policy of seeking to let into the market those houses or to provide a supply of houses, is that urgency is not there and there are too many technocratic and bureaucratic impediments in the way of doing that.  I hope those hurdles can be jumped so that we can release this supply of houses.  There needs to be greater urgency.  Every Deputy and Senator across the political divide is solution-driven and wants to see that supply.<\/p> <p>We will do everything we can within our constituencies to facilitate that supply.  However, there needs to be a top-down approach.  Arguably, the policy is moving too slowly.  I say that respectfully.  Fine Gael has been in government for quite a long time.  The Government of which the Labour Party was a part between 2011 and 2016 did not have money to build houses.  We had to make stark choices.  At the latter end of 2015 and in 2016, we made moneys available for house building but we have not seen the throughput of supply since 2016.  It is high time we built more houses in this country and sorted out this problem.  The money is there, as are the willingness and impetus to do the work.  We need to see greater Government action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600046#AAA00200","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649256600,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I thank the Regional Group for bringing forward this motion, which I broadly support.  The motion addresses the relevant issue of vacant properties.  I will make one comment on the motion that I mean in a constructive sense.  The motion proposes a long list of incentives and measures but it omits other measures that we know from international experience are effective in dealing with vacancy, such as a tax on vacant buildings and vacant homes that are not put into use.  We also need those sorts of measures.<\/p>  <p>  I am fully aware that many people who own vacant properties do not have the resources, wherewithal or finances to renovate, refurbish and retrofit them and so forth.  However, the context is that there are almost 10,000 people living in emergency accommodation.  There are 120,000 people on social housing waiting lists and living in insecure housing assisting payment, HAP, tenancies.  We cannot tolerate a situation where there are more than 90,000 vacant homes in this country.  We must apply a range of measures.  <\/p>  <p>  Every building that is built benefits from public investment in infrastructure and a societal investment.  Those buildings cannot be left to lie idle.  They cannot be wasted, year after year.  There should be more supports in place but if people who own vacant properties do not have the means to deal with the issue, the appropriate thing is for them to sell the property in order that it can be put into use.  Measures are needed in that regard.  We need to disincentivise holding onto vacant buildings.<\/p>  <p>  The GeoDirectory report gives the most up-to-date figures on vacancy.  It said that in quarter 2 of 2021, there were 92,135 vacant homes.  In addition, there were 22,754 derelict homes and 28,756 vacant commercial buildings.  These figures are much lower than those from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, but they are more up to date.  It is worth noting that the GeoDirectory figures only consider homes that no longer accept post as being vacant.  That is how it defines vacancy.  It does not separately count apartments in buildings with fewer than five apartments.<\/p>  <p>  Vacancy, as we all know, is a terrible waste.  It sends a terrible message to the thousands of people struggling without a home and to those paying high rents who are struggling to keep a home.  Those things have impacts on people's mental health and on communities and their well-being.  It is a problem across Ireland.  It is a significant problem in rural areas but we also know from the CSO that 64% of vacant homes, according to the 2016 census, were in urban areas.  There is a particular problem with vacancy in town centres.  The Heritage Council, in its land use survey, found a vacancy rate in Tralee, for example, of 25%.  The figure for Tipperary town was 31%.  These are shockingly high ground-floor vacancy rates.  It is a shocking level of wastage.  <\/p>  <p>  Not only do we have a housing crisis, we also have a climate change crisis and we must address both.  Addressing vacancy is part of the solution.  There is an urgency to this matter.  I do not need to tell the Minister of State because he knows that to be the case.  We have no time to wait to address the climate change crisis.  It is now or never, as was stated by the most recent report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  If we do not take urgent action now, it will be impossible to limit temperature rises to 1.5&deg;C, which will have catastrophic effects.  However, we still do not see urgency from the Government to tackle vacancy.  We do not see the vacant homes tax that is needed, and which was needed yesterday.  We have a housing crisis and a climate crisis.  We are wasting these vacant buildings containing embodied carbon and yet this Government is not bringing in a tax on vacant homes.  Why not?  Where is it?  Why has it not been brought in?  How can the Government justify not doing so in the face of the climate and housing emergencies?<\/p>  <p>  We know in respect of embodied carbon and the construction industry that 11% of global emissions are associated with upfront embodied CO2 emissions from new construction.  That is a significant amount of global emissions.  According to the Irish Green Building Council, carbon emissions from the construction process in Ireland account for 11% of our annual carbon emissions.  That is a sizeable figure.  Some 50 tonnes of carbon emissions can be generated when new homes are built, compared to 15 tonnes when existing homes are refurbished.  According to World Habitat, in most houses it can take more than 50 years for operational energy use to balance out the emissions created in their construction.  Demolition and construction created 8.8 million tonnes of waste in Ireland in 2019, accounting for 63% of the waste generated, which is a considerable proportion.  Only 6.8% was recycled and very little was reused.  <\/p>  <p>  We know that the most sustainable building is always an existing building.  Despite this, we have no regulations regarding embedded carbon in buildings and no definitive plans in that regard.  While the Government is bringing forward a welcome Bill on circularity and reuse, it includes an incredible exemption for construction and demolition waste so it will not be levied if it goes to landfill or incineration.  The Minister of State knows we have a climate crisis.  How can he justify those measures and their massive impact on the environment?  Those measures also impact people who need housing.  This is not in any way tolerable.<\/p>  <p>  Excellent work is being done by Ms Jude Sherry and Dr. Frank O'Connor in Anois.  Not only are they highlighting vacancy and dereliction but they are also highlighting meanwhile use and what can be done in that regard.  They have an excellent report on the topic and I recommend that the Minister of State reads it.  In the report, they share good examples of meanwhile use from Amsterdam, Glasgow, Denmark, Italy and other countries, and they outline how important that is to reduce vacancy, to get life back into town centres and to provide space for the arts, culture and communities.  They point out, quite correctly, that it was a meanwhile use approach that made Temple Bar take off years ago and put vibrancy back into the area.<\/p>  <p>  We have an issue with ground-floor vacancy in newer developments, those built over the past ten to 15 years.  There has been a lack of action in that regard.  Those vacant properties need to be brought into meanwhile use to bring life back into those areas.  We need to be looking at the good example of Scotland where the town centre empty homes project is a hybrid of grants and loans that brings vacant buildings back into use for affordable housing, either to rent or buy.  The incentives around vacancy introduced by this Government are not fully aligned with affordability like they are in Scotland.<\/p>  <p>  We urgently need the vacant homes tax now.  We need the Derelict Sites Act and compulsory purchase order powers to be used to their full extent.  We also need to bring in measures such as compulsory sales orders and compulsory rental orders in order that all our stock is brought into full use to address our housing crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600047#BBB00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1649256600,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I thank the Regional Group for bringing forward this motion on an incredibly important subject, that is, the frankly scandalous situation around vacant and derelict properties and vacant sites that could be used to address the severe and disastrous housing and homelessness crisis we are facing.

Now, a crisis that has existed for nearly a decade, which we have not addressed, of housing and homelessness is being compounded by our need to show solidarity with people fleeing the bloody war in Ukraine, which we absolutely must do.  Now has to be the moment to do things that are unprecedented.  Those measures have to solve the accommodation crisis, both for those affected by the ongoing housing emergency and homelessness crisis and the people fleeing Ukraine.  Unless we address the issue of vacant and derelict property in a seriously radical way, we are not going to be able to do that in the necessary timeframe.<br\/><br\/>It is important for us to remember the human side of this and why it is so urgent.  This is an email I got in the last couple of days but I could read out dozens and dozens just from the last week or two.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>\tI am a public servant in the HSE.  I ended up homeless, sleeping in my car.  I got zero help from my county council.  [I will not name the council or the employer so we do not identify the worker but it was a rural county council.]  None.  What happened to make me homeless was I had two deaths in my family.  I left the family home and ended up paying all my wages for a while in a hotel and getting loans to stay in hotels.  I ended up in severe money debt and had to sleep in my car.  Not one ounce of help from the council.  They knew I was sleeping in my car.  I was going to work.  I begged the council to help me.  Nothing.  I begged them to pay some for the hotel.  I did not even get a reply to that.  It is disgusting what is going on here.  I am now living in a shed with no washing machine or cooker.  It is damp, with rodents.  I am public servant in the HSE so God help anybody who has no job. <\/blockquote> <p>This week, I am dealing with the case of another healthcare worker who works in a Dublin hospital.  His wife cries to me on the phone as she sits in a park with her three kids while her husband is doing 12-hour shifts in a Dublin hospital, where he has worked throughout Covid.  There is nothing for them.  Their kids go to school in Shankill and Ballybrack and they were told to go to a place in Kilmainham, on the South Circular Road.  That is all that was available to them.  A council worker in my area is sleeping in his car.  Another family are sleeping in a shed in a relative's back garden.  I could go on.<br\/><br\/>Simultaneously, as I have been highlighting for the last four years, right across from my office there are 15 empty apartments in the hands of a vulture fund, which is trying to evict the five remaining tenants.  They have been empty for two years.  That is allowed to happen.  I have told three or four Governments, at this stage, that we need to do something about this.  The State should have the power to take those apartments and house the people who need them.  A few years ago we highlighted a derelict site at the end of York Road, near D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It has been sitting there for years, derelict.  Dozens of houses could be put on it.  The owners now owe &euro;140,000.  That is only because we highlighted it and it was put on the vacant sites register.  They owe &euro;140,000, which they have not paid.  The amount that has been paid for the 91,000 vacant sites all across the country is pitiful.  We are not collecting this money.  Recently, because we highlighted this, the owners of the site fixed the place up a bit and put in for planning permission.  However, we discovered the company that owns it is registered in the Caribbean.  They are only fixing it up and applying for planning permission in order to stave off action over its dereliction.  This stuff is going on everywhere.  Our main street in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is littered with empty buildings.  Some are in private hands and some are in public hands.  There is a place called Kelly's Hotel on George's Place in D&uacute;n Laoghaire which, just as it sounds like, used to be a hotel.  It is owned by the council and has been sitting there for as long as I can remember - a decade, at least.  We need a women's refuge.  We need places for the homeless families in sheds and those being sent to the other side of the city and it is sitting there empty in public hands.  I could go on.<br\/><br\/>This has to stop.  This is the moment to take emergency measures, and that means short-circuiting property rights.  Let us call a spade a spade.  This cannot be allowed to stand.  We do not even need a referendum to make this happen because the Constitution allows for the common good to override property rights and the common good is clearly served by ending the utter scandal of workers and families and kids in sheds, sleeping in cars, or being sent to emergency accommodation on the other side of the city where they could not possibly hope to get their kids to school in the morning.  We passed a referendum on children's rights and we are doing this to kids.  More than 2,000 kids are homeless, and the number is rising again.  Their rights surely override the rights of speculators to sit on empty property, or vulture funds in the case of St. Helen's Court, or the rights of owners of derelict buildings.  Dunnes Stores owns a site right in the middle of D&uacute;n Laoghaire that has been derelict for years.  It is an absolute scandal.  We need action.  The State should be able to say to the owners of these sites that if they do not have a good excuse for something being derelict or vacant for more than six months, it will take it off them.  It can then refurbish them and put people who need housing and have a right to it, whose rights are being abused and breached by not being provided with as basic a thing as a secure roof over their heads, into those properties.  I do not know how any people can call themselves a government if they cannot do that for people when the physical properties and sites are there.  We do not even count the derelict ones.  In the census currently being conducted, and in the previous one, we did not even count the derelict sites.  We need teams to be sent out from every local authority across the country to count these sites.  We must insist they are brought back into use regardless of the impact on the property owners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600047#BBB00500","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649257200,"counter":345,"content":"<p>The number of vacant dwellings in Ireland stood at 90,158 last year, according to the residential building report.  The housing situation in Ireland has been at crisis point for too many years.  We need a different plan and a different strategy that actually works.  Every single day, my office is blinded by the number of people being made homeless and the number living in squalor.  My clinics, which are held on every Friday and Saturday, are bombarded with people looking for homes.  I sometimes have up to 50 house queries a week, many of them from people facing homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  There are also huge difficulties when people build on a greenfield site.  I know a young family in west Cork with a very sick child.  They have moved into their lovely new home but are waiting since last December for a postcode.  Such codology.  They cannot get a phone or broadband because they have not got a postcode.  Imagine moving into a new home and waiting months for that.  They are now being told it could be May before they get a postcode.  In the name of God, anyone can go on Google Maps, get the co-ordinates, put them into a computer and send out the Eircode postcode.  It should be given automatically once planning is granted.  The fact that this is stopping people getting a phone connection is beyond a farce.<\/p>  <p>  That is only the start of the problems with planning.  People are being turned down left, right and centre for the most ridiculous reasons.  I do not have time to go through them all but sometimes I think there is a negative mindset among the authorities, totally opposed to giving a start to any young person who applies for planning permission in rural Ireland.  I went out to see a site in west Cork last weekend that was going to be refused planning permission.  The application was withdrawn before it was refused.  One of the reports said it only had 170 m viewing left and right.  I walked 250 m both sides and there was still another 150 m so I do not know what is going on with the planning authority making a decision like that.  This was a young man trying to get his life up and running and he cannot do that.

The charge for any house built in rural areas outside the towns and villages is worked out by square foot.  Down at the bottom of that price is stated what one is paying for, including the local library, the footpaths, roads and lighting, none of which apply to a person living in a rural area.  That is still included to show what is being paid for.  The minimum cost for building a house in a rural area in planning permission fees is about &euro;5,000 for an average-sized house.  That money is going to the Government for footpaths, lights and libraries.  The Government has closed down all those amenities and taken them away from us but it is charging us for them in local authority fees.  How laughable is that?  The Government is talking about building houses.  These are the people who are not putting their names on the housing lists; these are people who want to build their own houses, put in septic tanks on their land and build with their own money that they will borrow up to the hilt for.

I have long been speaking about the devastating effects of dereliction and vacant housing on our towns and cities and the potential they hold in addressing the devastating housing crisis in this country.  I have, in the past, called for a public housing programme led by local authorities, with a view to addressing dereliction and vacant housing, and I wish to call for this again.  In my constituency of Donegal, 7,700 houses are vacant.  That is about 10% of the overall housing stock in the county, which is a shocking percentage.  At the same time, there are 2,646 families on the housing list in the county.  If we were to truly and properly invest in vacant housing we would be able to house those families almost three times over.  It seems like the most logical solution to the problem, yet this Government fails to take necessary action on it.  Instead it does nothing to address the long housing lists or to address the fact that both the housing and rental markets have spiralled completely out of control.  It will also do nothing about the fact that as of February of this year, 2,667 children in this country were in emergency accommodation.  This is something that should cause us great shame and that should drive us to immediate action.  It should not paralyse us into complete inaction and uselessness, which seems to be the effect it has had on the three Government parties<\/p><p>.  Something needs to change.  We need to move away from failed Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il housing policies.  A new approach is needed fast.  We need the introduction of at least a 10% tax on vacant and derelict properties and the Derelict Sites Act 1990 should be used properly to activate vacant or unused sites around the country.  One of the problems is that most property owned in towns and villages around the country is owned by people with no tax liabilities.  There is a constant focus on tax breaks in order to encourage the development of these properties but this completely fails because they are all owned by elderly people who do not have a tax liability and who will not benefit from them in the first place.  The derelict sites levy and the Derelict Sites Act 1990 are woefully underused and have clearly not been effective.<\/p><p>At the beginning of the year it was revealed that almost &euro;20 million in vacant and derelict site levies owed to Dublin City Council remained outstanding.  This is an incredible amount and it demonstrates the amount owed in Dublin alone.  Can the Minister of State imagine how much would be owed nationwide?  This is especially because the total number of vacant properties in the northern and western region amounted to more than 44,000 properties, with an incredible 72% of towns and villages in this region recording a residential vacancy rate above the national average.  In County Donegal in 2020, Bundoran, Ballybofey, Stranorlar, Donegal town, Glenties, Killybegs and Letterkenny all recorded above-average residential vacancy and dereliction rates, with a total of 366 residential dwellings classified as either vacant or derelict in Letterkenny alone.<\/p><p>This just shows how ineffective the Derelict Sites Act 1990 and the derelict sites levy have been and far more needs to be done to address this.  In the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage&rsquo;s Housing for All plan, there were suggestions that there may be a vacant property tax in the future.  This housing crisis cannot wait.  We cannot continue to kick the can down the road in the hope that one day, things will get better when we have been given every indication that things will only get worse.  It is time to take decisive action on this untapped supply of housing.  Drastic measures are needed.  The Government&rsquo;s wishy-washy Housing for All promises are not enough.  A vacant property tax must be introduced and must include all property, including commercial property.  As Dr. Rory Hearne has stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tPolicy half-measures will not suffice ...  Owners of derelict and vacant property can no longer be allowed to leave it unused.  Use it, or lose it. <\/blockquote>  <p>That is his mantra.  Once again the public seem to be far ahead of the Government on this one.  It is time that their calls were listened to and that the hidden dereliction crisis is addressed.  We can no longer justify such high levels of homelessness and hidden homelessness while thousands of houses lie empty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600049#DDD00600","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1649257800,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I thank the Regional Group for bringing forward this well-thought-out and comprehensive motion, which outlines a series of proposals to utilise the many vacant and derelict properties throughout the country.<\/p> <p>In my opinion, the proposals outlined here are reasonable, practical and could be implemented in a timely manner.  I believe the Government will not oppose this motion, but as so many Deputies have said, we need urgent action.  We are all aware of the extent of the housing crisis.  While the Government tells us about its Housing for All plan and how it is being rolled out, people are at the end of their tether.  There is huge pressure to find a place to live, to rent or to buy.  It is crisis across the entire country.  We need other actions parallel to Housing for All that can be implemented immediately and that will deliver accommodation in the short and medium term.  I strongly support the proposal to introduce 0% long-term loans for retrofitting homes.  The proposal that repayments be made through utility companies based on energy savings, to include microgeneration technologies, is good and should be investigated.<\/p> <p> As I said, this motion is comprehensive and encompasses the fact that the homes that we renovate, build, supply and so on should be fully retrofitted.  While retrofitting grants are available for some homeowners, many will still have to take out loans to retrofit their homes.  That can be a significant cost at the best of times, but since it is highly likely that interest rates will rise, that will deter people from borrowing to retrofit.  Energy-saving homes are an essential component in cutting our emissions and our reliance on fossil fuels.  They are a necessity, not a luxury.  Innovative proposals such as interest free loans should be given full consideration by the relevant Ministers and action should be taken on foot of that.  The idea of taking credit unions on board to deliver these interest-free loans should be examined, because we know credit unions have money to lend and want to play their part in assisting people to either build, renovate or retrofit their homes.<\/p> <p> As the Minister of State knows, the Northern and Western Regional Assembly published a regional vacancy and dereliction analysis in January this year.  It is a valuable resource for policy development, since it gives the baseline figures.  We know where the vacant and derelict properties are.  This facilitates planning at local and regional level.  The national vacancy and dereliction rate for residential properties in 2020 was 4.9% in Ireland.  It is 10% in County Sligo, 14% in Roscommon, 10% in Donegal and 16% in Leitrim.  The renovation of derelict and vacant homes has huge potential to reinvigorate and renew many of the towns and villages across the north west.  It would bring them back to life.<\/p> <p> If the Minister of State implemented some of the recommendations in this motion, it would be a game changer for many towns in my constituency, especially those towns with residential vacancy rates at or above 10%, including Bundoran, Ballyshannon, Ballinamore, Dromahair, Drumshanbo, Mohill, Ballysadare, Ballymote and Boyle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600049#DDD00700","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649258400,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I call the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600050#EEE00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1649258400,"counter":356,"content":"<p>This motion contains some good proposals.

I agree with Deputy Berry about the Curragh camp.  I have written to the Minister for Defence on this.  As a demonstration project, it could deliver sustainable housing for the Curragh, and the plans are important.  Deputy Chris Andrews and I have spoken before about the redevelopment of the Dublin city flats, which are important from the point of view of housing and heritage, and should be repurposed.  Deputy Kenny raised Housing for All and a number of members raised the retrofit programme.  It is the most ambitious retrofit programme in the history of the State and Housing for All is the most ambitious housing programme.  Specifically on the question raised by Deputy Sherlock about the fair deal scheme, the Minister for Health will introduce legislation to reform and to remove the disincentives to renting those properties in the second quarter of this year.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan raised some interesting points about town centres, the Heritage Council and the collaborative town centre health check, which I think is a vital component of gathering data to see what we need, where empty properties are, and how they could be repurposed.  He mentioned Tipperary town and Tralee, both of which have gone through collaborative town centre health check programmes.  Climate resilience and walkable, cycleable town centres are what we are trying to receive.  This is not just housing policy in isolation or policy about vacancies in isolation, but is about creating liveable urban centres.  The issue of the Irish Green Building Council and the use of GGBS cement will be included in a green procurement policy and brought forward by Government.  A number of Members have referred to the housing crisis and to Ukraine.  The Government is committed to addressing it all.  It is challenging and we have hit the ground running in trying to address them.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Members have raised the issue of living above shops.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has brought in measures related to that.  Many of these premises will not go back into retail use and should be considered for bringing into full occupancy.  We should consider that for our town centres.  There were references to construction workers, builders and tradespeople, which need to be addressed.  Regarding rural housing, clustered housing and constructed wetlands should be considered to deal with water and wastewater infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Members for their contributions.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, stated at the outset, to give the issue the attention it deserves would take more time than is available to us this evening, so actions will have to speak louder than words.  I welcome the opportunity this has given Deputies to discuss a sustainable housing market and the significant contribution that recovering vacant and derelict properties makes to underpinning a sustainable housing market.  The high cost and affordability of housing, and the challenges it presents for people and families including the wider economy is fully acknowledged by Government.  That is why we developed and published Housing for All, the Government's housing plan for Ireland, which is a radical one that sets out four pathways to a sustainable housing system.  I remain convinced that Housing for All provides the firm pathways for transforming Ireland&rsquo;s housing delivery.<\/p>  <p>  This Government believes that everybody should have access to good quality housing to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard, and located close to essential services, offering a high quality of life.  The programme for Government, Our Shared Future, has been given impetus by the clear plan of action under Housing for All.  Supply pipeline indicators, including commencements, are strong and give confidence that the overall targets for delivery of homes will be met and likely exceeded.  There were 20,433 new home completions in 2021, despite the Covid restrictions imposed on the sector in the early part of the year.  Commencement notices for almost 4,200 new homes have been received in the first two months of 2022.  In the 12 months to February 2022, commencement notices for 33,006 new homes were received.  This is the highest rolling 12-month total since comparable data was first published.<\/p>  <p>  The number of homes granted planning permission in 2021 was 42,991, representing a fourfold increase on 2011 and indicating a strong housing supply pipeline.  There are also positive developments on the capacity of the sector to deliver the targets set out in Housing for All.  Employment in the sector is very close to pre-pandemic levels, construction apprenticeship registrations are increasing, and the future building initiative to address construction sector capacity issues by matching vacancies to jobseekers, as well as an international recruitment campaign, in conjunction with industry, is under way.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is mindful that it is clear that there are challenges ahead, with the war in Ukraine leading to a number of risks.  It has led to significant inflationary pressures, supply chain disruption and instability, all of which pose challenges in delivering the plan. In addition, our commitment to welcome those fleeing Ukraine leads to an immediate need for accommodation and a longer-term requirement for additional housing.  Against this backdrop, the delivery of Housing for All at scale and pace is now more important than ever.<\/p>  <p>  As already discussed, many areas of cities and towns and villages of all sizes face the blight of vacant properties, which, if brought back into use, could add real vibrancy to towns of all sizes around the country, and new accommodation in both urban and rural areas.  There is a real opportunity to increase residential development in cities and town centres, with a consequent emphasis on amenities and quality of life.  We are ensuring the houses we already have are being fully used at a time of such high housing need. <\/p> <p>The Government does not want to see habitable properties lying idle while people are homeless or living in unsuitable accommodation.  There has been good progress on a number of fronts in advancing actions in this pathway, particularly with the launch of the town centre first, TCF, policy in February, which provides a co-ordinated whole-of-government policy framework to proactively address the decline in the health of towns across Ireland and to support measures to regenerate and revitalise them.  Under the TCF approach, there will be a preparation of town centre plans to identify challenges, actions and integrated responses across a number of themes, including business, commercial, community, cultural, housing, built environment and heritage.  The plans will be action- and project-oriented in nature and will assist towns in accessing a range of future funding programmes available for urban regeneration across a number of Departments and Government agencies.<\/p> <p> Town regeneration officers will lead dedicated town centre first implementation at local level, including support local town teams in the preparation of the TCF plan, assisted by the wider local authority.  The Department of Rural and Community Development has provided funding of &euro;2 million for this purpose.  In addition, a national town centre first office will be established shortly within the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, to drive TCF actions and co-ordinate stakeholder engagement at national level and across the local government sector.  This will include the collaborative town centre health checks that I have referenced, which will be critically important in gathering that data and building capacity within the town teams.  A national oversight and advisory group, which is composed of representation from local government and Government Departments, agencies and wider expert representation will also link with town teams to provide feedback loop on the progression of the overall programme.  A number of pathfinder towns will be identified nationally to act as priority demonstrators of the TCF approach.  They will be assisted by the TCF national office.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, highlighted the broad suite of measures in Housing for All aimed at addressing vacancy in a co-ordinated, robust manner.  It is also important to draw attention to other crucial initiatives in tackling vacancy under Housing For All, namely, the repair-and-leasing scheme and the buy-and-renew scheme, which work in tandem.  In addition to providing social housing, the schemes involve additional benefits in terms of regeneration, employment and investment in local areas.<\/p> <p> The repair and leasing scheme assists private property owners, local authorities and approved housing bodies in utilising existing vacant housing stock throughout the country for social housing.  The scheme provides upfront funding for any works necessary to bring the property up to a required standard.  In return, the property owner agrees to leasing the dwelling to the local authority to be used for social housing for a period of five to 25 years.  The cost of the repairs is to be repaid by the property owner by offsetting it against rent.  Funding under the repair and leasing scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access funding that is needed to bring the properties up to a required standard for rental property.  The maximum cost of repairs allowable under the scheme is &euro;60,000, which was increased from &euro;40,000 in November 2020.  A total of 279 units have been brought into use under the repair and leasing scheme from 2017 to 2021.  The 2022 allocation is &euro;12 million for the repair and leasing scheme.<\/p> <p> In a situation where leasing is not an option that the homeowner is willing to pursue, the buy-and-renew scheme supports local authorities to purchase, acquire, remediate or renew vacant properties that are in need of repair and to make them available for social housing use.  Consequently, the scheme is particularly focused on older vacant homes to help tackle the problem of dereliction and to improve the appearance of the built environment in the community.  Some 735 homes have been delivered through this scheme for social housing purposes since its introduction in 2016.<\/p> <p> I again thank all the Deputies for their contributions.  This has been a worthwhile debate.  I reiterate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling the issue of vacancy through Housing for All and the other measures I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600050#EEE00400","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649259000,"counter":359,"content":"<p>We will go back to the Regional Group and an Teachta Denis Naughten to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600051#FFF00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1649259000,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies on all sides for their contributions and for their support for the principles behind this motion.  In particular, I thank Ms C&aacute;it Nic Amhlaoibh, who assisted us with the drafting of the motion and the research relating to it.<\/p>  <p>  There is something fundamentally wrong in a country that is in the middle of a housing crisis - which has got far worse in recent weeks - and in which there are 90,000 vacant homes.  The Northern and Western Regional Assembly has identified 44,905 residential and commercial premises that are empty in the five Connacht counties and the three Border counties of Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan.  This is one third higher than Ireland's total national annual housing requirement of 33,000 homes.  There are whole streets in our towns and villages that have not had a football kicked in them for a generation.  Some 40% of the vacant homes in the country are located in these eight counties.  Many of them are vacant family homes, are close to schools and services and have 1,000 Mbps high-speed broadband outside the front door.  The housing crisis is not just about the lack of houses; it is about the failure to have empty homes occupied by families, especially those in our towns and villages.  In fact, if these homes were occupied, it would have an immediate dividend to the State, to rural Ireland and to homeless families.  Frustratingly, I have been making this point for years.  Thankfully, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has listened to the arguments that I put forward and the Government has taken my suggestions on board.<\/p>  <p>  An entire section of the Housing for All strategy is focused on how we can bring families back into empty houses.  However, the strategy was published last September and we are still waiting for its implementation.  The Minister of State pointed out that the TCF strategy is going to help to develop this.  However, there is no point me going to my clinic on Friday morning and talking to a family who have become homeless again and telling them that the Government has another plan, namely, the TCF plan.  Plans are no good.  We need to see action.<\/p>  <p>  I will give a practical example.  In County Roscommon, we have the perverse situation whereby we have a vacancy rate of 14%.  There are 4,090 vacant homes in County Roscommon.  There are just 12 homes for rent and 334 for sale.  As a result, we have a housing crisis in the county.  We have had families living in emergency accommodation because there is no door that they can go into.  Yet, we have over 4,000 vacant homes in our county.  Local auctioneers have waiting lists for people for rental accommodation or for those who want to buy houses in Roscommon.  In east Galway, the situation is even worse because the demand is much higher and because our local villages there do not even have wastewater facilities.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State is talking about using wetlands to deal with wastewater.  We have wet streets because the raw sewage is flowing down some of the streets in east Galway at the moment and that is the situation that we are dealing with on the ground.  We need to bring vacant and derelict properties back into the housing stock.  This needs to happen immediately because it is an untapped supply of housing.  It is there to be retrofitted and it is there to be refurbished.  In many instances, the owners need innovative supports to take on these projects.<\/p>  <p>  We have proposed in this motion that the help-to-buy scheme would make available &euro;30,000 to help with the refurbishment of some of these empty homes.  The Government is paying, on average, &euro;31,000 to provide a serviced site here in Dublin, to develop privately owned land to ensure that it is opened up for development.  This is a worthy initiative but if we are prepared to pay &euro;31,000 to try to develop land in Dublin, why would we not pay something to open up derelict houses across rural Ireland?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned the local authority repair-and-leasing scheme.  That scheme is worthless in our part of the country.  I say this because you have to have a social housing test under the scheme.  There has to be a demand for social housing in the particular area before the local authority can use that scheme.  The reality is that we have a housing crisis across the country.  We have 44,000 houses in my neck of the woods and they are not going in under the repair and leasing scheme because there are not people in the village of Ahascragh looking for housing at the moment, or in the village of Caltra or in Ballintober.  Yet, we have vacant houses there.  We have people who are prepared to go in under that scheme.  We need to have more flexibility in relation to it.  If someone on the social housing list does not want to go into those villages, I can guarantee that there are many families here in Dublin who would be quite willing to relocate to rural Ireland if they were to be guaranteed a fixed rental charge for the next five years in the relevant community.  This would release a house that can provide social housing for a family here in Dublin.<\/p> <p> We need innovative thinking rather than the current rules and regulations that are in place.  We also need to look at clustered housing, particularly for older people.  Many older people are living in houses that are totally inappropriate for them in terms of the bedrooms and bathrooms located upstairs.  They would like to be able to move into locations closer to town centres where they could have access to facilities.  We need to provide high-quality, specialist, age-appropriate housing for older people close to existing communities and promote vibrant retirement within those communities in order that older people can enjoy healthier and longer active retirements.  One thing critical to that is security of tenure.  The Government is not going to get an older person to sell his or her family home and move into long-term rental accommodation unless that person knows he or she can actually afford it and that the rent will not be hiked up, as has happened in many of those facilities throughout the country in recent years.  There is a responsibility on the Government to provide clarity for people in respect of that matter.<\/p> <p> It is not just older people, however.  We need to do this right across our housing stock.  This is not a problem that is unique or new to Ireland.  In fact, as the Ceann Comhairle will know, we had very same problem in the 1990s in terms of agricultural land.  Back then, all of our land was leased on an 11-month basis.  Today, approximately half of all leases relating to agricultural land are for durations of more than five years.  Some of them are for up to 15 years.  In agriculture, the taxation system has been reformed to incentivise long-term leasing of land for the public good.  Now surely, if we can accommodate cattle, we must be able in a housing emergency to accommodate children under a similar scheme by actually providing security of tenure in terms of housing right across the country.  I am not talking about giving an incentive to big landlords.  They are doing very well with the current incentives.  I am talking about accidental landlords with one or two houses who could lease out a house to a family for a five-, ten- or 15-year period.  There would be an in-built incentive for the landlord because he or she is guaranteed income coming in over that period and it provides security of tenure for families.<\/p> <p> The single biggest problem I have in my constituency with homelessness is people being made homeless because of an eviction notice being issued to them.  Now, if there are 12 houses in County Roscommon when there are 4,000 vacant homes in the county, surely, there is something fundamentally wrong with our housing system.  There is something fundamentally wrong when I have people in emergency accommodation in my county because there is no rental accommodation available.  If we could provide security of tenure, it might act as an incentive for some of these houses to be opened up again.  It might act as an incentive for some of the accidental landlords not to sell that property, enter into a long-term lease and provide security to those particular families.<\/p> <p> We are also calling on the Government to implement a 0% long-term loan scheme for retrofitting homes and domestic microgeneration.  These loans would be paid back through the savings made on people's energy bills.  Rebuilding Ireland has failed to meet the annual target it set and is now running 41,000 units below its overall goal.   The Government needs to think creatively on innovative ways to provide homes.  It is now time to make use of our existing housing stock and resources and provide roofs for homeless families right across this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600051#FFF00300","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649259600,"counter":362,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649259600,"counter":363,"content":"<p>Motion, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649259600,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I congratulate Deputies on that work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600052#GGG00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Carbon Budget: Motion","time":1649259600,"counter":365,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600052#GGG00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1649259600,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth.

I greatly appreciate the work undertaken by members of the committee to examine the proposals and engage with numerous stakeholders and experts in order to fully interrogate the carbon budgets, and, more broadly, seek political consensus in support of a robust climate action.  I am grateful for the committee's recommendation to adopt the proposed carbon budgets and appreciate the other recommendations delivered in its report, particularly with regard to monitoring our progress, ensuring a just transition, identifying opportunities to enhance our ambition and the need for effective citizen and stakeholder engagement.<\/p><p>The need for swift, robust climate action is critical.  Last year, at COP26 in Glasgow, we witnessed the powerful testimonies of many international leaders from climate-vulnerable nations who painted a stark picture of the impact climate change is already having on their nations and communities.  The climate budget programme will support Ireland to deliver against its domestic, EU and international climate action obligations.<\/p><p>The year 2021 saw a step change in our approach to climate action with the signing into law of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 and the publication of the national development plan, NDP, and  Climate Action Plan 2021: Securing Our Future.  The introduction of our carbon budget programme will help us to build on the momentum from last year.<\/p><p>The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 establishes our climate objectives in law and will underpin national climate action in the medium- and long-term.  Under the Act, the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, submitted its first carbon budget programme in October 2021.  The programme submitted by the CCAC establishes a pathway to achieving our legally binding climate objectives.  It will deliver on our commitment to a 51%  reduction in our carbon emissions by 2030 and set us on the way to net zero by 2050.<\/p><p>Last December, the Minister for the Environment, Climate Change and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, caused a copy of this proposed carbon budget programme to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann then referred the carbon budget programme to the joint Oireachtas committee for its consideration.  On 7 February, the committee published its report and recommended that the proposed budgets be adopted by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Following consideration of the public consultation, the recommendations of the joint committee's report and input from my Government colleagues, the Minister took the proposed carbon budget programme to Government on 22 February and received Cabinet approval.<\/p><p>The motion being considered today on the Government's proposed carbon budgets taking effect is the final step in the adoption of the carbon budgets but it is only the beginning of the implementation process.  The motion under consideration represents a significant milestone on this journey.  Should the motion be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas, the carbon budgets will then come into effect and set out an emissions framework for the country that will support our overall climate objective.<\/p><p>Once these overall, economy-wide carbon budgets are adopted and have come into effect, the Minister and his Department will begin the process of preparing the sectoral emissions ceilings.  These ceilings will determine how each sector of the economy will contribute to the achievement of the carbon budgets.  It is my intention that the sectoral emissions ceilings will be presented to Government for approval by the end of June.  Preparation of the emissions ceilings will include extensive consultation with all Ministers and they will be informed by new and existing analysis undertaken by members of the  climate action modelling group.  As well as this, additional external technical support will be drawn upon.<\/p><p>The  work undertaken as part of the consultation and review process for the carbon budgets, including the joint committee's report, will also inform and support the preparation and development of the sectoral emissions ceilings.  Once the ceilings have been prepared and approved by the Cabinet, they and the carbon budgets will be reflected in the next climate action plan.  This will replace the indicative ranges of emission reductions for each sector that are in the climate action plan that was published in 2021.  The process to deliver the next update climate action plan will include further consultation with other Ministers, the public and various experts and stakeholders.<\/p> <p> It is crucial that while we prepare our carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings, delivery of climate action in Ireland continue apace.  The Climate Action Plan 2021, which the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications launched on 4 November alongside the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, provides a detailed roadmap for meeting our climate ambition under the climate Act.  The Government has also published an accompanying annexe of actions to support the delivery of the plan.  The annexe sets out the detailed actions and measures, with timelines included, that are required to drive delivery and ensure our emissions will reduce.  The annexe also identifies the key Departments, State bodies and other stakeholders that will oversee and implement these actions.  The 2021 plan sets out indicative ranges of emissions reduction for each sector of the economy and, following the legal adoption of carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings, these ranges will be finalised and reflected in this year's climate action plan.  The Government will support the changes through major public investment announced recently in the &euro;165 billion national development plan, NDP.  This will include increased funding for retrofitting homes, building new public transport, reskilling workers and supporting a just transition.<\/p> <p> While the Climate Action Plan 2021 builds on the ambitious targets of the 2019 plan, it also represents a significant step-up in ambition and implementation.  I will highlight a number of the most significant measures included in the plan.  The plan commits to an increase in the proportion of renewable electricity to 80% by 2030, including an increased target of up to 5 GW of offshore wind energy.  Second, it commits to a significant reduction in transport emissions by 2030.  Measures will include enabling 500,000 additional walking, cycling and public transport journeys per day by 2030 and supporting the take-up of electric vehicles, EVs, to reach almost 1 million by 2030.  Third, it commits to the implementation of a new national retrofit plan, intended to increase supply capacity and make retrofitting more affordable.  Fourth, it commits our enterprise sector to seeing a faster uptake of carbon-neutral heating, increased electrification of high-temperature heating and the phasing-out of high global warming-potential F-gases.  Lastly, it commits to reducing emissions associated with agriculture, which will be central to achieving our climate ambition.  The plan provides a pathway to reducing emissions while supporting world-class food producing through an innovation- and science-based approach.  There will be a reduction in the use of chemical nitrogen and a more targeted use of fertiliser while maintaining our position as a global leader in grass growth through multispecies swards.  We will reduce emissions from land use and make a move towards being an overall store of carbon, which will involve further bog rehabilitation, increased afforestation and the re-wetting of peat organic soils.  A new forestry programme will be prepared for launch in 2023.<\/p> <p> The plan places a just transition at its core.  It sets out four principles that will guide our policymaking and the implementation of our policy over the coming years to ensure we can effectively monitor and manage our transition and that our responses will remain flexible in order that we can respond to future transition challenges and target the areas in need of support.  Each Minister, as well as the Government as a whole, will be expected to consider these principles as we develop and implement our climate policies.  We have committed in the plan to establishing a just transition commission, which will make periodic recommendations to the Government, building on research, engagement through the national dialogue on climate action and the annual review from the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, on how Government policy can further the just transition.  In delivering this ambitious climate action plan and its future iterations, we must ensure we will bring people with us and that the transition is fair.  The national dialogue on climate action, launched in March 2021, will facilitate public engagement, participation, community action, networking and capacity-building activities on climate action, giving everyone in society the opportunity to play his or her part.  Last November, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications also announced &euro;60 million in funding from the climate action fund for community climate action projects to support and empower communities to shape and build low-carbon, sustainable communities in a coherent way.<\/p> <p> As I mentioned, the testimony presented at COP26 in Glasgow laid out the risks and challenges climate change presents.  The science is clear and definitive on the need for urgent action.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report, Climate Change 2021 - The Physical Science Basis, establishes incontrovertibly that the negative effects of climate change are being experienced globally and will continue to increase exponentially, in both magnitude and volatility, along with global temperatures.  We have made some progress towards this goal from Glasgow.  Ireland had a significant presence and extensive engagement at COP26 on a number of key areas, which will feed in to global decarbonisation efforts.  The Glasgow climate pact, the overarching agreement, keeps alive the ambition of restricting the global temperature rise of 1.5&deg;C.  It strikes a balance between increasing climate ambition, delivering on calls for increased climate finance and adaptation supports and leading the way for a new dialogue on the issue of loss and damage, critical to supporting climate justice for those most exposed to climate change.<\/p> <p> The carbon budget programme provides Ireland with a strong and deliverable framework for meeting our national climate objectives and our international obligations to climate action and emissions reductions.  It will require considerable co-operation and co-ordination to ensure we can achieve these budgets.  The process undertaken to consider these proposed budgets highlights how to build political consensus towards robust and impactful action against climate change.  It will take similar levels of engagement to achieve these budgets.  The transition to a carbon-neutral economy will provide significant opportunities to foster innovation, create jobs and grow businesses in areas such as offshore wind, cutting-edge sustainable agriculture and low-carbon construction.  While we all must act together towards our climate objective, I recognise the costs of climate action will be more acutely felt by some.  As a Government, we are committed to protecting those most vulnerable and ensuring a just transition to a low carbon economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600052#GGG00700","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649260200,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Patricia Ryan and Martin Browne.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion.  The carbon budgets were proposed by the independent CCAC and, after detailed scrutiny and engagement with stakeholders, were recommended for adoption by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action, though not unanimously.  The advisory council&rsquo;s evidence at the committee hearings was clear: we need immediate and urgent action, a whole-of-government approach and a complete reorientation and reprioritisation to ensure we can make the necessary changes now to help meet our targets in the years ahead.  We heard from other experts who said the budgets do not go far enough, and that cannot be ignored.   Nevertheless, what I took from the totality of the evidence and the deliberations, and I believe ours is a committee that is serious about its work, was that we do not have the luxury of more time.  The time for talking on climate has passed; radical action is needed now.  These carbon budgets are the advisory council&rsquo;s best estimate and, if implemented, can deliver the 51% reduction in emissions by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  We in Sinn F&eacute;in are in no doubt about the scale of the climate crisis facing the world and, in line with our support for our 2030 and 2050 targets, we will vote to approve these carbon budgets as proposed by the advisory council, although the third budget should be subject to further discussion.  While we agree with the ambition and the targets, we disagree fundamentally with many of the policy decisions the Government is implementing.  We will continue to bring forward constructive alternatives that we believe will help us meet our targets in a fair and just way.<\/p>  <p>  This debate on carbon budgets is timely, given the major report published on Monday by the UN's IPCC.  The contents of the report are incontrovertible and the consequences of failing to act unimaginable.  It can leave us in no doubt that it is now or never if we want to limit global warming to 1.5&deg;C.  We are on track for an increase exceeding 3&deg;C, with devastating consequences for the globe.  We know what needs to be done and how to do it, and we now need the Government to lead and deliver the just transition that will reduce emissions and secure a liveable future, and not just talk about it.<\/p>  <p>  The reduction in emissions set out in these budgets will be very challenging to achieve.  This challenge has been made all the greater as a result of the failure to act in years gone by.  It is precisely because successive Governments ignored repeated climate warnings from scientists and permitted our carbon emissions to accelerate over the past 20 years that we have been left scrambling to make radical changes now.   Incoherent policies have also contributed to the challenges we now face in energy, transport, housing and elsewhere.<\/p> <p>While public transport is rightly encouraged, many areas across the State remain without real options.  The investment was not made.  Major public transport projects such as MetroLink or the Navan rail line have been repeatedly kicked down the road and remain undelivered, leaving these communities without sustainable transport modes.  In my constituency this week, a lifeline public transport route, the 136, used by elderly people to get to and from the shops once a week is being pulled.  That is public transport in Ireland in 2022.<\/p> <p> At the same time, the red carpet was rolled out for energy-hungry data centres with no regard for our electricity generation capacity or the impact the policy would have on our national emissions.  Similarly, successive governments gave us and championed a system of developer-led development.  Communities got houses, houses, houses and urban sprawl.  It was the opposite of compact growth or transport-led development.  It created dependency on cars.  There were no amenities, public parks or green spaces, and creaking infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  Ratoath in my constituency is one example.  The water infrastructure in that town is crumbling under increased pressure from the growing population, leading to frequent water outages which impact on businesses, families, young and old and people with disabilities.  As the town grew and developers and the local authority made money, citizens were and are being failed by the lack of timely investment in water infrastructure.  There is a plan involving the Windmill Hill reservoir and trunk water main, but the work is too slow and outages far too frequent.  I implore the Minister of State to contact the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, to have that work expedited.  It is an example of much talk but little action.  <\/p> <p> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report highlights that in order to limit global warming, major change in the energy sector will be required.  Thankfully, we have the tools and know-how, but now we need a focus on rapid delivery.  Ireland is uniquely placed to become a world leader in offshore wind and reduce our emissions significantly, but we have heard from the wind industry that our 2030 renewable target is already in doubt.  The Oireachtas climate committee in recent weeks heard that we have just a 50\/50 chance of meeting our 2030 target of 5 GWs of offshore wind.  This is at a time when the head of the EPA says we can expect emissions here to increase in 2022.  They need to decrease by 4.8% to meet the carbon budgets.<\/p> <p> We heard that we need greater numbers of personnel in the planning authorities like An Bord Plean&aacute;la and that we need to ensure our offshore planning processes are as speedy as possible.  We heard we need investment in BirdWatch Ireland and other prescribed bodies to ensure planning is done in a sustainable way.   We need updated and new regulations brought forward and investment in grid infrastructure.  EirGrid is not fit for purpose.  We need our ports to be developed to ensure we can build and maintain the turbines and develop the supply chain industry here.  We should designate those ports today.<\/p> <p> Green hydrogen goes hand in hand with offshore wind and offers the State huge potential for the export of this green energy to Europe.  I brought forward a Bill seeking to develop a national green hydrogen strategy as soon as possible.  We should strive to become a world leader in this field, and I hope the Minister of State acts on this soon.<\/p> <p> In relation to onshore wind, we are still awaiting updated regulations, with the outdated ones having contributed to numerous development problems in the past.  The delay in bringing this forward is unacceptable, and the industry says the same.  If lessons are not learned from bad developments like Derrybrien, then we will not deliver the necessary onshore wind in the time ahead.  There are weaknesses at every level of the system.  It is not Sinn F&eacute;in propaganda to say that.  The industry and the agencies say it, if not publicly, certainly privately.  <\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see a more equitable retrofitting system, one that prioritises those living in fuel and energy poverty and targets grant support at those who need financial assistance.  Middle-income earners who earn too much to avail of free energy upgrades but not enough to have money to invest in energy efficiency measures feel left behind.<\/p> <p> We heard from the SEAI yesterday.  It is behind on one-stop shop targets and on tackling the two-year backlog in the warmer home scheme.  It has no plan for renters or for those just outside the eligibility criteria. The Minister of State can see a pattern here.  Every scheme the Government builds, including retrofitting, EV grants and the bike to work scheme, fails the equity test.  That is a problem.  I am fed up listening to Government representatives congratulate themselves on climate.  It is a reasonable estimate thatthis Government will miss every emission reduction target it set itself. <\/p> <p> Government Members' defence is they are serious about climate because they have a carbon tax.  This magic carbon tax is, on one hand, minuscule.  The increase on 1 May will make no difference to people, we are told.  On the other hand, it is the cornerstone of the Government's climate policy.  It will pay for retrofitting, renewables and sustainable farming, all of which are behind schedule and have missed targets, and it will protect the most vulnerable.  It will not and cannot do that.  No single tax could do that.  In the meantime, it will punish people for being poor and drive them against the climate agenda.  <\/p> <p> As always, there are alternatives.  The money can and should be raised in a different way.  For example, Sinn F&eacute;in proposed that the retrofitting budget be increased by &euro;125m in 2022 and outlined tax increases in different areas that would fund this.  A solidarity tax on those earning in excess of &euro;140,000 and a tapering off of tax credits for those earning more than &euro;100,000 are two examples.  These two proposals would raise &euro;408 million in a year and would not hit workers and families who are just about getting by as it is.<\/p> <p> The science is clear, the targets are in place and we need a focus on rapid delivery from the Government if we are to meet our 2030 and 2050 targets.  I echo the words of the IPCC chair: &ldquo;We are at a crossroads. The decisions we make now can secure a liveable future.&rdquo;  Carbon tax and tweaking the market will not do.  Sinn F&eacute;in will play its part.  We are serious about this but we want to see it delivered.  It will be delivered only if it is done in a fair and equitable way.  We have real concerns about the approach Government is taking.

We support these carbon budgets but have serious worries about delivery.  We have had the IPCC report.  At this point, people just need to look at weather reports over a number of months to know the reality of what we are dealing with in relation to climate change.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, Councillor Ant&oacute;in Watters and I met Louth County Council on the necessary projects of catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM.  One worries about the delivery of these projects and the difficulties around planning.  Unless we can get our act together in this field, we might be wasting our time.  What we aim for will not be significant enough to save the likes of Dundalk and make sure it does not end up underwater.  We have to get serious.<\/p>  <p>  The Climate Change Advisory Council is about transitioning to a low-carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy.  That is what we need to do.  We need to make the targets for 2030 and 2050.  It is all about policy decisions.  We have had a huge amount of conversation in the last while on energy, the sourcing of energy and energy security.  We have more questions than answers.  Public transport in this State is not what it needs to be to give people alternatives.  The Government tries to force some alternatives on people with carbon tax without offering them what they need. <\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Rourke spoke on data centres.  They are necessary for the companies that need them but we failed to plan for our energy security.  Wind energy is where we should be at.  We could be a major power in relation to offshore wind.  As much as we have put frameworks together, we are all aware of the difficulties that exist with planning in this State.  <\/p> <p>I have just left a transport committee meeting where Mr. Peter Walsh of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, appeared before us.  Obviously, everyone sees that there are major issues with tendering, contracts and planning.  We have the system that we have, but if we are not going to resource An Bord Plean&aacute;la or the judicial system, we will have delay after delay.  These are the types of issues that we need to get sorted.  If we are serious about this, then we have to consider all alternatives that deliver, including solar power, a retrofit system that works and has equity built into it and the likes of a green hydrogen policy.  We have to put all of this together.  If we do not, then we will be in the same position in future and we will fail.<\/p> <p> I wish to raise a particular issue, that of communal district heating systems and specifically Carlinn Hall in Dundalk where we are dealing with an environmental disaster.  It was meant to be a biofuel-heated system but it is inefficient.  The system is now being heated by gas.  On 15 April, people will get bills in which they will be charged 42 cent per kWh.  Due to this inefficiency, people end up using 100 units of gas to provide 50 units of heat.  I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and others in government.  This is something that the Government needs to tackle.  We need a short-term fix.  These people are being charged colossal rates and have no major control over what is happening.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, says that it has no responsibility in the matter but we need to get serious about this issue.<\/p> <p> We have had many discussions about the necessity of remote working.  It can enable people to reduce their time spent commuting and so on, but we need to get serious about the delivery of national broadband.  I have a great fear that tomorrow's numbers will be well short of the 60,000 connections that were meant to be delivered by the end of last month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600054#JJJ00200","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649261400,"counter":373,"content":"<p>The latest IPCC report has highlighted that, to limit global warming, major changes in the energy sector will be required.  It effectively says that we are sleepwalking into a climate catastrophe.  Under current plans, the next generation of offshore wind farms will not produce electricity until 2026 at the earliest while a microgeneration scheme that pays households for producing excess green electricity is still not in place.  There have been too many delays, announcements and re-announcements.  This is not good enough.  We need a step change in the pace of delivery across the board.  The IPCC has confirmed that time is running out to save the planet and that meeting Paris Agreement targets will require a real and immediate national effort.<\/p>  <p>  That the Climate Action Delivery Board only met once between 2020 and 2021 is a scandal as well as a serious cause for concern about how climate policy is being driven from within the Government.  The Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform cannot be allowed to be passengers in the process; they must be drivers.  We need serious progress on the sectoral carbon budgets process, as set out in the climate Act, and a whole-of-government approach.  An updated climate change adaptation plan is essential to meet the challenges ahead.<\/p>  <p>  The Government should adopt elements of the Scottish climate Act, which requires a just transition.  The impact on vulnerable communities must be set out and responded to.  This approach has been backed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and we need to listen to them.  A just transition must be a proactive process and it must be integral.  It cannot be an afterthought.  It must not just focus on Bord na M&oacute;na workers, deserving and all as they are.  It must also consider rural and farm communities.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the carbon budgets prepared by the CCAC.  This is consistent with our position on the climate Bill and our support for the 2030 and 2050 emission reduction targets.  The carbon budgets are the council's best estimate for how emissions could, and should, be reduced between now and 2030.  While we support the targets, we have serious concerns about the approach that the Government is taking to achieving them.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the work of Kildare County Council in this regard and its recently published just transition plan for west Kildare.  The plan's focus identifies projects that support and advance sustainable social, economic and environmental development in the transition to a low-carbon future in the region.  Councils must be provided with funding to ensure such plans are developed and implemented locally.  It is not enough to compliment their plans and move on.  The Government must provide the money to enable councils to bring these plans into reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600055#KKK00200","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1649261400,"counter":374,"content":"<p>It is appropriate that we are discussing carbon budgets following the publication of the UN climate report, which was released on Monday.  It was a worrying report that sought to reinforce the need for swift and meaningful action to be taken to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions across the globe if we are to survive the 1.5&deg;C threshold, but there was a note of hope that we could all play our part in this ambition if our roadmaps were right.<\/p>  <p>  To be clear, carbon budgets set out our targets and are adopted by the Oireachtas.  However, it is individual Ministers who prepare sectoral emission ceilings for the sectors of the economy under their respective remits.  The importance of the manner in which individual Ministers pursue these targets cannot be overstated.  When deciding on measures, attention must be paid to the role that each sector and each element of that sector can play in achieving our targets.  These measures are major responsibilities that will play a part in determining the direction that our climate will go.  The sectors cannot get away from that and we all have our part to play, but we must never forget the notion of equality.  We cannot forget that most people want to play their part to secure a world for their children and grandchildren in which the deterioration of the climate has begun to roll back, but they are often financially limited in the actions they can take to meet the demands being made of them by their sectoral Ministers.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, counterproductive measures are being rolled out.  Those that disproportionately impact the least well-off have resulted in many people seeing the climate actions designed by this Government as being little more than the imposition of additional charges that result in a higher cost of living.  This is because there are either no alternatives or, if there are, they are outside people's financial reach.  We see this in the retrofitting scheme, which favours those with disposable incomes, and in the grants available for electric cars, which favour those in particularly affluent areas and who have money to spend on prestige vehicles.  We see it in the carbon tax, which disproportionately affects those with little or no disposable income to spend on retrofitting and who have no alternative to using their cars daily to go to the shop, work or hospital.  If the Government's approach is to present obstacles to achieving our objectives and exclude those who have the least while imposing taxes on them for little gain, it increases the likelihood that we will miss our targets.<\/p>  <p>  Rural Ireland is being targeted in particular.  Where is our public transport?  Where is our district heating?  In previous policies, this and previous Governments have often put obstacles in the way of achieving the targets we have been set and have hampered our ability to deliver on them.  Where was the foresight?<\/p>  <p>  European countries have rolled out district heating while we are still talking about it.  Considerable opportunities lie in green hydrogen.  Offshore wind energy, which can be used to make green hydrogen, has historically been left in the dark.  Green hydrogen applications are increasing and it can be stored and used when the wind is not blowing, but we still do not have a national hydrogen strategy for this important energy source.  Deputy O'Rourke has introduced a Bill that would do just that.<\/p>  <p>  What about our farmers?  The Common Agricultural Policy used to be about food supplies at affordable prices.  That has been ditched, the playing field has been changed and our farmers are ready to make the change, but instead of being at the centre of those discussions, they are being spoken down to and vilified.  Decisions are being floated without their input, yet the Government talks waffle about engagement while supporting trade deals at European and global levels such as the Mercosur trade deal and the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The previous Government set a target of making Ireland the data centre capital of the world with no thought about the impact that this would have on our carbon emissions or energy capacity and, therefore, I do not blame those who have the least for speaking out against Government strategies.  Climate justice involves a human-centred approach to climate action and should involve bringing together workers, communities and employers to drive plans to achieve targets in a way that leaves no one behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600055#KKK00300","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1649261400,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Our global climate and biodiversity crises are existential and fundamental to our capacity to live and to the survival of our planet, but it is not all doom and gloom and we should never feel powerless.  It is good to have this opportunity to debate carbon budgets, given that we have just seen the IPCC's report with its chilling prognosis but also a reminder that we can still act to avoid a climate catastrophe.  We have many of the solutions already.  From agriculture to transport, we know what we have to do.<\/p> <p>The first Bill I ever published, when I was first elected to the Oireachtas 15 years ago, sought to impose a cap on Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.  It was the first Bill of its kind in Ireland.  Although that took place relatively recently, it seems a lifetime ago in terms of understanding the urgency of the crisis we are in.  The IPCC report emphasises we are currently on a path to exceed 2&deg;C warming worldwide, which could result in enormous loss of life, livelihoods, biodiversity and food security.  The clear and stark message from that report, and I raised this with the Taoiseach during Leaders' Questions on Tuesday, is the need to take action.<\/p> <p> All of us are encouraged by the activism we see in the engagement of younger generations, in particular, who are driving the charge on climate justice through the school strikes movement, the Youth Climate Assembly and many of their campaigns.  I was proud to stand with many of them at the most recent global school strike on 25 March.  This is a cause that hits close to home for young people in Ireland because they know, as we do, that this is about our children and grandchildren.  We are already running through their carbon budgets, spending their resources, destroying their planet and moving in the wrong direction.  Just last weekend we saw the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, confirm the extent to which Ireland's emissions are heading in the wrong direction.  We learned that emissions from electricity alone rose by 21% last year undoing the small progress we had achieved in previous years.  The EPA branded this directional move as disappointing, which is patently an understatement.  <\/p> <p> We need to ensure real and urgent action is taken to implement the measures we have already put into law and that we very much welcomed and supported through our ambitious climate targets.  The adoption of carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings form part of that effort.  We have called for this to be a whole-of-government measure with economic and environmental planning taking place in parallel.  In that spirit, we are glad to endorse and support the first two budgets being put to the House today.  I am very grateful to the different voluntary groups and NGOs that have been in contact with all of us, and with the Government, in recent weeks and have worked so hard to see those budgets improved and adopted, while recognising they are not sufficiently aligned with Paris Agreement commitments and do not constitute Ireland's fair share.  I pay special tribute to Friends of the Earth, the Stop Climate Chaos coalition and the Just Transition Alliance for their constructive campaigning and activism.<\/p> <p> I welcome the commitment the Minister of State made in his speech to the establishment of a just transition commission.  The delays in its establishment have fed into a sense of a lack of sufficient urgency from the Government in taking the necessary steps to meet our emissions reduction targets.  I also referred in my remarks to the Taoiseach on Tuesday not only to the delay in the establishment of that commission, which is so critical in bringing measures forward, but to inefficient governance through the lack of meetings of the climate action delivery board.  I asked the Taoiseach whether that board met yet this year, noting that it has only met once in 2021.<\/p> <p> Turning again to the budgets before us, I note, as have others, there is a degree of backloading of our reductions between 2025 and 2030.  I acknowledge this is to facilitate the adoption of new policies and practices but, again, we need to see a greater sense of urgency in these budgets.  The IPCC was clear that there is a very small window of three years to meet targets.  We know the effects of global warming are cumulative, so we will be worse off for not taking quick action now.  The adoption of reductions must happen on the understanding there is no room for any additional backloading of emissions reductions.  It is imperative we do not overshoot the first carbon budget.  These should not be seen as targets but, rather, a floor beneath which we cannot fall.  It would be morally unconscionable to pass the clear tipping points the IPCC has identified, which would trigger larger-scale changes in Earth's systems and a loss of biodiversity, with many species already on the ready on the brink of extinction.<\/p> <p> I will turn to the third carbon budget proposed from 2031 to 2035.  I note this budget remains provisional.  This budget needs to be improved upon in order that we can achieve net zero as quickly as possible, while noting that the law states 2050 is the latest target and some countries have adopted net zero targets earlier than 2050.  The reasoning behind the adoption of these earlier targets by other countries should form part of the Climate Change Advisory Council research in finalising the measures for the third budget.  Looking at those other countries, Sweden, Portugal and Germany have set a zero target date of 2045 in law.  Finland and Austria have set earlier targets in policy of 2035 and 2040, respectively.  The adoption by other EU states of these earlier net zero target dates shows us what can and may be done.<\/p> <p> The Labour Party prepared an amendment to this motion, which would have had the effect of declining to approve the third carbon budget for that five-year period of 2031 to 2035 on the basis of the need to ensure greater research on this.  Unfortunately, we were out of time with that amendment but I will put forward the logic that lay behind our proposed amendment to the Minister of State.  While the Climate Change Advisory Council put forward a reduction rate of only 3.5% from 2031 to 2035 for this provisional third budget, this presupposed a linear path from 2030 to net zero by 2050.  To return to the previous point, our climate law stipulates net zero by 2050 at the latest.  We believe there should have been steeper and faster cuts built in.  Our view, shared by Friends of the Earth, is the council should take into account the principle of climate justice about which our former President, Mary Robinson, has spoken so clearly.  It should also have taken into account the obligations of the Paris Agreement, including the principle of common but differentiated responsibility in drawing up this third carbon budget proposal.  Climate law sets a legal requirement for the CCAC to consider climate justice and the principle of Ireland's fair share in line with the further principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.  We believe that, based on what the CCAC has already published, more research and analysis should be built into informing the finalisation of the third carbon budget and, indeed, a provisional fourth carbon budget.  I am sorry we did not have the opportunity to table that amendment but I want to put that on the record, although we support the earlier budgets.<\/p> <p> We in Ireland must do our fair share.  This comes back to the point about responsibility and, in particular, global responsibility.  We have spoken extensively in both Houses in recent months about the cost-of-living crisis and what needs to be done to alleviate the burden on ordinary people and on every household in Ireland.  We know that the cost-of-living crisis, the energy security crisis as a result of the horrific war in Ukraine and the climate emergency are all strongly interlinked.  Households throughout the country are struggling to meet the costs of housing, transport, childcare and more, in addition to rising energy and fuel costs.  We are, however, a country that can do much more to support those who need supports with targeted measures while, in parallel, continuing on our path to end our reliance on fossil fuels.  Some say Ireland is too small to made a difference but, looking at the global reality, 111 countries are the same size or smaller than Ireland.  If they all said they were too small to make a difference, we would never reach global climate emissions reduction targets.<\/p> <p> We need to do more in this country at every level and in all sectors.  We speak every week about this but I was struck, in particular, by the recent words of Professor Kevin Anderson who addressed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action.  He contended that reaching a globally fair and equitable system of emissions cuts would require Ireland to reach net zero by 2029.  This is much earlier than even those other European countries are proposing as their net zero dates.  It is in that context that I emphasise we accept the need to pass these budgets without delay but to do so in a manner that will make it possible for us to improve upon our implementation and strategies to reach net zero.<\/p> <p> We are told that without immediate and deep carbon emissions reductions across all sectors, it will not be possible to limit global warming to 1.5&deg;C this century.  Three years ago, noting the crisis we were in, this House voted to declare a climate emergency, but last weekend we learned from the UN IPCC just how critical this timing now is and how crucial it is that we act urgently, without any further delay, to implement the necessary measures.  We have the targets in law.  We need to do more to ensure they are reached before that very latest date of 2050 we have set for ourselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600055#KKK00400","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649262600,"counter":377,"content":"<p>As my colleagues have mentioned, the IPCC report published on Monday made for grim reading.  It did not tell us anything we do not know already.  We are in a really dangerous situation with respect to climate.  It was a hard scientific report put together by people who know what they are talking about.  They have looked at the numbers.  They have been looking at this for 30 years.  The science is absolutely, categorically true: we are in a perilous situation with respect to our climate.  The report says that by 2025, global greenhouse gas emissions must peak and then we must reduce them by 47% by the end of the decade if we are to maintain any hope of staying within the 1.5&deg;C temperature rise over the pre-industrial average, which was the basis for the Paris Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The rate of growth of emissions has slowed to about 1.7% per year, and that is positive, but the chances of keeping the temperature rise to 1.5&deg;C are very slim indeed.  In fact we are on course for double that with an increase of 3&deg;C.  We are at about 1.2&deg;C right now and with that, we can see the devastation that is causing.  We can see it here in Ireland with droughts and very frequent storms and we are seeing it more across the world where the global poor are most affected.  Two degrees of warming would lift sea levels by almost 60 cm or 2 ft.  Beyond 2&deg;C, and we are on course for 3&deg;C, we do not know how bad it will be and what will happen.  What we do know is that feedback loops will kick in and we will enter a chain reaction of global temperature rise that will be utterly catastrophic.  It will lead the global ice melt to accelerate exponentially.  That is a situation where many of the coastal cities of the world will be underwater.  Much of the coastal communities that we know now will be uninhabitable.  We are likely to see the collapse of ecosystems and our ability to produce food.  That is the course we are on right now.  <\/p>  <p>  What is before this House is what the Climate Change Advisory Council has proposed as a carbon budget.  The council is not a representative body and nor should it be.  It is a collection of experts in the science of climate change as well as experts best placed to guide us in the transition away from a fossil-fuelled and carbon-intensive economy.  I commend the chair of the council, Ms Marie Donnelly, who came before the committee.  She really is a steady hand.  She is a voice of reason and very measured.  We owe a debt to her for the work that she has done on the council and in the production of this carbon budget.  I also commend her colleagues on their work.  I want to give particular praise to the carbon budget sub-committee.  It came before the joint committee.  I would like to name them all but there were so many of them, it would use all my time.  We were really impressed by their contributions.  The CCAC is required under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act, which this House overwhelmingly supported last summer, to produce three consecutive carbon budgets.  The first two were required to be aligned with the legally-binding target that we cut greenhouse gas emissions by 51% by 2030. <\/p>  <p>  What is a carbon budget?  It is a self-imposed ration on the amount of carbon we will release into the atmosphere.  It is not a sectoral ceiling.  Those will come later.  I note from the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution that we are going to get them at the end of June.  That will be interesting.  I think the Government will propose ceilings for various relevant sectors such as transport, housing, agriculture, industry, electricity generation and so on.  A necessary debate should happen then about what the appropriate sectoral emission ceilings are.  But this is the carbon budget; the five-year maximum allocation of carbon that we will allow ourselves across society through to 2026.  The second one will be through to 2030.  The third, as proposed by the council, is provisionally through to 2035.  <\/p>  <p>  The challenge for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, which I chair, was to look at the proposal from the council and assess whether the proposal was appropriate, whether it was something we would endorse or reject or what we had to say about it.  We undertook a highly extensive process and I commend colleagues, who are here this evening, on returning to the Houses early in the Christmas recess to do that work.  It was a very comprehensive piece of work.  As I said, we invited the carbon budget sub-committee of the CCAC.  We invited other eminent scientists, including Professor Kevin Anderson who Deputy Bacik just mentioned.  We invited in the social partners and had representatives from each of the pillars and we invited in officials from the Departments that will be most responsible for ensuring that the carbon budgets are not exceeded. <\/p>  <p>  In the end the budgets, were endorsed by joint committee but not unanimously.  It was a difficult process.  We are a highly collaborative committee and each and every member works very hard and diligently, week in, week out.  People took their positions fairly and legitimately.  In the end we did endorse the proposed carbon budget by a strong majority.  I respect those who have different views.  <\/p>  <p>  I very much welcome Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s position today.  I value the contributions of Deputies O&rsquo;Rourke and Cronin to the committee always.  I am a bit taken aback by Deputy O'Rourke&rsquo;s criticisms of the Government.  It is a little unlike his contributions at the committee, but I might return to those later.   <\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party is a party with a reputation for constructive opposition and it is very serious about policy.  It is a loss to the committee that we do not have a Labour representative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600057#MMM00100","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1649262600,"counter":378,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600057#MMM00200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1649262600,"counter":379,"content":"<p>We did try to make amends and I hope that we will continue to see Labour engage very positively on the climate debate.  Deputy Whitmore is in the House.  I do not want to pre-empt her contribution, but the Social Democrats are probably inclined to say that the carbon budget is not good enough and should go further.  I hope I am not misrepresenting her position.<\/p>  <p>  From People Before Profit-Solidarity, Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is a valued member of the committee.  I expect its position will be that we should also have a more demanding carbon budget.  If anyone is saying we should not accept this carbon budget and that it should go further, I challenge them to show exactly how to achieve it.  It is really important that we get beyond the rhetoric here and that we start to speak in numbers because this is an incredibly demanding carbon budget.  Supporting a moratorium on data centre construction is a valid position to hold but how many megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent will that give us?  Free public transport is also a legitimate position but how many megatonnes will that give us?<\/p>  <p>  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act requires us to get from around 60 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent down to about 30 megatonnes in the space of eight years.  Stopping the construction of data centres and providing free public transport is all very nice to say, but it is not going to do it.  If anyone is going to say that we have to have a more demanding carbon budget, then people need to show us their alternative climate action plan and their alternative carbon budget and let us scrutinise it.  Let us look at the numbers.  If they cannot show us then their credibility on the question is in doubt.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier, colleagues mentioned the opportunity Ireland has around the climate action plan.  I will not quote Robert Frost again but we are at a fork in the road in this country's energy policy.  <\/p>  <p>We have a choice in the medium to long term to decide what our energy future is going to be.  Voices in this House are calling for us to double down on how we did things in the past.  Liquefied natural gas, LNG, is not the future for Ireland.  We have so much renewable energy, especially off our coasts.  If we are confident as a nation and believe we are world leaders - as we might be in the provision of data centres - then we can be world leaders in rolling out renewable energy and we need to hear that across this House.  We need to hear that ambition and that confidence.  The idea we would fall back on fossil fuel technology, especially in light of what we heard from the IPCC earlier in the week, is utterly ridiculous.  We should not do it.  There is an opportunity for Ireland, with the assistance of Europe, to become the global leader in the development of floating offshore technology in particular and the development of not just green hydrogen technology but a green hydrogen economy.  It is a completely different type of economy, and that is what we need.<\/p> <p> We need to learn the lessons of 50 years ago when we went through a similarly energy crisis, namely, the oil crisis.  After the oil crisis the countries of Europe looked at how they might guarantee their energy security.  Some countries were brave and innovative and developed the renewable energy industry we know today.  Ireland sat back and it built a coal-fired power station.  That has left us with many of the problems we have today.  Let us not make the same mistake again.  Let us develop a renewable energy industry, a green hydrogen economy and let us not be conservative.  Let us become suppliers of green and clean energy to Europe, as well as meeting our own needs.<\/p> <p> In the few minutes I have remaining, I will address the carbon tax.  It is not the case the carbon tax is the sole pillar of the Government's climate policy.  It is one important measure and it is a very important one.  The increase amounts to &euro;1.50 per month for the average household.  This &euro;1.50 per month provides &euro;20 per month for those who are on the fuel allowance.  It provides &euro;12 per month for those on the living alone allowance and &euro;12 per month for those in receipt of qualified child payment.  If we are serious about climate then we need to get serious about the carbon tax.  While I welcome Sinn F&eacute;in's endorsement of this carbon budget, I would like to see it change its position on the carbon tax because it is absolutely necessary for us to achieve our climate targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600057#MMM00300","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649263200,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I am glad to speak on this important issue.  As a member of the climate committee I admit I am very worried we are running out of time.  Worry is the only sane and sensible reaction given what our world is facing with climate change and its advance.  According to the IPCC report we are facing major capital cities being underwater.  We are facing unprecedented heatwaves.  We have already seen these across Europe, with 1,000-year-old trees being burned and animals and people fleeing for their lives.  We have increasing storms in the north Atlantic and even with all this water we are still facing water shortages that are going to impact the availability and lead to the displacement of people across the world.  We will see the extinction of a million species of plants and animals.  As the UN scientists said yesterday, it is now or never.  It is all down to us, that is, to politics and politicians, to make that not happen.  We decide the budgets, the limits and the laws that will decide our planet's future and that of every human and animal life form that lives on it.  We politicians have the power to obliterate human civilisation or to save and though it will not be popular or comfortable, it definitely will not be managed by latt&eacute;-levy sound bites, because the responsibility to save it is ours and ours alone.  Big business, the big emitters and the big polluters that lead to the big heating and the sea-level rises all operate within the laws we make and uphold.  Even here at home, the capitalist delirium has taken hold.  You could be accused of treason for mentioning we should have a moratorium on data centres.  While we have workers sleeping in tents, there is a multimillion euro property development on land not too far from here that is going to be underwater in around eight to ten years, based on the current emissions trajectory.  That is not just going to happen in Dublin but in many capital cities.  Flood risk rises as the sea rises and we already know the devastating damage that can be done by a single storm surge.  I cannot mention rampant capitalism without mentioning the armaments industry, the war in Ukraine, the war in Yemen and other ongoing wars.  The carbon emissions that come from the arms industry are disgusting.<\/p>  <p>  Carbon budgets are always important but there is great urgency now.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the carbon budgets as prepared by the CCAC and this is consistent with our position on the climate Act and our support for emissions targets from 2030 to 2050.  Though we support the targets, we have grave and growing misgivings about how they will be reached, and I will talk about the carbon tax.  It is due on 1 May, which is May Day, the workers' day.  The Government can spin it any way it wants but right now people do not have an alternative energy they can choose.  How can you incentivise people to change their behaviour when their radiators are already off, their lights are off, the shower is banned and driving is confined to work and school?  All this is happening in a country that has made a meme about turning off the immersion.  The Government has let the cat out of the bag and the carbon tax is seen as a revenue-raiser and not as a means of behavioural change because the increase in costs has already caused a behaviour change yet the Government will not stop the forthcoming carbon tax increase.  The people affected by this energy poverty are not packing up their EVs, loading the electric bike in the back and heading off to their holiday homes to measure them for solar panels.  They are frantic about how they are going to deal with another cost hit deep in a cost-of-living crisis.  Therefore, while we support the carbon targets we will also support the people who are most affected by these decisions and Sinn F&eacute;in will make no apology for that.<\/p>  <p>  I am also worried bad policy and decisions will see us miss those targets.  In the process we will not only accrue fines but abdicate our responsibility to humanity.  People always talk about the planet, but the planet is grand.  In fact, humanity is really the main problem on it.  We are living on this planet in a parasitic way and we must learn how to live in harmony with it.  We will continue to bring forward our own proposals, as with green hydrogen.  I have co-sponsored a Bill with Deputy O'Rourke to create a national strategy on it.  We need a strategy to rein in our ambitions.  It is not going to happen with just ourselves.  We agree on the carbon destination though we have a different view on how to get there.  However, there is no doubt we must get there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600058#NNN00200","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1649263200,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to debate the carbon budgets in the Chamber.  I am always quite torn when it comes to these kinds of debates because I understand the commitment parties like the Green Party in particular have had over many years on climate and environmental issues and the role that party has taken in the current Government in pushing for and driving many of the changes we need to see.  I am also torn because as a parliamentarian, a scientist and a mother, Deputy Leddin is right that I want to see the Government doing more and want to see change happening in a faster, quicker and fairer way.  Deputy Leddin asked what we would do.  We are saying the Government should do more and make it happen faster.<\/p> <p>My party has outlined its policies and put them down on paper.  This is not about my party, however.  It is about what the Green Party said it would do.<\/p> <p> Deputy Leddin said that he wanted us to talk about numbers so I will give him one number tonight, a key number and that is 7%.  During the negotiations to form a Government, one apparent red line was a 7% per annum reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  That was a green line from the Green Party.  It put 17 questions to Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and the first one was whether they would commit to an average annual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 7%.  Apparently, this was a red line for the party and it worked because the Green Party got it into the programme for Government.  The programme for Government states that the Government is \"committed to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse emissions\".  This is reiterated four times over two pages.  There is reference to a 7% average reduction and yet when we get the carbon budgets and get the opportunity to scrutinise them, it turns out that it is not 7% but 5.7%.<\/p> <p> Deputy Leddin is correct to state that we heard from some very eminent people during our discussions at the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action.  He is also correct in saying that the CCAC has very highly qualified and passionate members.  Some very highly qualified and passionate scientists also appeared before the joint committee.  One of those scientists, Professor Barry McMullin, indicated that while the programme for Government contains an explicit commitment to an average reduction in total emissions of 7% per year over the period 2021 to 2030, the current carbon budgets amount to an annual reduction of just under 6% per year.  It was not just Professor McMullin and the other scientists who appeared before the joint committee who said this; the CCAC also said it.  The council stated that in the scenarios considered by the joint committee, the average rate of emissions over the ten-year period covering the first two carbon budgets would be approximately 5.7% per annum.  This is not something that I, independent scientists and various environmental NGOs are saying; it is the CCAC saying that the carbon budgets will not meet the 7% target.<\/p> <p> We can talk about what other parties are doing, but the Green Party is in government.  Ultimately, the 7% was written into the programme for Government.  It was a key commitment and red-line issue for the Green Party but, unfortunately, the carbon budgets are not going to meet that promise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600058#NNN00300","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649263800,"counter":384,"content":"<p>That is not true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600059#OOO00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1649263800,"counter":385,"content":"<p>Did the CCAC get that number wrong?

This is what the budgetary process has come out with.  We had debates on this matter at the joint committee and I and other members of that committee repeatedly raised our concerns about it.  Unfortunately, however, our concerns were not taken on board.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of what we need to do, we can have all the plans we want, we can have carbon budgets, the climate action plan and the Act, but the real issue is implementation.  That is the most important element.  Often there is too much rhetoric, too many plans and not enough movement or action.  When I look at the key actions promised by Government I absolutely hope that it gets this right because in three year's time when we are facing into another election, I do not want to realise that the targets are not being met and the implementation is not there.  At that stage, we will not have the time to ramp up to get it done properly.  I honestly and truly want this to happen and for the Government to get it right but on wind energy, for example, the sector is saying that we are not on target to meet the 2030 targets.  Retrofitting is going to be an incredible challenge.  The way in which the programme is being rolled out is not reflective of a just transition.  A huge number of people in our communities will not be able to afford to retrofit their homes.  We are relying on wealthier individuals who are in a position to either fund the work themselves or take out loans to do so.  The majority of people are so stressed about feeding their children, buying school uniforms, making their mortgage repayments and paying for food and fuel that they will not be able to think about taking out loans in order to make their homes warm and comfortable, regardless of how much we need them to do that from a climate perspective.  It makes sense that people would want their homes to be warm and comfortable, but they will not be in a position to get the necessary work done.  That is a big gap with the retrofitting programme.  It forgets about the low- and middle-income earners who will not be able to afford it.<\/p>  <p>  When we talk about transport, we need to move people not into electric vehicles but onto public transport and yet I have not seen any improvements in my constituency.  I have not seen the type of transformational change we need in transport.  The Connecting Ireland plan, the whole purpose of which is to bring public transport to rural Ireland, which is where we really need to expand it, received &euro;5 million in funding this year.  That is a paltry amount.  This must be transformational.  We need to put everything into it and we need to do it quickly.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to talk about consultation.  In his speech, the Minister said there was consultation with the joint committee and the public and also input from the CCAC but we need to move beyond tick-the-box style consultation.  Were any changes made to the carbon budgets as a result of the public consultation?  How many people made submissions?  They have not been published yet and there is no indication of the numbers who made submissions or whether their contributions were taken into account.  I do not think there were any changes made as a result of the recommendations of the committee.  There were 36 recommendations in its report.  As Deputy Leddin said, we worked long and hard and passionately to bring forward those 36 recommendations and get agreement on them.  I am interested to know if they were taken into account.  Where is the public consultation?  Will the Government be publishing that?  Will people be able to see where their input was heard?  That is really important.  If we want people to engage in this process and if we want to bring communities along, we need to make sure that when they do participate, it means something.  I ask the Minister to come back with details of what will happen with that consultation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600059#OOO00900","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1649263800,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I will begin by taking up the point made by the previous speaker in respect of this and other issues with which the State is dealing whereby we tend to leave people behind.  For me, consultation is extremely important.  The outcome of that consultation is even more important.<\/p> <p>We do not factor that in at the early stages in order to impress on people that their concerns, suggestions or ambitions are heard.  In order to gain the support of people, we need to deal with the issues they are grappling with at this time.<\/p> <p> The programme for Government was written at a time when we did not know what the financial impact of Covid would be.  We did not know about the Russian war or the Brexit issues that continue to knock us off course in terms of our economic development.  At today's meeting of the finance committee, at which we discussed many matters relating to this issue, we were told that there would be offsets.  I do not know what those offsets will be.  My concern is for those who cannot afford to heat their homes and those who are concerned about whether they will be able to afford their weekly shopping.  I am concerned about the marginalised, the elderly and the sick.  I wonder how they are going to afford this.  Today, I am told there will be offsets.  Does that mean that the offsets, in some way by payment through another means, will put the money back into the pockets of these people?<\/p> <p> I listened to the Taoiseach when he said that nobody will be worse off.  Today, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, indicated that that would be the case and that he is currently in negotiations with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his Department.  We should know all of these things now so that we can tell our constituents that there is no need to worry and how this is going to work.  If one were cynical about these things, one would say that it is like a three-card trick.  On one side, the money comes and we honour our obligation to the environment, the programme for Government, the Green Party and anyone else - all of us in this House want to protect the environment - and, on the other, the money slips back out into the pockets of whomever is affected.  That is what I take from it.<\/p> <p> I want to highlight all of those people I have just mentioned and the fact that they need to know where they are going.  A responsible Government that is concerned about its people and protecting them will explain in layman's language where we are going with this, what the cost will mean for people, businesses and farmers and how that cost will be offset for those who are in difficulty.  The people in difficulty are many.  For example, the contractors were in last week.  They told us that they may not be able to get diesel to do their annual contracting work, be it in forestry or farming.  They want diesel ring-fenced in order that they can be sure they will have a supply of it.  That is not mention the cost of diesel.  The farming community has stated that its inputs in terms of general farm work are significantly higher.  In terms of the offsets we are being told will be there, what is in it for the farmers and the hauliers?  Another group that is affected are the growers.  For example, a man who is growing tomatoes down near Wexford told me his energy bill has increased to &euro;100,000.  He is dealing with the multiples.  The multiples are dictating the price that they will pay for his produce.  He will not be in business because he will not be able to carry that cost.  There are other areas where the costs can be passed on.  At the end of the day, it is the customer in the supermarket and so on who will pay the cost.  If a company is being levied with a 7% or 10% diesel surcharge in order for the transport company to stay in business, because that company is not a charity it is going to pass on that charge to the customer, which inevitably will feed into the increased costs associated with food and everything else that comes from the supply line.  As I said, every now and then, we will be hit with a Brexit issue which will knock everything off course.<\/p> <p> In terms of retrofitting, those who are serious about their homes and the environment and want to sell back to the grid are not able to do that.  At the moment, they get no credit for what is sent back to the grid.  Again, it is a case of the cart being put before the horse.  These are issues that should have been sorted out long before now in order for people to be convinced that they are part of what we are doing here in terms of regulation and carbon budgets, or any other budgets for that matter.<\/p> <p> There are questions that are not being answered for them.  All they hearing is the term \"carbon tax\" and they are relating that to the increases of one kind or another in food, energy and utility bills.  In rural Ireland, it is very different than it is in urban centres where there is public transport and access to services and facilities.  Earlier this week, the five Deputies representing Carlow-Kilkenny were asked on radio if we would car pool and travel here together.  That may be a great idea.  It may be an even better idea for us to use public transport but none of that meets our needs because there are different demands on each of us.  There are different demands on the public.  We do not have the public transport to allow us play our part in all of this.  I would like to know what is going to be done about that.<\/p> <p> Similarly, with respect, the Minister has suggested various ways and means by which households can contribute by cutting down on showers, car journeys and so on.  It needs to be realised that families throughout the country are already doing that.  At the various junctions on the ring road around our city and Carlow are cars that are parked up because people are sharing their transport to work, school or college in another county.  That is already happening.  Some people are doing that because of the environment.  Most are doing it because they cannot afford the cost.<\/p> <p> In regard to the price of oil and so on, the rate of mineral oil tax on 1,000 l was &euro;120 in March.  It is set to increase further to &euro;138 and then to &euro;158.  Likewise, with petrol.  We cannot escape the fact that this is all being put upon the shoulders of people that are already carrying a burden in terms of their financial circumstances such that it is impossible for them to make ends meet or to participate fully in the development of a sound green economy with positive impacts for the environment.  They want to play their part.  I have never before seen at my clinics so many people who are suffering some form of poverty.  It may be that they have cut down on all sorts of things or that they cannot afford to pay for certain things.  There are those on low incomes and some in the squeezed middle who are so tied up in debt they too are experiencing difficulties.  We have to understand that in this House.  We cannot continue to impose extra charges on them.  I am not against carbon tax, as I stated publicly during the week, but I want a sensible approach to it.  If that sensible approach involves offsets, then I would like to know what those offsets are.  If Europe is looking at the possibility of reducing VAT or allowing us to reduce VAT, then tell us that.<\/p> <p>Plan for the short term and the long term.  Explain to the people we represent the different steps we will take along that journey.  If that happens, we might not hear scary stories from people who are concerned because they are running businesses and finding it hard to make a profit or are not making a profit.  Farmers and others are in the same boat as businesses generally.  They are uncertain about the future.  We cannot forget those people living on the poverty line.  They too are watching what we are doing and how we are doing it, and considering how it will impact their lives.<\/p> <p> I ask the Government to tell us please what the offsets are.  I ask it to tell us what it is doing about VAT at European level.  I ask it to stop sending out messages that are confusing people.  Stop telling people to cut back on different things in their homes and businesses and understand that people are already doing those things our of necessity.  Listen to the various groups that come to us and plead with us to listen to their case.  Bring forward some form of package to assist them.  The Government should reach out to those people and tell them what plan it has.<\/p> <p> My problem is the lack of information that the public is getting.  It is getting mixed messages.  Perhaps as a result of pressure applied by backbenchers or the Opposition, the Government has finally come to the point where in dealing with the carbon tax, it is going to have offsets and Europe is going to reduce VAT.  People must plan now for the future.  Business plans for the future.  All I am asking is that we would hear about any plans in the House so we can tell the people we represent about the plan in order to reduce their worry and concern.  There is enough of that in life as it is.  There are enough people suffering form all sorts of illnesses and mental issues as it is.  I call on the Government to be helpful rather than vague.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600059#OOO01000","speaker":"1496","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649265000,"counter":395,"content":"<p>All of us understand and agree that this motion on carbon budgets is about setting the destination to which we want to get.  We all share a common bond in our desire to get to that destination.  Where we may have disagreements is in the route that we take.  There are, of course, difficulties for many sectors when we get into this issue and try to deal with it.  There are also opportunities for many sectors and we should not forget that.  We all acknowledge that.<\/p>  <p>  The farming sector is one of the areas that has the most difficulty.  The people in that sector are very concerned about the situation.  The farmers in my part of the world are mainly beef and suckler farmers who sell their cattle on.  They are fearful that their whole model of farming will come under pressure.  They anticipate pressure being put on them to reduce the herd but at the same time they see Europe, which we are all part of, doing trade deals with places like Latin America, where they are talking about cutting down rainforests in order to allow more beef to be produced.  Those rainforests are, or were, the lungs of the earth.  That interconnectedness is not lost on the ordinary farmers in Ballinagleragh or Ballysadare or anywhere like that.  They are keyed in and understand the situation.  They are angry that these things are being foisted on them and they see an unfairness in all of it.  That needs to be addressed.  It is not enough to tell farmers and people in the farming sector that there are going to be opportunities.  It needs to be spelt out to them where those opportunities are and how they are going to be delivered.<\/p>  <p>  I attended a farmers' meeting approximately four years ago.  Someone at that meeting was talking about putting solar panels on the roofs of farmers' sheds and how it was going to be an opportunity for farmers.  I have been listening to that proposal since I came into this House in 2016 and it still has not happened.  I cannot for the life of me understand why.  With all due respect to the Green Ministers and the Green Party members of the Government, I would have expected the Green Party to have sorted that out quickly when it got into government.  That is just one example.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue about the opportunities that may arise is the doubt around the income that is possible to be generated.  Farmers, and everyone else in society, want to see what opportunities there are.  If we are talking about new green energy, a new green programme and a new sustainable future, there must be opportunities in that.  There must be jobs and incomes for people.  We need to see where those opportunities are going to be and how we can deliver them.<\/p>  <p>  There is a retrofitting scheme in place at the moment.  I have met several people, as I am sure all of us have, who have come to my office and asked when, where and how they can get the grant.  Most of us do not have answers for them.  We should have.  We should be able to tell them whether they will qualify or not.  We should be able to tell them what rate of grant they are going to get and how they can source it.  The biggest question they have is who is going to do the work for them.  They want to know where the materials are going to come from.  Those are real and serious problem that people have.<\/p>  <p>  There is general consensus on our carbon budgets and where we want to get to over the coming years.  There is also general consensus in the community.  Most ordinary people have a keen understanding that this is something they can do.  They want to work at it and pursue those goals.  They want a more sustainable future for their children and their children's children but they need assistance.  There is a bit of a disconnect in being able to deliver that.<\/p>  <p>  We often meet people who ask us about the retrofitting scheme.  An elderly person who wants to get a grant to put new windows into a house can approach the local authority.  He or she will then be told that if their household income is less than &euro;30,000, a 95% grant is available.  If their income is more than &euro;40,000, a 50% is available.  If their income is between &euro;50,000 and &euro;60,000, a 30% grant is available.  No grant is available if one has an income higher than &euro;60,000.  That is logical and clear.  Why can we not take a similar approach when it comes to retrofitting houses?  Why can we not say that the people who are on the smallest incomes and trying to manage while raising a family can get a higher level of grant and those with higher incomes, perhaps &euro;100,000 or more, will get a much lower grant?  Why can we not do that to try to bring balance back into the situation?  That is one of the things that really frustrates people.<\/p>  <p>  The big issue is the access to funding.  We are told that a large part of the issue relates to energy and where we get our energy from.  I certainly feel there are big opportunities in green energy, offshore wind and solar power.  However, we need investment.  The Government needs to be prepared to say that the investment will have to come first.  We need big investment from the Government to be able to deliver those alternative energy sources.  We need to be able to produce clean green energy.  There is no point in people having electric cars when the energy that is driving those cars is coming from a gas-fuelled power station or some other fossil fuel power station.<\/p>  <p>  We need to get this right.  We are all in it together and we understand that.  The destination is clear but the route to it is unclear for many people.  The real job of the Government is to make a clearer route for people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600061#QQQ00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1649265000,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot; and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&quot;having reflected on the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, declines to accept the carbon budgets presented for 2021-2025 and for 2026-2030 as:   \t&mdash; they are not aligned with the State's commitments entered into under the Paris Agreement; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; therefore, calls on the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications to consult with the Climate Change Advisory Council in order to amend the budgets accordingly; and further calls for a revision in the third budget to ensure it reflects our climate obligations based on the latest science and the principles of climate justice.&quot;. <\/blockquote>  <p>I will go through the amendment in order to make it clear to people what we are saying.  We propose the deletion of the current motion agreeing to the current inadequate carbon budgets.  We replace it with text stating that having reflected on the most recent  IPCC report, the D&aacute;il declines to accept the carbon budgets presented for 2021 to 2025 and for 2026 to 2030 as they are not aligned with the State's commitments entered into the treaty signed in Paris in 2015, and calls on the Minister to consult with the advisory council to amend the budgets accordingly.  Our amended motion further calls for a revision in the third budget to ensure it reflects our climate obligations based on the latest science and the principles of climate justice.<\/p><p>Listening to this debate, I must ask what we are doing here.  It is only days since the third working group report of the IPCC.  The co-chair has told us that it is now or never if we are going to avoid going over 1.5&deg;C.  The UN Secretary General put it adroitly and accurately when he stated: &quot;Some government and business leaders are saying one thing but doing another.  Simply put, they are lying.&quot;<\/p><p>The IPCC report is clear that we are on a trajectory to absolute disaster and catastrophe and the only thing that can avert it is deep economic and structural change or, in other words, a complete revolution in how are societies and economies are organised.  Instead of taking action, most of the people and political parties here, including the Green Party, and the world, are just rearranging the deckchairs on the <i>Titanic<\/i>.<\/p> <p>Even worse than that, we are pushing the <i>Titanic<\/i>further into the water through the EU signing up for a long-term deal with the US to ensure demand for 50 billion cu. m of US liquefied natural gas until at least 2030.  We are signing up for more fossil fuels and more fossil fuel infrastructure that will then have to be used for decades to produce a profit.<br\/><br\/>What we have before us is simply not in line with the science.  The Chairman of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, who is a member of the Green Party, earlier anticipated that we in People Before Profit would make the argument that the budgets presented are not adequate.  He knew we would do that because he was at that committee meetings when scientist after scientist said very clearly that this was not enough and would not contribute to staying under 1.5&deg;C of global warming.  He went on to say he does not think free public transport is the answer and that he does not think banning data centres will help.  I happen to think that it will.  What we need is a significant reduction in energy usage and material throughput, on a global basis, but that can be done in a way that also improves people's lives with measures such as free public transport, a four-day week without loss of pay, retrofitting and saying we do not need data centres with all the algorithms and everything else.  Let us use the energy we have to improve people's lives.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Leddin does not agree with those measures.  That is fine; no problem.  However, let us at least start with carbon budgets that are based on science.  Then we can work out what policies we need to get there.  We do not have that to start with.  It is a complete abject failure by the Government and the Green Party that they have brought forward carbon budgets that simply do not measure up.  What is contained in the carbon budgets is less than what is in the programme for Government.  What is in the programme for Government is less than the EU commitments.  The EU commitments are less than what is demanded in the Paris Agreement.  Bit by bit, there is a complete disconnection from what the science is saying.  That is because these budgets are attuned to political realities, rather than making the case to people about what we need to do and then finding a way to do it.  We think it can be done in a way that improves the lives of ordinary people as opposed to making their lives harder.<br\/><br\/>The overall target in the Act of a 51% cut in emissions by 2030 is insufficient.  It is particularly insufficient when taking into account the obligations set out in the Paris Agreement &quot;to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances&quot;.  Ireland is a developed country.  It is the fifth wealthiest country in the world <i>per capita<\/i>, although obviously most people do not feel that; it is the billionaires who feel it.  That is why we need a much faster trajectory.  We should be aiming for a zero-carbon economy by 2030.<br\/><br\/>Second, the budgets make no provision for, or do not account for, emissions from shipping or aviation.  For a country like Ireland, that is quite an omission.  We are just going to ignore these emissions.  We are not going to count them on our balance sheet and other countries will not count them on their balance sheets.  That way, we all sail on towards catastrophe with our eyes wide open but everyone can pat themselves on the back because they had a carbon budget.  The carbon budgets use a baseline of 2018.  It is not 1990, which is what we should use, and not even 2015, when the Paris Agreement was signed.  The consequence is that we get higher budgets than we would otherwise be allowed if we used a baseline of 2020.  It does not even include the Government's own programme for cuts of 7% per annum.  The eminent scientist Professor Barry McMullin calculates that these budgets amount to an average of 6% worth of reductions per year, and that the CCAC's budget amounts to 495 metric tonnes of CO<sub>2<\/sub>equivalent, not 468, which is how much it would be if a 7% cut per year was delivered.<br\/><br\/>The budgets are also less ambitious than what is recommended by the EU.  The EU looked for cuts of 55% by 2030, rather than 51%, and uses 1990 as the base year rather than 2018.  If 1990 was used in the advisory council's carbon budgets, they would provide for a reduction of just 45%, not 51%.  There is clever accounting going on to try to pretend that something closer to the science is being done here.  The budgets are less ambitious than the United Nations Environment Programme's emissions gap report, which called for cuts from 2020 to 2030 of 7.6% per year to be in with a 50:50 chance of limiting warming to under 1.5&deg;C.<br\/><br\/>The carbon budgets are not compliant with the Paris Agreement and its obligation to reduce emissions in a fair and equitable way between richer nations and poorer ones.  Quite outrageously, the Climate Change Advisory Council essentially says this is not its job.  It states, &quot;It is not the job of the Council or the Carbon Budget Committee to make such value judgements.&quot;  Conversely, the point was made by scientist Dr. Andrew Jackson that, according to the climate Act, &quot;CCAC is specifically required by law ... to carry out its functions in a manner consistent with implementation of the Paris Agreement 'to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities&quot;.  The carbon budgets back-load the cuts to the second budget, with cuts of just 4.8% per year for the first five years and cuts of 8.3% for the second five-year budget.  As well as the political reality that this Government will be gone, the consequence of that is that any slippage in the first five years, and there already is some slippage, will be very hard to fix in subsequent years.  Some stuff takes time - there is no question about that - but there are things that could be done immediately, like, for example, free public transport, rolling out mass retrofitting, and so on.<br\/><br\/>A very concerning point was made in the most recent IPCC report.  It noted that the whole world, including these carbon budgets, is reliant on the deployment of vast unproven future technologies to deliver net-zero by 2050.  The advisory council itself admits that future targets rely on carbon capture and storage technology, massive carbon sequestration and land use that is neither planned for nor possible at present.  That is like relying on a future fairy tale presented to us by some of the techno-modernists who suggest we do not really need to worry about this today because a magic solution is around the corner, as opposed to dealing with the science that is presented before us.<br\/><br\/>At the committee, Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith proposed reductions of a further 67 metic tonnes of CO<sub>2<\/sub>equivalent to account for aviation and shipping emissions, as well as our obligations under the Paris Agreement, but all of those amendments were rejected by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party.  For that reason, we should not accept these budgets.  We should send them back and come back with budgets that are actually in line with the science.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600061#QQQ00300","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649265600,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I have great respect for my constituency colleague, Deputy Paul Murphy, and he makes very compelling arguments.

I was reminded continuously during the Deputy's contribution of the movie \"Don't Look Up\".  Therein lies the challenge.  I am thinking of the Acting Chairman, who has some very young children.  If they understood half of what was going on - given their youth, not their lack of intelligence - they would wonder why we are not being more urgent about this.<\/p> <p>What is frustrating for someone like me is we were here having this same debate a number of years ago.  That is where one of the differences is.  In a previous contribution I praised the Greens because they have kept this item on the agenda and initiated this as a topic of conversation when no one wanted to know about it.  They persisted and politics and society owe them a debt for that, which can often be easy to underestimate.  They did so when it was politically unpopular but this issue has now gone mainstream, which is a welcome development.  I often offer constructive criticism to the Minister in that he has been radical on the macro stuff, which is important because it embeds measures in law and that has been done for the first time here.  He deserves great credit for that, as do his Government partners for negotiating the agreement on it with him.  It is the micro things that appeal to people on the ground because it is in those areas that people can make a significant difference in the way they live their lives, do things and contribute to the reduction of their individual carbon footprint and they can be proud of that.<\/p> <p> I know Members started to talk about the carbon tax this evening and I do not blame them for doing so because it is topical but carbon budgeting is essentially trying to reduce the carbon emissions on an annual basis and it is about setting particular targets to achieve that.  It is well past time for this to even be debated but I used to be strong in my opinion on the following point.  Countries like Denmark regionalise those budgets and I would have thought that carbon budgeting on a local authority basis would have been a competitive and attractive thing in Ireland.  It would have also given individuals in each county, residential area and parish a sense of pride, for example, if somebody converted to a hybrid or electric car in a parish that would result in a reduction in the carbon footprint of that parish for the year and that kind of thing could be measured on a league table basis.  We go for the national carbon budgeting and I understand why that is so.  To have localised it more might have made it a little bit more understandable.<\/p> <p> I have mentioned some of the changes previously.  I got a lift from a taxi driver recently and I said this at a recent parliamentary party meeting.  He availed of the &euro;25,000 grant for an electric vehicle and had to borrow a little on top of it.  He bought it from a supplier and the supplier claimed the grant from the National Transport Authority, which resulted in the taxi driver paying substantially less and then having to claim back.  The reduction was front-loaded for the taxi driver.  We should look at doing that for people who are retrofitting their houses and let the contractor apply for the grant.  That would open up retrofitting to an awful lot more people because what puts them off retrofitting is that there is a big grant but they have to have a lot of money in their pockets to avail of that big grant whereas if the onus was on the contractor being employed under certain protocols to claim the grant back then people would need substantially less money to start going for retrofits in the first place.  We should have introduced e-scooters on the city bike rental scheme two years ago.  Imagine the reduction in our carbon footprint if we had brought them in.  Imagine if, as I have mentioned for three years, we had allowed companies that purchased e-bikes for their employees to claim 100% of the cost of that back in tax.  Imagine how many electric bikes there would be on our streets in our urban areas and cities if that had happened and the reduction there would have been in our carbon footprint.  Those are the things that make meaningful differences to people's lives and allow them to make a tangible impression on the reduction of our carbon footprint.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600062#RRR00400","speaker":"1572","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649266200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I know the Ceann Comhairle has stepped out but I want to pay tribute to him for hosting President Zelenskyy earlier.  He spoke passionately and emotively from the heart and he represented the views of the people of Ireland.  I commend the Minister, who also spoke most eloquently.  It was wonderful to hear him namecheck and quote some of the 21 previous speakers who had addressed the Houses.  It put the momentum of today in context.  I congratulate him on that.<\/p>  <p>  On the business at hand, we are facing the perfect storm.  On the one hand we are warned of impending environmental doom if we do not take decisive action and, on the other, we have hard-pressed families throughout the country creaking at the seams and desperately trying to make ends meet.  While everybody in this Chamber is well insulated from the worst of the crisis, our communities are ravaged by a cost-of-living crisis.  Some would have us choose between the environment and aiding these families in the deepest and darkest of financial hardship as we face into potential double digit inflation.  I hasten to add that inflationary pressures will not abate and will ultimately wipe out any potential pay rises on a whim.  It is possible and incumbent on us to tackle both challenges.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot control the war in Ukraine or oil prices.  We are a price taker, not an oil producer, and all these issues are beyond us but we must go to the kernel of the issue and make any and every effort to address the cost-of-living challenge.  We can take real and meaningful actions to assist families who are struggling.  We have heard many calls to pause the carbon tax but the impact of doing that will be minuscule.  A reduction in VAT will assist and I commend An Taoiseach on his efforts at EU level in this regard.  I also welcome the comments in recent days from him that he, the Cabinet and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, are working towards a series of cost-of-living support measures that will hopefully be announced towards the end of the month.  The only way to genuinely help families in this time of crisis is if we put money directly back into their pockets.  We have already seen a significant Exchequer boost in VAT revenues as a result of soaring fuel costs.  That money needs to be ring-fenced and put directly back into the pockets of those who have been worst affected.  We have the means and mechanisms in place that will allow us to directly address these issues.<\/p>  <p>  We have to further broaden the eligibility for the fuel allowance and we also need to allow departmental officials flexibility and discretion when it comes to awarding the payment.  If people are &euro;5 or &euro;10 over the income threshold for the fuel allowance that should not preclude them from receiving it in this time of crisis because the reality is that a bale of briquettes costs &euro;6 and &euro;10 will not buy a half bag of coal.  To be arguing with somebody over &euro;5 or &euro;10 when it comes to applying for the fuel allowance seems derisory and insulting in this case.  We also need a once-off fuel allowance payment in the month of May.  This will cushion people into the summer as they prepare for the worst excesses of what will have been a difficult winter.  This should be a full payment of &euro;914 because the average oil bill is in the region of &euro;720 and average electricity bills are in the order of &euro;500.  There is also a compelling case to be made to extend the fuel allowance to family carers as the carer's payment is not a qualifying payment for the fuel allowance.  In addition, it is estimated that one in five family carers is not in receipt of a carer's payment.  It is important that we extend the eligibility of the fuel allowance to many of these households because they are the ones that have been most adversely affected by the cost of fuel and these are the families that needed the heat most over the hard winter months.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the hard-pressed middle income families who heretofore have seen no break, help or assistance apart from an electricity credit of &euro;200 and whatever benefit they gleaned from the reduction in fuel excise duty.  We have an immediate and ready solution that can address the issues for these people.  We have a network of community welfare offices across the country and among those numbers we can count some of the hardest working, most efficient and most empathetic civil servants we have in this country.  They have their fingers on the pulse and they can see first-hand the challenges and difficulties that families are facing on a daily basis.<\/p> <p>We need to give these community welfare offices a once-off fund, derived from money ring-fenced from the windfall from VAT on fuel in recent months.  We should allow hard-pressed middle income families to access that fund.  That is the only way that we will address the crisis that families across the country are facing.  We need to start putting money back into their pockets.  These are real changes that will make a meaningful difference and will not be hoovered up by energy companies, as we have seen so far.<\/p> <p> This is not a debate about them or us or about environmentalists versus climate sceptics.  An Taoiseach put it most eloquently earlier this week when he said it is about safeguarding the future for our children and their children.  It is also about safeguarding the people in our communities, who need us now more than ever.  They are turning to us with voices of despair and anger.  They are asking for us, as a Government and legislators, to do something meaningful and tangible, by putting money back into their pockets to take the pressure off them.  I have outlined three or four tangible measures and solutions that could address the cost of living crisis and could directly affect more than 700,000 households throughout the country.  At the same time, crucially, we can do this.  We can make a real and meaningful difference to those households.  At the same time, we can maintain momentum on the environmental challenge that looms large for the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600063#SSS00200","speaker":"1597","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649266800,"counter":404,"content":"<p>Several people contacted me about increases in carbon tax on foot of this debate.

It is out of touch with the increase in the cost of living, as was said by the Minister's colleague just before me, that ordinary workers and families must endure.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is still doing many things that increase emissions rather than reduce them.  Data centres are still being added to the grid.  There was a bad policy by the previous Government that wanted to make Ireland the data capital of the world.  This plan gave no consideration to the impact that this would have on carbon emissions.  The current Government is standing by idly as the volume of electricity that data centres use could reach 30% of all electricity used in the State by 2030.

I would like to shift the focus to the built environment.  Approximately 30% of our emissions come from the built environment, 20% from operational emissions relating to energy use and efficiency, and approximately 10% from the embodied carbon and materials used in the building of new infrastructure, homes, roads, schools, hospitals and so on.  My colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, earlier outlined our support for an ambitious, just retrofitting plan, and his concerns with respect to the plan presented by Government.  Even if the Government meets all of its targets, while operational emissions in the built environment will reduce, under the NDP, embodied carbon emissions are likely to increase unless we take significant action.  Last year, the Irish Green Building Council published a good report that outlined many pathways to reduce embodied emissions.  Both the Minister and this side of the House would fully agree on their implementation.  If we are serious about reducing embodied carbon, then we have to accept that whatever we build in the future has to be built differently.  We have to consider what is built, and how and where it is built.<\/p>  <p>  I will make some concrete suggestions about areas where our party would be happy to work alongside the Government in future to reduce those embodied carbon emissions.  We have to accept a clear phase-out target for high-carbon cement, not unlike what we have done with gas boilers as part of near-zero energy buildings.  We should set a date, on foot of the sectoral emissions targets that were announced, for phasing out high-carbon cement, both for concrete and bricks.  The technology is available in Ireland to produce lower-carbon cement and concrete products.  It costs exactly the same as older technology and there is no reason we cannot have an ambitious phase-out for those projects.<\/p>  <p>  We have to shift away from high-carbon products such as steel, cement and concrete to the new technologies that are being used much more comprehensively in Scandinavia, Britain, France and continental Europe.  A number of good small companies in Ireland produce high-quality timber products, not for timber-framed homes, but for a completely new form of technology for building houses, schools and other public buildings.  In many cases, it is zero-carbon and, in some cases, the emissions content is negative carbon.  More importantly, it is cheaper, faster and higher quality.  We need Government to be far more ambitious in the use of these technologies.  If it is, it will have our active support.  That also means we need to address issues with planning.  We need to see the new rural planning guidelines published to make sure they complement all of these strategies.  We need to have far more mid-rise, high-density development in our cities and town centres.  We want to work with the Minister on these areas.  We urge him to be ambitious.  If he is, he will have active support from our party on this side of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600064#TTT00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1649266800,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I learned from a constituent in the past couple of days that it is the practice of the ESB to apply a low usage charge at a fixed rate of &euro;38.28 for a 66-day period.  The low usage charge applies when usage drops below 125 kWh.  It is the practice of a State-owned body to penalise consumers for reducing their electricity consumption.  The Minister currently encourages consumers to reduce the time they spend in the shower and to change the times they use their washing machines and dishwashers, with other such measures to reduce their ESB bills, in the full knowledge that this is a complete fallacy, as those low-income earners and pressed middle class people will be the subject of a low usage charge if they take his advice.<\/p>  <p>  It is patently clear that he is completely out of touch with reality and the challenges facing those on middle incomes in Ireland.  Will he explain why Electric Ireland is allowed to apply higher standing charges to those customers who use low volumes of electricity?  Surely any sensible energy or climate policy should reward those who use less energy rather than punishing them?  Last year, I was one of only ten Deputies to vote against the climate action legislation.  My decision is now vindicated, especially when I see the consequences for the people of rural Ireland.  My opposition to the Bill was not as a climate change denier but as a realist.  My opposition is because I know the solutions being proposed to deal with climate change are contradictory and ineffective, and will tax the poorest in society.<\/p>  <p>  This practice of charging higher fees for people who use less electricity is another example in a long list of contradictions when it comes to the Government's approach to climate change.  Different members of Government seem to be attributing the blame for the cost-of-living crisis to the invasion of Ukraine.  The reality is that the biggest cause of the crisis has been the implementation of poorly thought-out energy policies that have resulted in rising costs, coupled with the consequences of Brexit.  These policies include shutting down energy production in Ireland and instead importing peat from eastern Europe, banning gas exploration and instead buying Russian gas abroad, and imposing carbon taxes on fuel and home heating oil and then applying VAT on the tax.  These are just some examples of how Government behaviour has contributed to the current problems.<\/p>  <p>  The climate action Bill is about carbon credits, another fallacious policy.  It basically states that the Government does not care how much CO2 is emitted, as long as it is outsourced to some other country.<\/p> <p>Government policy penalises our own farmers with taxes, regulations and charges, while indirectly encouraging imported products from places such as Brazil, where thousands of acres of rainforests have been removed to create room to meet their farming needs.  These have been produced in an environmentally unfriendly way and then transported here using the very fuel that the Government is trying to encourage us not to use.  In full view of the obvious headwinds that face our small island economy, the Government is hell bent on proceeding with an increase in carbon tax.  It appears that the Government does not realise that raising prices will make inflation worse.  It is willing to ignore the facts that this would penalise the most marginalised in society.  It is prepared to ignore the obvious, disastrous consequences for our economy in terms of unemployment and wage demands.<\/p> <p> The people need initiatives that will deal with inflation, not initiatives that will compound inflation.  All of this is at a time when our economy faces serious challenges as a result of the war and of the energy crisis.  Let me just highlight again who these carbon taxes affect the most.  They affect the people on lower and middle incomes.  These are the people who spend the highest percentage of their income on essentials, such as heating and food.  Low-income earners are the least able to afford to retrofit houses, or to buy a new electric vehicle.  Retrofitting will benefit those who are on higher incomes, not the squeezed middle.  People in rural areas of Ireland do not have the facility of public transport to avail of to replace their car journey or to go to work to help to reduce their carbon footprint.  They mostly have no choice but to use their car which, today, they can no longer afford.  <\/p> <p> Carbon taxes are anti-poor, anti-rural and anti-logic and should not be implemented without first having an alternative that the consumer can avail of.  If the carbon tax increase goes ahead in May, it would be another clear public demonstration that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are willing to ignore the struggling people and, instead, capitulate once again to the Green Party&rsquo;s agenda in order to ensure that the Government does not fall.  It is not too late for the Government to do the right thing.  I say it again: the Government must remove its 55% tax take from all fuel until the war is over and until risks have abated.  It will save jobs, it will save the economy and it will maintain the standard of living.<\/p> <p> When I put this proposal to the House two months ago, some in the Government condemned it as the madness from a mad cow.  It appears some economists are now catching the same mad cow disease and are agreeing with that proposal.  Today, David McWilliams noted a similar view, as did others on this side of the House.  Thankfully, they are now beginning to see these policies being of no benefit to the people.  Events are beginning to resemble 2008 more and more by the day.  The application of carbon taxes is Cromwellian and will tax the majority in society into penury.  The people will not stand for it and neither will I.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600064#TTT00400","speaker":"1622","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649267400,"counter":408,"content":"<p>Ireland has set itself the ambitious targets of a 50% reduction in carbon output by 2030 and of carbon neutrality by 2050.  The recent IPCC report again outlines the significant challenges that are facing mankind and our need to prevent global temperature increases above 1.5&deg;C over the coming years and decades.  We need to significantly change our consumption habits and our energy use if we are to have any hope of achieving these goals set out in the climate policy.  We must play our part, but climate goals must be implemented in the fairest way possible to ensure that no parts of our economy are targeted through unjust climate emission reduction targets.  I am referring here most pointedly to the agricultural sector and specifically to the national herd.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, mentioned in his introduction the plans to reduce chemical nitrogen through the use of multi-seed pastoral land sward.  I fully support this policy.  In fact, I accompanied the Minister of State on a visit to Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, and specifically, to the agricultural area of WIT.  Significant research has been ongoing there on the development of pastoral land sward, with the stated intention of reducing chemical nitrogen and emissions.  Despite the Minister of State&rsquo;s aspirations to developments in this area, I can tell him that a funding application to further enhance the living laboratory project, which is ongoing at WIT and which is central to the pastoral land research there, was refused funding by our national research bodies.  They are obviously working to a different agenda than the Minister of State.  <\/p>  <p>  In the south east, where the agrifood sector is the most significant economic driver, and where dairy, beef, lamb and tillage production are economically and culturally intertwined, I would like to see actions to back up the Minister of State's statements around developing options for reducing agricultural emissions.  Multi-seed sward, reducing chemical nitrogen and fertilisers, rotating feed stocks, wet lands and tree planting all have a part to play in reducing farm emissions.  These must be fully considered before any sectoral targets are announced that would reduce our national herd.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, mentioned Government plans to introduce a new forestry plan.  I am not sure what a new plan is going to do, considering the deficits within the existing plan that have been outlined to the Government for over two years and that have not properly addressed the situation as yet.  We can all agree with more afforestation.  We can all agree with more carbon sequestration.  However, how is this to be achieved if we cannot manage the regulatory environment in over two years to help deliver it? <\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State also highlights the need for Ireland to get moving on its renewable generation, particularly on wind.  I have mentioned in the House before the slow development of the maritime area regulatory authority, which will be charged with overseeing the planning of our offshore sea area.  Nothing has been announced by way of wind port investment for Rosslare.  We have all heard how Ireland may have up to ten times its national required wind energy generation offshore.  It is just waiting to be tapped on our eastern, southern and western coasts.  However, who is going to tap it?  Where is the evidence that we in Ireland are trying to create a skillset in understanding manufacturing and deploying offshore wind energy?  Despite all the talk of the vibrant potential industrial sector opportunity that could await for this country, where is the evidence that we are developing science and understanding in this area, that we are implementing in our colleges and our institutes of technology, that we are incentivising research and development grants to engineering companies in this area to pursue wind science and development?  The truth, as far as I can see it, is that we would sell the family silverware yet again by allowing overseas conglomerates to enter our maritime area, to develop commercial wind generation here and to run off and make profits that will be taken overseas.  They will maximise the export potential of our wind, while paying us a pittance in licence fees, all the while charging us up the wazoo for the energy generation that is lying off our shores that we have failed and are failing to capitalise on.<\/p>  <p>  I see no urgency to radically transform how we do business and governance in this country, how we strategically plan, how and who we make responsible to deliver on our stated goals.  We can talk electric cars, wind generation, hydrogen fuel manufacture, biogas and organic digestion, yet we have implemented nothing nationally to adopt any of these technologies to date.  We can talk retrofitting of houses in the midst of the construction crisis, all the while ignoring the complete lack of workers available to deliver on these projects.<\/p>  <p>  The climate action plan can be simply referenced as the need to significantly reduce national production of greenhouse gases.  Deputies such as myself have agreed in principle to support the actions of the Government in a national climate agenda.  I, for one, have had enough of the copious hot air generation that has surrounded much of these debates over the past 20 months.  We now need to see real intent and a visible, balanced plan with real delivery targets and real accountability for those charged with implementing it.  We must do a climate action plan, but we must do it fairly and we must ensure that it takes account of the most vulnerable in our society and in our country, and that it does not damage into the future Ireland&rsquo;s ability to compete internationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600065#UUU00200","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1649267400,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Shanahan.

That might not seem in any way germane to what we are discussing, but I learned a really important lesson that day.  I learned what happened when human excuses meet immutable, external realities.  I bargained in my training.<\/p> <p>I told myself I was too tired or busy that day or that I probably had enough done and would catch it up later.  I took my excuses out onto the roads of Dublin on an October bank holiday weekend and found out by mile 21 that the road just did not care what excuses I had prepared for myself.  I feel that, to some extent, we are doing the same with the climate challenge.  We are bargaining.<br\/><br\/>The language we use is that the science is not clear or the measures are too hard and unpalatable, that the consequences are too far away in terms of time or geography, or that we are small while others are big.  The atmosphere just does not care.  As we change its composition through human activity, it simply traps more and more of the sun's energy.  The science is clear and the impact and effects of climate change are no longer far away.  They are being felt and experienced in the here and now and will continue to intensify in the years and decades ahead.<br\/><br\/>If that was not abundantly clear before, the latest IPCC report published this week has made it so.  One of the IPCC working group co-chairs, Mr. Hans-Otto P&ouml;rtner, stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and the health of the planet.  Any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future. <\/blockquote> <p>I will admit that cost me sleep on Monday night as I listened to the breathing of my three sleeping boys in the other room.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 is part of our Government's response to that call to action.  The carbon budgets being discussed this evening are an outworking of that legislation.<br\/><br\/>A figure of 500 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions is the global carbon budget that scientists predict will give us a 50% chance of limiting global warming to 1.5&deg;C.  That translates to 62 tonnes per person worldwide, which in turn translates to approximately seven years of current <i>per capita <\/i>emissions each year in Ireland, or fewer than five years if we include agriculture.  Total greenhouse gas emissions covered in the carbon budgets are 68.3 megaton CO<sub>2<\/sub>equivalent in 2018.  These numbers are mind-boggling, to be honest, but we must make sense of them.  The baseline year that our climate Act sets out is 2018.  The first two carbon budgets must, therefore, be consistent with a reduction of emissions of 33.5 megaton CO<sub>2<\/sub>equivalent in 2030.<br\/><br\/>The proposed carbon budgets set us on a path to achieve a necessary climate neutrality by 2050 and present the potential to better our resilience to climate change and protect and restore biodiversity.  They also meet the temperature objectives required of us within the Paris Agreement for temperature rise of below 1.5&deg;C.<br\/><br\/>I share some concerns around the backloading of targets into the latter half of this decade.  We must be honest with ourselves, however, and acknowledge that many of the bigger measures that are required will take time to put in place.  We set out an average reduction of 4.8% per annum for the first budget period from 2021 to 2020, an average of 8.3% from 2026 to 2030, and in the third period, which is a provisional budget reduction target, an average of 3.5% year on year.<br\/><br\/>Following on from passing these budgets, we also need to ensure we deliver beart de r&eacute;ir briathar, that we deliver on these actions.  Ms Marie Donnelly, chair of the CCAC, pointed out there is already a &quot;significant [implementation] gap between climate action policy and climate action ... [delivery]&quot;.  She went on to note, &quot;Ireland&rsquo;s failure to meet its targets is due to not matching the ambition of plans with timely and complete delivery of actions.&quot;  Deputy Shanahan alluded to many of those things in that we need to speed up in our implementation.  We have to go further faster, and I heard calls earlier to go deeper and be more ambitious with our climate targets.  I would be all for that but we need to be able to tackle this climate challenge in a way that brings people with us, and, as the Minister often says, this is already a challenge beyond compare.<br\/><br\/>At the start this year, Mr. Ian Talbot, who is the CEO of Chambers Ireland, spoke about decisions made, or perhaps not made, by the State to lock in decades of transport-orientated emissions into the future.  He identified how inactivity has caused the long delay in creating regulatory and planning certainty for offshore renewable energy.  He commented that, &quot;The main benefit to introducing budgeting is that it will no longer allow administrations to defer actions as the rolling five-year budgets require immediate action.&quot;<br\/><br\/>We know that political time horizon struggle to see beyond the next electoral cycle.  In terms of budgeting, that will not do.  We need to be long term and ambitious in these plans.  One particular area in which we can address the twin crises of climate and biodiversity, because one is as serious as the other and they are, of course, interrelated, is land use change and forestry emissions.  The climate action plan set out indicative ranges of emission reductions for pertinent sectors.  I will again quote Mr. Hans-Otto P&ouml;rtner: <\/p><blockquote>\tBy restoring degraded ecosystems and effectively and equitably conserving 30 to 50 per cent of Earth&rsquo;s land, freshwater and ocean habitats, society can benefit from nature&rsquo;s capacity to absorb and store carbon, and we can accelerate progress towards sustainable development...  <\/blockquote> <p>There are things on which we are waiting.  We are waiting on a land use review, a land use plan and a national soil strategy.  Both of these are commitments within the programme for Government.  We are also waiting on an EU nature restoration law to help restore a nature we have already lost.  We need now to begin to plan for the departmental capacity and resources that will be needed to take on that combination and help us restore some of our natural and biological heritage and, at the same time, address land use, land use change and forestry, LULUCF, emissions to see how best we can use our land in terms of carbon sink and carbon sequestration.  These must be acted on and delivered as quickly as humanly possible.<br\/><br\/>I will return briefly to my harsh lesson in 2009.  I did finish that marathon, although, as Deputy Naughten insinuated, perhaps in a time I might not want to share with the House.  Something it taught me was relentless forward progress, however, and that every step we take now must be a step in the right direction.  No matter how hard it is for us to put one foot in front of the other, we must move in that direction.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Philip Boucher-Hayes, who I think is one of our foremost and best journalists in terms of climate reporting, posed the following question when reporting the latest IPCC report:<\/p><blockquote>\tQ: What happens when you put 270 physics, chemistry and environment PhDs in a room for eight years?<br \/><br \/>A: You get a revolutionary manifesto for changing the planet and saving humankind. <\/blockquote> <p>Let us adopt these budgets this evening, as challenging and revolutionary as they are.<br\/><br\/>I will close with the lyrics of a song that has often played in my head since the time of my election, which responds-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600065#UUU00600","speaker":"1617","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649268000,"counter":414,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy going to sing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600066#VVV00300","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1649268000,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I will not sing it; I will spare Deputy McGrath.

It is a tax that is truly unfair and harsh.  It penalises those who can afford it the least.  The Government spends much time talking about the hard decisions on climate change but does not talk about the facts and figures that show ordinary people bear the largest burden when it comes to action on climate change.<\/p>  <p>  The Government does not talk about how data centres take up 10% of the country's electricity and that is expected to rise to a whopping 70% by 2030.  There are currently 70 operational data centres in the State, with Dublin having 25% of European data centres.  They are not sources of employment.  They are not bringing investment into communities.  They do not bring people into local shops or groups in any way.  They are a drain on electricity that is really needed at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  When the Government talks about the carbon tax, should it not be aimed at big business, which uses the most energy, and not at struggling families who are only looking to survive.  When I spoke to Deputy McDonald earlier, she made a point to me that many families are not surviving.  They are going to moneylenders and credit unions and running up debts on their families.<\/p> <p>Are we expected to take the energy that is required to hold all of Europe's data processing?  That is the question the Minister has to answer.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party could send out a clear message to people.  If the Government leads by changing behaviours, people will follow if they can.<\/p> <p> The current application system for electric taxis is not operational at the moment, even though it was announced a few weeks ago.  The NTA has informed me it is a technical issue.  We could switch our entire taxi fleet to electric vehicles.  Imagine the message that would send out and the emissions it would save if we were to do that.  I encourage the Minister to act quickly, get that system up and running and let taxi drivers who want to move to electric avail of the grants.  We cannot solve climate change in one fell swoop, but there are many positive measures on which we can work together, and we will work with the Government if those measures are sincere and true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600066#VVV00500","speaker":"1453","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649268600,"counter":418,"content":"<p>The IPCC report announced this week gives a start and grave warning that we must take seriously, namely, that it is now or never and that two to three years remain in which we can reduce emissions drastically to ensure there will not be irreversible consequences that our children, those in poorer countries and the poorest in our own country could feel.  We need to act; now is the time.  Actions are being taken, which I acknowledge, but a great deal more can be done.  Solar technology has been around for a long time and it is incredible how many public buildings throughout the State do not have solar panels.  It is incredible that of the more than 4,000 schools in the State, there is no scheme as yet for them to feed in solar energy to the grid.  There are no regulations to govern that area.  The same is true of community facilities and any number of voluntary organisations and their buildings.  It is an obvious win and one on which we must move.  The Government has talked about it, but progress has been very slow and we need to address that.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue on which there is significant potential for generating energy not only for us but also in a European context and to allow us to convert to green hydrogen relates to offshore wind.  Moreover, there is great potential for creating employment as well.  In other countries, such as Britain and some of our other neighbours, steps have been achieved in this regard, whereas we are coming to this very late.  I appreciate that predates the Minister and there have been recent announcements, but much more is needed.  There is a need to engage with seafarers.  My understanding is the seafood task force that has been talked about has not yet been convened.  It would allow us to have that engagement in order that we can navigate the challenges that exist there.  We need a clear signal that there will be an option for floating offshore wind in the next two to three years because that will unlock significant potential.  There needs to be significant public investment to ensure the public and the community can benefit from it, and those who are going to invest in it need that clear signal to ensure the investment can start to be ramped up now.

We are ten Deputies, as Deputy Verona Murphy said earlier, and we are regarded as laggards, blackguards, backward, gombeen men and whatever else.  What have we seen since the Government came into power?  It can blame the Ukraine war or whatever it likes, but this was always coming.  Last October, we sought a debate on these issues, as did anyone who is in business or who knows anything about business.  Ordinary people cannot heat their homes or turn on their electric blanket, if they can afford one.  The Government is making the people perish and it is punishing people on lower incomes and those who are less well off.<\/p>  <p>  Meanwhile, the blackguarding goes on.  People who have installed solar panels cannot get onto the grid, and nor can people who have installed a miniature wind turbine near their house.  People have made all kinds of efforts to install various kinds of heating systems and want to make an effort, but they cannot.  The laggards and the blackguards are the Minister's Government and successive Administrations, which have blackguarded the people.  The Government thinks that now, it can frighten them into accepting anything.  That is not going to happen.  Just because it frightened the life out of people with Covid, it thinks it can frighten them now with the latest green policies.  It has a rude awakening coming.  We are not climate change deniers but we know that people need to live as well as everything else.  Why is the Government not hitting data centres or big business?

He is struggling to pay for a bag of coal when he buys it, and he said he has always been living hand to mouth every week.  He does not have the money that is required to refurbish his house to avail of the grant, so there is no point telling him he will get &euro;25,000 if he can pull another &euro;40,000 from underneath his bed.  Where is he supposed to get it?  He cannot get off the ground to carry out the improvements the Government recommends.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister take into account that man and his daughter, who has special requirements? They need to live today and next week, and they need to heat their home.  The Government is not going to do anything to help them but instead it will hurt them.

That statement, made by a rural Government Deputy, mesmerised many, who mentioned it to me.  I will tell the Minister how impossible carbon tax is to pay, on top of every other expense.  Parents, businesses, farmers and fishermen are on the phone to me day and night because of the cost of fuel to be used to take the kids to school, drive to work, fill the tractor to draw feed for cattle or fill the boat to take the crew out to fish for the week.  They are telling me in their hundreds to do whatever it takes to prevent the Government from applying this additional Government tax known as carbon tax, including a vote of no confidence, if it has to come to that.  That is how angry they are.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, they cannot afford to fill their home heating tanks or their cars or tractors with fuel.  Some fishermen have told me it is not worth their while going out onto the water and that this country does not pay them to go fishing because they cannot afford to go for a full week.  This additional increase, which will come in May, is coming in order that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael can remain in government and keep the Green Party happy.  It is time to wake up.  This country is on its knees.  Old people are freezing in their homes with no heating, in some cases because they earn &euro;1 more than the fuel allowance threshold.  This payment also needs to be considered.  Representatives of farm contractors visited Leinster House last week.  They cannot afford the fuel for their machinery.  That is the bottom line.  Farmers cannot afford to pay hauliers, so many of them have decided to go out of business.<\/p> <p>Government Members are standing idly by and allowing all this to happen.

If they were merely indicative targets, that might be one thing.  However, these budgets are legally binding, inflexible and punitive.  The concept behind them is to support our movement towards a so-called zero-carbon society in 2050.  That is a fairy tale which will punish people in the process.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister will be aware that Professor Michael Kelly of University of Cambridge recently delivered an eye-opening lecture to the climate science forum on the cost of Ireland's transition to a zero-carbon society.  It would do the Government good to listen to that lecture carefully, instead of following blindly one agenda which is hysterical and whips up unnecessary fear and anxiety in people who want to play their part.  Instead of that, the Government is dividing society and punishing the people who cannot afford it.  How dare Government Members dictate to people how they are to heat their homes?  People are expected to wait 24 months on a waiting list for a retrofitting scheme.  Is the Minister suggesting the people freeze in their homes until their grant comes through?  If it is out of their reach and they cannot afford it, what happens then?  It is outrageous.<\/p>  <p>  Professor Kelly says the cost of expanding the electricity sector in terms of transmission alone was estimated to be between &euro;15 billion and &euro;20 billion, an incredible amount.  The final bill, according to the professor, will be in the region of &euro;123 billion for the electrification element of decarbonisation and an astonishing &euro;255 billion for the retrofitting of buildings.  The professor's view is that we do not need both zero-carbon electricity and zero-emission homes.  He says net zero is an unobtainable pipe dream, and I agree, without a major national commitment, a command economy and lower standards of living.  He also says we ought to repeal net-zero legislation and replace it with more realistic and pragmatic targets.  I support this call because Government Members are punishing people and do not want to listen to any other view.

Last year saw a step change in Ireland's approach to climate action with the signing into law of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 and the new climate action plan.<\/p>  <p> There is a stark picture of the impact climate action is having on all nations.  Negative effects of climate change are already being experienced globally.  Carbon tax is a key pillar underpinning the climate action plan to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050.  Significant portions of carbon tax revenue are allocated for welfare and retrofitting schemes.<\/p>  <p>  Low-income households will see the carbon tax offset but I have concerns regarding this tax.  We are told that &euro;41 per tonne is equivalent to &euro;1.50 per month to household.  We all know and see every day that households are struggling with the increase in the cost of fuel and the cost of living.  I met with some taxi drivers today and they told me some of them will have to give up their job because they cannot afford to keep their taxi on the road.  I met with hauliers who tell me the same.  I meet with farmers regularly because of this.<\/p>  <p>  We speak about transport in rural Ireland and I can only speak about Carlow and Kilkenny, particularly Carlow.  In Dublin, there are all the buses and train services.  In a small rural town like Carlow, we do not have all those services.  It is unfair for us to promote or work on something that we know we need to address.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue is something I have been constantly fighting for and on which the Minister has given me a commitment.  Carlow town does not have a bus service.  My understanding is there will be an electric vehicle there and I welcome that the Minister is saying we will have it this year.  We have to get it this year.  I cannot go back again to the people of Carlow and say they are not getting their Carlow town bus service.  When we want to work on climate change and promote climate action, as we are doing, the proper infrastructure, such as proper cycle lanes, has to be in place.  I ask that the Minister ensure that town bus service is delivered.<\/p>  <p>  The fuel allowance is finishing this week.  I ask that it be extended.  It is so important.  We cannot forget about people.  We have to know what is the roadmap, what is the plan and what sort of communication we need to deliver to the people.  It is important that people understand.  People are struggling and I see it every day.  We have to be mindful and make sure we are not losing men who want to drive a taxi but cannot afford to.<\/p>  <p>  The carbon tax is coming in on 1 May.  There are concerns about that and I have had several phone calls about it.  I know the Minister is aware of that.  Do we look at an extension or what do we look at?  It is important that we get our communication out there.  We all want to have our homes and everyone else's home retrofitted.  The windows, doors and heating in houses are important but we need to make sure there is proper communication and the funding is there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600068#XXX00900","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1649269200,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate, which takes place at a time when the world can see the writing on the wall when it comes to climate change.  It is a time of acute increases in the cost of living, specifically relating to energy costs.  I welcome the comments of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste on a series of cost-of-living measures to be introduced soon.  Such a step is important as it recognises the struggles families face with regard to heating their homes and making choices about food.  The recognition of that, in the context of where we are economically, is important.<\/p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, should also note that, as my colleague has just mentioned, there is a compelling case for additional measures through the Department of Social Protection on top of the &euro;1.9 billion that has already been committed, including giving consideration to the extension of the winter fuel allowance for a further period.  Perhaps that is what she, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste had in mind in their prior comments.<\/p> <p> Returning to the climate budget, I am pleased that the Government and its predecessors, having recognised the necessity and urgency of this matter, committed to delivering real and transformative change across every sector and every corner of Ireland.  We have set some extremely ambitious and difficult-to-reach targets and goals for our country.  As has often been highlighted by the Department and the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, which I serve upon, we aim to reduce our carbon emissions by 51% by 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2050.  These are significant and challenging targets and there is no easy way to achieve them.  There is no one policy or silver bullet to help us reach these goals.<\/p> <p> However, a vital component in the battle is the role of the carbon budgets.  These budgets will allow us to map out not just our societal landscape, but also our sectoral landscape in a series of five-year budgets, allowing us to manage our emissions and adjust our activity as necessary, thus ensuring that we make the best possible effort to meet our climate responsibilities.  The carbon budgets will facilitate a change in policy and introduce a new level of responsibility and accountability that will be shared by all Departments, industries and sectors.  By acting now, we can ensure that we leave a planet that is fit for human existence, for our children and for our children's children.<\/p> <p> This week saw the publication of the latest UN report on the impacts of climate change and the cost of inaction.  The report highlights that, while it is not too late to limit climate change to 1.5&deg;C, it will be too late without immediate action on a global scale.  If not this week, then certainly last week, I believe the Taoiseach stated: \"Oh Lord, make me chaste but not yet.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600068#XXX01000","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649269800,"counter":437,"content":"<p>St. Augustine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600069#YYY00200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1649269800,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I listened carefully, as I always do, to the Opposition.  I do not want to convolute the subjects of carbon budgets and carbon taxation, but there is still an argument in the House that now is not the right time to do this.  To be frank, the right time was ten or 20 years ago, such is the impact that climate change will have, not in 20, 30 or 40 years' time, but in the next decade.  We are already seeing the change.  By acting now, we can ensure that we try to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.<\/p>  <p>  As a small nation, our impact on the world can vastly outweigh our size.  We have a massive diplomatic footprint.  It is impactful and important.  By building a broad coalition of nations, we can become a global leader in the fight against climate change.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise the issue of energy security in Ireland and the wider EU.  This morning, we heard first hand from President Zelenskyy.  Like others, I compliment the Ceann Comhairle, but also the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, for his excellent speech.  We must continue pushing back against Vladimir Putin's ability to make war.  Much of that comes from the availability of Russian oil and gas in the market.  While we in Ireland do not have a significant level of supply from Russia, some of our EU partners do.  We have a responsibility to use our significant diplomatic footprint to influence others to make the right decision.  The decision by the EU and the wider West to turn away from their dependency on Russian energy is not just morally right, but entirely necessary.  Ireland has the ability to produce vast quantities of renewable energy, primarily wind energy.  Over the next short while, we will see our energy bills rising due to the knock-on effects of other European states competing for a reduced supply of energy in Europe.  We will also begin to see a doubling down on renewable energy sources home-grown in Europe, but we must act faster.<\/p>  <p>  I was in Glasgow a few months ago at COP26.  While I was there, I took the opportunity to meet ScottishPower, which produced 106% of its energy requirements through offshore wind energy in a single day in 2019 or 2020.  I believe it was an August day.  Ireland has a significant opportunity in the form of the Atlantic off the coast of Donegal in the north, Kerry in the south and so on.  Such places will have significant opportunities once we get the legislative framework correct, the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority established and, of most importance, have communities up and down the country, especially ports, in a position to supply those sectors.  I do not just mean in the Shannon Estuary, either.  I am sure that other locations will be identified in the years to come.<\/p>  <p>  Wind energy and solar development are to be welcomed.  I hope that we will see investment in them increasing dramatically.  They will increase our ability to produce energy at home and give us the potential to become a clean energy exporter to the rest of the world.  Solar energy generation, particularly on farms, commercial buildings and homes, must be ramped up and the ability of those providers to feed into the network must be rewarded.  The Minister has heard from many Members this evening on the necessity of ensuring that such providers be supported and rewarded for their efforts, particularly where farm buildings are concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Our ambitions around offshore wind energy must not be limited to the private sector.  We must get involved as a State, and if gaps are identified in the coming years or decades, we as a State must plug them in light of the significant opportunities for us, for example the potential to produce tens of thousands of well-paid jobs while protecting the environment.  This will require changes in a number of policy areas, not least our planning and management systems and the speed with which the State responds to these pressing needs.<\/p>  <p>  There is no community in Ireland that does not want to see climate action plans delivered.  More than that, every community wants to play its part in this effort.  We must do everything we can in the House not to frustrate the process, but to provide people in communities with the tools and ability to contribute to our national targets and achieve what I hope will be a carbon-neutral society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600069#YYY00300","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1649269800,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies McNamara and Fitzmaurice.<\/p>  <p>  I will pick up on Deputy Alan Farrell's last point.  The one thing we have not done is empower local communities or people.  We have patronised them and introduced a divisive carbon tax when what we needed was leadership, not just from this Government, but from previous governments as well.  Climate change is an existential threat &ndash; I have no doubt about that.  I have followed it in Galway when we led the way &ndash; not me, but the people on the ground.  Another Deputy said that the people would follow.  The people have done their damnedest.  Actually, excuse the word.  They have done their best to lead us.  They did that in Galway.  Does the Minister remember what happened when they led us in Galway and we introduced recycling?  The then Government took the power away and brought in a waste management plan.  The Government did not like what we were doing, which was zero waste in a positive way.<\/p>  <p>  I have no problem with carbon budgets, but I support Deputy Paul Murphy's comments that they are not going far enough.  We are in the third instalment of the IPCC's trinity of reporting, with this its sixth report.  Its first report started more than 34 years ago in 1988.  It has led the way forward.  The first part of this instalment examined what was happening and warned that climate changes were becoming irreversible.  The second part was its report in February, which focused on adaptation and warned of catastrophic impacts.  The third report &ndash; this week's &ndash; focused on mitigation.  As has been stated, without immediate and deep carbon emission reductions across all sectors, limiting global warming to 1.5&deg;C is beyond reach.  The report goes on, but I will not quote the figures.<\/p>  <p>  I am 100% behind the Government in terms of taking climate change measures.  I have the greatest respect for my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group and, while I disagree with them, I understand their frustration.  The carbon tax should never have been introduced, and certainly not in the manner it was.  It is divisive and has repeatedly let Governments off the hook for providing proper leadership.  We have no choice but to transform our society.  Transformative action is urgently needed.  Otherwise, we are finished.  I make no apology for saying that.<\/p> <p>We do it in a way, however, that benefits and empowers communities and stops the division.  If we look at Galway and Connemara, seaweed and wool are two indigenous industries that should be thriving in those places but there is absolutely nothing.  There is no policy for the islands.  An interdepartmental committee has met repeatedly, starting in 1996 and again a year ago, but there has been nothing and no policy for the islands.  Scotland was mentioned.  It has a policy for its islands underpinned by legislation and the populations on those islands are increasing.  That is not happening in Ireland.  There is major potential in seaweed and wool for rural areas, but nothing is happening.<\/p> <p> We have begged, implored and done everything possible to have a feasibility study carried out for light rail in Galway city so we can have a green, lean city, and can channel the energy and opportunities that are coming from the transformation.  Instead, we are going down the cul-de-sac of an outer bypass that is going nowhere and will put more traffic on the road.  We keep doing this.  We keep dividing people from each other as opposed to asking how we can face this challenge together.  As with neutrality, how will we use our voices to say this is the way forward, we will show you and we will be together in that, rather than the divisive nature of it?<\/p> <p> Let us stick with Galway.  I see the Minister rubbing his head.  I rub my head all the time.  I am surprised I still have hair because I am so utterly frustrated by what happened in Galway more than 22 years ago this year.  The people there led us on recycling and light rail, for which 24,000 people signed a petition pleading for a sustainable way of running their city, for taking traffic off the road and bringing in park-and-ride.  We put it into the city development plan in 2005.  Management repeatedly told us it was too early to run it out, and now we have traffic congestion in Galway and no master plan for the common good.  I have brought this to the Minister's attention.  I realise he cannot do it on his own, but a voice has to be raised to ask that we do not keep doing this, and to say this is completely hypocritical and is against climate action and the policies that are supposedly sustainable.  That is not what is happening on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600069#YYY00400","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649270400,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I heard the Acting Chairperson say earlier that there was a danger of people becoming confused regarding what this debate is about and that it is about a carbon budget.

At present, if you are in Bord Bia, you cannot use anything out of an anaerobic digester, if that digester came from where Irish Water has either sewerage or a water plant.

I will respond to as many of the points raised as I can that I was able to hear in the Chamber.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, was present for the earlier addresses.  I will respond very quickly.  It will be rapid-fire but that is appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  On the 2018 figure referenced by Deputy Paul Murphy, this Government started in 2020 and that was the first recorded period we could measure our emissions from.  We had to set ourselves a target.  I agree with him that we have to be careful about what might be called techno-optimism, which is that there will be some easy, magical, technological solution.  Technologies are coming but more than anything else it requires political will.  We have to be careful about the false promise that everything can come for free, be it public transport or any other service.  That is one point on which I differ from the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  I also agree with Deputy Lahart.  It was interesting that he referred to the \"Don't Look Up\" movie in respect of how we communicate regarding this.  How we explain it, how we listen and how we engage will be critical.  It will be more important than all the technological issues.  I appreciate what he said, which is true, regarding the Green Party's role through the years in raising the alarm, in looking up and in looking ahead, but that now belongs to every party and every Independent in this House.  This is not an issue that will work if it is seen as partisan or belonging to one political family and not another.  It has to belong to everyone if we are to make the scale, leap and jump we have to make.<\/p>  <p>  I absolutely agree with Deputy Flaherty and many others in the House that we have to help our people through this particularly difficult time as regards the cost of living.  We should first and foremost look at many of the measures the Government has put in place, such as the &euro;2 billion in funding.  There are also many measures that can be an immediate solution.  For example, the 80% grant for retrofitting covers attic and wall insulation, which gives an approximate cut of 25% in the average bill at a time when prices have just gone up by 25%.<\/p> <p>Those measures are real.  They can and will be delivered in a timely manner to help people out of the difficult situation that we all recognise we are in.<\/p> <p> Deputy Ward from Sinn F&eacute;in spoke on data centres.  A number of Deputies raised this.  We must manage data centres differently.  There is no out for any sector.  No one industry can say that it is not part of the responsible solution.  We are certain to do that.  In Tallaght - the Deputy will be aware of this - a data centre is being built where the waste heat is being used to heat the council offices, the university and local buildings.  We can do that elsewhere.  People have asked what benefit those data centres can bring but if we start thinking and designing in that way where they are part of local entry solutions where that waste heat, which is the biggest problem in data centres, is used,  it becomes part of the solution.<\/p> <p> I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin, also from Sinn F&eacute;in, on what he said about the need to look at the built environment and particularly the need to switch away from steel, concrete and cement and think about the embodied carbon in buildings and he is absolutely right.  These new technologies with cross-laminated timbers give us building materials where we have an abundant resource supply in our forest system -----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600070#ZZZ00400","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649271000,"counter":445,"content":"<p>Will we be let cut it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600071#AAAA00200","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1649271000,"counter":446,"content":"<p>It will be cut all over the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600071#AAAA00300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1649271000,"counter":447,"content":"<p>We won&rsquo;t get felling licences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600071#AAAA00400","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1649271000,"counter":448,"content":"<p>Your Minister of State has done nothing about it.

I hope it will return and look for it again and stick with it because it may take time and persistence.  The Deputy also mentioned wind research.  Primarily, now, the research will be on the art of doing and of delivering.  It will be applied research from what we learn by going big in scale off foreshores.

The public service has to lead by putting solar panels on our buildings and particularly schools.  I will follow this up with other Deputies but I would say that the Port of Cork, more than any other place, with the Shannon Estuary probably second, is where we would see huge potential in developing this offshore wind.  That is not only on the energy generation side but also the application of that to deliver industry in Cork.<\/p>  <p>  I will follow that by responding to my Rural Independent Group colleagues, Deputies Mattie McGrath, Danny Healy-Rae, Michael Healy-Rae, Michael Collins and others.  I will make the point again that this will be good particularly for the west, south west, north west, and south east of Ireland because that is where the resource is strongest.  It is in places such as Bantry Bay that we will bring the power ashore, but not only that, or in Shannon Estuary or Cork Harbour.  I hear what Deputy Michael Collins says about the cost of fuel making it very difficult for trawlers and fishermen at the moment but the answer to that is not to turn our backs on what the likes of our ports could actually become, not just fishing centres but the centres of this new industry.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600071#AAAA02200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1649271000,"counter":466,"content":"<p>Tie up the boats then?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600071#AAAA02300","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1649271000,"counter":467,"content":"<p>No one seeks to divide or to speak down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600071#AAAA02400","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1649271000,"counter":468,"content":"<p>That is what the Minister is doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600071#AAAA02500","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1649271000,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I do not mean any disrespect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600071#AAAA02600","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1649271000,"counter":470,"content":"<p>The Minister will wreck the midlands.

There is a strong emphasis around Dublin Bay on improving water quality in the bay.  It is a long-standing issue but it has been particularly highlighted by the number of people using the sea facilities since Covid as they have become much more engaged with all-year round sea swimming.  I work with a group called SOS Dublin Bay, which has done extraordinary work and great research on this.  I have done my own research on it and found that constituents in my area in D&uacute;n Laoghaire have experienced illnesses from swimming.  This is replicated around Dublin Bay with the presence of E. coli and other harmful bacteria.  We recognise that a major upgrade of water services is needed in the area but there are things we can do to help in the meantime.  People want to know if the water quality is good or bad.  They acknowledge that a water upgrade is needed but random things can affect water quality, such as a heavy downpour for a day or two, movement of birds and excrement from birds, creating localised problems.<\/p>  <p>  What people really want to know, in advance of the upgrade of the water system, is what the water quality is.  We need to get to a point where people can check it on an app on their phone.  I can check the weather and tide but I should also be able to check the water quality.  The reason I could do that is all-year round testing of the water.  We are looking for two things.  First, we want all-year round testing of the water and the provision of that information, transparently, to people who live in the Dublin area.  That way, if they want to go swimming, they can make a decision based on the water quality on a given day, recognising that there can be random days here or there where it is not good, pending the upgrade.  Second, the ultraviolet technology in Ringsend should be made available for longer than it is currently, which is three months.  I believe that has been extended partially and I would love to know for exactly how long.  I have not got that information from the Department yet.<\/p>  <p>  We have been engaged in a process with the Department for some time.  The representatives of SOS Dublin Bay and I have been in correspondence since the beginning of 2021.  They met with the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, in May 2021, and received a letter from him, which was supportive, in August 2021.  It set out the various work his Department would engage in.  Crucially, it stated the Department would be commencing work to amend the existing bathing water regulations, SI 79\/2008, to allow local authorities to determine the bathing season for individual bathing waters and to support Irish Water in additional monitoring of the impact of UV disinfection.  If we can extend the bathing season to the realistic bathing season, which is now all-year round, and not just the three months of the summer, we could then have all-year round testing and would be able to provide that information in a transparent way to people who want to use the water.<\/p>  <p>  I have been disappointed with the correspondence and the pace of engagement from the Department and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, whose responsibility this is, since then.  SOS Dublin Bay followed up with another letter on 25 January pointing out that the purpose of the bathing water directive is to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment and protect human health.  That must be acknowledged.  We need to take further steps to implement that directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600076#FFFF00500","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speech","time":1649272800,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her ongoing interest in pursuing the very important issue of water quality in Dublin Bay.  In order to protect water quality in the bay, work is under way to upgrade and enhance Irish Water's management of the city's wastewater networks and treatment plants.  In addition, the Dublin local authorities are collaborating on projects to improve the management of surface water catchments around the bay.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has also requested the national bathing water expert group to report to him on how best to protect the health of people who regularly swim in Dublin Bay outside the regulated bathing water season.  The bathing water expert group has been meeting monthly since late 2021.  The expert group is currently gathering information on when and where out-of-season bathing occurs.  The expert group has developed two questionnaires, one for the public and one for local authorities.  This information, to be gathered within the coming two months, will inform the conclusions of the group and the development of advice to the Minister.  This may include any additional necessary measures, including regulatory changes and-or monitoring changes.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel, a bathing water task force, chaired by Dublin City Council, is seeking to improve bathing water quality all-year round in Dublin Bay.  The task force has undertaken an assessment of inputs to the Elm Park stream catchment as this stream is considered a significant source of pollution for bathing waters in the southern part of Dublin Bay.  Other pressures include dog and bird fouling and wastewater discharges.  As part of this work, the following actions are being progressed.  Irish Water and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council have closed a sewer outflow at Larkfield and are delivering upgrades to the combined drainage infrastructure at that location, eliminating one source of pollution to that stream.  The project included the construction of a new sewer from Larkfield Road to Our Lady's Grove Primary School in May 2021.  Installation of a flow and water quality monitor near the outlet of the Elm Park stream will provide information on pollutant loads in the stream just before it discharges into bathing waters.  This will assist in predicting water quality problems in order to protect public health.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, in the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant, Irish Water is operating an ultraviolet filter over the winter months of 2021 and 2022 and is now monitoring to see if water quality improvements were evident during the times the filter was operational.  Irish Water is currently collating and analysing the monitoring data and this analysis is scheduled to be completed shortly.<\/p>  <p>  The work I have outlined has been undertaken in addition to the ongoing project upgrade at Ringsend wastewater treatment plant.  Furthermore, the programme for Government and the national development plan made significant commitments for Irish Water capital investment in the period 2021-25.  I will raise the additional points the Deputy made around advising members of the public who want to use the bathing facilities all-year round in a transparent manner, which I understand is the course of things as people take the opportunity to embrace the outdoors.  Any technology we can take advantage of to make that a reality and get information to the source and to citizens' hands is important.  I will raise that matter, and the Deputy's other points, with the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, with whom she has had correspondence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600076#FFFF00600","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1649272800,"counter":571,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response and acknowledge his attendance here tonight.  I know this is not his area but the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, so I thank him for being here.  I appreciate that the expert group is gathering survey data.  I am a Deputy for the constituency from north Bray to Booterstown and I have been telling the authorities exactly what the issue is for two years.  I have provided my own survey data, as has SOS Dublin Bay.  It would be nice if the group engaged with us in this way.  A motion was passed by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to introduce all-year round weekly testing.  I thank the Minister of State for the information about Ringsend.<\/p><p>I wish to highlight a letter from Deputy Noonan to the SOS Dublin Bay group.  With the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's permission, I will read it into the record, because I struggle to follow the logic of it.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tDepartment officials, together with the National Bathing Water Expert Group, are currently examining the most suitable options to provide for safe bathing water during the winter months, [the winter months are when the issues are particularly pronounced] and improve the dissemination of information around bathing water quality, both in the Dublin Bay area as well as in other locations throughout the country.<br \/><br \/>The science underpinning the monitoring and management plans during the current bathing season relates to summer conditions so the National Bathing Water Expert Group are considering this in their discussions and exploring the best options for winter conditions.  For example, during summer, sunlight helps to kill harmful bacteria in water.  In winter, sunlight is not as effective at killing bacteria and therefore natural background levels of bacteria in bathing waters are likely to be higher.  There is also more rainfall during winter months resulting in more bacteria in bathing waters.  Bathing waters are currently designated using bacterial bathing water test results over four consecutive summer bathing seasons.  For example, if the bathing season is extended to the full year, the 12-month average concentration of bacteria used to determine the designation is likely to be higher than the average concentration over the current summer season.  This may result in the current designation of Excellent, Good, and Sufficient bathing waters being downgraded. <\/blockquote>  <p>The implication is that, because the winter sampling is being taken, it might identify that the water quality is not as good, resulting in our downgrading of the beach.  If the water quality is not good, I would like my constituents to know that so they can choose not to swim in it on the day that it is so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600076#FFFF00700","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speech","time":1649273400,"counter":572,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her intervention.

It is hard to get my head around it when I am reading it at pace but I will bring it to his attention.  I have outlined the three areas around the broader context of Dublin Bay, the bathing water expert group and the local authority-led task force that is assessing target areas.  We should be liaising with communities and advising them of any deterioration in water conditions so they can make decisions that best suit them.

The national development plan commitment of almost &euro;6 billion in capital investment to be undertaken by Irish Water from 2021 to 2025 includes a major upgrade of the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant.  The Deputy referenced her area, which is a key and important one.  I note that the bathing water directive is undergoing a review and officials from the Department are engaging with the European Commission and attending workshops to discuss the revisions required to the directive.  Protecting bathers' health out of season is being considered as part of these discussions but as the Deputy rightly points out, out of season is in season now and that is the reality going forward.  It is key for citizens to have that information at their fingertips.  We will raise the valid points the Deputy has made.

The Minister for Health just walked through the D&aacute;il Chamber less than one minute ago so that is disrespectful.  We always gave Ministers a bye if they were carrying out other important business but the Minister for Health walked past us there.  It is not good enough and that is no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, who is here in his place.  That shows a disregard for Members and for the House.<\/p>  <p>  I will return to the matter I want to raise.  If this report was available at the time I could have raised it prior to the general election in 2020.  I am speaking of the report of the independent review of unscheduled care performance.  It is quite a damning report and I hope the Minister for Health can address why it was not published before.  It took a freedom of information request for this report to be made available.  The report reviews emergency care in nine of our hospitals.  The report refers to unsafe treatment caused by overcrowding and staff shortages and it was completed prior to the Covid-19 pandemic when staff shortages dramatically increased due to the spread of the virus.  Its findings highlight a level of dysfunction at the heart of the HSE, with some hospital staff members stating that they did not know who was in charge.  Many of the issues that were highlighted remain.  The accident and emergency department wait times in 2022 look like they will reach pre-Covid levels with more than 51,000 patients already waiting longer than 12 hours in accident and emergency departments this year.  Some 13,000 people have already waited more than 24 hours for admission.  These are incredible figures when one considers the research report by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine in the UK that there is, on average, one excess death for every 67 patients who stay in an accident and emergency department for eight to 12 hours.<\/p>  <p>  I have a particular concern about the plight of patients and staff at University Hospital Limerick, a hospital that continues to have huge numbers of people treated on trolleys and in corridors.  Almost 1,600 people have been treated on trolleys there every month of 2020 to date.  Despite the best efforts of the wonderful but overworked staff there, the issues of long wait times and treatment on hospital trolleys continue unabated.  I spoke to a senior staff member at the hospital today who gave me a shocking first-hand account of how tragically challenging the jobs of staff there have become.  The member of staff contacted me in desperation about how difficult the work environment they are facing is.  I have no doubt that people are dying unnecessarily due to these failures.  Yesterday evening there was only one electrocardiogram, ECG, available across the three wards in the accident and emergency department.  Apparently all the other machines were broken.  That is one ECG to cover three wards, the triage area and the resuscitation sections.  That is a scandal.  These are important but basic pieces of equipment that should be readily available to staff.  It is a major hospital and the fact that just one ECG is in operation for the accident and emergency department is simply not good enough for me or for the people of Limerick.  This is a critical issue but on a more basic level, staff members told me today that there is often a challenge to get blankets and pillows for patients who are waiting.  The healthcare staff do their best.  Staying in hospital is a worrying experience and even the provision of this as an iota of comfort seems to be a cause of difficulty.<\/p>  <p>  I am from Limerick and these patients could be my friends or family members; they are not simply statistics.  The hospital zones are so full that in zones A, B and C of University Hospital Limerick yesterday, trolleys were two-deep in hallways, meaning that patients being moved had to either walk or be transferred through back doors so as not to interfere with those people lingering in the hallways.  It is worth remembering that zone C is a Covid area so infection is widespread because people are next to each other.<\/p>  <p>  We would all agree that the Minister for Health has an abundance of challenges facing him but he seems to be getting nowhere fast.  I have appealed to him, and I do so again, to expedite the construction of the 96-bed unit at University Hospital Limerick.  While it will not solve the problems of the hospital it would be an important signal to the people of Limerick that they are not being ignored and that the Government is committed to rectifying the problems at University Hospital Limerick.  Reducing accident and emergency department waiting times is just one part of the puzzle.  It needs to be done but it needs to be done as part of wider health reforms.  We can invest in GP capacity to reduce hospital admissions and we can increase capacity in staffing numbers in our hospitals.  These things take investment and we need to see this Government commit to this major investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600077#GGGG00300","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1649273400,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I welcome this opportunity to address the House on the issue raised by Deputy Quinlivan.  The health sector is facing significant challenges in providing emergency care while also managing Covid-19.  I acknowledge that this is causing distress to patients, their families and front-line staff.  I welcome the release of the report of the independent review of unscheduled care performance under the Freedom of Information Act 2014 following an application to the Department from the Irish Patients' Association.  The terms of reference of the report were finalised by the HSE following discussion with the Department, and it was published in June 2019.  The review across nine hospital sites was conducted during 2019 by an independent review team, including external management expertise from the National Health Service Scotland, the Scottish Government and National Health Service England.<\/p>  <p>  The report notes that the nine hospitals accepted the inspection visits with good grace, openness and a desire to learn, and that this is a great testament to their acceptance of the huge need for learning and change.  During the course of the review the team witnessed many incidents of outstanding practice and excellent patient care and was reassured by the many good things it saw happening.  The team also observed many areas that it felt needed to be improved.  The report contains significant findings in areas such as: patient experience times; executive leadership; and appropriate care settings.  It also gives clarity on: care provision; patient flow; and the normalisation of full capacity protocol.  The report makes numerous site-specific recommendations and 30 consolidated recommendations across four themes, covering: leadership and governance; emergency departments and assessment; patient flow; and operational grip.  It highlighted the following: the need for better access to routine diagnostics at weekends; the need for more senior decision-makers on-site on evenings and at weekends; and the need for more health and social care professionals working at weekends.  The HSE has advised that the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020 required it to respond to the extraordinary challenges posed and in doing so resulted in the implementation of structures and initiatives to address many of the issues and recommendations that were identified in the draft report.<\/p>  <p>  The report has remained in draft format since January 2020 and close-out of the review process to include factual accuracy checks and response from the nine sites reviewed was never completed.  The Government has increased health service current funding from &euro;15.3 billion in 2018 to &euro;19.4 billion in 2021, and &euro;20.4 billion this year.<\/p> <p>We permanently funded 1,146 acute hospital beds in budget 2021 and more than 800 have opened.  Significant funding was provided for additional staff, home help hours, alternative care pathways and community services.  It is critical that the funding is used in a manner that has a demonstrable impact on the challenges facing the healthcare system, particularly in relation to overcrowding in healthcare settings.  Key to this outcome is an emphasis on alternative options to emergency department attendance and a focus on improving the patient experience in the emergency department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600077#GGGG00400","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649274000,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the response but it is not good enough for the people of Limerick or most of the hospital staff.

It did not even mention University Hospital Limerick.  One would imagine, since I am the Deputy for that constituency, that the response would refer to that hospital.  That is deeply disappointing.  The workers at the hospital did Trojan work through the Covid pandemic.  They need to hear support from central Government and that their concerns are being heard.  Calls have been made for a HIQA inquiry into the level of overcrowding in University Hospital Limerick.  I have yet to hear whether one will be commissioned.<\/p>  <p>  In a recent reply to a question, the Minister stated that the current congestion in our emergency departments is due to constrained bed capacity, the high number of patients with Covid-19, and increased numbers of delayed transfer of cases.  I accept these are important elements, but the report of the independent review of unscheduled care performance shows that the issue in emergency departments preceded the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is important to restate and put on the D&aacute;il's record the report by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine that there is an average of one excess death per 67 patients who stay in emergency departments for eight to 12 hours.

I wish to raise the fair at Spancil Hill.  I am sure everyone in the House knows it is on 23 June.  It is an important cultural institution in Ireland.  It is obviously an important horse fair both nationally and internationally.  It goes beyond that and is now a cultural icon.  It was recently included in Ireland's national inventory of intangible cultural heritage.  Like much of our intangible cultural heritage, it is not only intangible but is endangered and will not be around for much longer unless the Government takes action to protect it because it cannot now get insurance.  Insurance is a significant obstacle for any event.  Occupier's liability is an issue for every organisation in the country, whether they are sporting bodies such as GAA clubs, farmers or any other entity, premises or event in the country that needs insurance.<\/p>  <p>  The fair at Spancil Hill was founded by royal charter, by King Charles, in 1621.  It was 400 years old last year, but the fair did not take place in 2020 or 2021 because of Covid.  It faces an even bigger threat from the state of the insurance industry in Ireland right now.  The inability to get insurance is threatening it.  There is a voluntary committee, none of whom could be called royalists, which revived the fair at Spancil Hill in 1989.  It was made famous by the song.  The committee simply cannot run the fair without getting insurance, which it cannot get since the British company that used to provide it exited the market.  Another famous horse fair in Ireland, at Ballinasloe, is in a position to proceed because it is held in the fair green, which is owned by Galway County Council and is covered by its insurance policy.  The Spancil Hill fair is held on a farm, which is private property, and has been since the royal charter was granted in 1621.  It cannot be held because of insurance.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to look into this matter, and not just for Spancil Hill.  There is a little time to save Spancil Hill, but it is a broader issue.  I wrote to the Minister of State's predecessor, Michael D'Arcy, when I was not a Deputy, suggesting some legislative change may be appropriate.  He spoke about the cost of insurance working group, which was established in 2016 and reported.  Almost all the key recommendations have been addressed, including the personal injuries guidelines, which were controversial but were approved by the Judiciary on 6 March 2021, which is a full year ago now.  Most of the measures recommended have been enacted, yet Spancil Hill cannot get insurance.  It is not unique.  It is a substantial obstacle to various events throughout the country.  We need to make sure these events take place.  The fair at Spancil Hill is iconic, but there are other community groups organising various festivals and events.  It will be the first summer back for many of them, like Spancil Hill, which has been in abeyance for two years, and they may not be able to get insurance.  I hope the Minister of State has some succour to offer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600078#HHHH00600","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1649274000,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for Clare, Michael McNamara, for raising this issue.  It only came to my attention today after receipt of the information about the Topical Issue debate.  I thank the Deputy for highlighting it.<\/p>  <p>  To address a few general points, I understand what the Deputy says about the historic nature of the Spancil Hill fair in Clare.  The community is involved and a voluntary committee runs it.  It was established by charter 400 years ago.  There is a long history attached to this.  I know it did not take place in the last two years because of Covid and once before that because of foot and mouth disease.  It is part of our national inventory of intangible cultural heritage and plays a key role in the local community, not only from an economic perspective but also, more importantly, because it enriches the social dimension of life in the area and wider region.<\/p> <p>Accordingly, I do not take the challenges regarding the accessibility affordability of insurance for such community-based events lightly.<\/p> <p> In this case, it seems to me that it is not the price that is at issue but that the fair cannot get insurance.  I want to be clear in my understanding of where the Deputy is coming from.  He mentioned a number of the legislative initiatives and policy changes taken by the Government in the last year and a half to deal with the insurance industry and the availability of insurance.  The Deputy will understand that the Government and Department cannot directly interfere in the provision of pricing of insurance products, nor do we have the power to direct a particular insurance company to provide cover to specific businesses or community groups.  Notwithstanding this, as the Deputy mentioned, the Government has an action plan for insurance reform.  A number of its actions have already been implemented, including personal injury assessments by the Judiciary.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, is now dealing with this matter and there are test cases in the courts at the moment.  This is taking some time.  As a result, the number of settlements the insurance industry would normally make in the normal course of events has fallen off dramatically while some of these cases are being dealt with.<\/p> <p> The Deputy highlights what I would describe as some of the pinch points in respect of insurance throughout the country.  These were exacerbated by Brexit because many of the insurance policies issued here had been done through London.  We had a hard Brexit on the insurance industry the day that Brexit occurred.  This has led to difficulties and to insurance not being available in many cases now.<\/p> <p> Overhauling the legislation will deal with the cost of insurance and the claims the Deputy correctly outlined.  However, while that does not provide insurance, it might deal with the cost of insurance.  There are only a few of these fairs and similar types of event.  In the past year, I have found that if those groups come together and go to a broker, they can, collectively, get a good premium from an insurance company.  Rather than each individual fair or street event going individually to an insurance company, if they pool together through some association of fairs, they can increase their purchasing power and the willingness of the insurance industry to take them on will increase.  <\/p> <p> In my next contribution, I will talk more about the pinch points and show that there may be an option to follow.  This is not a commitment from the Department because we are not involved in the insurance industry.  If we can provide any advice or direction, we will be happy to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600078#HHHH00700","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649274600,"counter":585,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is a master of suspense.  I am looking forward to hearing what his proposal is.  I would very much welcome any proposal he would have to make, as would the committee in Spancel Hill and the broader community.<\/p>  <p>  This event is organised by a committee and enjoys broad, popular support.  It is a big event run with the co-operation of the surrounding community, as well as the Garda.  It has not given rise to any trouble so it comes as a big surprise to me, as it will to many others, that it is danger because of insurance.  This may be the result Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  We also spoke earlier in the week about childcare.  One of the major costs childcare providers face continues to be an increase in the cost of insurance.  There is an issue around occupiers' liability insurance in Ireland.  If the reforms called for by the cost of insurance working group are carried out and they are not having the desired impact - the Minister of State and I agree they are being carried out &ndash; the Government will have to look at the matter again.  Governments have a tendency to say there is nothing they can do, it is a matter for the markets, etc., but there was a time in this State when the D&aacute;il could legislate.  It was by legislation that the VHI was introduced because the Government of the day - that was a Fine Gael Government whereas we now have a Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael Government - decided that we needed State intervention in the health insurance market in Ireland.  We may be close to the time when we need State intervention in occupiers&rsquo; liability insurance.  This is one example.  It is an important example.  It very much illustrates what is being lost in Ireland by the cost of insurance.  This is an important part of our culture and patrimony that is being lost.  Equally, there are childcare facilities that are being lost and many facilities across various sectors are under threat because of the inability to obtain insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600079#JJJJ00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1649274600,"counter":586,"content":"<p>My understanding - and I stress the word &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; - is that although Clare County Council oversees the fair and supports it with financial assistance, the fair itself falls out outside the scope of the Casual Trading Act 1995 due to its historical charter status.  As a result, it cannot avail of group insurance schemes operated by the market, active support teams and the Irish Organisation of Market and Street Traders, IOMST, and, therefore, its organisers must seek insurance on a stand-alone event.  In that context, it is similar to other such events as the Smithfield Horse Fair and Ballinasloe Fair.<\/p>  <p>  As regards dealing with pinch points, we had issues in a couple of industries.  The Deputy mentioned childcare.  Two years ago, after Brexit, there was a serious issue with availably of insurance for that sector.  One company is providing such insurance on the basis that the childcare industry came together collectively to have group purchasing power with a large premium.  It has secured insurance.  I spoke directly to the only company that provides insurance for childcare and reductions in its premiums are coming because of the improved standards and uniform approach taken by the sector.  <\/p>  <p>  On a related industry, point-to-point pony clubs and hunts could not get insurance last Christmas.  We got that matter sorted, again by a large group of hunts, pony clubs and point-to-point races coming together.  Collectively, through two different brokers, they increased competition and got insurance.  There is scope to do that here, although I am not making any commitment whatever.  It is not my role to get involve in that.  However, I ask the Deputy to contact my office and we will talk to Insurance Ireland and Brokers Ireland to see if they can help.  I stress again that this a market issue.  We will not have a role but if we can point people in a helpful direction, we will be happy to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600079#JJJJ00300","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1649274600,"counter":587,"content":"<p>Before moving on to the next Topical Issue matter, we will deal with messages from select committees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600079#JJJJ00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Messages from Select Committee","time":1649274600,"counter":588,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600079#JJJJ00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1649274600,"counter":589,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach has completed its consideration of the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022 and has made amendments thereto.<\/p><p>The Select Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment has completed its consideration of the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2022 and has made amendments thereto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600079#JJJJ00600","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Saincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Debate (Resumed)","time":1649274600,"counter":590,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600079#JJJJ00700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes","time":1649274600,"counter":591,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600079#JJJJ00750"},{"type":"speech","time":1649274600,"counter":592,"content":"<p>The final Topical Issue matter is to discuss the compensation package for farmers in relation to the Shass Mountain landslide.

Which Minister is taking this matter?  We addressed it to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I have huge respect for the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, and his portfolio, but I had hoped we would have a Minister or Minister of State from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  However, like Deputy Michael McNamara, I will keep my powder dry because maybe we will get good news, which is what we are here for.  <\/p><p>To provide some context for the Minister of State, a landslide occurred at Shass Mountain in Drumkeeran in June 2020, which is well over 20 months ago.  More than 20 farmers and eight foresters were adversely affected by the damage from the landslide.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, set up an inter-agency group that did really good work.  All of that is in hand.  However, the farmers in the area have seen no progress on agricultural issues.  <i>Force majeure<\/i>has been used for two years to enable those farmers to access their payments.  The Minister of State and I both know that <i>force majeure <\/i>can no longer apply after two years.  The affected farmers need certainty about their payments. <\/p><p>Last November, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, came to Drumkeeran where he met the farmers and stakeholders and engaged with all of us.  He promised he would seek funding from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, to put a compensation package in place.  Despite a great deal of correspondence, all I got in response to a parliamentary question was a holding answer indicating that nothing definite was happening.<\/p><p>The farmers have been patient, as have public representatives.  When similar incidents occurred in other parts of the country, they were done and dusted and compensation packages were put in place within 12 months.<\/p> <p>We have waited more than 20 months now.  Perhaps we have been too patient.  I am hoping for good news, however.

Obviously, if there is a slide from bog, as the Minister of State knows because I know where he comes from and met him up in his own country, where there is bog, the land around it is marginal.  These people are rearing families on small portions of land and in my opinion, they matter.  In fairness, the Government and the Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, set up an interagency group at the time.  Many of the different State bodies were involved.  Even the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine was involved.  The problem as we move on, however, as Deputy Harkin outlined, is that <i>force majeure<\/i>only lasts so long.<\/p><p>A commitment was given that a compensation package would be put in place to try to resolve this.  I am talking about where the slide went down and destroyed areas.  Rivers and different parts were involved.  It is not in my area but I went down to see the devastation it caused to small farms and small bits of land.  Where it is situated at the bottom of the mountain would always be the place someone might bring the ewes down for lambing, or it would only be the bit of middling ground a person has.  Rather than putting animals up the mountain, a person would bring them down in wintertime or springtime for lambing or it might be the place someone would have a few cattle in those small farms.  That is why this is important.  A decision needs to be given and made.  We cannot keep going on in limbo.  Farmers need clarity, especially as they are living in uncertain times at the moment.  As the man says, I am enthralled to hear the reply that is coming.  I hope what is coming is positive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040600080#KKKK00200","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speech","time":1649275200,"counter":596,"content":"<p>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, asked me to respond to this Topical Issue matter on his behalf.  As Deputies will know, he was not available in the Chamber a short while ago for the votes either.  I thank Deputies Harkin and Fitzmaurice for raising this issue, which is very difficult for the people involved.<\/p><p>The landslide occurred on Shass Mountain, close to the village of Drumkeeran in County Leitrim, on 28 June 2020 following heavy rain on that day and in the preceding days.  An area of upland blanket bog, including an area of adjacent forestry plantation, moved downhill as a result of the liquefied peat, vegetation and trees continuing from its source to follow the course of a tributary of the Diffagher River downhill to Lough Allen.  Some of the landslide material was held up at an area known as Dawn of Hope Bridge close to the origin of the landslide.  A quantity of material overflowed the bridge, however, and made its way approximately 7 km downstream to eventually spread out and settle on areas of farm and forestry land in a number of townlands.  Sporadic deposits of peat and other debris subsequently occurred, with the heaviest deposits occurring in three townland areas, namely, Corcormick, Derrindangan and Corchuill Lower.<\/p><p>Following the landslide, officials from the Department mapped the areas affected by the deposit of peat and debris from the landslide using a combination of satellite imagery for the period in question and detailed GPS data collected from surveys conducted on the ground in July and August 2020.  The total land area of agricultural land affected by the overspill has been calculated at 24.09 ha.  This land was declared by 18 basic payment scheme, BPS, applicants in 2020.  The total area of forestry within the damaged area is approximately 12 ha.  This comprises land held in seven privately owned forestry contracts.<\/p><p>In the aftermath of the landslide in 2020, the Minister moved to ensure that <i>force majeure<\/i>would apply to ensure that all farm scheme payments were not impacted by this event.  Officials from the<\/p><p>Department contacted each of the applicants affected by the landslide to assure them that payments would not be impacted.  <i>Force majeure <\/i>was applied again in 2021.  The Minister will ensure it will apply again in 2022 in respect of farm payments.<\/p><p>In response to the event, a multi-agency group was established under the chairmanship of the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Membership of this multi-agency group includes, <i>inter alia<\/i>, members of Leitrim County Council, local representatives, Oireachtas Members, farm bodies, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Inland Fisheries Ireland, the Department of Transport, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and some universities.<\/p><p>Leitrim County Council engaged specialist consultants from RPS Group to undertake a comprehensive examination of the causes of the landslide and the impact it had on the natural and built environment, ecology, water quality and the farming community.  A report that was prepared by RPS Group for the Department of culture estimated that there were total deposits of 160,000 cu. m, which is present at varying depths of up to 2 m in the overspill areas.  Accordingly, many of these areas remain untrafficable to both animals and machinery and are both unsuitable and unsafe for agricultural or farming use at present.<\/p><p>The Minister visited the site on 19 November, where he viewed at first hand the damage to farm and forestry.  He also met with many of the landowners impacted.  With regard to the compensation of landowners, his Department does not have a contingency fund.  Any <i>ex gratia<\/i>payment will have to be sanctioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Discussions are still continuing at this point between the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

If we look at what happened at Pollatomish in County Mayo, we will see that it took less than a year for compensation to go to farmers.
