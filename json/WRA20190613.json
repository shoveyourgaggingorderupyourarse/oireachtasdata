Members of the Defence Forces and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fulfil different roles and have different terms and conditions of service and pay structures. The vast majority of military personnel and Garda&iacute; are engaged in duties on a day-today basis which are quite dissimilar. <\/p>  <p>  Defence Forces pay and allowances are set, amongst other things, by reference and in consideration of relative levels of pay across a broad range of duties and roles across various sectors of the Irish public sector. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to basic pay, the Defence Forces have a wide range of allowances which are unique to their duties. A weekly Military Service Allowance is paid to all ranks up to the level of Colonel. Military Service Allowance is designed to compensate for the special disadvantages associated with military life. This includes unsocial hours of duty, exposure to danger, and the restrictions inherent in military discipline. For Privates, Corporals and Sergeants with more 3 years in service, MSA is worth more than &euro;6,023 per annum per person. For Senior NCOs the rate is &euro;6,411 per annum, per person. <\/p>  <p>  A range of duties attract additional allowances. Certain positions also attract technical pay for enlisted personnel or additional rates for officers. <\/p>  <p>  Security Duty Allowance is payable to all ranks up to Commandant for certain duties of a security nature performed. This includes duties assisting an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Aid to the Civil Power. <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Public Service Stability Agreement, 2013-2016, (the Haddington Road Agreement), all sectors across the public service were required to contribute to additional pay and productivity measures. Other sectors delivered these savings through a variety of approaches including additional working time and reduced rates of overtime payments.<\/p>  <p>  The contribution from the Defence sector included a reduction of 10% on the rate of certain allowances payable to the Defence Forces including Security Duty Allowance. It was also agreed with the Representative Associations that the Saturday and Sunday rates for Security Duty Allowance would be flat rated. <\/p>  <p>  The Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations have made claims for the restoration of the premium rates, which is being processed through the Conciliation and Arbitration (C&amp;A) Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. As discussions under the C&amp;A scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate to comment further on the matter at this time.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission has conducted a comprehensive examination and analysis of underlying difficulties of recruitment and retention in the Defence Sector. The Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform is expected to bring the report prepared by the Commission to Government shortly. The Government will give due consideration to the findings and recommendations in the report. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300045#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":8,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 5 to 10, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Representative Organisations","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300045#WRA00800"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[24585\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300045#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the work carried out in his Department and the progress made to increase the level of industrial relations support for serving personnel in the Defence Forces; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[24584\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300045#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the progress being made in affording Defence Force representative organisations affiliation with a union (details supplied) as a means to advance the interests of their members in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":12,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.<\/p><p>The Defence (Amendment) Act 1990 and Defence Force Regulations S6 provided for the establishment of representative associations for members of the Permanent Defence Force.

The commanding officers inform all ranks of the availability of the registration forms. A significant operation then takes place to ensure that those who are registered to vote, at home or overseas, are provided with postal votes, to enable them to exercise their right to vote.  <\/p>  <p>  Postal votes for Defence Forces personnel were processed and administered by the military authorities in the normal way for the 2019 local and European elections. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed that a number of personnel have expressed concern that they did not receive a postal vote.

This structured mid-life\u00a0extension programme of works will future proof the two vessels, allow for preventative maintenance and address obsolescence of equipment through capitalising on advancements in technology, thus ensuring the reliability of the vessel for the next 15 years. In addition, planning is underway for the replacement of the current Naval Service flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The examples given, whilst not exhaustive, demonstrate my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available. In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence has been increased to &euro;106 million for 2019, an increase of &euro;29 million. The National Development Plan provides for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary\u00a0modern and effective range of\u00a0equipment\u00a0available to them which is in line with best international\u00a0standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300046#WRB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300046#WRB04400"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[24803\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300046#WRB04500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the staff numbers in his Department in each of the past ten years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":102,"content":"<p>The number of whole time equivalent\u00a0civil\u00a0servants\u00a0working in\u00a0my\u00a0Department at 31 December in each of the years 2009 to 2018, and at\u00a04\u00a0June 2019,\u00a0is set out the following table.

I am particularly concerned by the ongoing fighting around the Libyan capital, Tripoli, which is endangering thousands of civilians, including putting already vulnerable migrants and refugees in Libya at further risk. <\/p><p>At the Foreign Affairs Council in December 2018, the EU committed to continue to work with the Libyan authorities to improve conditions for migrants and refugees, with a view to addressing the current system of detention. The EU High Representative, Federica Mogherini, met with the Prime Minister of Libya and the UN Special Representative for Libya in February 2019 and discussed how conditions in detention centres can continue to be improved for migrants with the assistance of the EU and UN agencies.<\/p><p>Ireland and the EU will continue to support the work of the UN migration and refugee agencies to monitor and improve conditions for refugees and migrants in Libya, including inside detention centres, and to assist with the voluntary return of migrants to their countries of origin. As I have consistently stated, conditions in Libyan detention centres are totally unacceptable. The European Union is working to find ways to ensure that migrants are not held in detention centres in the first place, and to put an end to the system of arbitrary detention in Libya. In the meantime, we are working with the UN migration and refugee agencies and other international partners to provide protection and assistance to vulnerable migrants and refugees at Libyan disembarkation points, in most of the official detention centres, and in host communities.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>Unfortunately, the current instability in Libya further limits the capacity of the international community to do this important work in some areas. I applaud the efforts of the UNHCR, which, over the past two months, and in the midst of escalating violence, has successfully relocated hundreds of refugees and migrants from more dangerous areas into safe zones.<\/p><p>EU diplomats regularly discuss the situation in Libya, taking stock of any opportunities to exert a positive influence on the situation, and to support political efforts to resolve the conflict. In recent EU discussions on Libya, Irish officials have highlighted the importance of guaranteeing the safety of refugees and migrants. However, political fragmentation and the fragile security situation in Libya limit the capacity of the EU and the wider international community to influence the situation on the ground.

The proposed Scottish action was based on the UK Government&rsquo;s stance on sovereignty over Rockall and their interpretation of their prerogatives under UK fisheries legislation and the UK&rsquo;s 1972 Island of Rockall Act, combined with the absence of an explicit provision in Annex 1 of the Common Fisheries Policy Regulation permitting Irish vessels to access territorial waters around Rockall.<\/p>  <p>  Since then, discussions have been ongoing. At political level, the issue was discussed between myself and Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, Fiona Hyslop, in September 2018, and this discussion was followed by an exchange of letters. Further discussions have taken place at senior official level this year. <\/p>  <p>  On 31 May, Cabinet Secretary Hyslop wrote to me to indicate that, subject to operational priorities, the Scottish Government intended to deploy vessels to the area one week after the date of the letter (i.e. from 7 June) and intended to take enforcement actions against any vessel, regardless of nationality, that it considered to be fishing illegally. I replied to this letter on 5 June, stating the position of the Irish Government and requesting that the Scottish Government reconsider its approach. I spoke with Cabinet Secretary Hyslop on 6 June and, during the course of this conversation, she maintained the Scottish position.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This is a complex situation. The difference of view between the Irish and Scottish Governments is based on a fundamental question of sovereignty over Rockall, on which Ireland and the UK disagree.<\/p>  <p>  I should make it clear that as we do not accept that the UK enjoys sovereignty over Rockall, we do not accept that a territorial sea exists around Rockall, nor therefore that the Scottish Government is entitled to exclude Irish vessels from the seas around the rock. We understand that the UK takes a different view, but the approach taken by the Irish and British Governments to the definition of maritime boundaries in the past has been to accept that our views differ and to take no account of Rockall for practical purposes. <\/p>  <p>  Dialogue regarding Rockall is continuing between the Irish and Scottish Governments. There have been close contacts at official level over recent days. It has now been agreed that a process of intensified engagement will take place, led by senior officials from both administrations.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has consistently said this matter should be dealt with through diplomacy and agreement.

For example, property owners can select a single (annual) debit, a monthly direct debit or can make regular payments through one of three approved payment service providers (An Post, Payzone and Omnivend). These options are provided by commercial entities who charge on a per-transaction basis and Revenue has no role in determining the level of cost imposed.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the person in question met her LPT liabilities through DAS from her DEASP payment until February 2015.

These\u00a0affect c.23,000 workers across the three banks in which the State has a shareholding.

The State remains the largest shareholder in AIB, BOI &amp;amp; PTSB\u00a0but following the successful IPO of AIB in June 2017 all three banks are also now on an equal footing with listings on the main market of the Irish and London stock exchanges.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The skill set required in the banking sector is evolving with the greatest demand for staff now in areas such as the digital economy, risk management, legal and compliance.

Acts, it actively pursues claims harvesting websites.\u00a0 From its various consultations, the Department has been advised that the number of active &lsquo;claims harvesting&rsquo; websites operating in Ireland has drastically reduced in recent years from approximately 60 in 2016 to around 11 more recently, although this figure can fluctuate.\u00a0 The Law Society states that unfortunately, the process of identifying the owners of the websites is often frustrated by the sophisticated ways in which the website owners conceal their identity.\u00a0 For example, it would appear that many of the websites which are operating in Ireland may not actually be located within the jurisdiction nor within other EU countries.\u00a0 I understand that this factor increases the levels of complexity of investigations, as it can be particularly difficult to establish who the owners of the relevant websites are.\u00a0 Notwithstanding these challenges, my Department has been informed by the Law Society that 23 websites that have been removed from the internet since 2014 and since last year, a further three websites have been removed from the internet, with another two websites identified as belonging to a company that has gone into liquidation.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  With the application of section 218 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, solicitor advertising will no longer be regulated by the legal professional bodies as happens at present.\u00a0 Instead, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority will maintain the restrictions of any advertisement which, in the opinion of the Authority, &ldquo;expressly or impliedly solicits, encourages or offers any inducement to any person or group or class of persons to make claims for personal injuries or seek legal services in connection with such claims.&rdquo;\u00a0 The Authority will be undertaking consultations for the making of regulations for the advertising of legal services by legal practitioners, whether solicitors or barristers, under section 218 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.\u00a0 It is my understanding that the new advertising regulations are planned to come into operation in Quarter 1 of 2020.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the above, it is clear that the regulation of claims harvesting websites is a complex matter but that the existing solicitor regulations have helped prevent such websites to evolve to become a more prevalent feature of the Irish personal injuries environment, in the way that they are in the UK, for example.\u00a0 I am satisfied that the relevant professional bodies are pursuing such websites to the extent that they can in light of the challenges that exist.\u00a0 Notwithstanding this, my officials will continue to monitor the prevalence or otherwise of this issue.\u00a0 In addition, I would suggest that if anyone is of the view that particular solicitor firms are using such claim harvesting websites, they should report the matter to the Law Society\/ Legal Services Regulatory Authority for investigation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300047#WRC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tracker Mortgage Examination","counter":140,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300047#WRC02300"},{"type":"question","counter":141,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[24775\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300047#WRC02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position with regard to the Central Bank ensuring there is individual accountability in the retail banks subject to current enforcement investigations relating to the tracker mortgage examination;

As per the 2019 Stability Programme Update, the overall level of general government expenditure this year is projected to be &euro;85.345 million up from &euro;81.985 million in 2018. My officials are preparing the Summer Economic Statement 2019 which forms the next stage of the budgetary process. This will include a medium-term economic strategy and narrative and also provides an updated assessment of the fiscal policy parameters.<\/p>  <p>  In June, the Commission published its assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s 2019 Stability Programme Update (SPU). On an ex-post basis, Ireland did not achieve its Medium-Term Objective (MTO) in 2018 with an estimated structural deficit of 1.4 per cent of GDP.\u00a0 However, there are important caveats to this. First, the Commission have acknowledged the very open nature of the economy and the difficulty in estimating the output gap (needed to assess the structural budget position). Partly for this reason, they prefer to use the expenditure benchmark as a guide to fiscal policy.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, the rate of increase in spending exceeded the limit applicable under the expenditure benchmark. However, the mechanical assessment of the expenditure benchmark takes no account of the non-indexation of income taxation in Ireland (which would permit higher levels of spending, all other things being equal). This is accounted for in an overall assessment and thus the breach of the expenditure benchmark was not adjudged to be significant by the Commission. In simple terms, the Commission&rsquo;s overall assessment is one of broad compliance in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  For 2019, the forecasts underlying the Stability Programme are compliant with the expenditure benchmark limit. When the years 2018 and 2019 are taken together, the Commission also adjudges Ireland to be compliant with the expenditure rule. The Commission acknowledges some risks of non-compliance with the fiscal rules but concludes that the overall assessment is one of compliance. As regards the MTO (-0.5 per cent structural deficit), the Commission&rsquo;s assessment is that Ireland will be compliant in both 2019 and 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300047#WRC03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Central Bank","counter":152,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300047#WRC03500"},{"type":"question","counter":153,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[24794\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300047#WRC03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his role in deciding which candidate Ireland will support to succeed Mr. Mario Draghi as President of the European Central Bank; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":154,"content":"<p>The President of the European Central Bank, Prof. Mario Draghi, is due to step down on 31 October this year. <\/p>  <p>  The selection process to appoint a candidate to succeed Mr Draghi will open in the coming months when the President of the Eurogroup will invite nominations for the position.\u00a0Following receipt of nominations the name(s)\u00a0will be discussed at Eurogroup and agreed at ECOFIN.

The Council is examining whether there are any students for whom both specialist and mainstream educational settings are currently not working and consider what might be contributing to this. <\/p>  <p>  We have significantly increased the availability of special placements for children with special educational needs as well as bringing more and more children into mainstream education.<\/p>  <p>  The number of ASD special classes has more than doubled in the last 5 years from 511 in 2014 to 1,196 across the country now. Provision in special schools has increased from 6,848 placements in 2011 to 7,872 this year. The NCSE has informed my Department that they intend to establish approx. 156 new ASD special classes nationally for 2019\/20 school year to meet currently identified need.<\/p>  <p>  Where students are excluded from school, the Department provides home tuition as a short term measure until a more permanent solution is identified.<\/p>  <p>  Circulars 0013 and 0014\/2017, which introduced the model for allocating special education teachers to schools, noted the importance of educational planning. This is in the context of ensuring that the children with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE Regional Support Service, which has incorporated the Special Education Support Service (SESS), the National Behavioural Support Service (NBSS) and the Visiting Teacher Service for the Visually Impaired and Hearing Impaired, provides advice and support to schools on the education and inclusion of students with special educational needs, providing in-school support for teachers and continuing professional development for teachers. <\/p>  <p>  It is also enhancing the multi-disciplinary capacity of the education system through providing access to expert knowledge in areas such as autism, speech and language and challenging behaviour. <\/p>  <p>  Schools are required to have policies in place for the promotion of student wellbeing, positive behaviour and an environment that is conducive to good teaching and learning.\u00a0 Advice and support is available to help schools in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) supports children with ASD, including those who may also present with Anxiety. This involves working with the teachers to build whole school capacity on working with children with special educational needs including autism and anxiety.\u00a0 It also involves working with individual children who are experiencing difficulty. <\/p>  <p>  There are legal provisions around the exclusion and expulsion of students and these are the responsibility of TUSLA.\u00a0Fair procedures are a key requirement.

The Act also removes those who offer their services as a prostitute from the existing offences of soliciting for the purpose of prostitution. One purpose of these measures is to provide additional protection to persons involved in prostitution, especially vulnerable persons and victims of human trafficking. This measure allows persons working in prostitution to provide information to the Garda&iacute; on, for example, violence towards them by clients, without risking prosecution for selling sexual services.<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 does not introduce a new offence of brothel-keeping. This offence has its basis in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993. The 2017 Act increased the penalty for brothel-keeping on summary conviction to a class A fine (&euro;5,000) or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both. Prior to amendment these penalties were &euro;1,000 and 6 months, respectively. The penalty for conviction on indictment remained unchanged: a fine not exceeding &pound;10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.<\/p>  <p>  These measures and others introduced by Part 4 of the 2017 Act are part of the Government efforts to target the demand for prostitution and are reinforced through awareness-raising efforts and well-publicised Garda operations. As regards decriminalising the offence of brothel-keeping, there are concerns that this could create a loophole that could be open to abuse by criminal gangs and others who wish to profit from prostitution.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to a review of the 2017 Act, Part 4 of the Act specifies that, not later than 3 years after its commencement, a Report will be prepared on the number of arrests and convictions in respect of the new offences, as well as an assessment of the impact on those who provide sexual services for payment. <\/p>  <p>  Once the mechanism for the review has been finalised, the Department expects that concerns such as those raised by the Deputy will be considered, along with other submissions made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300048#WRD04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Vetting","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300048#WRD04500"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[24670\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300048#WRD04600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if one Garda vetting application can be carried between separate organisations; and if not, if a person has to complete a separate application for each organisation with which the person is involved.","asker":"1323","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":241,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that the primary purpose of the employment vetting carried out by the National Vetting Bureau is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults. It is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na primarily in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016 and is, as I am sure you will agree, a very important task which must be done thoroughly and correctly. My Department has no role in the processing of individual vetting applications.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding sharing of vetting between organisations, vetting checks are conducted by the Garda National Vetting Bureau for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original vetting disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Data Protection Acts require that any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date. Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process. <\/p>  <p>  However, the Act provides for the sharing of vetting disclosures in certain circumstances by registered organisations; a facility which is of assistance in the health and education sectors, for example, in reducing the need for multiple vetting applications. Section 12(3A) of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that two or more relevant organisations can enter into a joint written agreement in relation to the employment, contracting, permitting or placement of a person to undertake relevant work or activities, thereby providing for only one of the organisations being required to conduct vetting in respect of that person.<\/p>  <p>  In general, the vetting process is working well and I understand that there are no backlogs or delays in Garda vetting at present. This efficiency has been achieved by the deployment of the e-vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations. The current turnaround time for vetting applications submitted by organisations utilising the e-vetting system is 5 working days for over 85% of applications received. Individual applicants can track the process of their application online using the e-vetting tracking system, details of which are contained in the email received by applicants when completing their application online. Furthermore, in circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is largely obviated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300048#WRD04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Data","counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300048#WRD04800"},{"type":"question","counter":243,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[24701\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300048#WRD04900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of individual prisoners that were held on 22 or 23 hour lock up for 15 or more consecutive days in 2018 and to date in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":244,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[24702\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300048#WRD05000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the average length of time individual prisoners spent in safety observation cells and close supervision cells from 1 May 2018 to 30 April 2019; and the longest duration of time spent in each type of cell over the period.","asker":"1259","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":245,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 97 together.<\/p><p>I am advised by my officials in the Irish Prison Service that it has not been possible in the timeframe available to collate the information sought.

Spurred on by advances in business technology and electronic media, those who operate harvesting entities in contravention of the law come from a variety of countries, backgrounds and disciplines that are proving prohibitive in terms of cost and scope to corral under a single regulator. <\/p>  <p>  Even in internet governance terms, these operators can literally change identity overnight when challenged, as they continue to be in this and other jurisdictions, and can operate outside the scope of national or EU law while also seeking to exploit several markets at once. These are the very substantial challenges that remain to finding a cost-effective regulatory response at either national or international level to claims harvesting operations, including as considered by the Cost of Insurance Working Group.<\/p>  <p>  As far as those aspects of claims harvesting which fall within the remit of my own Department may be concerned, the key regulatory focus continues to be on the interface between claims harvesters and those solicitors with whom they would wish to engage in a mercenary manner to the detriment of our insurance regime. This is being applied diligently by the Law Society which continues to take a strict approach against any offending solicitors or claims harvesters in this area as appropriate to the Society's role as the regulator of solicitors under the Solicitors' Acts. <\/p>  <p>  This approach, which has proven highly effective, has a number of key legislative components. Section 5 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 2002 generally prohibits unqualified persons from advertising a service of a legal nature that could otherwise be provided by a solicitor for a fee or reward.  This includes such advertising in relation to personal injuries claims in the context of claims harvesting websites. Moreover, section 62 of the Solicitors Act 1954 prohibits solicitors from rewarding or agreeing to reward unqualified persons for the introduction of legal business and provides that any such agreement is void. Under the Solicitors Advertising Regulations as recently updated by the Law Society with my consent under S.I. No. 229 of 2019, it remains the case that an advertisement intended to publicise or otherwise promote a solicitor in relation to the solicitor's practice shall be in such a form as shall not expressly or impliedly solicit, encourage or offer any inducement to any person or group or class of persons to make claims for damages for personal injuries or to contact the solicitor concerned with a view to such claims being made. <\/p>  <p>  From the active engagement by the Law Society and the on-going work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, I understand that the number of active claims harvesting websites operating in Ireland has drastically reduced in recent years from approximately 60 in 2016 to around 11 in more recent times. It is also understood from the Law Society that 23 websites have been removed from the internet on foot of its efforts since 2014 with further such removals possible.  The Society has previously issued relevant practice directions and directly notified claims referral companies found to be targeting solicitors about the statutory prohibition on solicitors paying referral fees. It has also successfully pursued these matters before the High Court and is, therefore, to be commended for the diligent and effective discharge of its particular regulatory functions in response to this threat to our insurance regime.<\/p>  <p>  This strict approach is set to continue under the new advertising provisions of section 218 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015. Under that section, such advertising will no longer be regulated by the legal professional bodies as happens at present but by the Legal Services Regulatory Authority. Specifically, section 218(d)(vi) of the 2015 Act allows for the restriction of any advertisement which, in the opinion of the Authority, &ldquo;expressly or impliedly solicits, encourages or offers any inducement to any person or group or class of persons to make claims for personal injuries or seek legal services in connection with such claims.&rdquo; The Authority will be carrying out the required public consultations in preparation for the new legal services advertising regulations coming into operation in Q1 of 2020. <\/p>  <p>  In so far, therefore, as claims harvesting operations are seeking to directly or indirectly engage solicitors in their claims work, the Solicitors Acts 1954 to 2015 are operating as a bulwark against them with recognised effect. Such a regulatory approach will continue under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015. While, in broader terms, the issue of claims harvesting does not seem at this time to lend itself to an immediately amenable regulatory solution, I will, along with my Department, continue to support the on-going work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group and of the Law Society in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300049#WRE03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Medical Service","counter":296,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300049#WRE03100"},{"type":"question","counter":297,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[24790\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300049#WRE03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress of the prison healthcare review following the appointment of the executive clinical lead; when the findings of the review will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":298,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the Irish Prison Service that the Executive Clinical Lead was appointed in July 2018.

Using this model, the allocation and transfer of Garda Personnel is determined by a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, minimum establishment, population, area, policing arrangements, and operational strategies. When considering the allocation of resources to a Division, comprehensive consultation is carried out with local Garda management during which all factors are taken into consideration.<\/p><p>In relation to the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute;, it is important to keep in mind that they have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.

Under the new legislation, the HSE Board will be the governing body of the HSE and will be accountable to the Minister for the performance of its functions and the CEO will be accountable to the Board. <\/p><p>A Board governance structure, with strong competencies across key areas, will be a key component in strengthening HSE governance and will contribute to strengthening the oversight and performance of the HSE. <\/p><p>Immediate priority issues for the Board include: <\/p><p>- developing and implementing an effective performance management and accountability system in the HSE <\/p><p>- developing a plan for building public trust and confidence in the HSE and wider health service.<\/p><p>- ensuring the HSE&rsquo;s full support for and implementation of the Government&rsquo;s programme of health reform as set out in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300051#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Discharges","counter":421,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300051#WRG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":422,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[24781\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300051#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of delayed discharges by hospital.","asker":"1222","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":423,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300051#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages Expenditure","counter":424,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300051#WRG00800"},{"type":"question","counter":425,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[24782\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300051#WRG00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the budget for home care services; the estimated cost in 2019 of the requirement to pay staff for travel time further to an EU directive; the estimated number of home care hours which will now not be funded as a result of this change; his plans to seek a supplementary budget to make up this shortfall; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":426,"content":"<p>Homecare is an important support that enables older people to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.

In addition to owners and occupants, the Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable the continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations. <\/p><p>From a regulatory perspective, Part B (Fire Safety) of the second schedule to the Building Regulations is under review.

Important revisions in the TGD B Volume 2 include enhanced provision for fire detection and alarm systems in dwelling houses, guidance on fire safety in community dwelling houses, guidance on timber frame construction, including new provisions in respect of timber frame party walls, enhanced provisions in respect of loft conversions, new provisions for galleries in dwelling houses and other general updates. A revised Volume 1, dealing with buildings other than dwelling houses (including apartment buildings), is being prepared for public consultation at present.  <\/p><p>Finally, in response to the building failures that have emerged over the last decade my Department has advanced a robust and focused Building Control Reform Agenda, including:<\/p><p>-  Amendments to the Building Control Regulations;<\/p><p>-  Establishment of a shared services National Building Control Management Project;

My Department and local authorities administer a number of funding programmes to assist AHBs with the cost of building, buying and leasing new social houses. All funding is conditional on the properties being made available to households on local authority waiting lists.<\/p><p>Under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), my Department, together with local authorities, can support AHBs to construct, purchase or lease housing units and make them available for social housing. The housing units are secured under long-term leases\/availability arrangements between local authorities and AHBs, the cost of which is recouped to local authorities by my Department. The Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) funding is capital support provided to AHBs by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units, including units acquired through the establishment of the Housing Agency Acquisition Fund.<\/p><p>The capital advance, which is up to 30% of the value of the eligible capital costs, is repayable by the AHB to the local authority at the end of a Payment and Availability (P&amp;amp;A) agreement, usually 30 years. All proposals for CALF are submitted to my Department by AHBs for review, to ensure that each project complies with the terms of the CALF and that there are sufficient funds available.<\/p><p>To date, 26 AHBs have availed of CALF to secure homes for social housing use. Funding eligibility is aligned to those AHBs signed up to and demonstrating compliance with the Voluntary Regulation Code. <\/p><p>AHBs and local authorities work closely on a local basis to plan and programme new social housing supply. This collaborative approach ensures that there is local authority support for a project prior to submission to my Department for funding approval. Applications for funding for a scheme or individual homes, which have not progressed, may have been withdrawn by local authorities or AHBs for various reasons, including the opportunities no longer being available. In many cases, the applications are resubmitted with revisions or by another AHB.<\/p><p>The CALF was introduced in 2011 and only a small number of AHBs availed of the facility during the period 2011 to 2013, delivering a total of 498 additional social housing homes under the scheme. Only over the last number of years has the sector moved to accessing private funding\/ borrowing and moving away from full exchequer support. Since 2014, the number of homes delivered using CALF support has increased significantly year on year, along with Exchequer funding to support AHBs to access finance for the provision of new social housing.<\/p><p>Delivery under CALF since 2014 is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>CALF<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>2018<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Homes Delivered<\/td><td>319<\/td><td>374<\/td><td>566<\/td><td>1,257<\/td><td>2,315<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>At the end of Q4 2018, there were some 3,600 homes approved for delivery either by building or acquisition using CALF and P&amp;amp;A support, which are scheduled to be delivered out to 2022.  As of June 2019, &euro;284 million had been loaned by local authorities to AHBs as CALF funding and a further &euro;244 million has been approved for lending.<\/p><p>Owing to the nature of the CALF, home delivery does not always arise in the same year as expenditure is incurred. Schemes delivered under phased programmes may cross a number of payment periods. A provision of &euro;94.4 million is available for CALF in 2019. <\/p><p>Expenditure under CALF since 2014 is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>CALF <\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>2018<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Expenditure<\/td><td>4.447m<\/td><td>13.374m<\/td><td>35.677m<\/td><td>55.677m<\/td><td>120.881m<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>In terms of social housing delivery, we are continuing to build on the significant progress that was made between 2016 and 2018 in terms of supporting new households. My Department is currently validating returns from all 31 local authorities and will shortly be publishing the local authority breakdown of delivery against targets for Quarter 1. <\/p><p>Indicative delivery outputs reflect that more than 5,800 additional housing supports have been provided in the first three months of this year across all of the various social housing delivery programmes, including build, acquisition, leasing, HAP and RAS. This includes more than 1,200 additional social homes provided by local authorities and AHBs under build, acquisition and leasing programmes.  <\/p><p>As you will be aware, my Department publishes a quarterly Construction Status Report. This report is a compendium of the new build programme across the 31 local authorities for new build social housing activity for the duration of Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p><p>By end 2018, the number of new build social homes now delivered or in the pipeline stood at over 19,000 of the overall build target of 33,600, with nearly 5,000 homes on site and under construction and a further 2,569 homes at the final pre-construction stage. The Quarter 1 2019 Report will be finalised in the coming days, and given the rate of new projects being added to the programme, going on site, and completing, I expect this to show a strong pipeline against the overall target.<\/p><p>Details of the annual social housing output for each of the local authority areas, as well as the specific output under each of the funding programmes, are available on my Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie\/housing\/social-housing\/social-and-affordble\/overall-social-housing-provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300054#WRK05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":681,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300054#WRK05300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Seirbh&iacute;s&iacute;

The Wildlife Act\u00a0affords protection\u00a0to a range of habitats and species and provides for regulation and control of activities that impinge on biodiversity, such as hunting and trade. \u00a0<\/p><p>The legislative framework\u00a0in place to protect biodiversity is further strengthened by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 SI No 477\/2011, which also fall under the remit of my Department. These Regulations transpose\u00a0the EU Birds Directive and\u00a0the EU Habitats Directive into national law, and provide for\u00a0protection of certain habitats and species across the\u00a0European Union and\u00a0give a framework for specific\u00a0measures to be taken to target areas of concern in each Member State. The main instruments provided for are the designation of Special Protection Areas (SPA) aimed at the protection of threatened species of birds and Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) aimed at protecting other animal species and habitats. There are currently 18 SAC sites and 6 SPA sites designated in County Offaly. <\/p><p>These include\u00a0the Slieve Bloom Mountains Nature Reserve, Ireland&rsquo;s largest state-owned Nature Reserve. It was established in 1985, so that it could be managed in such a way as to ensure the conservation of the mountain blanket bog ecosystem. In addition, the Nature Reserve is designated a Ramsar Wetland Site and a Council of Europe Biogenetic Reserve. Much of the greater upland area has been designated as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). The primary interest of the SAC is mountain blanket bog. <\/p><p>The Slieve Bloom Mountains are also designated a Special Protection Area (SPA), of special conservation interest for the hen harrier, a rare bird of prey. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are operating\u00a0&quot;the \u00a0Hen Harrier Project&quot; in 6 SPAs, including the Slieve Blooms, which\u00a0aims to reward farmers for managing their land to favour the Hen Harrier.\u00a0<\/p><p>Clara Bog in County Offaly is one of the\u00a0best remaining examples of midland raised bog in Western Europe. The Clara Bog Nature Reserve Visitor Centre includes an interactive exhibition space and\u00a0is open seasonally from May to October\u00a0and admission is free to the public. <\/p><p>My Department is also\u00a0responsible for developing and publishing Ireland's National Biodiversity Action Plan. The most recent Plan (Ireland's\u00a03rd) was published in October 2017 and includes a number of actions aimed at assisting local authorities throughout the country in their efforts to protect and conserve biodiversity in their areas. Local authorities\u00a0undertake much valuable work\u00a0in this sphere and\u00a0are an important element in the overall approach to halting biodiversity loss.\u00a0<\/p><p>In support of the work carried out by local authorities, last February I announced\u00a0at the National Biodiversity Conference a commitment in the coming years to double the funding my Department makes available for local Heritage and Biodiversity Officers to implement biodiversity actions at local level and to tackle invasive species. I am pleased that the\u00a0pilot grant scheme, introduced in 2018, to assist local authority led biodiversity projects will be\u00a0extended\u00a0with increased funding in 2019.<\/p><p>In 2018,\u00a0under this grant scheme, Offaly County Council received biodiversity\u00a0funding of &euro;13,600 from my Department for the conducting of Swift surveys;\u00a0support for the All Ireland Pollinator Plan;\u00a0Tidy Towns support; and conducting workshops in schools and preschools.
