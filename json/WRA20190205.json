The objective of this programme is to provide one clear referral pathway for all children irrespective of their disability, where they live or the school they attend. <\/p><p>Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Managers, who will lead these teams, are central to this successful reconfiguration of services. A large number of these managers are currently in post and the remaining vacancies were advertised late last year. Interviews for these posts were held recently and it is hoped that all of these Network Managers will be in post shortly. <\/p><p>In addition, the HSE are also working actively to reduce waiting times through the development of a standardised assessment process.<\/p><p>Funding for an additional 100 therapy posts for children&rsquo;s disability services was secured as part of Budget 2019. Detailed planning in relation to the location and breakdown of the posts is underway and is expected to be completed shortly. These additional posts, along with the reconfiguration of services and other innovative approaches will have a significant positive impact on waiting times for Assessment of Need and therapy service delivery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500061#WRB03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services Provision","counter":44,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500061#WRB03900"},{"type":"question","counter":45,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[5254\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500061#WRB04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a permanent general practitioner service for Carrigallen, County Leitrim, will be in place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":46,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the HSE that the GP post in Carrigallen, Co.

These services have been enhanced recently through the recruitment of assistant psychologists in primary care. The HSE also employs counsellors\/ therapists\/ psychologists in primary care addiction services.  In addition to HSE services, other agencies are also funded by the HSE to provide talking therapies including Jigsaw, MyMind, Turn2Me and Pieta House. <\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure greater consistency and equity of access to talk therapies, HSE Mental Health commenced a service improvement project in January 2018 with a view to developing a Model of Care for adults who access talk therapies while attending specialist mental health services.

In responding to these questions and in recognition of the complexity of the matters arising, I requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report on the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:<\/p>  <p>  a) the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology; andb) an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.<\/p>  <p>  Preparation of the report has involved consultation and engagement with national and international bodies. The report has been informed by review of international reports and safety reviews of mesh surgery which have been published in recent years. The report has also been informed by the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery.<\/p>  <p>  The Report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional SUI and POP procedures. However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women. These are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.<\/p>  <p>  The Report makes 19 recommendations including:<\/p>  <p>  - the development of patient information and informed consent materials;<\/p>  <p>  - surgical professional training and multidisciplinary expertise in units carrying out mesh procedures;<\/p>  <p>  - the development of clinical guidance;<\/p>  <p>  - the development of information systems to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices;<\/p>  <p>  - ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications; and<\/p>  <p>  - ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications. <\/p>  <p>  The report was completed and published on the Department of Health website on 21 November 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of the report&rsquo;s completion, the HSE was requested in May 2018 to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications. The HSE was also asked by the Chief Medical Officer on 24 July to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so, until a number of key recommendations are implemented. <\/p>  <p>  A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the HSE, to advise on and progress all of the recommendations.  I am informed that an ongoing work programme for the development of appropriate patient information resources and consent materials, and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications is being progressed through this Group. The HSE has advised that many women have already engaged with this pathway system and have attended centres for second opinion and follow up appointments.  <\/p>  <p>  I am informed that work is ongoing by the HSE to examine options for sourcing services from abroad to address any immediate shortfalls identified, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or through agreement with relevant centres. <\/p>  <p>  The Secretary General of my Department wrote to the HSE on November 27 2018 to request that it prepare a detailed Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, to be approved by the Leadership Team in the HSE and published on the HSE website within three months of receipt of the report, or sooner if completed. It was also requested that a copy of the Implementation Plan, together with an interim report on the implementation of those recommendations on which work has already commenced, should be submitted to the Department at the time of publication of the Implementation Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500064#WRE03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":216,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500064#WRE03200"},{"type":"question","counter":217,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[4712\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500064#WRE03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way in which there will be an increase of 170,000 personal assistant hours to persons with disabilities over the 2018 target without an increase in funding; the number of persons who will receive personal assistant hours in 2019; the average number of hours that will be provided per person daily; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":218,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

The Veterans&rsquo; Associations raise issues of concern to their members at these meetings.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the supports currently offered to veterans, my Department has Service Level Agreements with O.N.E. and IUNVA which set out the services the Department provides to these Associations.  Under the terms of these SLAs, my Department provides financial support by way of an annual subvention to O.N.E. and IUNVA to encourage their valuable efforts and the range of services they offer to ex-service personnel.  The subvention given to O.N.E. was increased from &euro;44,000 to &euro;100,000 per annum last year.  This significant increase in the grant will make a substantial contribution to the work of O.N.E. which provides accommodation to homeless, elderly and disabled ex-members of the Defence Forces in Smithfield, Dublin, Athlone and Letterkenny.  The subvention given to IUNVA is &euro;11,000 per annum.  The funding provided by my Department is to support the general overheads of the organisations. <\/p>  <p>  I am strongly supportive of O.N.E.&rsquo;s plans to increase the number of its Veteran Support Centres (VSCs) around the country.

It explicitly states that this should be seen as a minimum not a maximum effect. <\/p><p>The Budget 2019 Economic and Fiscal Outlook includes a sensitivity analysis, using the ESRI&rsquo;s COSMO model, on the impact of a 1% deterioration in global demand on our public finances, as measured through the general government balance. This specific external shock could arise through a number of channels, including through Brexit. <\/p><p>A number of UK studies on the economic impact of Brexit on the UK,  published in November last year, subsequent to Budget 2019, have found that it will be more negative than previously assumed. Among these studies was one by the UK National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), whose previous work on the issue was a key input to the joint Department of Finance ESRI research published in 2016.<\/p><p>My Department is therefore working with the ESRI on a new assessment of the economic and fiscal impact of Brexit on Ireland. This will update the 2016 exercise which has formed the basis of my Department&rsquo;s forecasts since then. The results will also inform my Department&rsquo;s next set of macroeconomic forecasts in the <i>Stability Programme Update<\/i>in April. This is being treated as a priority and the output is expected later this quarter.<\/p><p>Pending completion of the more detailed work currently underway, my Department prepared a preliminary &lsquo;holding&rsquo; assessment based on an initial application of the latest UK NIESR estimates, which were made public on the 29<sup><\/sup>January. The update shows that, over the medium-term, by 2023 the economy would be of the order of 4.25% smaller than the Budget 2019 forecasts, and of the order of 6% lower than a no Brexit baseline.<\/p><p>Further, the preliminary analysis suggests that there would be a sharp deterioration in the public finances, as measured by the general government balance. In 2019 the currently projected broad balance would turn to a deficit of 0.2% of GDP, with a further decline in 2020 &ndash; from a surplus of 0.3% of GDP to a deficit of 0.5% of GDP. In the short-term, the appropriate fiscal strategy would be to allow the public finances absorb the shock &ndash; the in-built automatic stabilisers will provide the first line of defence for our economy thereby allowing a deficit to occur<\/p><p>Clearly the impact of Brexit upon the economy and the public finances remains highly uncertain. The timing and nature of the UK&rsquo;s exit remains unclear; calibrating a model to simulate the impact of what is an unprecedented shock is challenging and the phasing-in of the economic impact is uncertain.<\/p><p>As more information becomes available, the Department will update and publish its assessment in the <i>Stability Programme<\/i>, which will be submitted to the European Commission in April. Additional information will be available at the time of Budget 2020, which will be introduced in October of this year, and this will enable Government to design the appropriate budgetary policy response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500066#WRG02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Customs and Excise Staff","counter":328,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500066#WRG02700"},{"type":"question","counter":329,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[5075\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500066#WRG02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the identified number of customs posts to be filled in advance of Brexit following the advertisement of 600 posts in 2018, by county and region in tabular form; if additional posts to the already advertised 600 posts will be required; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1269","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":330,"content":"<p>In September 2018, the Government granted approval in principle for the phased recruitment of an additional 600 Revenue staff to meet the challenges posed by Brexit.  <\/p><p>Revenue appointed over 150 staff to customs roles in the period September 2018 to 4 February 2019.

However, it should be noted that final details of Ireland&rsquo;s ultimate allocation will not be confirmed until after the conclusion of negotiations on the MFF. Beyond this estimate, there is no further detail available as to what the final allocation will be or how it will be allocated between the various Funds. For the next round, the Border Midland and Western Region will revert to being a transition region, as its GDP per capita is between 75% and 100% of the average EU GDP, while the Southern and Eastern Region remains a more developed region. The level of co-financing to be provided by the Member State has increased to 60% for more developed regions, 45% for transitions regions and 30% for less developed regions (up from 50%, 40% and 15\/20%).<\/p>  <p>  In line with the obligations under the European (Scrutiny) Act, 2002, and the European Union Act, 2009, with regard to the provision of information on EU business to the Oireachtas, scrutiny notes were prepared in relation to all elements of the package and have been considered by Joint Oireachtas Committee on EU Affairs. <\/p>  <p>  Since the European Commission published its legislative proposals on the regulations governing the implementation Cohesion Policy programmes post 2020, discussions have been on-going at Working Party and Ministerial level with Member States, seeking to clarify the proposals and assess their implications. Ireland is participating actively in these negotiations.  In general Ireland believes that the legislative package is a good starting point for negotiations and welcomes, in particular,  the level of simplification introduced in relation to the implementation of programmes.  <\/p>  <p>  Since the European Commission published its legislative proposals discussions have been on-going at Working Party and Ministerial Level and Council&rsquo;s position on the overall package remains to be finalised.<\/p>  <p>  Following on from the Bulgarian Presidency, who undertook the first examinations and considerations of the overall package, the Austrian Presidency held working party meetings almost weekly, aimed at progressing the Common Provisions Regulation (CPR), the European Regional Development Fund Regulation\/Cohesion Fund (ERDF\/CF), the European Social Fund + Regulation (ESF+), the European Territorial Cooperation Regulation (ETC) and the European Cross Border Mechanism Regulation (ECBM) &ndash; while concentrating on the CPR. This has allowed a \"partial general agreement\" (i.e., agreement on particular negotiating blocks, subject to overall agreement on MFF) on the Council&rsquo;s position, ahead of further negotiations with the European Parliament, to be reached on two blocks (or parts) of the Common Provisions Regulation, i.e. Blocks 1 and 5, relating to programming and strategic planning (Block 1), and management and control (Block 5). These were prioritised by the Austrian Presidency to assist national and regional authorities with their preparations for planning and programming the implementation of post 2020 programmes. The Austrian Presidency presented a progress report to the European Council on 13th\/14th December before handing the file over to the incoming Romanian Presidency.<\/p>  <p>  The Romanian Presidency commenced working party meetings on 10 January and like their predecessors have set out a very ambitions work programme involving almost weekly meetings.

However, parents and students in larger urban areas have a greater choice of post primary schools.  Among the factors that comes into consideration when selecting a school are the schools admissions policy, the range of subjects offered by the school, the various Programmes offered, school facilities and extra-curricular activities etc. The choice of post primary school is an important decision and parents and students must have the option of weighing up all the factors that a school has to offer and which best serves their individual needs and educational requirements.<\/p>  <p>  A student can attend the post-primary school of their choice, provided there is a place available. Where there is an accommodation problem, the school must give priority on the basis of its enrolment policy which is drawn up by their board of management. While most post-primary schools are in a position to enroll all students who apply, there is no automatic guarantee of a place in the school that the student chooses.<\/p>  <p>  On this basis therefore parents and students, in order to avoid disappointment, will initially register interest in more than one post primary school in order to increase the likelihood that they will be accepted into a school that meets their needs.  When the student officially accepts the offer of a place in a particular school, they are then officially enrolled into that school. <\/p>  <p>  As final enrolment plans may not be known until late August, my Department&rsquo;s Post Primary Online Database (P-POD) permits enrolment in more than one school to facilitate this.   All post-primary schools are required to make their returns of students (known as the October Returns) via P-POD.

Dublin have increased from 66 in 2011\/2012 to 197 in 2018\/2019. Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on <i>www.ncse.ie.<\/i><\/p><p>The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year, and where special provision, including special class provision, is required, it is planned and established to meet that need. This process is ongoing.<\/p><p>While it is not always possible or practical that a special class placement would be available in a child&rsquo;s local school, the NCSE has informed my Department that, in general, they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand nationally.

My Department is strongly supportive of the promotion of well-being in our schools and has a key role to play in the promotion of the well-being of children and young people in Ireland, in collaboration with the Departments of Health and Children and Youth Affairs, and with other Government Departments and Agencies. <\/p>  <p>  My Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting post primary schools in promoting well-being and positive mental health.  The process spans the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional development for teachers.  It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally. <\/p>  <p>  To support this holistic approach my Department has published a Well-being Policy Statement and Framework for Practice (2018-2023) for all schools which will inform how schools can best promote student well-being.  The policy statement and framework for practice provides an overarching structure encompassing existing, ongoing and developing work in the area of Well-being Promotion in schools.  <\/p>  <p>  Best practice indicates that schools adopt a whole-school, multi-component preventative approach to Well-being Promotion that includes both universal and targeted interventions.  A whole-school approach involves all in the school community engaging in a collaborative process to improve areas of school life that impact on well-being.  This will be achieved through the use of a School Self-Evaluation process taking Well-being Promotion as its focus.  It will allow schools to benchmark their practice against the statement of effective practice, and identify areas for development, implementation and review.  It is envisaged that schools will engage with the statements and adapt and develop the best practice items as they meet the needs in their own school community.<\/p>  <p>  A multi-component approach encourages schools to address areas, not only relating to Teaching and Learning but also relating to culture and environment, policy and planning and relationships and partnerships.  These areas are embedded in the Well-being Framework for Practice.  Working preventively and providing for both universal and targeted approaches is described as providing a &lsquo;Continuum of Support&rsquo;.  Schools are encouraged to provide supports to promote the well-being of all within the school community as well as providing some targeted interventions for children and young people presenting with vulnerabilities in the area of well-being.  <\/p>  <p>  It is my Department&rsquo;s aim that by 2023 all schools and centres for education will have embedded this dynamic School Self-evaluation process focusing on Well-being Promotion.  The implementation of this Well-being Promotion Process is an ongoing process that will ensure the necessary focus on supporting children and young people in having a sense of purpose and fulfilment, and the skills necessary to deal with life&rsquo;s challenges.<\/p>  <p>  A Well-being Policy Implementation Plan, which has specified seven high level goals, has been agreed for achievement over the next five years.  The seven high level goals are as follows: <\/p>  <p>1. Strengthen and align current structures within the Department and between the Department and other relevant Departments to ensure the coordinated implementation of this Well-being Policy Statement and Framework for Practice. <\/p>  <p>2. Plan and provide for the national roll-out of a professional development process to facilitate all schools and centres for education to engage with and embed a Well-being Promotion Process which builds professional capacity and collaborative cultures from 2018-2023. <\/p>  <p>3. Provide for an aligned, comprehensive and easily accessible programme of support for all schools and centres for education to address school-identified well-being promotion needs.  <\/p>  <p>4. Consider how the system is meeting current and future teachers&rsquo; learning needs relating to well-being promotion.<\/p>  <p>5. Develop a research based framework for the evaluation of well-being promotion in schools. <\/p>  <p>6. Improve use of supports for children and young people at key points of transition within and between education settings.  <\/p>  <p>7. Promote the well-being of school and centre of education personnel.<\/p>  <p>  The Well-being policy Statement encompasses the support for implementation of the Well-being in Post Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013) and Well-being in Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion (2015). These guidelines to present in an integrated way the existing elements of good practice to promote positive mental health, and direct then to new practices as appropriate.  They provide clear information for schools and for agencies supporting schools on how to address issues of mental health promotion. The European wide HSE supported, Health Promoting School Process (HSP) is also outlined, and the Well-being Guidelines show how the HSP can be introduced to schools to complement existing good practice. The Guidelines outline how schools support young people through early intervention and prevention, modelled on the NEPS Continuum of Support tiered approach (see appendices below for additional information).  <\/p>  <p>  Schools will be supported in this work by a national professional development programme currently being developed and trialed, and full roll out will commence in 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, our national support services will step up the investment made in building capacity within schools to deliver: <\/p>  <p>  - Training for teachers and school staff (including the Incredible Years programme, the Friends programme and the SafeTALK programme) <\/p>  <p>  - Improved curriculum content (through the Junior Cycle Well-being programme, improved resources for teachers to deliver Relationships and Sexuality Education) <\/p>  <p>  - Best practice models of school based student support teams <\/p>  <p>  - Protocols for connecting to wider support services <\/p>  <p>  - A national training programme to support schools to implement the Self-Evaluation Well-being Promotion Process and the development of Well-being Resources, including self-evaluation planning and feedback templates.<\/p>  <p>  The Framework for Junior Cycle 2015 includes an area of learning at junior cycle called Well-being encompassing Physical Education (PE), Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) and Civic, Social and Political Education (CSPE). Up to 400 hours is available for learning in the area of Well-being in junior cycle beginning with a minimum of 300 hours of timetabled engagement from 2017 and moving to the full complement of time as the new junior cycle is fully implemented. The Well-being Policy Statement 2018&ndash;2023 is the overarching context in which the implementation of the Junior Cycle Well-being Programme is situated in post primary schools. Within this policy and framework implementation, it is expected that the Junior Cycle Well-being Guidelines will be the focus for implementation with the Junior Cycle cohort. The NCCA has developed Guidelines for Junior Cycle Well-being to support schools in planning and implementing their Well-being Programme. The Guidelines situate curricular provision in CSPE, SPHE and PE within the broader context of whole-school provision for well-being. There is a suite of supports provided to post-primary schools to enable them to implement the Well-being Programme.  My department works in partnership  with the HSE,  Health promotion Services in developing lesson plans which will focus on mental health promotion  to support implementation of the social personal and health education curriculum in Junior Cycle well-being Programme.<\/p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), is leading work in supporting schools with review and development of student support teams in reviewing and developing support structures for teachers and students through the implementation of the Guidelines on Student Support Teams in Post- Primary Schools (2014). This guide provides practical support for schools in the implementation of significant elements of the Well-being in Post-Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013) and is in line with current national priorities in relation to the Well-being and mental health promotion among young people. <\/p>  <p>  The third edition of Responding to Critical Incidents: Guidelines and Resource Materials for Teachers issued to all schools in autumn 2016. This document provides comprehensive advice for schools in preparing for and dealing with a crisis situation.  Of particular note in the revised edition is the attention to inclusion of advice in relation to use of social media in crisis situations. The Guidelines are an essential support to school communities in preparing for and attending to Critical Incidents that challenge the coping mechanisms of schools.

It will support schools in the implementation of the Department&rsquo;s Anti-Bullying Procedures. The production of guidelines for boards of management in relation to homophobic bullying is also being supported.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills (through the Teacher Education Section), in conjunction with the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has introduced a training model for the delivery of SafeTALK suicide prevention training. This training aims to prepare people to identify those with suicidal thoughts and connect them to people and agencies that can help.

This includes developing standards, policies and carrying out accreditation of pharmacy degree programmes.<\/p>  <p>  In August 2014, the Minister for Health approved changes to the education and training of pharmacists. This change in Pharmacy education has come about because the regulatory body, the PSI, now requires graduates to have completed a Masters degree before entering the PSI Register and practising as a Pharmacist. The new programme was intended to keep pace with changing healthcare needs in Ireland and offer an improved student experience through its evidence-based and experiential-based learning approach<\/p>  <p>  For those students that commenced their pharmacy course from September 2015, the structure of the pharmacist qualification changed from a four-year Bachelor degree programme followed by a one-year Internship Programme (which resulted in the award of a Level 9 degree) to a five-year fully integrated pharmacy degree programme. <\/p>  <p>  This programme structure supports the dispersal of placements throughout the five years (rather than focussed on the final year) and culminates in the award of a Masters in Pharmacy (M.

Very significant modernisation of the law in this area was brought about in 2015 with the enactment of the Children and Family Relationships 2015, which amended extensively the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.  <\/p>  <p>  The reforms in family law provided for in that Act recognise the crucial role of parents and the need for a child to maintain meaningful relationships with both parents. <\/p>  <p>  Married parents of a child are automatically joint guardians and have joint custody of their children. Where married parents separate or divorce, they can decide between themselves on custody arrangements for their children or apply to the courts to decide on the matter. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Article 42A.4 of the Constitution requires that provision be made by law that in the resolution of all proceedings concerning the guardianship or custody of, or access to, any child, the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration.  Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 provides that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration for the court in any proceedings where guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child is in question.  Section 31 of the 1964 Act sets out a wide range of factors that the court is required to take into account when determining the best interests of the child in such proceedings.  These factors include the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with each of his or her parents.  The courts shall have regard to all of these factors or circumstances that it regards as being relevant to the child concerned and his or her family and make its decision accordingly. <\/p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 provides that either parent of a child, whether or not he or she is also a guardian of the child, may apply to court for a direction regarding the custody of a child or the right of access to the child.  Section 11D of the 1964 Act obliges the court in proceedings under section 11 to consider whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with each of his or her parents on a regular basis. <\/p>  <p>  Section 25 of the 1964 Act also requires the court, as it thinks appropriate and practicable, to take into account the child's wishes in guardianship, custody and access matters, having regard to the age and understanding of the child.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 12A of the 1964 Act provides that in making any order under the Act, the court may impose such conditions as it considers to be necessary in the best interests of the child.  <\/p>  <p>  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 made provision to assist parents who need to return to court because the other parent has breached a court order in relation to custody of, or access to, a child. Section 56 of the 2015 Act inserted a new section 18A into the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.  This provides that where a parent or guardian of a child has been granted custody of or access to the child under the 1964 Act, but he or she has been unreasonably denied such custody or access by another guardian or parent, that person may apply to court for an enforcement order.  <\/p>  <p>  I have no role in the making of court orders in relation to guardianship, custody and access to children. This is a matter for the courts, which are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the performance of their functions. <\/p>  <p>  While there are no plans at present for further amendment of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 in relation to custody and access, the operation of the law in this area is kept under ongoing review by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  I aim to publish proposals early in 2019 for a new approach to handling family law cases in Ireland at District, Circuit and High Court levels. This will be done by legislation to create a new dedicated Family Court within the Circuit and District Courts which will sit with dedicated Family Court judges and deal only with family law business. These courts will have new procedures aimed at less adversarial resolution of disputes, and facilities and case management aimed at helping litigants and seeking to resolve issues between the parties short of having to bring them before the courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500072#WRN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Closed-Circuit Television Systems","counter":637,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500072#WRN02000"},{"type":"question","counter":638,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[4962\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500072#WRN02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if applications are open for the community-based CCTV scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":639,"content":"<p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to supporting investment in CCTV systems.

If the conviction is eligible to be spent, it becomes spent once seven years has passed from the date of conviction.  <\/p>  <p>  While a person would not be penalised for failing to disclose a conviction that is spent, disclosure is required in certain circumstances including for example for specified work, such as with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, or applying for a public service vehicle, private security, taxi or firearm licence.  <\/p>  <p>  It is also the case that section 7 of the 2016 Act provides that a court may admit or require evidence regarding a spent conviction in certain circumstances and subject to any necessary  restrictions with regard to publication of that evidence. <\/p>  <p>  Arising from the above,  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not required to expunge the details of such offences from PULSE.

An adult might require the court&rsquo;s protection because of mental incapacity. This covers the majority of persons taken into wardship. When considering whether or not a person over the age of 18 years should be taken into wardship, the court must be satisfied that the person is, on the basis of the medical evidence available, mentally incapacitated and incapable of managing his or her affairs, and that it is necessary for the protection of his or her person or property that s\/he be taken into Wardship. <\/p>  <p>  A minor (child under 18 years of age) might also require the court&rsquo;s protection and there are a number of reasons why it might be necessary to take a young person into wardship. The most common reason is that the child has been awarded substantial damages by a Court and has special housing or care needs. Wardship is declared only where it is considered necessary for the protection and\/or benefit of the relevant person. While the needs of each ward are different, all wards are under a legal disability and are therefore vulnerable persons. <\/p>  <p>  The Wards of Court Office, under the direction of President of the High Court, takes its responsibility to protect the person and property of every ward seriously. It ensures that the ward&rsquo;s assets are protected and appropriately invested, approves expenditure on the ward&rsquo;s behalf, deals with the ward&rsquo;s committee or guardian (usually a family member) to ensure that the ward&rsquo;s personal needs are met, deals with proposals for sale, purchase or adaptation of accommodation for the ward&rsquo;s benefit, liaises with healthcare professionals and drafts proposals on the person and property of the ward for the President of the High Court.<\/p>  <p>  The Courts Service has also advised that the committee or guardians are usually family members. In cases where there is no suitable relative who is prepared to act, or where there is disagreement among the ward&rsquo;s relatives which cannot be resolved, or where a conflict of interest arises, the court may appoint the General Solicitor for Minors and Wards of Court to act as an independent committee or guardian to ensure that the interests of the ward are protected. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Wards of Court Office appoints a case officer for each ward of court when the person is brought into wardship. The case officer meets with the committee or guardian appointed by the President of the High Court and will liaise with that committee or guardian throughout the wardship to ensure that the care and monetary needs of the ward are met. Case officers in the Wards of Court Office are all experienced Civil Servants of at least Assistant Principal level. If any concern is raised by the committee or guardian as to the property, affairs or welfare of the ward that is dealt with by the case officer in conjunction with the committee or guardian. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced. <\/p>  <p>  The Act provides for the repeal of the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871 and the Marriage of Lunatics Act 1811. The current Wards of Court system for adults will be phased out over a three year period from the commencement of Part 6 of the Act. The Act offers a continuum of options to support people in maximising their decision-making capability. <\/p>  <p>  Each adult ward (a ward who has attained the age of 18 years by the date of commencement of Part 6 of the Act) will be reviewed in accordance with the new system. A ward who is found to have capacity will be discharged from wardship. A ward who continues to have capacity needs will be discharged from wardship and offered the support option most appropriate to his or her needs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500072#WRN04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":666,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500072#WRN04900"},{"type":"question","counter":667,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[5214\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500072#WRN05000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress to date in the determination of an application for residency status in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":668,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned requested permission to remain on 8 October 2018.

Roughly one third of these incidents were deemed unsuitable for inclusion in the juvenile diversion system, and it has emerged that almost 8,000 of these crimes were not properly pursued. This is a completely unacceptable situation that must be thoroughly addressed in the interest of victims and the proper administration of Justice, and for the future welfare of the children who committed the crimes.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the apology which was issued by the Garda Commissioner, the Garda&iacute; have commenced a process to contact victims and have also provided a Helpline for anyone who might be affected by the failure to process these cases. Details of the Helpline are available on the Garda website. I am anxious that all relevant information must be made available to the victims, including the steps being taken to deal with the failures that have occurred.<\/p>  <p>  A number of fundamental issues have been identified by the Garda examination, including inadequate ICT and supervision, a lack of training, and alleged failings by individual Garda&iacute;.  <\/p>  <p>  Concerns about similar gaps have surfaced previously on different issues and, as the Deputy is aware, last month the Government published the Implementation Plan which will give effect to the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.

The Review, which was published in September 2018, was overseen by an Interdepartmental Group (IDG) of senior officials of a number of Government Departments.<\/p>  <p>  The report confirms that the current employment permits system is robust and has served the country well in recent years.

Work has commenced on the implementation of the review's recommendations, including scoping out the legislative changes required through both primary and secondary legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500074#WRP03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Science Foundation Ireland","counter":752,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500074#WRP03100"},{"type":"question","counter":753,"qnumday":307,"qnumall":"[5450\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500074#WRP03200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the estimated cost in 2019 if the budget for Science Foundation Ireland increased by 8%.","asker":"1266","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":754,"content":"<p>My Department has allocated &euro;206.61m in current and capital funding to Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) in 2019.

The Strategy emphasises the need for a \"whole community response\" to dementia, as the majority of people with dementia live in their own communities and wish to avail of services in their local area.<\/p>  <p>  To support future development of services and supports for people with dementia, the National Dementia Office and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland undertook a joint project in 2016 and 2017 to map dementia-specific community-based services across the country.  Information from the project is included in an on-line service finder on the Understand Together website so people can find out what services are available in each county.<\/p>  <p>  Gaps remain in access to services and there is a large variance in what services are provided across the country.  The National Dementia Office has met with senior HSE officials in each CHO area to highlight service gaps in each area and to provide guidance and support on dementia service planning and development across the country.  In addition a Dementia Needs Analysis Framework was developed to support services.<\/p>  <p>  Considerable efforts have been undertaken to progress the National Dementia Strategy, and this has been recorded in the mid-term review of the Strategy, published last year.  The review also highlights work to be carried out by the National Dementia Office to further implement the Strategy.  In the medium term, the HSE is working to create compassionate, inclusive communities for people with dementia and their carers, by building a network of community activation champions and partnering with a wide range of businesses and organisations nationally as part of the Dementia Understand Together campaign.<\/p>  <p>  Significant funding has been secured by the Department of Health from the Dormant Accounts Fund since 2016 to develop projects which seek to improve care and supports for people with dementia.  Projects receiving funding include the delivery of post-diagnostic supports; a dementia diagnostic service for people with intellectual disability; a national network of memory technology resource rooms; the development of a national dementia registry; the national roll-out of a dementia training programme for HSE home care staff; the development of dementia resource centres; community support projects for people with dementia; funding for a Dementia Community Activation Co-ordinator to support community-based dementia champions across Ireland; and a review of young-onset dementia diagnostic processes and practices to inform future service development needs.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these community supports, in 2014 the HSE introduced Dementia-Specific Intensive Homecare Packages to test the feasibility of providing a high level of support to people with dementia with complex needs to facilitate them to remain living at home.  These were initially co-funded by the HSE and the Atlantic Philanthropies and now fully funded by the HSE, which has committed to continue to provide approximately 120 packages at any one time.  In addition to the IHCPs, people with dementia are also able to avail of standard home care services on the basis of need and within the resources available.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE are committed to further expanding the level of community supports for older people, including people with dementia, subject to the availability of resources, and cognisant of the large number of areas competing for finite resources.  The National Dementia Office is also working to ensure that existing community health and social care services are optimised to meet the needs of people with dementia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500074#WRP05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Properties","counter":778,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500075#WRQ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":779,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[4957\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500075#WRQ00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progression of refurbishment of the HSE property in Drogheda Street, Monasterevin, County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":780,"qnumday":316,"qnumall":"[4958\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500075#WRQ00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the funds spent on the refurbishment of the HSE property in Drogheda Street, Monasterevin, County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":781,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 315 and 316 together.<\/p><p>As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the management of the healthcare property estate, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to you in relation to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500075#WRQ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","counter":782,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500075#WRQ00700"},{"type":"question","counter":783,"qnumday":317,"qnumall":"[4966\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500075#WRQ00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if home help will be reinstated for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":784,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500075#WRQ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Applications","counter":785,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500075#WRQ01000"},{"type":"question","counter":786,"qnumday":318,"qnumall":"[4987\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500075#WRQ01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an application for a hearing aid by a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":787,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500075#WRQ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Products Supply","counter":788,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500075#WRQ01300"},{"type":"question","counter":789,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[4989\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500075#WRQ01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the anxiety and worry the parents of children with SMA are experiencing due to the delay in making the drug Spinraza available; the timeline for making it available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":790,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the HSE has statutory responsibility for medicine pricing and reimbursement decisions, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.

There are already additional stocks of medicines routinely built into the Irish medicine supply chain, and these additional stocks, together with planning by Revenue to allow the fast-tracking of essential drugs into Ireland, where necessary, will help deal with any delays that may arise.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no need for hospitals, pharmacists or patients to order extra quantities of medicines, or for doctors to issue additional prescriptions.  To do so could disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for other patients.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, the HPRA developed and launched a multi-stakeholder Medicine Shortages Framework to anticipate and manage medicine shortages when they occur.  This framework is used to manage and address an average of 45 shortage notifications a month.

HSE and HPRA technical experts are undertaking a process to verify the contingency planning in place for the continuity of supply of medicines essential to public health, including those with a narrow therapeutic index, in order to determine those medicines that have the potential to be vulnerable to supply disruption and, where necessary, identify clinically appropriate alternatives.  Work on this process is ongoing and will continue in the months before and after Brexit.  <\/p>  <p>  Both the HPRA and HSE have requested that medicines manufacturers and suppliers highlight any issues regarding the availability of specific products associated with Brexit and, to date, no major issues have been identified through this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500075#WRQ05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Healthcare Infrastructure Provision","counter":830,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500076#WRR00200"},{"type":"question","counter":831,"qnumday":333,"qnumall":"[5047\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500076#WRR00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an extension and redevelopment at a hospital (details supplied).","asker":"1225","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":832,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of healthcare infrastructure projects and has advised that a planning application for this project was submitted in December 2018.

The Strategy is intended to promote older people&rsquo;s health and well being so that older people can continue to contribute to social, economic, cultural and family life in their own communities for as long as possible, thereby representing a vision for an age-friendly society.  The Strategy highlights that ageing is not just a health issue, but rather requires a whole of Government approach to address a range of social, economic and environmental factors that affect the health and well-being of our ageing citizens.  <\/p><p>As part of the NPAS implementation process, a Healthy and Positive Ageing Initiative (HaPAI) was established in collaboration with the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Well-being Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies.<\/p><p>HaPAI provides an ongoing system for measuring and reporting on positive ageing and implement the research objectives of the National Positive Ageing Strategy (NPAS).  It was jointly funded by the Department of Health, the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Well-being Programme, and the Atlantic Philanthropies until December 2017, with a commitment to Department of Health funding for a further two years. <\/p><p>The initiative aims to monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and well-being linked to the goals and objectives of the NPAS.  This is done primarily through the development of national positive ageing indicators to be published every two years. <\/p><p>The first Positive Ageing National Indicators Report in 2016 identified that 7.1% of people aged 50+ often feel lonely and that women have a higher loneliness score than men at all ages.  However, more than nine out of 10 (93%) people aged 50+ have at least one supportive relative or friend, five in seven (85%) of people aged 50+ engage in at least one social leisure activity on a weekly basis, more than one in four (26%) people aged 50+ volunteered in the past 12 months and eight out of 10 (82%) people aged 50+ report high life satisfaction.  The second National Positive Ageing Indicators report will be published later this year. <\/p><p>A Local Indicators report, entitled Positive Ageing in Age Friendly Cities and Counties, was published in June 2018.  This identified that older people in rural settings were more likely to have difficulties accessing public transport than those in more urban settings.  However, an urban or rural environment made no difference to older peoples level of socialising, with over 90% of people aged 55+ socialising at least once a month.<\/p><p>The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) is a large-scale, nationally representative, longitudinal study on ageing in Ireland, the overarching aim of which is to make Ireland the best place in the world to grow old.

Securing access to new and innovative medicines in a timely manner is a key objective of the Irish Health Service.  Officials in my Department are aware of the document referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  The challenge of accessing innovative medicines at affordable prices affects all countries.  A constant pipeline of new medicines, whose asking prices are in many cases beyond what health services can afford, mean that the increase in pharmaceutical expenditure that our rapid demographic changes require is unsustainable. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is already engaging in a number of initiatives in relation to access to medicines through its international agenda, most notably through its membership of the BeNeluxA initiative.  The BeNeluxA collaboration seeks to enhance patients' access to high quality and affordable treatments, improve the payers' position in the market through joint negotiations, increase transparency on pricing between the collaborating countries, share policy expertise and focus on knowledge building. BeNeluxA members will work closely together to identify pragmatic solutions to the challenges which we all face with medicine pricing, sustainability and supply.<\/p>  <p>  The four-year Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines, between the State and the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), was signed in 2016. It is expected to deliver &euro;600 million in savings in its lifetime from IPHA companies and &euro;150 million in savings from non-IPHA companies. The Agreement contains a number of measures intended to increase sustainable drug access and supply, including setting prices relative to those in over half of EU member states, reviewing prices annually against the reference countries to achieve better value for money over a product&rsquo;s lifetime and formal health technology assessment of new treatments to inform reimbursement decision making.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that partnership with industry is a key aspect of improving access to new medicines.  At the last bi-annual meeting between my Department and IPHA, a proposed dialogue was discussed. It is envisioned that this will take the form of a structured platform of engagement, to create better patient access to new treatments. An Open Policy Forum also took place in November 2018 with the Departments of Health, Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and IPHA.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to more engagement with stakeholders over the course of the year, with the aim of building a fairer partnership between industry to help ensure that patients get sustainable access to new medicines in as timely a manner as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500079#WRU00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Addiction Treatment Services","counter":977,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500079#WRU00500"},{"type":"question","counter":978,"qnumday":389,"qnumall":"[5305\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500079#WRU00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 58 of 5 December 2018, if extra resources will be committed to allow adequate spaces for those wishing to detox from Z-drugs in a community setting (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":979,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500079#WRU00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pharmaceutical Sector","counter":980,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500079#WRU00800"},{"type":"question","counter":981,"qnumday":390,"qnumall":"[5318\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500079#WRU00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will ensure that pharmacy students will be in a position to be paid for their mandatory placement; his views on the enormous financial strain this will cause students; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1283","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":982,"content":"<p>The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) is the pharmacy regulator in Ireland and is responsible for regulating pharmacists and pharmacies in the public interest.

One of the recommendations included the introduction of an integrated 5-year Masters level programme of education and training for pharmacists in line with international best practice, to replace the previous 4 year Bachelor plus 1 year in-service practical training programme.<\/p>  <p>   A National Forum was established to advise and assist the Council of the PSI in its oversight of the development and ongoing delivery of the new fully integrated programme of pharmacy education, training and assessment. The National Forum for Pharmacy Education and Accreditation Interim Report of November 2013 noted that it was an essential component of the integrated degree that the student remain a student for the full five years of study. Under the previous model, students became employees during their final year. <\/p>  <p>  The PSI has advised that under the new programme structure, the entire structure, content and curriculum has integration taking place on a number of levels: within the curriculum through the revisiting of the theory and knowledge base as the student advances through the programme; and within the practice placement experiences. These practice placements are designed to be workplace based learning experiences overseen by the academic institutions during which pharmacy students have the opportunity to contextualise their academic learning in a real practice setting. <\/p>  <p>  The PSI have further advised that their accreditation process involves visits to the universities (UCC, TCD &amp;amp; RCSI) operating the MPharm programme, which includes meeting with representative students at each School of Pharmacy. The accreditation teams assess the programme of training and education various standards, including one related to students and the supports available to students.<\/p>  <p>  The institutions meanwhile deliver the programmes of education and training over the 5 years of the MPharm degree, including student enrolment, academic coursework, sourcing and governance of placements.<\/p>  <p>  I understand the PSI and the Schools have engaged over the matter and my officials have requested to be kept informed of developments. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500079#WRU01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Data","counter":983,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500079#WRU01100"},{"type":"question","counter":984,"qnumday":391,"qnumall":"[5319\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500079#WRU01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of general practitioner full-time equivalents for the past three years by county and year in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":985,"content":"<p>As the question relates to service matters, I have arranged for it to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500079#WRU01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pharmacy Regulations","counter":986,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500079#WRU01400"},{"type":"question","counter":987,"qnumday":392,"qnumall":"[5321\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500079#WRU01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the concerns of dispensing pharmacists in relation to the falsified medicines directive; if the concerns will be taken into account; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":988,"content":"<p>The &lsquo;Safety Features&rsquo; Delegated Regulation introduces new rules for the supply of medicines from the 9th February 2019.

Indeed it must be emphasised that every sector of our society has a role in reducing the burden of obesity and the OPAP clearly acknowledges this.<\/p><p>The OPAP prescribed short-term (five-year) targets for overweight and obesity as follows:<\/p><p>- a sustained downward trend (averaging 0.5% per annum as measured by the Healthy Ireland Survey) in the level of excess weight averaged across all adults<\/p><p>- a sustained downward trend [averaging 0.5% per annum as measured by the Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative (COSI)] in the level of excess weight in children, and<\/p><p>- a reduction in the gap in obesity levels between the highest and lowest socioeconomic groups by 10%, as measured by the Healthy Ireland and COSI surveys.<\/p><p>The annual cost of the Healthy Ireland Survey, which collects data on a wide range of health and wellbeing issues including those relevant to the OPAP, under current contractual arrangements will be &euro;719,346 (&euro;884,796 including VAT). Through grants, the HSE provides support for the operations of the National Nutrition Surveillance Centre to coordinate COSI.<\/p><p>The OPAP policy prescribed 'Ten Steps Forward' that would be taken to prevent overweight and obesity. A new Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group was established in October 2017. The current position with implementing some of these is as follows:<\/p><p>1.<i>Embed multi-sectoral actions on obesity prevention with the support of government departments and public sector agencies<\/i><\/p><p>An Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group (OPIOG) has been established under the Chair of the Department of Health. It is comprised of representatives from the following Departments and Agencies: Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Department of Children and Youth Affairs; Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; Department of Education and Skills; Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government; University College Cork; the Food Safety Authority of Ireland; the Health Service Executive (HSE) - including the National Clinical Lead for Obesity; and Safefood. The OPIOG held its inaugural meeting in October 2017 with further meetings arranged at agreed intervals for the purposes of providing oversight to the implementation of the national Obesity Policy &amp;amp; Action Plan (OPAP). <\/p><p>At its next meeting, the OPIOG will consider the Report on Tackling Childhood Obesity from the Joint Oireachtas  Committee on Children and Youth Affairs for the purposes of, among others, aligning both sets of recommendations. In the meantime, the preparation of a Progress Report on the implementation of OPAP is continuing so that it can be considered at this next OPIOG meeting. The development of an annual bulletin or score card to evaluate progress in relation to the national Obesity Plan and dissemination of results, has also been initiated.<\/p><p>The OPAP recommended that proposals be developed relating to the rollout of evidence based fiscal measures, including a levy on sugar-sweetened drinks, in support of healthy eating. As the Deputy is aware the Sugar-Sweetened Drinks Tax commenced on the 1st of May 2018. It represents a positive step in our national policy to deal with the problem of obesity.<\/p><p><i>2. Regulate for a healthier environment<\/i><\/p><p>The development of legislation for calorie posting to support people to make healthy choices is underway by the Department of Health. Currently, a behaviour study on how best to make the posting of calories meaningful to customers and more likely to impact on their behaviours is being finalised by the ESRI. <\/p><p>A number of Government policies aim to support the design and development of built environments that enhance health, wellbeing and quality of life for all. The National Physical Activity Plan (NPAP) and OPAP both require that joint action is taken to promote the importance of physical activity and to reduce the obesogenic nature of the built environment.<\/p><p>In line with Actions 31 of the NPAP and 2.1 of the OPAP, which commit to developing guidelines and support materials for those working in developing the built environment in order to promote the importance of physical activity, and Action 59 of the NPAP which commits to developing a programme of on-going stakeholder communication and engagement, a Stakeholder Forum was held on the 21st of November last. <\/p><p>The event was planned in partnership, with substantial input from three Government Departments, (Health; Transport, Tourism and Sport; and Housing, Planning and Local Government). Work will progress in 2019 based on the outcomes of the forum's discussions.<\/p><p><i>3. Secure appropriate support from the commercial sector to play its part in obesity prevention.<\/i><\/p><p>At its inaugural meeting, the OPIOG agreed to establish two sub-groups for Reformulation and Healthy Eating. Both sub-groups have met on a number of occasions since being established and agreed their Terms of Reference.<\/p><p>The Reformulation sub-group is technical in its work programme. The work of the sub-group will primarily set targets on reformulation of food and drink. It will also make recommendations on addressing reduction of portion sizes and on monitoring and validation procedures.<\/p><p>One of the priority actions under Step 3 of the OPAP was to &lsquo;Establish a forum for meaningful engagement with industry on best practice initiatives towards a healthy food environment&rsquo;. It is intended to progress this action under the auspices of the OPIOG. And in this regard, a workshop between the Reformulation sub-group of the OPIOG and Food Sector Stakeholders on reformulation took place last September. This workshop provided an opportunity for detailed engagement with key Food Sector Stakeholders on the challenges and opportunities of reformulation in the interest of promoting the health and wellbeing of the population. Another similar engagement has been scheduled for late February.<\/p><p>A code of practice for food and beverages promotion, marketing and sponsorship has also been developed involving representatives from the food industry, advertising sector, statutory agencies, and various Government Departments. It was chaired by the former CEO of the statutory Food Safety Authority of Ireland, and published in 2018. Work on the implementation of the Codes of Practice is continuing.<\/p><p>4.<i>Implement a strategic and sustained communications strategy that empowers individuals, communities and service providers to become obesity aware and equipped to change, with a particular focus on families with children in the early years.<\/i><\/p><p>The Healthy Ireland 2018 communications and citizen engagement campaign sought to encourage people to make small, healthy changes under the themes of Healthy Eating, Physical Activity and Mental Wellbeing, and to link them with partner organisations and initiatives providing information and support. This campaign will continue in 2019.<\/p><p>In addition, under Healthy Ireland, the Department, <i>safe<\/i>food and the HSE run a campaign called START which  aims to inspire, empower and support parents to start building and persist with healthy lifestyle habits in the family to prevent childhood obesity.<\/p><p>5.<i>The Department of Health, through Healthy Ireland, will provide leadership, engage and co-ordinate multi-sectoral action and implement best practice in the governance of the Obesity Policy and Action Plan.<\/i><\/p><p>As referred to at step 1 above, an Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group was established to oversee implementation. New Healthy Eating Guidelines, Food Pyramid and supporting resources have already been published, disseminated and communicated in 2017, including dissemination of the new Guidelines to all primary and post-primary schools. <\/p><p>Work has also commenced on developing Healthy Eating Guidelines for the 1-5 year old age group. As a first step in this work, the Scientific Committee of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) is currently developing scientific recommendations for food based dietary guidelines for 1 to 5 year olds.<\/p><p>New Nutrition Standards for schools, with an initial focus on school meal programmes funded by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, have also been developed. These Nutrition Standards were published in September 2017. The Nutrition Standards were developed by the Department of Health with the assistance of <i>safe<\/i>food and the Health Service Executive, in cooperation with the members of the School Meals Programme in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills. <\/p><p>6.<i>Mobilise the health services to better prevent and address overweight and obesity through effective community-based health promotion programmes, training and skills development and through enhanced systems for detection and referrals of overweight and obese patients at primary care level.<\/i><\/p><p>A Healthy Eating, Active Living Programme has been established as a Policy Priority Programme within the HSE and a three-year plan for the programme has been finalised. The GP contract for the provision of free care to children under 6 years, already provides that the medical practitioner shall take an active approach toward promoting health and preventing disease through the provision of periodic assessments to child patients. <\/p><p>The HSE is also implementing a Breastfeeding Action Plan and a new Making Every Contact Count brief intervention framework which aims to capitalise on the opportunities that occur every day within the health service to support people to make healthy lifestyle choices.<\/p><p>On the issue of nutrition in hospitals, the HSE, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Healthy Ireland, is to roll out a new Food, Nutrition and Hydration Policy for patients in acute hospitals in the coming months. A Clinical Specialist Dietitian was appointed to work across Acute Hospital Services to lead on the development of a National Food, Nutrition and Hydration Policy. A team working at national level, composed of all relevant staff including catering, (managers and chefs), dietitians, management, medical, nursing , occupational therapy and speech and language have worked together to develop the policy. Support and guidance to aid implementation of the policy will be provided in an accompanying toolkit. The policy and toolkit are due for publication and implementation over the coming months. <\/p><p>7. Develop a service model for specialist care for children and adults.<\/p><p>A National Clinical Lead for Obesity was appointed in 2017. This appointment is important in further advancing the implementation of many of the recommendations in the OPAP including the development of a national integrated service model for the health and social care of overweight and obese people and for developing quality assurance guidance for obesity services. <\/p><p>8.<i>Acknowledge the key role of physical activity in the prevention of overweight and obesity.<\/i><\/p><p>'Get Ireland Active! The National Physical Activity Plan for Ireland' (NPAP) is one of the key developments arising from Healthy Ireland, and implementation of that Plan is well underway in collaboration with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and a range of other stakeholders. An updated progress report on the implementation of the NPAP will be published in Q1 2019.<\/p><p>9.<i>Allocate resources according to need, in particular to those population groups most in need of support in the prevention and management of obesity, with particular emphasis on families and children during the first 1,000 days of life<\/i><\/p><p>The implementation of the Healthy Eating and Active Living Plan within the HSE is supporting work in the education sector, as well as with parents, families and communities in delivering a more co-ordinated approach to prevention and early intervention in child obesity.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500079#WRU03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1010,"content":"<p>Question No. 400 answered with Question No. 94.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Funding","counter":1011,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500079#WRU03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1012,"qnumday":401,"qnumall":"[5422\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500079#WRU03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the level of funding included in budget 2019 and the HSE National Service Plan 2019 for equipping and staffing the 40 bed modular unit at South Tipperary General Hospital in view of the reply to Topical Issue no.3 on 29 January 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1348","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1013,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500079#WRU04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1014,"content":"<p>Question No. 402 answered with Question No. 69.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabilities Assessments","counter":1015,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500079#WRU04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1016,"qnumday":403,"qnumall":"[52343\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500079#WRU04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the failure of the HSE to complete assessment of needs for children with disabilities within a reasonable timeframe (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1299","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1017,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

Women who live in Northern Ireland can access termination services in this jurisdiction but would, in effect, be doing so as private patients and would be subject to charges in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  While I share the Deputy's wish to facilitate access without charge to termination-of-pregnancy services to women from Northern Ireland, such a proposal raises a number of legal and policy issues.

The Act provides that persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and family can qualify for full eligibility (a medical card). The HSE can only award medical cards in accordance with the Health Act and, therefore, it must assess applicants on the overall financial situation of the applicant and his or her spouse or partner. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is obliged to operate within the legal parameters as set out in the Health Act, while also responding to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals who apply for a medical card. Under the legislation, there has never been an entitlement to a medical card based on having a particular disease or illness. The HSE gives effect to this legislation through its Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE's Expert Group on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility examined the issue of awarding medical cards on the basis of illness and concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  The Expert Group also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  This position remains unchanged. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE also has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to emergency situations i.e. in circumstances where persons are in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and also for persons in palliative care who are terminally ill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500081#WRW01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Addiction Treatment Services","counter":1091,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500081#WRW01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1092,"qnumday":429,"qnumall":"[5525\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500081#WRW01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons treated for gambling addiction in each of the years from 2007 to 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1093,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500081#WRW01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"question","counter":1095,"qnumday":430,"qnumall":"[5526\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500081#WRW01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a dedicated nationwide gambling prevalence survey will be undertaken to identify the number of problem gamblers here, ascertain the scale of problem gambling and put the correct supports in place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1096,"content":"<p>The Drug Use in Ireland and Northern Ireland, Drugs Prevalence Survey 2014\/2015 contains data on prevalence rates on gambling.

These require that medical devices perform safely while achieving the purpose intended by the medical device manufacturer. The risk classification of a device influences the level of specific assessment of a medical device&rsquo;s conformity with the legal requirements that is conducted and in the case of morcellators, a manufacturer must have the conformity to the requirements verified by a third party, namely a notified body for medical devices. <\/p>  <p>  Once the notified body has satisfactorily completed its assessment it issues a certificate to the manufacturer who can then label their device with a CE mark. Medical devices which are appropriately CE marked may be freely placed on the European market. A notified body, once appropriately competent, in any European country can issue a certificate which allows the manufacturer to place the device on the market without further national authorisation. <\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have queried this matter with the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), who understand that the black box warning referenced to in this question relates to a FDA warning issued in April 2014 that discouraged the use of laparoscopic power morcellation during hysterectomy or myomectomy for uterine fibroids and advised that such use poses a risk of spreading unsuspected cancerous tissue, notably uterine sarcomas, beyond the uterus. Subsequently, following a public Advisory Committee meeting, the FDA also recommended that manufacturers of laparoscopic powered morcellators with a general indication or a specific gynaecologic indication prominently include a number of contraindications and a boxed warning in their product labelling.<\/p>  <p>  In May 2014 the HPRA (then the Irish Medicines Board) wrote to Consultant Obstetricians and Gynaecologists via their professional associations (Royal College of Physicians in Ireland and Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland) highlighting the April 2014 FDA communication and requesting feedback on the information outlined in the FDA communication. The HPRA also coordinated with the European Commission and other European Competent Authorities to issue a letter to all medical device notified bodies in Europe highlighting that the FDA had requested that manufacturers of these products include contraindications and warnings on their product instructions and labelling. Notified bodies were requested to consider this potential risk in their review of manufacturers&rsquo; technical documentation and any updated product information, including labelling and instructions for use. Please note that within the context of the HPRA's role as designating authority for the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI), HPRA communicated this issue to NSAI in November 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500081#WRW03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Deaths","counter":1112,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500081#WRW03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1113,"qnumday":436,"qnumall":"[5543\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500081#WRW03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of women here who have died in the past decade within a year of having hysterectomies by morcellation.","asker":"1259","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1114,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly as soon as possible<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500081#WRW03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Data","counter":1115,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500081#WRW03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1116,"qnumday":437,"qnumall":"[5547\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500081#WRW03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the proposed name change of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1225","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1117,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500081#WRW03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1118,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500081#WRW03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1119,"qnumday":438,"qnumall":"[5564\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500081#WRW03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a child (details supplied) in County Clare will have an assessment and ultrasound in the urology department of University Hospital Limerick; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1120,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

In May 2018 the Medical Council issued updated guidance for registered medical practitioners on relationships between doctors and industry which covers a number of issues such as gifts, sponsorship and hospitality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500081#WRW04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages Provision","counter":1130,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500081#WRW05000"},{"type":"question","counter":1131,"qnumday":442,"qnumall":"[5585\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500081#WRW05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the additional funding allocated to the HSE to reduce the waiting lists and waiting times for home support services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1132,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500081#WRW05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists Data","counter":1133,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500081#WRW05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1134,"qnumday":443,"qnumall":"[5586\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500081#WRW05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children waiting for an outpatient appointment in children&rsquo;s hospitals in Dublin (details supplied) for more than 18 months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1135,"content":"<p>I am conscious that waiting times are often unacceptably long and of the burden that this places on patients and their families. In this regard, I am committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures.<\/p>  <p>  I hope to publish the joint Department of Health, Health Service Executive (HSE) and National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 shortly. This will set out commitments aimed at improving access for patients waiting for hospital operations or procedures, as well as patients waiting for a first Outpatient appointment. <\/p>  <p>  As of the end of December 2018, there were 45,595 patients awaiting an outpatient appointment for the Children's Hospital Group. Of these 51% (23,492) were waiting less than 9 months, while 25% (11,288) were waiting more than 18 months. <\/p>  <p>  A key element of the 2019 Access Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List which remains a significant challenge. The HSE, in line with the National Service Plan 2019 will provide 3.3 million outpatient appointments, more than 1 million of which will be first outpatient appointments. <\/p>  <p>  In 2019, the HSE will focus in particular on specialties with a high volume of referrals and large proportions of long-waiting patients including ENT and Dermatology. In addition, the NTPF, with an increased allocation totalling &euro;75 million in 2019, will fund an additional 40,000 first outpatient appointments through weekend and out of hour&rsquo;s clinics and &lsquo;see and treat&rsquo; clinics. <\/p>  <p>  The NTPF will deliver this additional activity in the health service by working with hospital groups and individual hospitals as well as private health providers to maximise the number of patients treated in both a public and private capacity. In this context, in 2018 the NTPF approved 504 Outpatient appointments for Temple Street as part of an initiative to support implementation of an extended working day in the hospital. The NTPF have also met with Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI) to review Outpatient proposals covering the specialties of Cardiology, Ophthalmology, and Dental Surgery.  <\/p>  <p>  CHI advises that it has implemented a number of new and innovative initiatives to improve access to outpatient appointments for patients across a range of specialties including cardiology, dermatology, and orthopaedics. This includes additional clinics in ENT and dermatology, the appointment of additional staff in general paediatrics and ophthalmology, and the use of virtual assessment clinics for rheumatology. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the establishment of the Outpatient and Urgent Care Centre at Connolly Hospital in 2019 will result in 6,350 outpatient appointments being issued for the new facility next year, with projected full year outpatient attendance of 15,240 in subsequent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500081#WRW05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services Data","counter":1137,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500082#WRX00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1138,"qnumday":444,"qnumall":"[5601\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500082#WRX00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children admitted to adult mental health units in 2018.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1139,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500082#WRX00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Reimbursement","counter":1140,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500082#WRX00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1141,"qnumday":445,"qnumall":"[5603\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500082#WRX00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a medical product will be supplied to a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1142,"content":"<p>Medicines play a vital role in improving the health of Irish patients.

The Government remains firmly of the view that ratifying the Withdrawal Agreement that has been agreed between the EU and the UK remains the best way to ensure an orderly UK exit. At its meeting on 11 December 2018, the Government decided to give greater immediate priority to the preparations for a no deal Brexit. This is being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach in collaboration with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and involves all Government Departments and agencies.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health, the HSE and other Health Agencies have been taking forward detailed Brexit preparedness and contingency work related to the impacts in the area of health of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, with or without a deal, including proposed legislative provisions. A number of issues are being examined and contingency planning for a range of eventualities is underway. A key issue will be to ensure that there is minimum disruption to health services and that essential existing services are maintained on a cross-Border, all-island and Ireland-UK basis. Protecting and maintaining the Common Travel Area and the associated rights and privileges is a key part of this process.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department and its Agencies particularly the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) and the HSE have been in regular contact with stakeholders to assess the level of preparedness for a no deal Brexit. It is important to state that while the Department continues to monitor and seek assurances in a number of areas, our current analysis is that there are no immediate risks to the health of the population because of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health has strengthened its internal capacity to plan for Brexit. The Secretary General meets with the heads of the HSE, the HPRA and the FSAI weekly to review progress on Brexit preparedness and to consider any new challenges identified. A Brexit Operations Team has also been established in my Department, chaired by a Deputy Secretary General and comprised of senior officials from the Department, HSE, HPRA and the FSAI. This group works to resolve issues and to escalate them to the Heads of Agency group, chaired by the Secretary General, if necessary. An inter-agency communications group, chaired by my Department, has been established to plan for all aspects of a communications strategy to ensure that the public is fully informed of the health implications of either a central case Brexit or a no deal Brexit. A further working group is working to identify and monitor medicines that may be vulnerable to supply disruption as a result of Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish and British Governments have committed to maintaining the Common Travel Area and its associated rights and privileges.

There are three strands to my Department&rsquo;s approach to this:<\/p>  <p>- Abatement: reducing emissions of methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide from the agriculture sector in so far as it is possible;<\/p>  <p>- Sequestration: increasing carbon sequestration through forests and land use;<\/p>  <p>- Displacement and substitution: displacing fossil fuel and energy intensive materials with renewable energy sources.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and agencies are actively engaged with the farming sector on a large range of measures and actions focused on the environment and climate, which support the continued transition towards a low carbon economy and society.<\/p>  <p>  Measures such as the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) are aimed at lowering the intensity of GHG emissions by improving the quality and efficiency of the national beef herd. Our Agri-Environment Scheme, GLAS supports farmers to implement actions such as the use of Low Emission manure application technology whilst our Capital Support Scheme, the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) also supports investment in technology and infrastructure to make agriculture more carbon efficient.  Other initiatives such as Origin Green, Quality Assurance schemes and Knowledge Transfer Schemes also contribute to lowering the carbon footprint of the sector.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of sequestration our most significant intervention is the national afforestation programme.  Afforestation and forests also play a key role in replacing energy intensive materials and providing sustainable renewable biomass to the energy sector. My Department are therefore, investing heavily in the Afforestation Scheme to encourage landowners to establish forests on their land. The Government has recently approved significant improvements in grant and premium rates under the agro forestry and forestry for fibre options.<\/p>  <p>  Lastly, the third strand to our climate policy approach focuses on energy efficiency, energy provision from biomass and other agricultural products and on the use of wood products to substitute for materials associated with high levels of emissions such as steel, concrete and fossil fuels. The agriculture and forest sector is a significant contributor of low-carbon, bio-based materials at present and is primed to play a central role in the expansion of the bio economy. My Department is actively supporting this through funding research and development and value the efforts of other Departments and Bodies in seeking green, sustainable solutions to meeting our resource needs.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to review options that will enable our farmers to transition to a low carbon economy.  The recently published Teagasc report &ldquo;An Analysis of Abatement Potential of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Irish Agriculture 2021-2030&rdquo; is key to informing the type of measures we need to focus on into the future to continue to reduce the carbon footprint of the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500086#WRBB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fur Farming","counter":1361,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500086#WRBB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1362,"qnumday":520,"qnumall":"[5732\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500086#WRBB01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if a ban on fur farming will be introduced here in 2019 (details supplied).","asker":"1291","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1363,"content":"<p>My Department has statutory responsibility for the welfare and protection of farmed animals under the European Communities (Welfare of Farmed Animals) Regulations, 2010(Statutory Instrument No 311\/2010) and the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.

This is part of that company&rsquo;s ongoing rural fibre roll out to some 300,000 premises. <\/p>  <p>  Eir&rsquo;s rural investment in high speed broadband is an entirely commercial undertaking, and not part of the planned State Intervention network.  Although the deployment is monitored under the terms of a Commitment Agreement signed between the company and my Department, it is not funded by the State and it is not planned, designed or directed by my Department in any capacity. <\/p>  <p>  The selection of what premises are to be served under eir&rsquo;s deployment is a commercial decision for that company.  My Department has no statutory authority or function to intervene in the company&rsquo;s commercial decisions, nor in any decisions relating to the roll out and siting of infrastructure throughout Ireland by service providers operating in a liberalised market.<\/p>  <p>  For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. <\/p>  <p>  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities. The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500087#WRCC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Pollution","counter":1421,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500087#WRCC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1422,"qnumday":540,"qnumall":"[5690\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500087#WRCC01500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the expected time for an inner lough waterway to refresh itself following a pollution incident; and the research that has taken place to provide this information.","asker":"1250","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1423,"content":"<p>As Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I have no role or function in the matter raised.

The allowance is not considered as means for Social Welfare purposes.<\/p>  <p>  Foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. It is important that foster carers have access to specialist services to meet the child's identified needs.

In the Dublin South Central area one of the two duty\/intake offices which deals with child protection referrals was operating, in the period prior to inspection, with only two social workers, instead of the six required.

We have been planning for all Brexit scenarios but in light of uncertainties in London and the Brexit deadline of 29 March, the Government decided at its meeting of 11 December that immediate priority must now be given to preparations for a no deal Brexit and that Government Departments and state agencies should urgently take forward work on that basis.  <\/p>  <p>  The Contingency Action Plan which the Government published on 19 December sets out in comprehensive terms, the challenges to be faced and the actions taken and planned by the Government across key sectors in the event of a no deal Brexit scenario. <\/p>  <p>  My key area of interest is the impact of Brexit on the current reciprocal arrangements for social insurance schemes, social assistance schemes and child benefit under the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland.    <\/p>  <p>  Last year, I met with the then UK Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and we agreed the objective of ensuring that the reciprocity of social welfare rights and entitlements, which currently exist for Irish and UK citizens moving within Ireland and between Ireland and Britain under the Common Travel Area, are safeguarded and maintained. <\/p>  <p>  Because of the unique nature of the Common Travel Area and the specific rights which it provides and will continue to provide for Irish and British citizens in each other&rsquo;s countries, it was agreed that we would formalise the pre-existing Common Travel Area arrangements in a documented agreement.  That agreement was signed last week.  Under the terms of the agreement all existing arrangements with regard to recognition of, and access to, social insurance entitlements will be maintained in both jurisdictions.  This means that the rights of Irish citizens domiciled in Ireland to benefit from social insurance contributions made when working in the UK and to access social insurance payments if resident in the UK are protected.     <\/p>  <p>  In addition the General Scheme of the Miscellaneous Provisions (Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill which the Government published on 24 January 2019 is part of a framework of wider planning and preparations for the possibility of a no deal Brexit, which the Government still hopes can be avoided.<\/p>  <p>  Part 11 of the General Scheme sets out proposed amendments to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2015 (as amended).

This is very positive.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by approximately &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  Therefore, the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) which was available to people aged 65 who satisfied the qualifying conditions.  This measure standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.<\/p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to State pension age.  Where this is not possible and a person exits the workforce before reaching State pension age they may apply for either the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments are currently paid to eligible jobseekers aged 18 to 66 years. <\/p>  <p>  Jobseekers Benefit is payable subject to the person satisfying the general scheme conditions. This entitlement is normally paid for 9 months (234 days) for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid and for 6 months (156 days) for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid.  Arrangements are in place to provide that jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year can generally continue to be paid benefit up until pensionable age (66 years) provided they satisfy the necessary contribution conditions.  The jobseekers schemes are kept under review and any further changes, including entitlement beyond the 66th year, will be considered in that context.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.  In this regard, the Workplace Relations Commission has produced a Code of Practice on Longer Working and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) has published guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500091#WRGG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Overpayments","counter":1628,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500091#WRGG00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1629,"qnumday":610,"qnumall":"[5088\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500091#WRGG00900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if moneys owed to a person (details supplied) will be investigated in view of the fact that there are no assets to be distributed from the estate; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1630,"content":"<p>The solicitor for the person named above has returned an Inland Revenue Affidavit (IRA) which includes an estate to be finalised.<\/p><p>The Department is obliged to recoup any debt owing to it and the method of recovery, and negotiations regarding the amount recoverable, are dealt with under the Department&rsquo;s code of practice. <\/p><p>The Department is currently investigating the circumstances around the debt owed in this case and will contact the next of kin when this investigation is complete.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500091#WRGG01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory)","counter":1631,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500091#WRGG01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1632,"qnumday":611,"qnumall":"[5149\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500091#WRGG01200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a matter concerning a request for a review of a contributory pension by a person (details supplied) will be examined; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1633,"content":"<p>Since the end of September 2018, my Department has been examining the social insurance records of pensioners born on or after 1 September 1946 who were awarded state pension (contributory) on reduced post Budget 2012 rate bands.

This is very positive.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by approximately &euro;1 billion every 5 years.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  Therefore, the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) which was available to people aged 65 who satisfied the qualifying conditions.  This measure standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.<\/p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to State pension age.  Where this is not possible and a person exits the workforce before reaching State pension age they may apply for either the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes.   Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments are currently paid to eligible jobseekers aged 18 to 66 years. <\/p>  <p>  Jobseekers Benefit is payable subject to the person satisfying the general scheme conditions. This entitlement is normally paid for 9 months (234 days) for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid and for 6 months (156 days) for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid.  Arrangements are in place to provide that jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year can generally continue to be paid benefit up until pensionable age (66 years) provided they satisfy the necessary contribution conditions.  The jobseekers schemes are kept under review and any further changes, including entitlement beyond the 66th year, will be considered in that context.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.  In this regard, the Workplace Relations Commission has produced a Code of Practice on Longer Working and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) has published guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500091#WRGG03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":1659,"qnumday":620,"qnumall":"[5284\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020500091#WRGG03900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a person who reached State pension age before 2012 can avail of the new home care credits and TCA if it would be more beneficial to them; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1660,"content":"<p>In January last year I announced a new Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to calculating the entitlement of pensioners who reached state pension age from September 2012 (i.e., those born on or after 1 September 1946).  This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome.  The HomeCaring Periods can be claimed for any year in which they occurred - they are not limited to years since 1994.<\/p>  <p>  People whose pensions were decided under the 2000-2012 ratebands were subject to a significantly more generous regime than those who qualified before or afterwards, as a Yearly Average of only 20 contributions per year (out of a maximum of 49) could attract a 98% pension.  The effect of those changes, as it impacted upon those new pensioners since 2012, will be familiar to anyone who followed the debate on this matter over the last 6 years.  If pre-2012 pensioners were also allowed avail of HomeCaring Credits, their arrangements, as a group, would continue to be significantly more generous than those of post-2012 pensioners.  There would also be a very significant cost which would be expected to be of the order of several hundred millions of euros each year.  This in turn could significantly impact funds for future pension increases with consequential implications for pensioner poverty.  <\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;232 (over 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension).

Securing compact and sustainable urban growth means focusing on reusing previously developed &lsquo;brownfield&rsquo; land, building up infill sites and either reusing or redeveloping existing sites and buildings, in well serviced urban locations, particularly those served by good public transport and supporting services, including employment opportunities. <\/p>  <p>  The NPF provides a policy framework for more compact urban growth rather than car dependent sprawl, while also providing safeguards that protect the environment, promote healthy communities and lifestyle choices.

It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of multi-unit developments, the legislative position is very clear in terms of where responsibilities rest. Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014 primary responsibility for compliance of works with the requirements of the Building Regulations, rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings. Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers. When a building is constructed and occupied, statutory responsibility for fire safety is assigned by section 18(2) of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 &amp;amp; 2003, to the \"person having control\" of the building. In multi-unit developments, the \"person having control\" is generally the owner management company. Under the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, the owner management company must establish a scheme for annual service charges and a sinking fund for spending on refurbishment, improvement or maintenance of a non-recurring nature of the multi-unit development.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the effectiveness and accessibility of legal remedies for homeowners who discover defects in their homes, these are complex legal matter with potential implications for the entire legal system, as well as for the insurance industry.
