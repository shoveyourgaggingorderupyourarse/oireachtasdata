The Department was established by Government in July 2017.  Its stated mission is to promote rural and community development and to support vibrant, inclusive and sustainable communities throughout Ireland.  Climate change is an issue that will impact on Ireland at national, regional and community level.  Whether it is farming, forestry, fisheries, tourism or recreation, rural communities are affected by the quality of the environment and are impacted on by its degradation.  We have all witnessed in recent times how adverse weather conditions have a profound effect on those whose livelihoods depend on the elements.<\/p> <p>  While the Department does not have a direct role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from energy, agriculture or transport, our core mission enables us to play an important role in supporting the transition to a low carbon future.  Supporting the development of resilient and sustainable communities is at the heart of the Department&rsquo;s mission.  This is also at the heart of the challenge facing us in addressing climate change.  Through a range of programmes, policies, supports and investments, the Department seeks to promote: balanced regional development and economic opportunity; the diversification of rural economies; the enhancement of towns and villages as attractive places to live; and the strengthening of communities, community life and opportunities for active local civic participation and decision making.  We are providing direct support for volunteering, social enterprise and social innovation.  We are investing directly in locally generated ideas and initiatives in the green economy and in facilitating community ownership of projects, both literally and in terms of input into development strategies at local level.  We are helping people in accessing locally based job opportunities.<\/p> <p>  All of these supports are at the core of delivering on the Department&rsquo;s mission to support vibrant, inclusive and sustainable communities and all of these objectives are essential elements of a low-carbon future.  I want to provide some specific examples of the relevant policies, programmes, projects and supports to which I am referring.  Under the LEADER programme, almost &euro;24 million will be invested in projects under the rural environment theme in the sub-theme areas of protection and sustainable use of water resources, protection and improvement of local biodiversity and development of renewable energy.  Projects approved for funding include large-scale initiatives such as Glasha hydro project in Waterford and smaller projects such as renewable energy heating systems and a self-sustainable, solar powered eco-friendly lodge in County Clare.  To date, more than &euro;1.5 million has been approved to fund 58 projects under these sub-themes, and the Department looks forward to dispersing the full &euro;24 million allocation in conjunction with local action groups.<\/p> <p>  The Department is also providing a number of climate relevant supports through the Dormant Accounts Fund, social enterprise and social innovation fund measures, the social inclusion and community activation programme and the community services programme.  These include grants to applicants providing home insulation services, reducing our food waste, sustainable energy actions, beekeeping and training in thermal insulation installation.  In addition, investments under the town and village renewal scheme support the diversification of the rural economy through funding for enterprise hubs, digital hubs and other projects that support localised employment opportunities.  These impact positively on commuting requirements and carbon emissions.   The Department is also making investments through the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme and the walks scheme that protect and sustain our natural heritage and identify ways to assist communities in maximising the value of these assets for the local area.  Greenways, blueways and mountain trails are delivering economic, recreational, health and climate benefits, reducing car journeys and creating employment and tourism opportunities.<\/p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s role in the context of local community structures, such as local community development committees and public participation networks, affords it the opportunity to harness all the potential resources at the disposal of communities by bringing together people, groups, agencies and voluntary and statutory bodies to make a positive difference in the development of sustainable communities.  Through encouraging citizen engagement we aim to increase awareness of climate issues and to foster community involvement in policy development and decision-making processes.<\/p> <p>  In addition to these initiatives and programmes, the Department has an important co-ordination role when it comes to policies affecting rural Ireland across Government.  Realising our Rural Potential: The Action Plan for Rural Development, which was launched in 2017, contains over 270 specific actions to be taken across a variety of Departments.  In addition to measures on enterprise, tourism, culture and connectivity, it is clear on the importance of our environment to ensuring sustainable rural development.  It contains actions associated with climate mitigation, renewable energy and energy efficiency that are of relevance to rural Ireland.  In general, these actions are to be delivered by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment or its agencies.  The action plan is also clear on the importance of climate adaptation measures such as the flood relief programme to be delivered by the OPW.  Reports on progress on all actions in the plan are published every six months and, to date, have shown that 93% of the actions across Government were either completed on schedule or substantially advanced.<\/p> <p>  It is important that we continue to look to further opportunities to support community-led initiatives in the green economy.  The planned introduction by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment of a renewable electricity support scheme will open up opportunities for rural communities not only to invest in new renewable electricity projects, but also, potentially, to develop and operate their own projects.  Involving communities in the development of new renewable energy projects will not only provide a long term, sustainable economic dividend but will also help to change the perception of renewable energy projects in rural Ireland.  The Department has already provided funding supports to those who are exploring the potential of renewable energy and to local projects in that sector.  For example, a &euro;50,000 grant has been committed over the next two years to facilitate a community-based renewable energy project in the Iveragh Gaeltacht in Kerry.  Across a range of activity, the Department is providing direct support to the required national climate action effort.  The new rural regeneration and development fund, one of the four funds established under Project Ireland 2040, will provide further opportunity to build on this.<\/p> <p>  I have attempted to give a very short overview of current investments, programmes and partnership activities of the Department of Rural and Community Development that are assisting communities to identify and engage in climate-positive initiatives.  We recognise that the scale of the challenge involved in meeting climate action targets requires effort and mobilisation across Government and at every level of society, with a particular challenge to engage citizens and communities.  We look forward to continued opportunities to support progress in this objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018102400002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1540384200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I imagine that both were framed prior to the emergence of the latter report.  What thoughts does he have on the impact of that report on his Department's activities, plans and targets?  It has shocked all the official bodies across the world that are trying to deal with climate change.  I am sure the Secretary General will have given some thought to his own role in this.<\/p><p>I assume the Department's programme was produced prior to the IPCC report being published.  I would also like to know whether the Department took into account a report produced by Met &Eacute;ireann in 2016 that declared extreme weather events as the norm rather than being rare.  Was that taken into account when the Department was looking at what it can do in dealing with rural Ireland and communities?  <\/p><p> My first question is on the home insulation services.  In the context of last year's extreme weather events, the D&aacute;il was forced to put it to the Taoiseach to give an extra two weeks' fuel allowance to people suffering as a result of those extreme cold conditions that occurred as a consequence of climate change.  Mr. McCarthy has talked about grants that are provided for home insulation services.  Does Mr. McCarthy think that scheme sufficiently covers people whose socioeconomic profile means they rely on the grants entirely rather than on their own means to retrofit their homes and to be able to insulate and reduce their emissions? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018102400002#E00400","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540384200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I do not believe that is within the remit of this particular Department.

Does Mr. McCarthy have any thoughts on the idea of energy democracy, which is a widespread philosophy, as a way to engage local communities?  Anybody who was looking at events surrounding the motion on plastics in the D&aacute;il yesterday will realise that communities want to be fully engaged in climate mitigation.<\/p> <p>  The other question is on the Department's role in dealing with issues around rural maintenance and sustainability.  Unfortunately, we recently passed a Heritage Act in the D&aacute;il that allowed for more burning and slashing of the heritage and landscape around the country, which will have a further impact on climate change.  Ditches and hedgerows are frequently cut back to the detriment of the sustainability of the environment and to the detriment of the sustainability of systems in the environment, for example that of bees.  The Department gave a small grant to some beekeeping enterprises.  These are obviously things on which we need to join the dots.  If we are concerned about the sustainability of the environment, what role would the Department have in leaning on the parties or the Government to say the Heritage Act is not a good idea because it impacts on the role of the Department in maintaining sustainability in rural affairs?<\/p> <p>  My last question is on maintaining rural transport.  Does Mr. McCarthy believe the winding down of public services such as rural transport and post offices has an impact on not helping to mitigate climate change because it forces people to travel further to reach a post office?  It forces them to use private transport because public transport has been removed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018102400002#F00900","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540384200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>To clarify the Deputy's first question about whether what I have set out predates the IPCC report, the answer is it does.  What I have been describing is a programme of activity in which the Department is engaged across a range of programmes and funding schemes.  Collectively, their purpose is to support rural development and to support the development of sustainable communities in terms of the broad description of what that involves.  As I said in my opening statement, through those investments we have the opportunity, in working with and facilitating communities in coming forward with ideas, to support initiatives and projects that have a very direct climate action impact and a very direct positive climate effect.  It is not necessarily the core purpose of those programmes, however.  At a broader level, given our remit in promoting rural development and supporting balanced regional development, there is a strong consistency between the overall effort in which we are engaged and the climate action agenda.  If one is supporting the development of strong, sustainable communities at a local, regionally dispersed level and if one is giving those communities the tools they need in terms of employment opportunity and quality environments in which to live, one is supporting a better balanced development overall.  That is very consistent with the climate action agenda.  We did not take the IPCC report into account in the design of these programmes.  With regard to all of the programmes and funds in which we are involved, we keep watch on the overall policy landscape on all of its fronts to ensure what we are investing in and supporting is delivering on Government policy across the broad range of objectives the Government has for rural Ireland.  Climate change is an important part of that, as I have described.<\/p> <p>  As the Acting Chairman has clarified with regard to the fuel allowance and the Deputy's question about home insulation services, while I have cited a couple of projects that have supported retrofitting of homes, we got involved in those projects because, as part of wider funding schemes, communities were coming forward with initiatives in that area which allowed us to support particular projects.  We do not have overall responsibility for retrofitting homes which, as the Acting Chairman has pointed out, falls under the remit of the SEAI and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  <\/p> <p>  On energy democracy and engaging communities, it is very much at the core of what we are trying to do generally in terms of community empowerment.  I described briefly in the opening statement some of the structures and the framework we have in place to try to generate capacity at community level to allow communities to engage more effectively with decision-making processes both at local authority level and with central government.  Our role is to try to generate that capacity and develop the structures locally that allow communities to engage with what central government is trying to do and to allow communities to input into decision-making at central government level and at local authority level.  Energy communities are part of that.  There are some initiatives where we are supporting particular energy communities.  The SEAI, as the committee will have heard, has a very good scheme around energy communities and we are certainly looking to see what support we can give to it in terms of how our various programmes and investments can align better with what it is trying to do.  We can support communities in generating the ideas that allow them to make a real contribution to what they see as their requirements at a local level.  <\/p> <p>  On the question about protecting biodiversity, the Heritage Act and rural transport, the Deputy is asking me to comment on the policy responsibilities of other Departments.  I want to make that point.  Protection of biodiversity is first and foremost the responsibility of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Clearly, what we are doing in the outdoor recreation scheme, for example, in investing in greenways, blueways, walks trails and so on, is really about helping communities to identify their own natural heritage locally as a real asset for the community.  In general terms, that is what we are trying to do to support and empower rural communities.  It is encouraging and supporting them to make the best use of their natural amenities.  We clearly-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018102400002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1540384200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I will rephrase the question.

I thank Mr. McCarthy and his officials for coming before the committee.<\/p> <p>  Obviously a lot of what we are talking about in this committee confirms that our approach to climate action needs to be a whole-of-government approach across Departments.  This Department has a very specific remit with regard to community development and assisting those great community groups.  How much interaction is there between the Department of Rural and Community Development and the other Departments that provide other supports?  Has the Department ensured there is no duplication and that any gaps have been filled?  <\/p> <p>  I gathered from what Mr. McCarthy said in his presentation that there are areas where co-funding can be leveraged from two different Departments.  In my local area in Kildare we have the Drehid grant for the Drehid landfill in the greater Carbury area.  Sports clubs in those areas can apply for a community grant under that local scheme.  They can co-fund their projects with the sports capital programme.  In this way, two small grants can go together and get something very sizeable done.  As more community energy groups are developed, could the Department of Rural and Community Development co-fund them with other Departments?  Is Mr. McCarthy's mind open to that?  Is there real awareness in the Department of the other supports in other Departments with crossover potential?<\/p> <p>  The local authorities have a key role to play here.  They have a lot of knowledge about local groups.  The town and village renewal scheme is a really positive scheme.  Now that communities have become more aware of it I am seeing an even higher standard of applications.  Community groups are now planning a year in advance, rather than trying to cobble an application together just before a deadline.  They are giving applications more thought.  As such, there are applications of much higher quality with stronger and more robust long-term plans and we get better bang for our buck when we spend taxpayers' money on supporting those groups. <\/p> <p>  As energy groups develop and Tidy Towns groups move into the sustainable energy field, there will be space for us to support those community groups and the Department of Rural and Community Development will be absolutely key to that.  This is not just something for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  In Kilcullen, in south Kildare, a sustainable energy community has been established.  It is a very progressive community-driven group.  We are very lucky to have some experts with knowledge from their professions and jobs volunteering their time.  Does the Department have a plan that could assist such existing community groups to look at energy-efficient measures?  How can we help to support them?  That question concerns groups with a fair bit of knowledge, such as the Newbridge Tidy Towns Association.  Newbridge is obviously the biggest town in my constituency, with more than 20,000 people.  The Liffey Linear Park has won the green flag award for a sustainability model for a second year.  That group is not starting from scratch.  Its members have a fair knowledge of this.<\/p> <p>  Is support available for groups who are not as advanced to get their heads around the types of project that are possible?  What role does the Department play in opening the minds of people who are at the very early stages of this?  <\/p> <p>  Does Mr. McCarthy find there is a geographical spread?  Are there gaps in the country where less of this activity is happening?  Once one energy community has developed within a county, others will pop up nearby because people see it is a good idea.  Ultimately, funding will drive a great deal of this.  If local active voluntary community groups can see that funding can be accessed through implementing certain measures it will encourage them into that area.  Nowhere is that more obvious than where greenways and blueways are concerned.  Those projects have a very positive spin-off in attracting tourism, economic activity and people.  We have to link environmental sustainability and a positive environmental story into each of these measures.<\/p> <p>  When Mr. McCarthy came in here he probably thought that his Department was not the lead Department on this.  However its role is absolutely key.  Everything we have covered in the committee in recent weeks, or will cover in the coming weeks, concerns getting people throughout the country to buy into the idea that we need to do more.  We have so many good active community groups that just need a bit of support.  Some are at an advanced stage and just need grants and schemes to assist them in their ideas.  Others need help in formulating those ideas.  On those points, particularly in regard to the rural fund, how can we best harness that along with other Departments?  I would be interested to hear Mr. McCarthy's views on that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018102400002#G01300","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540384200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>There is quite a lot of ground to cover there.  On the question of interaction with other Departments and the need to avoid duplication, identify gaps and so on, we do have a lot of interaction with other Departments.  On the climate action front, we are represented on the relevant Cabinet committee and the senior officials group that feeds into it.  More generally, our interface with other Departments is core to what we do.  Our remit concerns supporting and promoting the development of rural communities and communities generally.  We can only do that by interacting with Departments across a wide range of remits, including transport, tourism, heritage and so on.  We have a lot of interaction with those Departments.  We try to share as much information as we can and get the best possible understanding of other Departments' agendas and their various programmes, projects, initiatives, policies etc.  We try to align with them and add value where we can.<\/p> <p>  I recognise this is an area in which we always can do better.

Someone referred to the fact that we have a small budget.  In the scheme of things, we are a small player in terms of the scale of our investments and what they can achieve.  However, we can have an influence through our interaction with other Departments, particularly by offering other Departments the capacity to engage with communities at a local level.  Our role is in supporting community organisations and the structures that allow them to engage effectively with Government, and in helping them to build the capacity to do so.  We see that as a really important part of our responsibility.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Heydon touched on an important point in his question about those areas where community and civic engagement are less well developed.  That is a real challenge for us.  The degree of social capital in a community is an element here.  The better the community is able to access information on what is available, the better it is equipped to exploit the benefits of various Government investments.  We have a duty to support the communities that are less well developed on that front.  The structure of local community development committees and public participation networks is very much a developing structure.  Supporting local authorities in building that structure is a part of our responsibility.  We are putting resources into directly supporting them in doing that.  I refer to the capacity-building issues around training, sharing best practice, networking and supporting networks of communities in order that they can learn from one another.<\/p> <p>  There are some specific things concerning the LEADER programme about which my colleague might wish to speak, such as sharing best practice between LEADER groups around the country so that people can see what other communities have done and see the potential.  Community groups can talk to each other about how they have accomplished things and learn from that.  We see our potential contribution as creating the facility for all of that to happen.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Heydon specifically mentioned the energy communities.  The SEAI, is doing brilliant work to support the energy groups that are in place.<\/p><p>It has a really good programme of development with those communities.  We are meeting the SEAI next week to talk about that programme and how we can weigh in behind it through our interaction with local authorities and local community organisations on various fronts. <\/p><p> Deputy Heydon's comments on the town and village programme are very welcome.  That programme has had a huge impact.  Since 2016 there has been very significant investment and 675 projects around the country have been supported.  Through a sequence of calls we have an established lead-in for local authorities and communities to identify the potential of that programme.  We are seeing an increasingly high quality of proposals coming through from communities, which are feeding into approvals under that scheme.<\/p><p> The rural regeneration and development fund involves investment of a significant scale.  I spoke about our budget being minor in the overall scheme but the new fund created by Government under the national development plan amounts to &euro;1 billion over the next ten years.  That gives us the opportunity to have an impact on rural regeneration in all its forms and to help communities deliver on the various national strategic outcomes in the national planning framework including on the climate action front.  One of the challenges is to ensure that fund does leverage the possibility to build on the investments and commitments of other Departments.  We have a good mechanism for interacting with other Departments in their investment plans to ensure that fund is adding value and is helping communities make the best of the possibilities from Government. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018102400002#G01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540384200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>As I understand it, the role of the Department of Rural and Community Development is not to actually do anything but to liaise between communities and the rest of Government, pointing out to communities where they can do stuff and tie the Government in with that.

It is a bottom-up approach with community-led local development.  The Deputy is right to say that as part of that work we need to identify the good projects and try to ensure that best practice is shared around the country.  Part of our role is in hosting workshops where the different groups can come together and share their ideas.  We had a workshop on the rural environment earlier this year where a range of different ideas was shared and different best practice examples were demonstrated.  One example is a group in Wexford that has developed an advisory guide.  It is a very handy easy-to-use guide for community groups and small businesses that are delivering investments under LEADER.  It covers areas such as insulation, power generation and lighting in a very simple manner that others can use in designing applications and projects under LEADER.  It ensures that the sort of investment happening under LEADER is proofed for climate change and environmental measures.<\/p> <p>  Beyond that there is a network that shares different best practice ideas.  There is a very specific interactive map dealing with environmental projects on our website.  It shows where case studies of good practice in climate change projects are delivering.  That is a good avenue for the local action groups delivering the programme and for the community groups to see how projects can be delivered in other areas and how that might apply to their areas.

We need local authorities to identify their own development needs, to come up with their own strategies to address those needs, to identify and involve all the actors at a local level, to engage directly with communities and with community organisations and feed into that.

In relation to this particular function, their direct relationship is with us.  From that point of view, there is not an issue.<\/p> <p>  In terms of our mandate more generally and our mandate to work through Government, we have an important co-ordinating role in rural development.  The nature of rural development is contingent on a lot of actors and interactions across business and enterprise, tourism and transport, heritage, Gaeltacht, etc.  Our role is to bring a coherence to all that engagement and we do that as best we can.  It necessarily involves interacting across all those and the mechanisms and structures are there for us to do that effectively.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the accidental impact, I would say it is not accidental.  Through all of our programmes of investment, we seek to deliver on Government objectives across a range of fronts.  Climate action is one of those.  It is clearly a hugely important front.  I referred earlier, in the question from Deputy Butler, to the objectives of the rural regeneration and development fund which is to deliver on the ten defined national strategic outcomes.  In that sense there is a direct link in the criteria of that fund to the climate action agenda.  Similarly, for example, in LEADER, we would require proposers in putting forward applications to identify any climate impact of what they are doing.  We continuously keep the criteria and the eligibility requirements of all our schemes under review as we go from call to call and that is something on which we can keep a direct watch.

Wednesday is a day when one has to attend other committees as well.  I welcome the submission, which I have read.  I merely want to ask some key questions.  On the theme of building capacity in relation to the LCDCs and the PPNs, communities are coming together and generating ideas about what they want to do and there is an articulation of those ideas or projects through the local authorities.  I want to glean a better understanding from the Department of how it is facilitating or helping to build capacity so that we can see a greater throughput of these localised projects with a climate change theme.  One specific project with which I am familiar is the IRD Duhallow project on warmer homes.  I am not sure whether Mr. McCarthy is familiar with that project.  It is an extremely good project whereby those who are dependent on the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payment can be facilitated with a grant and the project will come out and retrofit houses for attic insulation.  That is one bespoke and valuable project for the community I represent.  I wonder how the Department can translate that across a wider geographical spectrum and how one builds capacity on that kind of project and other types of projects.  The LCDCs and the PPNs have considerable potential to build capacity and deliver projects for everybody, and have a real impact.  I want to get an understanding from the Department of that dynamic.  That is my first question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018102400002#K01400","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1540384200,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Deputy Pringle asked that earlier.

That is the second question.<\/p> <p>  In regard to planning policy, to follow up on Senator Grace O'Sullivan's point, I want to get a understanding of whether there is a need to ensure that houses in rural areas are built near settlements so as to reduce the dependency on cars.  Mr. McCarthy may say that is a Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government competence but I wish merely to have the Department of Rural and Community Development's perspective on that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018102400002#K01600","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540384200,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I will take Deputy Sherlock's last question on the planning requirements first.  The national planning framework sets out the collective Government objective in respect of that which will inform planning requirements, which, as the Deputy rightly points out, is a matter for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  In regard to the attractiveness of residential occupancy in towns and villages, it might be worth mentioning that the Minister for Rural and Community Development last week announced a pilot scheme for town and village residential occupancy in six pilot areas.  The intention of that is to support those six communities in the first instance to try to identify solutions and actions that will make their town or village a more attractive place in which to live because we know what the patterns of settlement have been in rural areas.<\/p><p>Towns and villages are emptying out as people live in the wider hinterland.  We want to find a way of turning the tide in respect of the attractiveness of living in those settlements.  We hope the pilot in those six areas will identify a range of possible innovations or solutions that are locally generated in the first instance but that potentially require action at central level to support them.  We are keen to see something emerge from that that can be useful in terms of our policy effort to support town and village residential occupancy.  <\/p><p> Regarding the targets for community-owned energy projects, the SEAI has its Better Energy Communities scheme.  Deputy Sherlock is probably familiar with it so forgive me if I am going over familiar ground.  It is at over 200 and has a target to grow it to 500.  We are looking to get into a discussion with it to see how we can support it in achieving that target because we can be helpful to it.  Similarly, in respect of the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, which provides the opportunity for community ownership of renewable projects, we are keen to engage with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment regarding its plans in order that we can support it in meeting realistic targets around that.  <\/p><p> As for Deputy Pringle's question, which Deputy Sherlock has asked in a slightly different way, I will ask my colleague to respond because I attempted an answer earlier and he might give a better answer on the capacity building at community level.  Under the LEADER programme, we have project officers in each county who do some of what was described in activating involvement in communities and talking to them about what they have seen work elsewhere.  That is a good vehicle for sharing good practice and experience.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018102400002#K01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540384200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>With particular reference to the local community development committees, LCDCs, and building their capacity, one of the biggest challenges for us is building their strategic capacity.  They are still very much in the early stages of their evolution.  They have only been in place since 2014 but they have developed quite strongly in the past few years, particularly in terms of their operational capacity, but strategic capacity is still a bit of a challenge.  The Department is doing a number of things to support that capacity.  We have a number of networks in place at a regional level that mirror the regional assembly districts.  We support those networks and use them to share best practice.  Deputy Pringle mentioned that earlier.  That is another avenue by which we support the dissemination of good practice and good ideas both in general in terms of their operation at local level and in terms of specific programmes.  We also are developing a capacity development programme for LCDCs in partnership with local authorities and we hope to roll that out in its full iteration from next year.  The Department also supports a programme of specific supports around its programmes such as SICAP and LEADER.  Mr. Mulherin might be able to speak to that one more specifically.  We also provide guidance to LCDCs on their general activities and the local economic and community planning function they have, which is one of their primary functions if not the primary function.  That is a mechanism through which they are charged with co-ordinating planning and bringing a more joined-up approach to local and community development and bringing communities on board to develop those co-ordinated and integrated actions at a local level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018102400002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Dalton"},{"type":"speech","time":1540384200,"counter":82,"content":"<p>Are climate action and mitigation mapped across that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018102400002#L00300","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540384200,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Not at present but we seek, in conjunction with local authorities, to rework their local economic and community plans with them.

To me, this is about balanced regional development and our environment, which is why I welcome the interaction here today.  Balanced regional development might not be about getting big factories into our areas.  It might be about many of these smaller projects - green projects in which communities become involved.<\/p> <p>  Referring back to the questions asked by Deputies Pringle and Sherlock, there is a plethora of community groups with really good plans for walkways, be they through bogs or hilly grounds.  Must all of those projects go through the local authority or can those community groups, which are public participation networks that are fully operational, come directly to the Department?  Can they develop their projects through the Department or must it all go through the local authority system?  Some groups might fall through the system and much good proposed work that is in the pipeline could be lost.  I am talking specifically about my part of the country.  <\/p> <p>  I am party spokesperson on the Office of Public Works and flood relief.  I was not here for all of the opening statement.  I notice that it stated the action plan is also clear about the importance of climate adaptation measures such as the flood relief programme to be delivered by the OPW.  I will speak to the OPW in a few moments.  Are the witnesses satisfied that this is moving quickly enough and in an adequate manner?

There are two areas of its work that are particularly relevant, namely, estate portfolio management in mitigating the effects of climate change by increasing the energy efficiency of the public building stock and our flood risk management function which involves adaptation measures undertaken as a result of climate change.<\/p> <p>  The projections indicate that climate change will have a considerable impact on flood risk in Ireland.  A rise in mean sea levels, together with increased storm frequency, is being observed and the upward trend is projected to continue in the future, increasing the risk to coastal communities' infrastructure and assets.  It is projected that the number of days per year with heavy rainfall will increase, with potentially wetter winters, which could lead to an increase in flooding from rivers and flash floods in urban areas when intense rainfall events overwhelm the storm water drainage networks.  The projected wetter winters, particularly in the west, could give rise to increased groundwater flooding associated with turloughs.  These potential impacts of climate change are likely to have serious consequences for Ireland where cities and most main towns are located, either on the coast or alongside rivers.<\/p> <p>  Within the remit of the 2012 national climate change adaptation framework the OPW prepared a flood risk management climate change sectoral adaptation plan in 2015.  The plan summarised the relevant signs of climate change and the then state of knowledge of its impact on flooding and flood risk in Ireland and outlined flood risk management adaptation practice in Ireland at the time.  In May this year the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works and flood relief, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, launched the flood risk management plans.  They are the final output from the national catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme.  It was the largest study of flood risk ever undertaken by the State and assessed the risk in 300 communities that were home to approximately 3 million citizens or two thirds of the population and 80% of the properties potentially at risk from the primary sources of flooding, namely, rivers and the sea.  While these 300 communities included all of the cities and almost all major towns, approximately half of the 300 areas studied were small, often rural communities with a population of less than 2,000 people.<\/p><p>Key findings of the CFRAM programme were that while some 34,500 properties within the 300 communities had been identified as being at risk from a significant flood event, there was an economic basis to invest in flood relief schemes to protect 95% of these properties to the 100-year standard for fluvial, or river, schemes and the 200-year standard for coastal schemes.  To do this, we need to design and construct another 118 flood relief schemes, in addition to the 42 completed and the 33 under way.  An investment of up to &euro;1 billion is required to accomplish this and that funding has been committed by the Government under the national development plan to 2027.  The OPW is doubling its annual investment in flood risk management to &euro;100 million in 2021.<br\/><br\/>The CFRAM programme and the preparation of flood maps included the assessment of risk for two potential future scenarios taking into account the potential impacts of climate change.  The future scenarios include a rise in mean sea levels of 0.5 m and 1 m and an increase in peak flood flows in rivers of 20% and 30% for the two scenarios, respectively.  The flood maps for the 300 communities assessed under the CFRAM programme, including the future scenario flood maps, were published in May this year on our publicly accessible web portal, <i>www.floodinfo.ie<\/i>, and are being made available to the local authorities and other stakeholders to inform the preparation of their local and sectoral adaptation plans.  They can also assist in future planning decisions and emergency response planning.  The CFRAM maps compliment the strategic flood maps which cover the entire coastline of the country and which were prepared as part of the Irish coastal protection strategy study.  The maps which also include maps for the two potential future scenarios are under review to take into account the most recent available observed data and also the coastal wave environment.  Together with the local authorities, since May the OPW has been moving to the detailed development and implementation of the 118 measures.  It includes further detailed assessment of adaptability to future climate change.  Hence, each scheme will be subject to an assessment within its particular context and, as appropriate, provisions will be made in the design and construction of the schemes to cater for potential future changes.  While substantial work has been done in assessing the potential impacts of climate change on flooding and flood risk, the OPW will continue to engage across sectors of government and with the climate science research community to help to inform and monitor the evolving state of knowledge of climate change.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I turn to estate portfolio management.  The OPW's property role is largely focused on providing property solutions for central government Departments and other State organisations.  In 2009, as part of the European Union's 2020 climate and energy objectives, Ireland set a national target of 20% for improvements in energy efficiency.  While the overall national target was set at 20%, Ireland set a more ambitious target of 33% for improvements in energy efficiency within the public sector.  The purpose in setting a more challenging public sector target was to demonstrate leadership on the issue of energy efficiency for the economy and society.  The public sector energy efficiency strategy published by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in 2017 set out the very significant achievements of the public sector to date in improving its energy efficiency, with savings of 21% reported in 2016.  However, the report also identified a need for step change in activity to reach the Government's target of 33% by 2020.The built environment contributes significantly to total energy use, at in the region of 40% of overall consumption.  The savings reported for the public sector to date represent a considerable achievement.  A significant proportion of the savings have been realised through behavioural change, the elimination of energy waste and low-cost capital projects.  There is, however, a finite limit to how much can be achieved by these measures and once it is reached, capital investment will be necessary to make further savings, particularly in areas such as larger scale projects, including near-zero energy, new builds and the deep retrofit of existing buildings.<br\/><br\/>The OPW devised and implemented a staff energy awareness programme, &quot;Optimising Power@Work&quot; which is a play on the acronym &quot;OPW&quot;, in our portfolio of buildings.  The level of engagement by staff has been exceptional and considerable savings have resulted, with a relatively low level of investment.  The majority of existing inherited buildings in the OPW's portfolio provide accommodation for the central government Departments, agencies and the Garda, but there are also specialist facilities such as data centres, laboratories and museums.  A good indication of the overall energy efficiency of the existing buildings can be found in analysing their operational BERs and display energy certificates.  The vast majority, or 79%, have a &quot;C&quot; or &quot;D&quot; rating, as members will see in the slides provided.  At the upper end of the scale, only 10%, unfortunately, have a &quot;B&quot; rating or better, while at the lower end, 11% have an &quot;E&quot; rating or worse.  The majority of the very poor performing buildings have exceptional electrical loads, for example, large data centres or historic properties.<br\/><br\/>The OPW has developed a three-step process to increase energy efficiency in our building portfolio.  Step 1 involves behavioural change, the elimination of waste and the optimisation of existing controls.  The OPW has achieved average energy savings of approximately 18% through the Optimising Power@Work scheme.  Launched in 2008, the campaign operates in 280 large central government buildings, covering approximately 80% of energy usage across the entire OPW property portfolio.  The main focus of the programme is on encouraging behavioural change among building occupants, optimising existing control systems and eliminating energy wastage.  There are three fundamental elements of the campaign, the first of which is technology.  One needs the availability of real-time energy reports from energy monitoring equipment installed in each participating building.  The second element is specialist resources.  This means having energy specialists working with energy teams in each building.  The third and most important element is staff engagement.  This means the active involvement of staff in the energy teams operating in each building.  In 2014 the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment provided &euro;9 million in funding to expand the programme into the wider public sector.  While the OPW is leading the campaign, the service requirement is largely outsourced to specialist private sector companies.  The public sector campaign is now operating in 16 large acute care hospitals, two universities, five institutes of technology, five local authorities, nine prisons, five specialist facilities and three HSE estates administration buildings.<br\/><br\/>The second step involves upgrading mechanical and electrical systems.  There are significant energy savings to be achieved by upgrading existing mechanical and electrical systems, particularly in older buildings.  Most buildings will benefit from upgrading existing lighting systems, boilers and controls and these interventions can be carried out with minimum disruption to the normal operations of the occupants.  Typical savings of 8% to 10% can be expected, with payback periods of eight to 12 years.  In 2017 the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment provided &euro;3.5 million in funding for an energy efficiency retrofit pilot programme in central government buildings.  The programme was a joint venture between the Department, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the OPW.  Last year 11 large buildings were upgraded, mainly through lighting and control projects.  Funding has been increased this year to &euro;9.5 million.  As a result, energy retrofit works are under way in 33 large buildings.  This year's retrofit programme includes boiler, control system and some fabric upgrades which will lead to significant electrical and thermal fuel savings.  The OPW will closely monitor the levels of savings achieved through the existing monitoring and reporting system.<br\/><br\/>In addition, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has provided &euro;1 million in funding through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland for a pilot energy works programme in a selection of smaller buildings.<\/p><p>As part of this initiative, fabric, lighting and boiler upgrades are being carried out in 28 smaller central government buildings.  Substantial energy savings are being achieved in the buildings that were retrofitted in 2017 where we have the data.  Typically, electrical usage on lighting has been reduced by 60% to 70%, with overall electrical loads in those buildings reduced by 20% to 40%.  In order to meet the Government's public sector energy targets, substantial investment to expand the energy retrofit programme into all large buildings within the OPW portfolio during 2019 and 2020 will be needed.<br\/><br\/>The third step is deep retrofit.  Deep retrofit is a combination of major fabric upgrades and mechanical and electrical, M and E, systems upgrades.  Such works yield very significant reductions in energy usage.  In effect, deep retrofit involves stripping the building right back to its bare structure and installing very high-performing insulation and glazing systems, improving air tightness and installing high-efficiency mechanical and electrical systems.  It is not practical to carry out these works while buildings are occupied.  This type of intervention is only considered where it is opportune, that is, when the building is being vacated for some reason.  The OPW has a number of buildings in the project pipeline that will be suitable for deep retrofit, such as Tom Johnson House, in Beggar's Bush, Ballsbridge, and 22 Clare Street, both office refurbishments that are planned.<br\/><br\/>A key part of the State's portfolio managed by the OPW relates to heritage sites, buildings, parks and gardens.  The conservation and restoration works within these sites are undertaken with an emphasis both on conservation standards and energy conservation.  The ability to upgrade the energy efficiency of a historic structure while maintaining the appropriate conservation standards can be seen in recently completed projects such as the refurbishment works to the south block of Government Buildings, Merrion Street.<br\/><br\/>The energy performance of buildings directive requires EU member states to ensure that after 31 December of this year, all new buildings occupied and owned by public authorities are nearly zero-energy buildings, NZEBs.  The directive provides that the public sector must lead by example in this regard.  Part L, concerning buildings other than dwellings, of the revised Irish building regulations was published in 2017.  However, in order to satisfy the requirement after 31 December 2018 that all new buildings occupied and owned by public authorities be NZEBs, an interim public sector performance specification was published on 1 January 2017.  This involved the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the OPW and the SEAI working together to formulate the specification.  The OPW is currently designing all new buildings to NZEB standard.  Our design teams are carrying out considerable work to ensure compliance with the new requirements, especially in respect of on-site renewable technologies such as photovoltaics, heat pumps, solar thermal etc.  The OPW has maintained a long-standing tradition of building design based on sustainability and energy efficiency, from the publication of the <i>Green Design: Sustainable Building for Ireland<\/i>standard in 1996 to the recent completion of a number of building programmes.  These programmes include seven courthouse projects across the country, three large-scale Garda divisional or regional headquarter buildings and the OPW schools programme, all of which achieved a BER rating of A3.  Moving forward, under the National Development Plan 2018-2027, the OPW is charged with the delivery of a number of large-scale building projects, the design and construction of which will require compliance with the NZEB standard.  In particular, the forensic science laboratories at the Backweston campus, County Kildare; the Garda security and crime operations centre on Military Road, Dublin 8; and the Leeson Lane office development will all be NZEBs.<br\/><br\/>In summary, the OPW has completed under the national CFRAM programme a detailed assessment of current and potential future flood risk.  We are implementing a &euro;1 billion programme of investment in flood risk schemes to protect people and property, taking into account the increases in flood risk that climate change can bring.  The OPW is playing a leading role in Ireland's compliance with public sector targets by ensuring that buildings within the property portfolio managed by the OPW are designed to comply with energy efficiency standards.  Substantial work has been done to date on energy efficiency in central government buildings, significant savings have been achieved and the OPW will continue to work with our clients to help them maximise their energy efficiency.  To continue to make these improvements, a significant capital investment to retrofit the remainder of the OPW's building stock will be required over the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018102400002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540384200,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agaibh.

I would like the witnesses to talk about this point.<\/p> <p>  In line with that, Mr. Buckley talks about a &euro;1 billion investment required to design and construct 118 flood relief schemes.  Does he think this investment is nearly enough?  Does he think, knowing what we know now, it may need to be ratcheted up?  He gave us the scenario of a possible rise in sea levels of 50 cm to 1 m, resulting in peak flood flows in the rivers of 20% or 30%.  On what is Mr. Buckley basing this?  Where is the figure coming from?  He did not just pluck it out of the sky.  Again, in line with the climate change projections, could this be more serious and could it change?  If so, would the OPW then need more investment in what it is trying to do with the flood measures etc.?<\/p> <p>  My last question is kind of in line with that.

Whether it can be extended is a question for Government in terms of the amount of money that can be made available and where that is prioritised.

I dealt with an issue in the town in which I live and, thankfully, through the minor works scheme, that has been resolved, although one can never say that for definite.  A small grant was secured and the works were done.  I have found that when a single dwelling that is located at the mouth of a river or a river basin is affected, the residents involved did not have as much of a voice, especially if they were elderly, compared with an event where an entire village or town flooded.  Does Mr. Buckley understand the point I am trying to make?  It can be more difficult for such people to be heard.  The minor works grant has been successful when employed but unless the people affected contact a politician, they find it difficult on occasion to get the information they need to access the grant through their local authority.<\/p> <p>  I refer to when flood defence schemes are put in place.  For example, Mr. Buckley showed us the picture of Clonmel, where a very successful flood defence scheme has been put in place.

First, in terms of the single houses or smaller communities, I guess there is a kind of a hierarchy in terms of how the protection works.  Obviously, we are prioritising the schemes that will bring the most benefit to the highest number of people and properties.  Also, if a large investment is being put in the cost benefit is easier to achieve if 50 houses will be saved from flooding as a result.  The high-level schemes we described in CFRAM are at that national level of major investment.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, the next level down is working with the local authorities on minor works.  There is a large number of such schemes and they are more flexible and locally focused but they still have to meet the cost-benefit analysis requirements.  I might ask Commissioner Sydenham to explain that.  We then come down to the single houses or two or three houses that are built on a flood plain where it is not possible economically to justify large-scale work.

The individual development will always be a problem.  Given our demographics, we have a great deal of what we call ribbon development the length and breadth of the country.  It is always a challenge to try to protect that.  That said, it is equally as emotive for any individual impacted by flooding, whether they are part of a town or living in an isolated bungalow.  The key argument is the economic argument.  We cannot devote very scarce resources to do an elaborate scheme to protect houses.  We have looked at instances where the cost of a remediation would be multiples of the value of the dwelling we are trying to protect.  Even though it sounds very heartless, the economic realities come in.<\/p> <p>  We have looked at a number of measures that can assist individuals affected in such a way.  We have individual property protection whereby, depending on the extent of the flood impacting on the dwelling, they can get devices that will protect them in terms of water ingress.  Pumping is another measure that can be taken.<\/p><p>Beyond that we have looked at home relocation, which is an extreme option.  There are instances where it is not economically viable, prudent or practical to do something with existing dwellings so Government has approved a scheme to facilitate somebody moving to a new location and constructing a new dwelling.  That is extreme for somebody who has lived in the community for a protracted period.  In other areas where there are small groupings of houses not warranting a full scheme, there are other schemes where we have developed localised individual property protection.  A highly sophisticated warning system is needed to give us ample time to put the measures in place.  We have piloted a number of schemes and we found that the cost of the warning system sometimes exceeded the cost of the remediation.  Some of them can be extremely expensive.  There is also the minor works scheme so there is a range of measures.  Perhaps, as the Deputy said, our communication could improve so that people knew what was available to them.<\/p><p> The Deputy also asked about Carrick-on-Suir and said there was a perception that we fix the problem in one area only to push it into another downstream.  The central aspect of the CFRAM programme is catchments and the interactions within them.  It is important that an intervention in one area does not cause a problem elsewhere.  People may think this happens but it does not and the schemes are designed specifically to ensure there is no knock-on impact. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018102400002#Q02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Sydenham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540384200,"counter":172,"content":"<p>There is a lot of detail in the presentation.

In one scheme it might be necessary to design a physical defence strong enough to withstand an increase of a few hundred millimetres in 50 or 100 years.

To use that analysis in a different way, when we are doing flood protection measures, we should look at nature protection at the same time.  There is widespread concern that the flood protection measures the OPW is engaged in are highly disruptive of natural systems.  I could cite many examples.  The current issue which may be drawing most attention is the Blackwater flood management near Bandon where, on a daily basis, we see trucks driving up and down rivers in the middle of the sensitive spawning season.  The whole river has been destroyed.  Why is the OPW doing flood management in a way that is destroying rivers?  The Blackwater is not an unimportant river.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018102400002#S00900","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540384200,"counter":188,"content":"<p>All of the works can be invasive.

We have worked closely with Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, and the fisheries to work around spawning seasons.  We conduct environmental assessments and look after the ecology to the greatest possible extent.  We also look at other measures to seek to solve the problem differently.  There are schemes such as the Clonakilty scheme, which I mentioned already, where water will be stored in flood plains so that when there is a flooding event, instead of deepening channels and so on, water will be allowed to run into areas where it will not cause damage or impact the environment.  It will then run off when that becomes possible.  There are limits to how much can be achieved with these natural measures, including forestation and so forth.  We look at them and they are part of long-term planning but experience nationally and internationally shows that there are limits and one cannot get away from the need to engage in fairly aggressive physical interventions sometimes.  These are unfortunate and disruptive because they interfere with riverways and so on but they are done in as sensitive a way as possible and we manage environmental issues very carefully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018102400002#S01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1540384200,"counter":189,"content":"<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, reports on sea level rises are very conservative.

I am very concerned about this.  The need for a scheme in Crossmolina has been established for a number of years and consultations have been ongoing since 2013 or 2014.  Statutory public consultation was undertaken during the summer and we were honoured with Mr. Buckley's presence and that of other officials from the OPW.  My understanding is we will not see the various stages through which it must proceed completed until the fourth quarter of 2019.  In all honesty, at this stage people in Crossmolina are pretty angry and frantic because there almost was a flooding event two weeks ago.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledged the minor works schemes put in place and the efforts of locals but some of the businesses that were destroyed in the town centre do not have flood insurance.  They will be finished if they get flooded again.  Mr. Buckley is speaking about two more winters before the work commences.  If the project is approved by the fourth quarter of 2019, the works will be put back until spring at the earliest because the OPW will not start works in the middle of winter.  We will have this threat hanging over people for two winters.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the planning process that is under way, when will the OPW submit a report to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to enable it to go through its part of the process?  Has a screening of the project been done?  What stage are we at on a strategic environmental assessment?  So much work has been done and so much has been said about this project.  The funding is also in place.  It is of little solace to people to hear their project is on a list, has been prioritised and funding is available.

I must accept it is difficult for agencies to deal with situations like that and to take everything into consideration.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  Is the aforementioned &euro;1 billion ring-fenced for the ten-year period?  It is a significant amount of money but is it totally ring-fenced and guaranteed?  Is it there for dealing with what could be emergencies and other issues that may need to be dealt with?  I understood that the Government put money into a relocation scheme.  Is that correct?

I believe two such studies are under way in Roscommon.  When is it envisaged that we will have a report on them?<\/p> <p>  Have we got a maintenance budget for the River Shannon?  We have heard a lot of talk about pinch points and I am sure Mr. Buckley has travelled many times across the bridge in Lanesborough and has seen the abhorrent growth there, that was never there before.

Is there a budget to remove that type of growth, as well as the amount of silt and peat that is in the River Shannon?  Capacity has been badly affected over the years.  Is there a budget to cover that?<\/p> <p>  As for flood defences, it appears to me that we are looking at masses of concrete as flood defences.  We should be eco-friendly and environmentally friendly by following those parts of the world where they do not use these concrete defences, which will look appalling around towns like Roscommon or Carrick-on-Shannon.  Is it the case that where we do put up such flood defences, it all is going to be mass concrete?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Buckley has spoken about the issue of insurance.

The OPW has, as part of CFRAM, identified 90 coastal communities that potentially will be impacted by coastal flooding.

The OPW, for its part, will assess applications for funding from respective local authorities if they identify a need and set out a proposed scheme.  It comes to us, we assess it and we provide the funding to them.  A good example of this is Portrane, which was impacted significantly by coastal erosion.  The local authority, Fingal County Council, engaged consultants and in the first instance produced a scheme for interim protection to protect a number of houses at risk.  That was submitted to us and we provided half a million euro in funding to Fingal County Council to start immediate work on the implementation of the local coastal defences.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Adamson will now speak on the other two issues, specifically, the turloughs and the nature of the flood defences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018102400002#V00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Sydenham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540384200,"counter":260,"content":"<p>The turloughs study is being undertaken by the Geological Survey of Ireland, GSI, with Trinity College Dublin, but in partnership with us.

That has saved us bringing any soil offsite to put into landfill.  We would take those wider issues on board as part of that broad spectrum of approach.  We have a core and a comprehensive approach.

Deputy Eamon Ryan's people were baptised in the River Lee.  I was baptised in the Blackwater, metaphorically speaking.  We do speak about flood defences and there is very clear evidence of structural works on the Munster Blackwater at Fermoy and Mallow, which are phenomenally successful.  For anybody who has any doubts about whether demountable walls work there is incontrovertible proof that they do.  Notwithstanding that, the problem for migratory fish and so on, to which Deputy Eamon Ryan has referred, is a slightly different issue, not quite pertinent to this one because it relates to a fish pass in disrepair and is not necessarily in the witnesses' remit.  It is important to put that on the record.<\/p> <p>  There are 118 flood relief schemes and flood relief programmes were always designed with the 100 year flood in mind.  I was formerly a mayor of my town and when we went through the process we were told we were designing for the 100 year flood.  I fail to understand Mr. Adamson's intervention on the planning, maybe I missed something in the dialogue.  Have we now surpassed the 100 year flood mark or benchmark in planning for flooding events?  Should we now be using agricultural land to slow down flooding and should we be paying farmers who are on flood plains some sort of compensation and telling them not to build on their land, not to plant or graze and allow for natural drainage schemes to take place?  That would be a structural solution to flooding and a more natural solution that is not just engineering but another solution in terms of land use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018102400002#W00600","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540384200,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Before I pass over to Mr. Adamson, fluvial or river flooding is targeted to the 100 year event, in other words a 1% probability of a flood.

There is a significant existing risk.  We have seen in recent events that many properties have flooded so the primary focus is to tackle that immediate problem.  We are aware, however, that climate change can make flooding worse so we need to take that into account.  How exactly that is done will vary on a scheme-by-scheme basis.  There is no one-size-fits-all solution to climate change adaptability for flood relief schemes.  It depends very much on the local context of each individual town.<\/p><p>If one takes Crossmolina as an example, there is a bridge in the town.  If the river level rises too high, it becomes a buoyancy issue and the historic bridge could pop up.  We have a diversion channel which takes the flood flows around Crossmolina.  In adapting to potential future change, we cannot send greater flows through the town and build walls because we have a problem with the bridge.  The solution for adaption in Crossmolina is to enhance the capacity of the diversion channel to take the mid-range future scenario flow.<\/p><p> In that instance we took what we call the assumptive approach.  We assume a certain design allowance for climate change.  In other areas we may take an adaptive approach, particularly in regard to flood defences.  We might build the foundations of a flood defence wall to a certain size, ensuring that if necessary they can be increased in height in future.  In other instances there may be alternative approaches, such as providing storage upstream at a future date.  This could help reduce flood flows through the town.  In other instances such as Cork there will be a mix of all three approaches.  There are a range of ways to ensure that our schemes are adaptable to climate change.  We have to look at each of them on a case-by-case basis.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding that, we are maintaining the 100 year standard protection for fluvial schemes in the current scenario.  In doing that, however, we must be conscious that in some instances we will need to raise the standards to cater for a 100 year projection that might come to pass in 50 years.<\/p><p> On using flood plains for storage, I refer in the first instance to the previous response.  There are very few embanked channels in Ireland, so effectively the rivers are already using the storage available to them.  Having said that, there are certain areas where we can effectively enhance the use of that storage.  For example, to deal with flood conditions, the scheme in Clonakilty is looking at increasing the depth of storage in the flood plains upstream of the town.  In the lower Lee Cork city scheme we are looking at utilising the rural land between Cork city and the Gearagh as washland, thereby making use of that additional storage during flood events.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018102400002#W00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Adamson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540384200,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I have one last question.

Based on the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, finding of 21% in the public building space versus the target of 33%, the report provides details by group of buildings.  It provides a traffic light code showing which areas of the public sector will meet the target.  For example, we are very confident that the OPW buildings we occupy we will meet the target.  The target will be met in large parts of the agencies and the accommodation we provide.  In some areas however, including some local authority facilities and Garda stations which are small, old buildings designed around other priorities, it will not be possible to reach the 33% target by 2020.  For example, the figure for Garda stations is above 20%.  That is higher than the national target, but it would take a phenomenal investment to get there.  That was identified in the report and I mentioned it in my opening statement.  As we discussed a moment ago, for the Government it is a question of prioritising where the available funding is to be put.  If funding can be supplied to retrofit public buildings on a large scale, we can organise that.

The Houses of the Oireachtas are being asked to approve the following regulations in draft: Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (Section 95(3)) (Variation of Title: Physical Therapist) Regulations 2018.  These regulations are being made pursuant to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, which provides for the protection of the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct, education, training and competence through statutory registration of the health and social care professionals designated under the Act.  Regulation under the Act is primarily by way of registration of practitioners and the statutory protection of professional titles.  The use of protected titles is restricted to practitioners granted registration under the Act.<\/p><p>The registrants must comply with a code of professional conduct and ethics and are subject to fitness to practise rules similar to those applying to nurses, midwives and doctors.  The structure of the system of statutory regulation comprises registration boards for the professions, a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters, and the Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system.  These bodies are collectively known as CORU.<\/p><p> The Act prohibits a person whose name is not on the register from using the title of a designated profession and provides that CORU may initiate a criminal prosecution summarily to enforce the prohibition on a designated title's misuse.  The title of physiotherapist is specified under section 79 of the 2005 Act for the exclusive use of qualified professionals registered with the Physiotherapists Registration Board.  The board first met in June 2014.  One of the first items on its agenda was protection of title and how best to address the question of protecting the title of physical therapist.  In other English-speaking countries physiotherapists often use the title of physical therapist interchangeably with that of physiotherapist.  In Ireland, however, in the absence of regulation and of title protection, the title of physical therapist has been used by other providers of musculoskeletal therapies practising in the private sector.  Those using the title of physical therapist are predominately members of the Irish Association of Physical Therapists.  This association has approximately 300 members, most of whom are degree level graduates of the Institute of Physical Therapy and Applied Science in Dublin.  Like physiotherapists, graduates of the institute provide musculoskeletal therapies.  Physiotherapists, however, are also trained to provide cardio-respiratory and neurological therapies.<\/p><p> In 2016, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, concluded extensive consultations with the registration board and other relevant organisations concerning the protection of title.  He decided that protecting the title of physical therapist under the Act as a variant of the title of physiotherapist would be the best way to eliminate the risk of title confusion and the consequent risks to public safety.  The Physiotherapists Registration Board established its register on 30 September 2016.  The two-year transitional period ended in September 2018, at which time entitlement to use the title of physiotherapist was confined to members of the register.<\/p><p> The Health and Social Care Professionals (Amendment) Act 2017 provided for the registration in the register of physiotherapists on a once-off basis and for a limited period, ending in December 2018, of certain qualified users of the title physical therapist.  The Act facilitates the Minister in making regulations to prescribe the title of physical therapist as a variant title of physiotherapist.  Section 95(3) of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides that the Minister for Health, after consulting the registration board of a designated profession and any organisations that he or she considers appropriate, may by regulation prescribe one or more than one title that is a variant of the title designated in the Act for the profession.  Section 95(7) provides that a regulation may be made under section 95(3) only if a draft of the proposed regulation has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.

Now on the Physiotherapists Registration Board we have physiotherapists who are qualified in three streams, namely, cardio-respiratory, neurological and musculoskeletal.  A limited number of registrants are on the same register with an interchangeable title and who only practise in the field of musculoskeletal therapy.  They practise in one stream and the others practise in three streams.  There is a once-off provision to ensure there is no risk to the public.  No more physical therapists of the one-stream category will be registered.  To protect the public, those physical therapists with a one-stream musculoskeletal practice have signed up to a code of conduct and ethics.

For 2018, the Government approved gross expenditure of &euro;15.332 billion for the health services - &euro;14.839 billion for current funding and &euro;493 million for capital funding - representing a 4.9% increase on the original Vote allocation for 2017.  The improving economy has enabled the health service to achieve much-needed budget increases in each of the past three years.  We are very aware that there are areas where further improvements are required, and the Department will continue to work with the HSE to optimise service provision within the constraints of available funding.  Demographic pressures, including a rise in chronic diseases and an ageing population, mean that we face challenges into the future in implementing our strategic responses to these developments while continuing to focus on effective management of resources to ensure that services are delivered in line with the national service plan and within budget.  Not only has our population over the ages of 65 and 85 increased significantly, but due to the continuous improvements in health delivery more people are also living longer with more illnesses, requiring increased ongoing support from the health system.<\/p> <p>  In considering the drivers of expenditure in any given year, it is important to recognise the interdependencies that exist.  For example, a policy goal seeking to improve client safety, underpinned by improved regulation, can be delivered through a range of interventions which may drive a requirement for increased staffing and new roles.  Almost 1,100 designated centres in disability services need to be registered by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  In addition, 790 individuals were identified nationally in 2017 as requiring an immediate service response in terms of residential placement.  Notably, death or incapacity of the main carer was the main driver, accounting for 29.5% of these requirements.  In the case of drug spending, the main drivers are new high-tech drugs expenditure in areas such as cystic fibrosis, rheumatology and cancer and increased spend on drugs under the long-term illness scheme for conditions such as diabetes, cystic fibrosis and epilepsy.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that a number of service areas are purely demand-driven, and spending can exceed the budgeted allocation, where forecast assumptions on demand levels differ from those experienced.  Health is one of the few public services which has its pension costs reflected in its Vote.  Changes to pension rates and the fact that pensioners are living longer have resulted in a significant increase in the share of the health Vote attributable to pensions.  Similarly, the inclusion of the costs associated with the State Claims Agency has an impact on the health Vote annually.  While an assessment is undertaken each year, it can be difficult to forecast.  The increasing cost of settlements is determined by the court system and is a matter which does not fall not within the remit of the health sector.<\/p> <p>  The nature of the health services is such that the normal budget management levers available to other sectors, such as reduction of services, are simply not available to the HSE in some areas.  The winter of 2018 was very difficult for our health services.  During February, there was a 7.7% increase in attendances and a 5% increase in emergency department, ED, admissions compared to February 2017.  This growth in demand is well ahead of population growth and reflects international evidence that emergency department demand is driven by more than demographic factors.  This increased demand was further exacerbated in March by the impact of Storm Emma and the associated severe weather experienced across the country.  Other external factors, such as the actions of the private health insurers, are also driving the need for additional funding.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the financial position and the 2018 outturn, while it is still too early to forecast accurately the year-end position, significant deficits are emerging, driven in large part by the issues referred to above.  I refer, for example, to: a private patient income shortfall of around &euro;100 million, arising from the campaign by the insurers to dissuade their policyholders from using their insurance when admitted through an ED; a higher level of State Claims Agency payouts than budgeted for, approximately &euro;50 million; a primary care reimbursement service driven by costs and demand for drugs, especially high-tech and long-term illness, in the range of &euro;95 million; a higher level of spend on national reform projects, in the range of &euro;40 million; a higher level of spend on service areas, acute and social care, in the range of &euro;220 million; and non-achievement of tranche 3 of the value improvement programme, in the range of &euro;150 million.<\/p><p> The overspend in the service areas is driven by a number of factors, including the non-achievement of value improvement programme, VIP, targets, higher levels and higher complexity of demand, costs associated with meeting national standards and emergency placements beyond the level funded.  Based on spending this year to date, it is clear that there will be an overrun in 2018.  In that context, the announcement by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, that he intends to allocate an additional &euro;700 million to the health service in 2018 by way of a Supplementary Estimate is most welcome, particularly bearing in mind that it has been possible to carry this additionality into the base for 2019.<\/p><p> In drafting the capital plan for the period 2018 to 2022, the HSE identified a deficit in construction capital funding for 2018 of &euro;109 million.  During 2018 extensive measures to actively manage the capital budget have been applied.  This has involved balancing, as much as practicable, the fulfilment of contractual commitments, delivery of projects and managing equipment and infrastructural risk issues such that capital expenditure remains within profile.  Following this extensive engagement and management of issues, capital spending to September 2018 remains within profile.  Nevertheless, there are limits to which such a level of funding shortfall in the year can be managed.  As the end of the year approaches and following implementation of the measures I have outlined in the past 12 months, the projected year-end deficit has been managed down, with no further viable options available to meet this gap.  However, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has approved a further &euro;20 million to be allocated to bridge a proportion of this gap in 2018 as part of the overall Supplementary Estimate amount.<\/p><p> Despite welcome increases over recent years, a financial challenge remains as we deal with a larger and older population, more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and the rising costs of health technology.  The costs of payments under the State Claims Agency are also rising, adding to the overall cost of health above the operational costs funded to meet the health demands of a growing and ageing population.  The HSE is reporting significant overruns in the year to date and the Department continues to work closely with it to identify measures to reduce the projected deficit through mitigating actions, without impacting service levels.  It is now anticipated that the bulk of VIP 1 savings for the year will be achieved in 2018, as well as a small amount of savings under VIP 2.<\/p><p> We must maintain our focus on improving the way services are organised and delivered, and on reducing costs, in order to maximise the ability of the health service to respond to growing needs.  It is essential that those managing and delivering the service demonstrate good practice by delivering the best possible healthcare within the limits of resources that have been made available by Government each year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Desmond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Desmond and invite Mr. Mulvany to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#L00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I thank committee for the invitation to attend.  The HSE spent &euro;14.3 billion on the provision of health and social care services in 2017.  This excludes capital spending.  The 2018 budget for the provision of these services is &euro;14.6 billion, which is &euro;224 million, or 1.6%, above what was spent in 2017.  The 2018 budget is &euro;608 million, or 4.4%, higher than the 2017 budget.  This is made up of pay rate funding for existing staffing levels at &euro;278 million, funding support for the existing level of services, including demographics, at &euro;134 million and funding for new developments at &euro;195 million.  To the end of August 2018 the HSE has spent &euro;10 billion on the provision of health and social care services to service users, patients and their families.  This is &euro;485 million, or 5.1%, above the level of budget available to the end of August.  Some 43%, or &euro;206 million, of this &euro;485 million overrun relates to unfunded cost growths in 2018 that are outside of the areas of spend which are amenable to normal management control efforts or relate to exceptional costs such as those associated with Storm Emma.  This includes the primary care reimbursement service at &euro;50 million, the State Claims Agency at &euro;32 million, local demand led schemes and overseas treatment at &euro;24 million, pensions at &euro;9 million, acute hospital income issues related to the actions of insurers at &euro;63 million and exceptional items, including Storm Emma, at &euro;28 million.  Some 37%, or &euro;180 million, of this &euro;485 million overrun relates to a shortfall in the target savings necessary to offset the unfunded costs of services that were running throughout 2017.  Despite this, &euro;37 million of savings under the value improvement programme are being reported by our community healthcare organisations and hospital groups at the end of August.  This figure is indicated to be approximately &euro;60 million in savings by year end.  In addition to this, there are significant centrally generated drugs and medicine related savings being delivered by the primary care reimbursement service, for example, &euro;27 million on a clinical protocol driven access initiative and in acute hospitals &euro;12 million on the framework agreement with suppliers.<\/p> <p>  Finally, 20% or &euro;99 million of this &euro;485 million overrun relates to other unfunded cost growths in 2018 within our operational service areas.  The provision of disability services to services users with intellectual and physical and sensory disabilities accounts for &euro;29 million of this residual &euro;99 million - emergency residential places at &euro;19 million, costs associated with HIQA registration of residential services at &euro;7 million and home support at &euro;3 million.  Behind these numbers there are many individual stories of service users with intellectual disabilities requiring residential care on a crisis basis due to a breakdown in their family caring arrangements.  On a positive note, very substantial progress has been made in achieving HIQA registration of residential centres.  The provision of services to older persons accounts for &euro;22 million of this residual &euro;99 million overrun, that is, home support at &euro;5 million, transitional care beds at &euro;2 million and public residential units at &euro;15 million.  Ireland's population aged 85 years and older is growing at approximately 4.3% per annum, which is significantly above than the EU average.  The provision of acute hospital services accounts for &euro;50 million of the residual &euro;99 million with this being partly attributable to additional activity levels and the growing complexity and cost of care as the age of the average patient increases.  In addition, bed occupancy levels in our acute hospitals, at 94%, are the second highest in the OECD and are well above the OECD average of 77%.  Levels consistently above 85% are indicative of a system operating under considerable stress, with knock-on implications for efficiency, quality and cost.<\/p> <p>  Based on the data to the end of August, it is clear that the full year cost of providing essential health and social care services in 2018 will significantly exceed the available funding.  In that context, the HSE very much welcomes the announcement by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that he intends to allocate an additional &euro;700 million to the health service in 2018, by way of a Supplementary Estimate.  It is particularly welcome that it has been indicated that this additional allocation will remain in the base funding of the health service going into 2019.  It is understood that &euro;625 million of this &euro;700 million will be allocated to the HSE to offset overruns in operating costs, with &euro;20 million being allocated to support ongoing HSE capital investment.<\/p> <p>  HSE national directors and their teams, as part of the ongoing performance management process, have been working throughout the year reviewing current costs with a view to reducing the level of overrun and this will continue and be intensified to year end where this is practical.  This is necessary to minimise the amount of any residual 2018 overrun.<\/p> <p>  That concludes my opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mulvany.

Obviously, the overrun this year, at &euro;700 million, is huge.  We will see what it reaches by the end of the year.  Not only is it a vast amount of money that we must vote through this year, it also has serious implications for next year and the following years.  The budget documentation has provisioned &euro;625 million for all future years based on this year's overrun.  The health budget is going to increase by nearly &euro;1.7 billion.  Over &euro;600 million of that will be for the overrun, and there are demographics and pay agreements.  When one strips it all out there is not enough left to get serious about Sl&aacute;intecare and the modernisation and scaling up of the system.  The overrun does not just affect the Exchequer this year but the &euro;625 million that must be allocated to cover the overrun essentially means Sl&aacute;intecare is not happening next year.  Sl&aacute;intecare requires approximately &euro;1 billion per year, although one could probably pare it down a little.  The implications of these overruns are enormous.<\/p> <p>  There have been overruns for a long time.

While, obviously, there may be overruns in the health sector for unforeseen events, there has been a massive leap.  We are tipping along at a figure of &euro;700 million a year and have been for the past few years, with 2017 being an outlier.  What has gone on in the past few years that is different from happened in previous years?  We were looking at much more modest overruns, whereas now they are enormous.  Notwithstanding the fact that there are always crises and storms in the health sector, with expenditure on drugs that was unanticipated and inevitably a certain amount of unanticipated activity, why are the overruns now approximately three times what than they were a decade ago?

As explained, the position on overruns is that they are mainly driven by demographics and unforeseen events which require a Supplementary Estimate.  Historically, the position has varied to a fair degree and it has not necessarily been for technical reasons.  In recent years, for instance, a significant additional allocation of &euro;500 million was made in one year and it was not technically a Supplementary Estimate.  The nature of the health sector is such that there is a degree of unpredictability in service requirements but also in other areas which are not service related such as those I mentioned in my opening statement.<\/p> <p>  I can also answer the questions about Sl&aacute;&iacute;ntecare, if the committee so wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Desmond"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":378,"content":"<p>No; I wish to stay on this topic.  <\/p> <p>  With the greatest of respect, that is not a reasonable answer.  Demographics are predictable and should never lead to overruns.  We know how many people are living in the country and have quite a good idea of how many will be in it next year.  Demographics are not unforeseen and are planned for in any budget.  Therefore, demographic changes cannot be the issue.  While there have been overruns, based on the 11 years of information we have available, the trend has been significantly upwards.  There are always unanticipated events in healthcare, but there are unanticipated events in everything, including transport or in running a coffee shop.  Anyone who budgets for the year, be it for a coffee shop or a &euro;17 billion healthcare system, makes provisions.  One includes discretionary amounts of money to deal with unforeseen events such as storms, flu outbreaks or whatever else.  Therefore, I do not think it is reasonable to say demographic changes are the reason for an overrun as they are entirely predictable and can be budgeted for.  My question is: why are the overruns twice to three times more than what they used to be in the past four years?  The wheels are coming off.

We have set out where the deficits have occurred in the year to date and people can form a judgment on which of them was anticipated.  In looking at the performance at the end of last year, if one adds the Supplementary Estimate at the time for &euro;208 million and the residual deficit with which we were left of &euro;166 million, one ends up with a &euro;374 million problem.  It is a larger deficit than in other years such as when the health service broke even, but one must bear the components in mind.  About which parts of that &euro;374 million could one realistically say it was a performance issue or potentially a performance issue?  There was a central Government decision to make a pay award on 1 October 2017, but the Government decided to bring it forward to 1 April.  The first part of the Supplementary Estimate was a &euro;75 million increase in the allocation to allow for this.  Is that a performance issue?  No; it was simply a decision made by the Government, which was entirely appropriate.  <\/p> <p>  The cost in respect of the State Claims Agency is &euro;50 million.  It is a difficult area in which to predict expenditure.  It is difficult to come up with the actual figure between actuarial and run-rate estimates.  The key point from a performance management perspective, as people in this room know, is that the State Claims Agency is not the HSE's lawyer but its insurer.  It has its own statutory powers.  While the money we pay to the agency is in respect of HSE-related claims, it is in respect of claims made a number of years ago.  Is the figure of &euro;50 million related to a performance management issue in the health service?  I think that is the root of the question, to which the answer is no. <\/p> <p>  In 2017 the Government decided to make an access-winter investment plan, following the national service plan.  That is not unusual.  It accounted for &euro;35 million of the overall Supplementary Estimate and the residual deficit.<\/p> <p>  People can form a judgment on the next big item.  In 2017, &euro;121 million of the overall &euro;374 million is the impact on the income of acute hospitals.  It includes bad debts as a result of what we refer to as the actions of private insurers.  Leaving aside the question as to whether what they are doing is appropriate, the reality is they are doing it.  Despite the fact that hospitals have improved their income processes, there is an element with which they cannot deal.  The sum of &euro;121 million is in the performance management space because we must manage income and seek to management the budget we have rather than the one we would like to have, but we are satisfied that the sum of &euro;121 million does not broadly constitute a performance management issue for hospital groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting.

If he was running a coffee shop, a hospital, a health care system or anything else for which he had a budget, saw that he was spending over a certain amount a year and that it had jumped by a factor of two or three and stayed at that level, he would know that something had happened.  Anyone in Ireland who is running a business, a nursing home or a charity would ask himself or herslef that question.  He or she would say he or she was overspending by a bit, but now we are overspending by a huge sum and it has stayed there.  Something has changed and we need to understand it.<\/p> <p>  I want to go through the chronology to understand how it happened.  In 2017 the D&aacute;il voted through a health budget, on the basis of which the HSE produced a national service plan which under legislation needs to fall within the budget allocated.  In fairness to the HSE, at the front of that service plan it raised serious concerns about the risk of a potential overspend and here we are with an overspend of &euro;700 million.  When the national service plan was presented to the Minister for Health with all of the associated risks flagged, did he go back to ask the HSE to revise it to one that would deal with and make provision for the risks identified?  Anyone watching this debate who is running a business, a charity or a GAA team anywhere in the country knows that when someone is budgeting and dealing with a chaotic world where unforeseen things happen, as they do in the health sector and everywhere else, they make provision for this.  Anyone running a hospital knows that it is necessary to make provision for a certain amount of overtime to cover emergencies and so forth.  The D&aacute;il voted through a budget of over &euro;14 billion.  The national service plan produced for the Minister mentioned serious risks about the potential for an overspend.  We now have that overspend.  Was the HSE instructed to go back and come up with a budget that would make appropriate provision for the risks it had foreseen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#N00200","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Desmond to comment, but, first, while I am not trying to be difficult, unfortunately, the public health care system does not hold to the Deputy's analogy of someone running a coffee shop, a GAA club, a charity or a business.

There are references throughout the documents to increasing staff costs and pressures, but surely the officials will agree with me that if they are citing an increase in population as one of the reasons for constant overruns which are increasing, there should be a consequent increase in the number of personnel which should be easy to plan for.

We can certainly show the movement of staff over any period, but the Deputy's general point is absolutely correct.  It is possible to predict, or make estimates of the required staffing level to retain the existing level of staff and demographics.  The Estimates and planning process has two large components across the public sector.  The first runs up to budget day, where Departments and agencies like the HSE set out a view of what is required for the following year.  The second then is budget day, which tells one what is available.  The planning piece is then about how one fits the demands as best one can within what is available.<\/p> <p>  The HSE can make estimates and assumptions about what the costs will be in the following year on both sides of that process.  Without looking to offer excuses, the health service is large and complex.  Its system challenges are well documented and we are working on that.  Progress is being made, albeit slowly because of the scale of the system.  We rely on more than 2,000 organisations - 50 of them very large - to deliver the overall service.  We do not ask them all to feed into the forecasting estimates process, but we do ask a number of them.  Any future-focused exercise carries risk.  Typically when the service plan is made, data are available for August and September, so we are looking 15 or 16 months ahead.  One makes assumptions.  Given the scale of our budget, every margin of error of 0.1% is about &euro;15 million.  That is a big margin.<\/p> <p>  In the context of all that, for the HSE preparing bids and service plan estimates, and obviously for those in the Department and other colleagues who review them, one is looking at a set of estimates and assumptions.  In terms of calculating the value improvement programme target of &euro;346 million in the service plan, we went through an iterative process which looked at what was the level of service it could currently provide with the available funding, what level of activity within that could be tailored to fit the funding and what level of activity was almost entirely driven by demand.  The health service, as the committee knows, is complex.  It is the provider of last resort, the provider of 24-7 services and the place of safety.  There are a number of areas, including emergency departments in hospitals, disability, residential placements and similar areas in which a level of activity will happen even if there is not specific funding for it.  Through that iterative process, we determined there was a need for savings of about &euro;346 million.  It was set out in three tranches.  The first was the more immediate and urgent priority, that was about &euro;77 million.  As I said in the opening statement, we would expect to deliver about &euro;60 million of that.  We are challenged in terms of delivering much beyond that against that figure of &euro;346 million.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned other areas of savings where money is being delivered but that is against targets that are set for them.

One of the issues about which I am very concerned in the HSE is the growth in staff numbers since December 2014.  My understanding is that there are now 12,000 additional people working in the HSE, of whom over 2,600 of them are working in the area of administration and management.  In the past three to four years I have not seen a clear plan being set out by the HSE for where it needs to increase its workforce.  Yes, we have heard about increasing the numbers of nurses and doctors, but in the area of administration generally I have not seen an overall plan.  If we take it that there are an extra 12,000 people working in the HSE, the additional cost is roughly &euro;600 million per annum, but I am open to correction on that figure.  I am not clear on the stage at which there was a plan set out for the key areas in which personnel were required.  It seems to have been very much hit and miss and a case of whoever shouted the loudest got additional staff.  The number of staff in the area of administration and management has jumped from 15,000 to 17,600.  I am concerned about the lack of planning in that regard.  I have not seen any overall plan for how it is going to progress in the next few years.<\/p> <p>  When we are talking about planning, are we still only working on a one or two-year basis without having an overall objective?  In the area of computerisation we have focused on employing additional staff, while we do not appear to have an overall plan, or certainly it is very vague.  We are way behind other health services throughout Europe.  In Denmark they worked out that their computerisation programme was saving a huge amount of money each year and they have been at it since 1996.  I have not seen one coming from the HSE.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the State Claims Agency, Mr. Mulvany has said it is an additional cost.  The agency is able to predict the value of cases well in advance of being settled.<\/p><p>As such, it should be able to flag well in advance of drafting a budget what will be paid out in the coming year.  It has already made out for the next five to six years what it predicts the level of claims will be.  I am a little surprised that the figure is &euro;32 million for the agency.  It is a huge figure.  I imagine it has not got its figures that wrong in predicting the value of claims.  As such, when the HSE corresponds with the agency before it prepares its budget, the agency is surely able to provide a good guideline for what is needed.  Mr. Mulvany might clarify the issue.<\/p><p> I am not sure if any effort is being made by the HSE to deal with the following.  There is a lack of capacity to make decisions.  A huge amount of time and effort is wasted which results in the waste of a huge amount of money.  I gave the recent example to the committee of 12 people within the HSE having to have a meeting in Dublin about an issue which had been raised 18 months earlier.  That meeting was cancelled two days beforehand because one person had moved to a new job within the HSE and could not, therefore, attend.  The meeting was cancelled which resulted in a huge loss of time in planning for it and everyone organising for it.  I find that it is consistently the case in the HSE that people are not able to make decisions and that a huge amount of time is wasted.  How can the organisation be made more efficient?  We do not seem to have done any major work on that issue in the past few years.<\/p><p> Deputy Donnelly referred to the sudden increase in figures in the past few years.  We are all concerned about this continuing into the future.  If we are planning a 12-month budget, we should be able to plan carefully in order that there will be no overrun.  We have the figures for changing demographics and the number of people with disabilities.  We also have the figures for the huge numbers of elderly parents looking after people with disabilities, which will mean a huge demand on services in the next few years.  Another issue I encounter a great deal is the lack of access to respite care for carers once their children with disabilities reach 18 years of age.  We have known for ten years how many are in that cohort and would reach the age of 18 years, but no planning seems to have been done to make provision for them.  These are issues about which I am concerned.<\/p><p> Mr. Mulvany referred to savings in healthcare organisations and hospital groups of &euro;37 million under the value improvement programme.  Can we have detailed figures for savings within the HSE?  I have not seen a huge amount in savings.  It is easy to impose savings on healthcare groups and voluntary organisations by simply setting a budget and providing it.  However, I do not see the same effort being made to make savings in sections of the HSE.  It is an issue about which I am concerned.  There are over 2,500 organisations which rely on HSE funding.  While it is very easy for the HSE to dictate and important that we get value for money from these organisations, the same set of rules does not appear to apply to internal sections of the HSE.  I seek clarification in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#P01900","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I will take the Senator's questions in reverse order.  On the figure of &euro;37 million in savings, when I refer to community healthcare organisations and hospital groups, I mean the HSE.  The community health care organisations are part of the statutory HSE, of which hospital groups are also part, albeit 16 involve large voluntary hospitals which are funded under section 38.  The figure of &euro;37 million is across the HSE and some of it will also be across certain voluntary organisations.<\/p> <p>  With reference to administration, planning and ICT, the HSE has set out an e-health Ireland strategy which is very clear on how to develop and invest in both clinical and non-clinical ICT, with a view to obtaining all of the returns from it, including efficiencies.  That plan is in place and we are making progress with the Department's assistance in seeking to have it funded.  It was announced not that long ago that there would be an EIB loan to assist in its funding.  There is a long-term ICT plan.  We also prepare three-year corporate plans.  It is not just about relying on the annual service plan, albeit that is also in place.  It is probably fair to say we do not yet have a single overarching plan for the workforce setting out specifically where we want to go with administration and management staff.  That is something that needs to be closed.  However, I do not accept that it is simply a matter of he who shouts the loudest.  We must remember that administrative staff categories include everyone from the grade 3 personnel one meets at reception in one's clinic all the way up to people at my level and some staff we would otherwise count as technical or professional, including engineers, HR staff and accountants.  It is not just all senior general managers, albeit the system, clearly, must be managed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":425,"content":"<p>The argument was put to me about additional administrative staff in clinics.

Certainly, we can set out the movement at all grades in the area of administration, if that would be of help.<\/p> <p>  On the State Claims Agency, I am not for one minute suggesting it does not predict its costs.  Those costs can be somewhat difficult to predict and, depending on which actuarial assumptions are used, can vary a great deal.  There were periods during which there was uncertainty about some costs.  The fundamental issue with the State Claims Agency which is a part of the NTMA concerns when the Government will fund the costs which arise.  Will they be funded at the start of the year or through the Supplementary Estimates process?  It is accepted that it is a cost which is funded by central government.  In other cases the equivalent amount would not actually be included in the main operational Vote.  For example, the figure for public sector pensions might not be included in the main operational Vote.  In the health service they just are.<\/p> <p>  On the lack of capacity to make decisions, I do not have the details of the specific example given by the Senator, but I am not saying it did not occur.

At its high point, the acute hospital income from private insurance was about &euro;630 million.  That will be less for last year.  We have not closed that gap and the service planning process will have to try to do so.  However, to be clear, if we have a &euro;100 million gap in that area and we close that, that represents a &euro;100 million cost that must come from elsewhere or money that cannot be invested in something else.  That gap has not been closed.  That is the Sl&aacute;intecare recommendation and the implications are more complex and broader than simply finding the &euro;600 million.  We will let the group examine that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":451,"content":"<p>As it happens, I must go to the Chamber to ask a question on the same issue.  I am somewhat concerned about some of the answers.  It is bad budgeting practice to repeatedly fall short of the target on either side, unless there is some serious explanation.  Take the PCRS.  Drug costs can and will impact.  We need a counterbalance such as a reduction in the costs through the things this committee has discussed so many times, such as the power of European Union as a procurement lever.  Over the course of any year, drugs come on the market and cause problems.  There will be patients for whom those drugs are suitable.  A practice should be established whereby an immediate assessment is done as to how the budget will be affected, rather than waiting until the end of the year to see how much of an overrun there is, or if there is a surplus.<\/p> <p>  I have been around the health services for a long time.  I remember the health boards and the overruns during that period.  There were overruns as far back as 2000.  There must be a time when we identify what practice is repeatedly causing this problem, and deal with it.  If we do not deal with it, it goes on forever and in 20 years' time, someone will be sitting here talking about the same thing.  <\/p> <p>  I remember the American politician who spoke of known knowns and unknown unknowns.  At a certain point, we need to know where the particular bodies are buried so that we can navigate our budget accordingly.  Take the issue of finding accommodation for certain people who require it after their parents have passed on.  The HSE deals with that.  Crooksling has the capacity to cater for up to 100 people, yet the HSE wants to close it and is undermining it and slowly strangling it to do so.  That accommodation is already there and there would be no capital costs involved at all.  However, the HSE says it wants a different system in a different place but to what benefit?  I do not know.  I was on the visiting committee of that nursing home many years ago.  It is still structurally sound.  An engineers report might say that is not the case but it is.  We must sometimes dispute the opinions of engineers as well as economists and financial controllers.  However, there is no use in saying on the one hand that we have a budgetary overrun and that we are providing alternative accommodation when we already have accommodation that is built and paid for.  I would like clarification on that.<\/p> <p>  The greater incidence of treatment for an ageing population was raised and I accept that but it must be possible to budget for it accurately.  The information is already there.  Unless there is a particular issue that we are not being told about something must be done.<\/p> <p>  There is a simple way to deal with matters relating to the State Claims Agency.  How are the overruns of its expenditure monitored?  Is this in line with neighbouring jurisdictions?  If not, if they are above or below, then we must ask the reason.<\/p> <p>  Private insurance and providers' reluctance to deal with emergency cases was raised.  I would like to know more on this.  It looks as though the public health sector could be subsidising the private health sector, if we are to assume what I think that means.<\/p> <p>  It must be possible within the public health sector to take a hospital, for instance, and compare it with the private sector.  It must be possible to make a comparison on a like for like basis.  I do not accept that it cannot be done and it is like comparing chalk and cheese or apples and strawberries.  It is possible and needs to be done as a matter of urgency because otherwise we will continue to embarrass ourselves by suggesting that something is wrong that we cannot identify it.<\/p> <p>  My last point relates to my own hobby horse of how the chain of command operates within the health services.  If a consultant wants access to facilities in a theatre or to radiography, for instance, and cannot avail of those services, that represents a loss of money and potential lost revenue.  If one holds up the facilities that are there, and does not use them for any period over a working day, that is a financial loss and a liability on the system.  I would like to see someone identify those blockages once and for all.  They may be explainable and it may be possible to explain them away, but I have not heard anyone do so yet.  I am concerned that we continue on with the same issue year after year, and we are no closer to getting to the bottom of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#S00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":452,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Mulvany or Mr. Desmond care to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#S00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":453,"content":"<p>There are several questions which span both agencies.

For example, I spoke with a senior consultant recently who prescribes very expensive drugs and who produced a paper stating that he could change his way of working and save approximately &euro;5 million on the prescribing that is being done but that he could not get anyone from the Department or the HSE to meet him and take it seriously.  I see examples of savings across the system all the time.  I also see examples of process improvements that would ultimately lead to savings.  For example, clinicians at Tallaght Hospital wanted to introduce a triage room.  Such rooms are part of standard practice in emergency medicine.  It took five years to get the room commissioned, which gives rise to issues regarding patient safety and also funding.  The issues relating to funding arise because there are missed savings in such circumstances.  What is being done to try to tap into the efforts of administrators, doctors, nurses, porters and managers?

The HSE is trying to promote a culture that allows people to interact in respect of some of these issues.  However, an aspect of this is a cultural matter relating to values rather than value for money.  Are the different parts of the team - cleaner, porter or consultant - in a hospital all able to speak frankly to each other?  There is a piece around that and how that is changed over time.  Work is under way on that.  A values and action programme is under way.  It is not about money, it is the overall culture.<\/p> <p>  People have different views about what constitutes a saving.  There are savings that simply take cash out while others are valuable but what they mean is that we can get extra for less than would be the case.  Some of those savings will actually increase the cost.  I take the point that we must pursue the stuff that is safety or quality driven in any event .  That must happen.<\/p> <p>  We are going to continue the value improvement programme.  It is accepted that we need to energise it more.  It is clearly set out in the service plan that this ought to identify additional levels of savings beyond those that our system generates on an ongoing basis throughout country at hospital and ward level and in the community and psychiatry, not all of which we can capture, cost, measure or report.  Part of our system is about continuously making improvements at individual team level.  That is something to be encouraged.  We cannot report on all of that and some of it gets swallowed up because something else happens or costs grow and they are not funded for one or the other.  We have a substantial amount of work to do in the context of trying to develop and promote savings initiatives, but significant savings are already being driven in parts of the health service.  The &euro;60 million we will get this year in value improvement is not insignificant.  It is a problem when we compare it with the overall target.  Hundreds of millions of euro in savings are being delivered by our primary care reimbursement service every year to try to contain drug costs so that we can allow more new drugs in that are needed.  Those savings are built into the base.  Their targets are driven by the base so they do not close any of the gaps.  We would be wrong to say that there is only &euro;60 million worth of savings in clinical service.

I referenced earlier the general funded workforce plan.  When I briefly stepped out of the meeting, I checked the specific one for nurses and midwives.  It has been brought twice to the Workplace Relations Commission and now it is going to the Labour Court.  I emphasise it is the funded workforce plan for 2018 and it is now almost November.  We all know it is not easy to get a date for a Labour Court hearing unless one is about to ground a large number of planes.  Therefore, it is unlikely in this instance.  If we are talking about controlling costs and getting value for money, if we do not have a funded workforce plan for the single biggest grade within the health service at this point in the proceedings, that figure of &euro;346 million was never likely to be achieved, as there is no plan in place for the number of staff and, therefore, there is no capacity to control agency staff numbers, overtime or any of the other steps that have to be taken to make up the shortfall.  Does Mr. Mulvany agree that the funded workforce plan and the workforce plan for all grades, groups and categories should be agreed at some point?

It strikes me there is not a great deal of forward planning going into this process.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the savings figure, was some of it earmarked to be offset by a contribution from the stretch income targets?  We considered those previously and, as I recall, it was brought to our attention by the chief executive of one of the hospital groups - do not quote me on that as I cannot remember exactly who it was but it was stated in a submission that was made to us - that individual hospitals and hospital groups were given targets to collect money from private sources - I assume from health insurers and whatever else - and that stretch targets had been added to those targets, whereby if the target was &euro;5 million it was stretched out by a certain percentage.

I am not talking about the actual charge.  I am talking about stretch income targets, the target versus the figure.  There is a difference.  Mr. Mulvany knows that.  There is a difference between collecting all the money which HSE is obliged to do, and that is separate, but setting a target for the amount of money causes a problem with regard to how the HSE is going to plan, as a bizarre incentive is imposed on public servants to impose a target on other public servants to collect money out of the private sector.  If those stretch income targets are still in place, I would be worried because it is not a prudent way to plan and because of various other reasons that I will not go into here.  If Mr. Mulvany is saying the targets have not changed in the past two years, I can only assume they include the stretch income targets.  We reviewed this less than a year ago and the stretch income targets were included.  If the HSE is aiming to hit a figure of savings and it is massively wide of the mark, which it is, and it is counting in the stretch income targets in that figure, that brings me back to the point that the witnesses have not been able to provide an explanation as to where that figure came from, which is worrying.  If stretch income targets are part of it, is it not time that the HSE acknowledged that it is not working and that it should try to figure out another way to proceed?<\/p> <p>  Various initiatives took place a number of years ago and Professor Drumm was one person who initiated them.  They included having a conversation with staff.  We spent a long number of days in Government Buildings where we were given the use of a room and health service workers came in and talked about the way on-the-ground savings could be achieved.  It was around the time the moratorium on recruitment was imposed.  Much of what we heard were simple changes and how the staff envisaged such simple changes could be made.  I am not talking about the big issues, such as the out-of-control agency staff bill, but some changes that could be achieved at the level of the ward or the primary care centre.  Suggestions were made by staff but they were not followed up on.<\/p> <p>  That might be something the HSE would consider ensuring is followed up in the context of a plan.  If, say, a staff nurse in Letterkenny General Hospital has an idea for the way she would improve the running of a ward, that might not be a feasible consideration as we would all have the idea that if more staff were brought in, we would not have to deal with constant crises, but if she or, say, a porter in Tallaght Hospital has a worthwhile idea, how could they realistically feed that into the organisation and how would it be taken on board?  The top-down approach was tried and, with respect, failed.  Perhaps Mr. Mulvany would reflect on that and consult the representative organisations as many people have good ideas.  The target is quite ambitious.  Mr. Mulvany has just admitted that and he might need all hands to the pump.

It is not as if people should be levying a charge in some way that is a stretch.  Their task is to levy the charge when it is appropriate to do so.  When I said we have not changed the target, I mean the &euro;345 million is not dependent on somebody achieving a stretch target.  If we were to lower the income targets, we would have to find more savings because the income targets and the income that has been raised support the costs of providing the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#X00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":572,"content":"<p>It is not the income targets, it is the stretch target.

This is about the setting of targets and the stretching of those income targets, which creates a perverse incentive for people to prioritise.  I am not suggesting that clinicians do it on any basis other than clinically, but in a situation where there are two people, both at the same level of acuity, and one bed, a perverse incentive has been created by the finance side of the house for people on the other side of the house to give that bed, in that scenario, to the patient who has private health insurance.

It is very simple to figure out what level of our GDP, GNP, GNI, or whatever, is spent.  It is easier to convert and compare accurately.  They say that we are in the top four or five internationally for expenditure per capita.  If the information is not available now, could we please have it?

There have been many decades when we would have been behind that.  I mentioned the &euro;3 billion or &euro;4 billion that we spend on social care and to what extent that is equally reported with other countries.  With some of these measures, one is often measuring total spend on health.  We are well down the league with regard to publicly funded healthcare expenditure versus total healthcare expenditure.  Part of the question is whether we spend too much on health for what we get back.<\/p><p>I refer to two of the most expensive things in a healthcare sector.  The same OECD data - data have to be used carefully - says that we have significantly fewer doctors per 1,000 population than the OECD average.  We rank somewhere around 26 out of 34 on that.  We have significantly fewer hospital beds, which is the single most expensive resource in any healthcare system.  We rank 24 out of 34 on that.  We also have the lowest increase over an eight year period which puts us at 31.  That is using the same OECD data.  I am not saying that means we do not get sufficient resources.  We get more than &euro;15 billion but I am saying that one cannot simply rely on OECD figures to provide the answer.  Again when one looks at the hospitals, the OECD figures say that Ireland had a consistent bed occupancy of 94%.  We are well ahead of the 77% OECD average.  The doctors will tell one that at more than 85% bed occupancy on a consistent basis, one is demonstrating a system that is under stress.  That is in the Department's capacity review document and that is a recipe for both efficiency, cost, and potential quality issues.  That is all OECD data.  Is it consistent?  I do not know.  It is not simple to settle that question.  I agree with Deputy Durkan that it is something that a proper body, such as the ESRI, if it is not doing it already, should seek to answer.  Having tried for a number of years, I can tell members it is not a straight forward thing to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#Y03400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":608,"content":"<p>If it is not a straightforward thing to do, that flags it is impossible to do and that we can never do it and yet everybody else does it.  How have we come to a situation where we have fewer hospital beds per 1,000 population than most European countries?  Experts, including medical experts, have told us that we have too many hospital beds and we have been told that for a number of years.  The Chairman knows that as well as I do.  I remember being involved in the initial stages of planning for a hospital some years ago.  I thought at the time that we did not need beds given the expert opinion that was made available.  I had to make a decision that that was not going to work and I was right.<\/p> <p>  It is all very well telling mere D&aacute;il Deputies that this is not comparing like with like, that it is apples and oranges and that it is very difficult to solve it.  As long as we keep on that route, we will never provide a health service that is efficient, effective and accessible.  We need to drill down into the issues, find out where the problem exists, make the comparisons and solve the issues.<\/p> <p>  What is regularly trotted out is the demographics and the significant increase in the number of older people.  I am not sensitive about this topic, although the Chairman may think I am.  Nobody ever mentions the significant increase in the younger population, which is at least comparable and counter-balances the increase in the older population.  If somebody tells me there is no increase in the young population, that person is wrong.  One does not have to go into the statistics to find out that information because it is readily available.  We have a growing young population because of the cohort of people who returned to this country or came into the country.  They are counter-balancing in a positive way the expenditure on health.<\/p> <p>  Somebody needs to tell us what the situation is, instead of making excuses and saying this is the cause of all our problems.  It is not.  Drugs are an issue that needs to be dealt with effectively now.  On the question on the State Claims Agency claims, I do not accept the notion that we cannot compare like with like in that regard.  It is quite simple to check with the neighbouring jurisdictions.  There are norms and averages.  We can get those averages, even if we have to do it ourselves, and find out exactly how they have lower costs than we have.  What is the cause of the problem?  Deputy O'Connell referred to that matter as well.<\/p> <p>  I note the growth in staff numbers following the lifting of the moratorium.  If we are to get to where we can provide a reasonable health service, we have to pay staff and so on.  We accept all that but there are other issues that are virtually a diversionary tactic in that they just come up.  I remember them from when I was on a health board years ago.  The same old story would come up time and again.  I do not accept that.<\/p> <p>  My final point is on emergency residential places.  I will never understand why it is more efficient and effective to demolish a building.  Over the past number of years several older buildings were demolished in this city and replaced with newer buildings.  These new buildings are no more efficient and, in some case, the structures are worse.<\/p> <p>  Let us not forget that a building was leased for the Department of Health for a period of time during which it was not occupied.  I know how that can happen but we are back to the old story of projections.  It should not happen.  If anybody in  business rented a building in anticipation of being in it by a particular time, that is the only time for which the person will pay.  That person will not rent a building and keep it until such time as her or she has enough money to pay for it.  It does not work that way.  We need to break down the barriers that are there.  <\/p> <p>  I believe we are told what happens to be available at the time and we walk away.  At a certain time, one gets tired of walking away.  If one has been around for a long time, one remembers all these things and hearing the same points made.  One asks oneself where did I hear that before?  Why do I not want to hear it again?  It is because it does not work and it does not tally.  The health service is an organisation which has a significant budget and we need to deal with such situations as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#Z00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":609,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Durkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#Z00300","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":610,"content":"<p>I will respond to a number of factual points raised by Deputy Durkan.

That is clearly a priority, as is Sl&aacute;intecare, among the reform processes we have under way.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the Department's headquarters, the OPW appeared before a committee recently and gave the explanation on that process.  It is the appropriate agency to do that because it was responsible for delivering that building for the Department.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan made a very fair point on the increasing number of younger people versus the increasing number of older people.  Absolutely, the ageing population brings with it the great benefits of what the health sector has achieved in recent years with longevity but that longevity brings certain costs, as we have explained.  With younger people, the shift towards a primary care delivery and care in the community, which is underpinned and reaffirmed by Sl&aacute;intecare, has to be the basis on which we try to develop a service that is closer to people in the community and prevents another generation of people moving into services which are more costly and not appropriate.

The Deputy is correct in that Ireland has a comparatively younger population but it is ageing faster than other European Union countries.

I look forward to working with the joint committee in a spirit of accountability, openness and transparency and a way that will improve the policing service we provide for society.  I have supplied written comments, on which I want to enlarge somewhat.  One of the themes on which I will pick up is how policing is changing, as identified by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  Policing is moving towards dealing with harm and vulnerability, as set out clearly by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  It is a recognised phenomenon across Europe.  The commission has set out the next steps for us as an organisation.  It will be a roadmap for us in the next three to five years for the policing service we will provide.  Within it, we need to have an understanding of the demands placed on us, how they might change in the next three to five years and how we will deploy our resources and what they will look like in terms of the people we employ and their skills to deliver a policing service.  These are big management problems, with which many police services are wrestling, but there are two particular strengths we have which I should highlight in the context of how policing is changing.  The first is that we still retain a strong link with local communities.  That has been very evident to me and we wish to retain and strengthen it.  As I visited Garda stations and offices throughout the country, I met high quality people.  It is clear from our own cultural audit that they, too, are fully committed to providing an excellent policing service for the people of Ireland and are determined to do so.<\/p> <p>  I have arrived against the backdrop of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, our own modernisation and renewal programme and cultural audit, as well as the report of the Charleton tribunal of two weeks ago and the tribunal's recommendations.  The first three documents set out what has to be done and a roadmap for how that work should be taken on.  I have read the Charleton tribunal's report and the last few pages, in particular, seem to have been written directly for me.  They are a clarion call for action.  We will take action to reform the policing service provided and reassure the people of Ireland that we are here to protect them and do our very best for them as public servants and that we are fully determined to do so.<\/p> <p>  Compared with any of my contemporaries, I am fortunate that I have arrived at a time of investment.  There is considerable investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is an organisation that is growing, which is almost unique among law enforcement agencies.  There is a responsibility on me and the rest of the organisation to use these resources efficiently and effectively and in such a way that will also promote confidence in the policing service we provide and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is important in the behaviours we exhibit both inside and outside the organisation.  At every opportunity I emphasise the importance of the code of ethics.  It is a living document which is there to guide us on the behaviours we expect internally but, more importantly, the public expects of us and which we must live and demonstrate to them every single day.<\/p> <p>  For my part, I am motivated by public service.  Policing is my public service.  I applied and have been appointed.  I am here to serve and lead An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the next stage of its development, all with a view to making sure we are doing our very best to protect the people of Ireland, the vulnerable in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#C00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":626,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Garda Commissioner on his appointment.

To pick one, there is a concentration on district policing.  We hope that district policing provides a local, community-focused service to the public but within a divisional structure.  A division should be self-sufficient for the majority of what it has to do.  Obviously at times the whole service may have to come in behind a district to assist it with big public events or a series of criminal outrages for instance, but by and large a division should be self-sufficient and should have sufficient resources so that the divisional commander and the chief superintendent have enough resources to provide a locally tailored service to the public.  That would be based on the district model but the divisions should be autonomous in terms of the provision of the local policing service.  They should have their own human resources, HR, and financial support for example, but all within a corporate framework.  If I set the corporate framework for how we go about our business it will then be for the divisional commanders, the chief superintendents and their staff to deliver on the service with all of the local characteristics that people will require.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":629,"content":"<p>Are there any other areas where the Commissioner would have that type of nuance or variation in interpretation compared to the report?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#D00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":630,"content":"<p>We have picked out small nuances only.

Within the roadmap of the report there is a very strong emphasis on community policing.  I am interested in getting some concrete examples from the Commissioner.  My personal experience with this is that community policing delivered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works very well occasionally.  It works very well because somebody comes in, he or she is enthusiastic, is on the ground and working with the community but it is never envisaged as a career or a long-term posting.  That garda moves on and gets promotion.  It is the type of job that the young man or woman coming from Templemore does and then moves on from and therefore it is stop-start.  A gap arises when they move on and the post is not filled or it gets diverted.  Under the proposal that is there, the whole force re-emphasises and refocuses on community policing.  How does the Commissioner envisage that we would be changing structures in a more concrete manner to deliver that, as distinct from the way in which most communities would feel that it works at the moment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#D00400","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":632,"content":"<p>Community policing will undoubtedly be the ethos of the organisation but also, as the Deputy has said, we have to deliver on this structurally as well.  The particular characteristic of the service that we must deliver is that we have both urban and rural areas where there is deprivation, high crime and the problems attendant with those such as drug abuse, alcohol abuse and mental health issues - all of which require a multi-agency response.  Community policing should play its part there and in effect, the garda&iacute; who engage in that become specialists and should be regarded as such because skills are needed in order to work with other agencies and there are also community problem solving skills.  It is not just a post that a garda will fill for a period of time.  It is specialism but it depends on relationships as well.<\/p> <p>  The rural areas are somewhat different because there will be a more hybrid model.  Garda&iacute; in rural areas will not only have that problem solving, community responsibility, they will also have a response capability.  We are still working on this but I envisage dedicated community policing teams built up against the need that we see in critical areas where those interventions can make a real impact.  That can be clearly seen in urban areas and in areas of deprivation.  Those areas have a high demand for our services but a high demand for other services as well.  The commission of policing takes that on further in terms of widening the definition of policing and widening the scope for who may engage in policing.  Much of that is down to ensuring that the State's energies are focused on the right places and towards the right people at the right time.  There are areas and individuals with high demand and we need to collectively work together to see how we can best address that to improve the quality of their lives, along with the quality of the lives of the people who live around them and community policing is a big piece of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I have another question linking to that if the Chair will indulge me.  In the police service in which the Commissioner formerly served there was an extensive programme of the closing of police stations.  There is obviously a very contentious issue around the closing or potential reopening of Garda stations.  In the context of refocusing on communities, both in urban and rural areas and in the context of delivering the type of service the Commissioner described, what is his view on the need for additional Garda stations, the locations in which they might be needed, whether we need to radically increase the number of Garda stations and whether that type of community policing that the Commissioner described can be delivered with the Garda station profile that we have at the moment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#D00600","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":634,"content":"<p>I have not come to a final conclusion on that.  I certainly do not feel any particular pressure to close stations.  I should retain the stations that I have and then examine what is going on in terms of the demand they are meeting and the reassurance they are providing as well.  People take comfort from having a Garda station in their location and there is no doubt about that but I have to look towards where the new demands are and where the issues are in respect of which the intervention of the Garda will make a difference.  It also comes down to our resources and how we best use them.  I refer to my earlier comments on the demand that we are dealing with, how that demand is changing and how we are best placed to meet it.  It is not necessarily the case that building new stations and reopening stations is the way to go forward.  We want to be sure that our service is responsive, that people feel that it is approachable and that it is providing a local service.  That is undoubtedly true but at the same time stations are expensive and they draw on the public purse a lot.  I could not make any promises here today that there will be a wholesale reopening of stations because it depends on the need and the demand that it is filling as opposed to just making a promise that we will reopen stations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for his answer and I acknowledge his remarks on investment going into the Garda.

Obviously, where there is a station, there is reassurance for the community in seeing Garda patrols backwards and forwards and it feels there is visibility.  I can look to my last service, in which a lot of closures were driven by economics in keeping police stations open.  I do not feel the same pressure on me because we are in a time of investment.

The cultural audit flagged how committed they were to public service.  There is also the confidence people have in their local garda&iacute;, which is important.  There is probably less confidence in senior management.  It is for me and the rest of the senior leadership team to work on improving the leadership of the organisation.  Therefore, the second piece is that we have strong community contacts.  Beyond that, a process of digitisation and digital investment is required as a lot of time and effort are spent in dealing with paper.  When we talk about demand, it is very difficult in a paper based system to understand entirely what it is as we do not have the statistics we need to understand how much time we are spending on particular calls.  We are moving towards computer aided despatch, a system which will give us far more information on what we are spending our time on in patrolling and responding to incidents.  I require a lot more information and having a process of digitisation is the way to do it.  Beyond that, there is the training and development of our staff.  There are a lot of online systems coming on-stream that require training, but we also want to increase the focus on the human rights aspects of policing, as well as on the code of ethics and how central it is.  Everyone is undergoing training on the code of ethics and that process will be completed by the end of the year.  It has been a big commitment by the organisation to deliver it.  The people are good, as is the level of public support.  Some of the systems are old and antiquated, but there is a programme to bring them up to speed.  A paper based system in an organisation of our size, given the demands with which we are dealing, is just not sufficient in the 21st century.  That is what we have to concentrate on.<\/p> <p>  Some of the Garda stations I have visited are not of the standard I would expect.  Some look a bit tired and rundown.  Some are crowded and we have had to move outside the core premises and extend into other buildings.

We are staffing that appropriately as we see the threats at this time.<\/p> <p>  There are three areas of concern.  The first is local policing and local reassurance and confidence for people.  I know the Police Service of Northern Ireland is also concerned about this.  People living close to the Border will be worried and will have a fear that their area could be raided from the other side, backwards and forwards, and there is the fear of crime and the travelling criminal crossing the Border.<\/p> <p>  There is also the reality of night life in Derry, where a lot of young people travel across the Border to engage in night life there but there is also attendant crime.  It is about managing those scenarios where a serious crime may be committed in one jurisdiction but the perpetrators are located in the other jurisdiction.  How do we manage the evidential issues that emerge from that?  We want to know how well the European treaties, particularly around criminal justice, are going to withstand Brexit or what will go in their place.<\/p> <p>  Organised crime is the third area of concern.  Any change in trading tariffs gives opportunity for smugglers to make illicit profits or to evade tax or duty.  There is an organised crime element to that and any organised crime element on the Border will also provide some additional element of funding to terrorist groups, dissident republicans in particular.  It has been suggested that they might use this as an emotional driver for their particular campaigns, and we want to avoid anything like that at all.  We want to avoid them being able to use this as a rallying call.  There is a lot of focus on a hard border in terms of the threat of terrorism but there are two other elements as well that are equally important.

Notwithstanding that, I believe that in the vast majority of cases the local garda still enjoys great trust from the people and the people have great faith in him or her.  People want to see more garda&iacute; in their community.<\/p> <p>  This is also a time that has a lot of potential.  While I do not agree with every single recommendation in the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland report, there are many positive elements which can modernise and transform policing.  One of the major priorities in the recommendations was the emphasis on community policing.  I am a big fan of the community policing model.  I may have a slightly contrary view to Deputy Brophy in that I think the model as it is works reasonably well where it is resourced correctly.  Unfortunately, the number of dedicated community garda&iacute; has fallen by about 40% since 2010 or 2011.  That has undermined the model.  Does the Commissioner intend to make policing in the community a core priority?

We will be an organisation that focuses on community policing.  All of us will have a community policing ethos.  I recognise what the Deputy says about local confidence in local garda&iacute;, and I want to build on that and make sure it is enhanced going forward.  One of the routes into that is community policing.  As we work out our new divisional and district structure, an integral part of that will be how we will police with the community in each particular district or division.  There will be a focus on local policing whereby service delivery will be focused on the district.  Part of that will be how we manage the community policing element within a particular district.  The Deputy can have assurance of that.  I have seen the initial plans about what divisions will look like going forward, and that is built into them in terms of how we manage local accountability, local responsiveness and dealing with people's concerns at a local level.  That is a given.<\/p> <p>  Community policing, as was said, will be a specialism in some areas depending on the demand.  We see that in the urban areas.  In rural areas, it may be more of a hybrid model where we will just regard all of our response officers as having a community responsibility but also having to attend calls as well.  I was privileged to be in one of our small towns two weeks ago.  The local guard also answered calls but he knew everybody we spoke to on first name terms and he introduced me to dozens of people.  That is community policing.  Everyone knew him by name and he knew and was able to identify and speak to many individuals.  That is what we want to build on.

There is very good work going on.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the overall question, when dealing with such determined organised crime groups, we must come at it on a number of levels.  One element is community policing.  In effect, organised crime always puts a foot down somewhere and leaves a bad trace in a local community.  In part when I speak of critical neighbourhoods where there is high demand, I mean areas where organised crime gangs may try to find shelter or impose their writ on the local community.  Much of our community policing will be about those areas and undermining, in effect, the legend and story of the gangs.

To a large extent this relates to the decision in July 2017 in which Mr. Justice Treacy found in the High Court in Northern Ireland that Mr. Harris took decisions that were not compliant with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights and frustrated any possibility that there would be an effective and overarching investigation into the Glenanne gang cases.

The Policing Authority has expressed serious concerns that the Garda renewal and modernisation programme is not fit for purpose, and that not only is the pace of reform too slow but that the vehicle set up by the Garda for reform is not delivering.  On 9 August it stated:<\/p><blockquote>If the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not at this juncture pause ... to reconsider in a determined and focused way the end to which its efforts and resources are being directed, as well as what key enablers and levers it needs to achieve that change, then it is the authority's view that a continuation of the current activity and effort, however well-intentioned, will not deliver the fundamental reform envisaged.<\/blockquote> <p>Essentially, this questions whether the Garda is properly set up with the vehicle it set out to deliver reform, both in terms of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate reports that are a few years old now and the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland document.

These are big information technology projects that are being landed into a public organisation with multiple complex systems.  It would be a challenge for anybody to deliver.<\/p> <p>  Just looking at the digital strategy, there is much under way.  Beyond that there is a human resources piece, which very much relates to workforce modernisation.  It is a major project as well in terms of expanding the organisation and having the required training, in effect, for every new garda who comes in.  There is training and investment in the individual while Garda staff are brought in to displace others at the front line.  There are many plates spinning.  We need more support in financial and human resources skills and we are working up what that would look like.  It is well recognised within the organisation that we need more expertise.<\/p> <p>  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland has described an end point for us and what the model of policing should be.

While one needs to be realistic about what is in one's way and what problems need to be solved, if one has a clear idea of where one is going, one can be optimistic about what can be done.  It has become clear to us and the Policing Authority what needs to happen to make these changes, acknowledging that it is complex.  We have staff and skills issues to deal with, including training, and we have to look at our own structures and how we deliver policing and at the style of that policing.

My question on this is threefold.  First, what is the Commissioner's understanding of the security responsibilities he has within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Second, how does he respond to concerns expressed by persons such as Michael C.

That vetting, which was under constant renewal, was still in place for me and still live.

What happened is that the Chief Constable provided an assurance in respect of that vetting and, indeed, my vetting certificates were provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a demonstration of that.  The vetting is there to ensure that one is not open to coercion or blackmail or whatever it might be and that there are no issues surrounding one's private life or affiliations which could give rise to concern.  It is a very thorough process, including both financial and private life checks.  I have undergone that vetting process and been subject to it.  One does not do it once, but is subject to it constantly.  There is no issue about the level to which I have been vetted and that was resolved through the normal channels.<\/p> <p>  The obligations I have under the Official Secrets Act here are similar to those I had under the UK's Official Secrets Act.

The tribunal also found that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs a complete turnaround in its attitude which must be led by senior management.  I ask the Commissioner to respond to that.

People were really shocked at the strength of the finding against the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, and the fact that someone in his position could be responsible for a campaign of that nature.  It is vitally important that such behaviour is never repeated and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na becomes an organisation that supports whistleblowers.<\/p> <p>  My final question is on overtime, which I have raised with the Minister for Justice and Equality on a number of occasions.  Mr. Harris has introduced a moratorium or an effective ban on overtime as I understand it, between now and the end of this year.  Any overtime request must now be sanctioned by two of the most senior garda&iacute; in the State.  A similar ban was introduced at Christmas last year but this ban is a much lengthier one.  There is also a reduced budget, I believe, for overtime for 2019.  I recognise that Garda budgets are under severe pressure and that in the abstract, too much is being spent on overtime but that is caused by the very real gaps that exist across a number of districts.  According to replies to various parliamentary questions, most Garda districts are still at or below 2011 staffing levels.  It is because of staffing gaps that districts are relying overtime to deliver essential policing services.  I was canvassing yesterday on the south side of Dublin and two issues were flagged to me in terms of the problems this is causing at an operational level.  Problems arose in Inchicore with an operation that was targeting a number of people involved in what appeared to be racially motivated attacks.  In Drimnagh, a call was made to a Garda station on foot of serious anti-social behaviour but the call was not responded to because there were not adequate numbers of garda&iacute; to safely respond.  The Commissioner will not be aware of the specific details of these incidents and I do not expect him to respond in that regard.  I am merely giving some examples of what was flagged with me.  My question is whether Mr. Harris is confident that the overtime ban will not have a very significant impact on the quality of policing and the ability of garda&iacute; to respond to crime between now and the end of the year, particularly with any potential spike in crime, public order issues, or increases in burglaries that often arise around the Christmas period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#J00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":680,"content":"<p>Overtime is sometimes an emotive topic but it should not be thus.  We received a budget at the start of the year.  We overspent the budget and corrective action had to be taken.  That is my responsibility as Accounting Officer.  This is public money and I have to show good management of it.  There is still per roster, which is every four weeks, approximately &euro;7.2 million to &euro;7.3 million available for overtime, so it is not an absolute moratorium.  We have covered what we believe are essential areas but have kept a small pool in the middle for emergencies or pre-planned operations.  People bid in to my colleague, the deputy commissioner, in terms of releasing overtime funds for those operations.  Regrettably, overtime has grown quite considerably over recent years.  I feel an obligation now to get a rope around it, to understand what the money is being spent on and what we are getting for that overtime.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation and the number of staff hours for policing is growing all the time with each release of individuals from the training college.  I have to think carefully about overtime because it can quickly suck dry the ability of the organisation to be proactive in other areas and to spend money on things like training, equipment and other vital areas.  I am not apologising for the cut in overtime.  I regret if it is having an impact on operations but at the same time, that has not been conveyed to me.  Our managers are living within the overtime that is being provided to them.  It will probably be a feature going forward but we have not finalised the budget for 2019 yet.  Overtime will remain in and around the figures outlined but we will have to manage it going forward.  Hopefully, we will have an overtime budget of over &euro;90 million next year but we can quickly overspend that.  Then overtime starts to suck money out of other projects that we want to push forward and that is not where we want to be.  We need to be managing it because not doing so takes away my ability to do other things which are also very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":681,"content":"<p>I thank the Garda Commissioner for his responses.

I wish the Commissioner well going forward.<\/p> <p>  My first question relates to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland report, which the Commissioner referenced in his opening statement.  Having been in his post for two months now, what is his view of the current policing oversight architecture?  One of the issues raised in the aforementioned report and other reports on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that there are many bodies through which the force is held to account.  The Commissioner has said that public accountability is important to him.  New offices have been proposed, including an independent office of the police commission and a policing and community safety oversight commission.  The Policing Authority, the Garda Inspectorate and GSOC are in the mix already and there is also the potential for a new board.  Where does the Commissioner see this going?  I know that ultimately it is a Government decision as to the architecture surrounding An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but does the Commissioner believe it is too complicated at present?  Would he like to see it simplified, while still upholding the principle of public accountability?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#J00700","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":685,"content":"<p>Undoubtedly, the landscape at the moment is complex.  As a chief officer, I spent a long time - 12 years - being held to account by the Northern Ireland Policing Board in Belfast.  I worked with the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and I was subject to investigation by that office.  I am well used to vigorous and rigorous public accountability and investigation.  That brings a lot of benefits in terms of public confidence and dealing with difficult issues.  It brings an objectivity when dealing with complaints.  It means that the policing service itself is subjective in its view on how to go forward.<\/p> <p>  As I said, I do not want to comment specifically on the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  We will make our views known as part of our commentary to the Government.  We still have the Policing Authority, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.  The responsibilities of those bodies are set out in legislation.  We have to be responsible as we work with them into the future.  I can say without any equivocation that our position is that accountability, independent investigation and oversight are very important for the role we provide and are central not only in the performance of what we do but also in promoting public confidence in what we do.  All this serves as a very useful sounding board and acts as a route for getting the opinions of the public on various matters.  Regardless of what happens, we wish to see rigorous accountability that adds to public confidence in what we do and provides us with good and viable feedback that we can use to improve the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":686,"content":"<p>Mr. Harris has mentioned that public accountability is important.

Obviously, Mr. Harris is here.  There are many channels that facilitate oversight and accountability.  Maybe a private submission will be made to the Government.  My view is that there should be some streamlining so that Mr. Harris is not getting direction from 20 different places and so that oversight can work.  That was something that came out of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.

I know PULSE gets a bad press.  Like any big IT system, it has started to evolve.  PULSE 7.3 will be very different from the version of PULSE that was used several iterations ago.  We can already see that some of the systemic issues that were encountered with earlier editions of PULSE have started to fade away and diminish.  We have put a lot of effort into the quality of our data.  We have a great deal of work to do in that respect.  This is a point of emphasis for me and for the rest of the organisation because the data determine how best we should use our resources.  It has been said to me that PULSE, in itself, is unwieldy and difficult.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as an important organisation that uses PULSE, is always thinking about the next iteration of PULSE and about how we should improve and expand it.  We have other systems coming online.  I think the investigation management system will be of particular assistance.  Reference has been made to computer-aided despatches as well.  The challenge is to get these systems to communicate with one another and start to populate things on through.  These are complex programmes.  It is inevitable that any time we buy a product, we are not the only user of it.  We have to work with others when new editions are coming out and new changes are being made.

All this improves the processes when garda&iacute; are making the decisions they are required to make.  We have done some work to look at how this will extend and roll out.  We have developed a series of apps.  It has been pointed out that PULSE is continuing to adapt to change, to evolve and to become more agile.

It has been assured in those respects.  I do not have a timescale for when we will achieve the point referred to by the Deputy.  We have put our own systems in place.  Certainly, there has been an improvement in data.  The next thing we have to look to is clarity around our crime-counting rules.  The CSO has pointed to that as well.  We have appointed an interim chief data officer, who is an expert in the field, to assist us with what our strategic approach should be and what else we have to do with our systems to ensure the quality of the data.  As I said, data is essential in modern policing.  We have a focus on this.  We want to get to a place where this qualification no longer exists.

There is an emphasis on that.

All I have seen of him has been in the newspapers and on the television.  I am impressed.  Even though the Commissioner says he is not an outsider, he has come from a different part of the country.  I wish him the best.  To me, what I see is what I get.  The Commissioner seems to be a very honest person.  He seems to be a person who wants to get the job done.  What I like about him is that the first point he made was that he had confidence in the force.  It means that the people working under the Commissioner note there is a man coming here and he means business.<\/p> <p>  One of the biggest challenges the Commissioner mentioned from day one when he got the job was the Border after Brexit.  Coming from the Dundalk area, I am aware the Border plays a big part in the life of the community.  As an ex-member of the 27th Battalion in Dundalk, an Army man, I know what it is like to patrol the 34 Border crossings from Cullaville to Omeath.  During the troubled time, it was not a nice time to be involved.  We also have a lot of illicit trade there at present.  I refer to the fuel smuggling, the cigarettes and everything else.  It is just not a nice time.<\/p> <p>  I am a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  I spent the past two days in London and the main topic was Brexit.  The British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, has said that she has 95% of Brexit sorted out.  The last 5% is the Border.  The Taoiseach has said that if the Border situation is not sorted out, violence will return.  These are statements that we do not want to hear.  The bottom line is that it is important that the Commissioner has a plan of action.<\/p> <p>  I have been very lucky in recent months.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, visited Dundalk recently and met Superintendent Gerard Curley.  I would like to record that I find Superintendent Curley approachable, honest and upfront.  In fairness, he gives the Garda a good name in the area.<\/p> <p>  We visited Dundalk Garda station.  Given the amount of stuff they are taking in and the level of investigation they are doing, my main concern about the Garda station is that there does not seem to be an inch of space left.  They are doing a good job.  I can see a presence of the Garda on the beat, which is good there.<\/p> <p>  We also visited Dromad Garda station, which is a prefab building at present.

We have to provide a service that protects people, prevents the further growth of organised crime, and, in fact, erodes such crime, but which also deals with the threat that there may be of terrorism as well.  We are not sure how Brexit will work out.  We are not sure of the drivers that there may be behind any of those issues, but certainly we have identified properly the concerns of the local population and how we should address those.  We emphasise that because in many ways people's local concerns about robbery, very bad driving or anti-social behaviour through bad driving, etc. are somewhat missed in the big political debates around Brexit, but those are of concern to us.  We will be there for the local communities.<\/p> <p>  In terms of organised crime and terrorism, we will be watching those very closely.  We will be in a position to react should the climate change in terms of the threat posed by either of those, but we are particularly concerned in respect of how organised crime will use the difference in tax tariffs, as I have said, to try to build up revenue.  We will work with other partners in respect of that.  Two weeks from now, we have the annual cross-Border organised crime conference.  That always has a focus on the various forms of criminality that we see right across the island of Ireland, not only smuggling but also other areas of organised crime that we can co-operate on, and not only in the Border area.  I am meeting the Chief Constable before that to agree further areas that we can develop.  It is incumbent on us at these times of uncertainty to do our utmost to reach out to our neighbouring law enforcement agency to assure to the best of our ability that we are ahead of the game even though we are not quite sure exactly what shape the game will be, which is part of the problem here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#P01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":781,"content":"<p>I want to talk about resources.

I have no intentions here of slagging off anybody.  What is most important here to me is peace and working together.<\/p> <p>  I am a bit concerned about resources.

The Commissioner mentioned getting the paperwork sorted out.  Will he elaborate on the resources, especially this commitment on the 4,000 civilians?<\/p> <p>  In Dundalk - the reason I mention Dundalk is it is the best example for me because it is the area I am from, but I am sure this happens in all the other Border towns as well - they seem to be short a few Garda cars.  Living close to a motorway, there are many pluses but there are also many negatives.  As garda&iacute; tell me, people from the other jurisdiction come in, rob and get back on the motorway, and it is difficult to monitor the motorway.  As I stated earlier, it is important that we get these resources.<\/p> <p>  The Commissioner mentioned promotions.  He mentioned 100 or so sergeants getting promoted.  In Dundalk, there are six vacancies for sergeants.  As the Commissioner will be aware, it is important to have the more experienced people in the Border area or in certain other areas.  It is important that we have the proper resources there.  Will the Commissioner elaborate?

Similarly, next year, our plans are around a particularly big recruitment of Garda staff who will displace officer members out to operational duty, but we will also have a growth next year in terms of Garda officers.  That is a very strong position to be in.  While there is an issue around the money for this, and as that is all being worked through I cannot give the precise figures, this time next year we will be many hundreds ahead in our overall headcount, so that is positive.<\/p> <p>  In terms of promotions, I will have to inquire about the specific situation in Dundalk.

I presume this is not only looking ahead but includes historical inquiries.  Mr. Harris has alluded to a number of ongoing murder inquiries and we wish those well.  There was an earlier reference to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings on 17 May 1974, a day that I will never forget.  With no reference to a hierarchy of victimhood, it was the single greatest atrocity through all the years of conflict we have known on this island in relatively recent times.  The Houses of the Oireachtas, this Parliament, have on three occasions unanimously passed motions appealing for full co-operation with the appointed inquirers into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.<\/p><p>We have appealed to the British Government and its agencies to co-operate fully in the provision of all documentation, information and files relevant to the respective inquiries into those matters that took place north of the Border, and elsewhere if that be the case.  Deputy Commissioner Twomey responded earlier to one of my colleague's inquiries on this particular matter.  The Commissioner himself earlier indicated a willingness to meet victims and the representatives of victims.  In this particular instance, that is the Justice for the Forgotten organisation, heroically led by a lady called Ms Margaret Irwin.  Will the Commissioner facilitate an opportunity to meet Ms Irwin and with victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the survivors and bereaved families?  There were 33 deaths in those bombings.  <br\/><br\/>Commissioner Harris is unquestionably highly qualified for the position he has undertaken.  His experience is a significant factor in that.  Can the Commissioner, because of his previous roles, responsibilities and exposure, bring something more to the call, the wish and the cry for justice?  Despite the passage of time since 1974, here we are heading for 44 years later and that cry for truth and justice in respect of those particular atrocities has not faded.  Can the Commissioner, given his experience, knowledge, contacts, communications <i>et al.<\/i>, offer any hope for a better position than maintains currently?  As Deputy Commissioner Twomey indicated, this is not an area where there has been a flow of communications.

Commissioner Harris was talking about internal communications in the first instance as a priority.  With no specific reference, I have to say as Chair of this committee that I hope communications with the committee will also improve in the future.  There have been inordinate delays in responses to specific questions this committee has posed to former holders of the post of Garda Commissioner.  I am saying this on behalf of all of those present and all those elected members who make up this committee.  It has vexed us in the past and it is unnecessary.  I would greatly appreciate a significant improvement in that area.<\/p> <p>  My final question is on something that came up only last week.  We met with Assistant Commissioners Leahy and Finn and Commissioner Harris's former colleague, Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd.  They were before us in these very seats.  We talked about the importance of partnership in addressing issues that very often present almost wholly and solely to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am speaking about areas such as mental health and, as the Commissioner referred to earlier, youth crime and reducing recidivism.  It came out in the engagement last week that there might be - this might be a point of opinion - a better degree of interaction and co-operation between the different agencies north of the Border than may be the case here.  <\/p> <p>  That may be a moot point and perhaps the Commissioner might have a different view.  That is neither here nor there.  The point is that we need to see that level of co-operation across the board.  As elected public representatives, we are very much aware that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na find themselves having to deal with situations that present that are not their primary responsibility in respect of community safety.  I refer particularly to the area of mental health.  Some of the difficulties relate to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being a 24-7 hour organisation.  Some of the other services concerned are not and that is a huge problem.  <\/p> <p>  Even in my years of public service, I have had to strive to find where one can get help in a given situation after 5 p.m. in the evening and at weekends when, very often, these problems present.  It is an important area for the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and societally.  I would like to conclude by asking the Commissioner to elaborate on building this interaction perhaps in a more structured way.  I know it is early days for the Commissioner, and I do not mean to put him on the spot.  It is, however, an area he has reflected on.  I welcome that and I would like to underscore the importance of it.  Could he offer any additional commentary on this important area? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#S00700","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":811,"content":"<p>I will address that last point but I will start with the Chair's first point on communication.  As I said at the start and in my comments as well, I want to have open and transparent communication with the committee.<\/p><p>I was struck by Senator Conway's remarks.  He asked me to identify what issues I have seen in the organisation.  As I see them and as they crystallise, the committee, along with the Policing Authority, will be briefed properly on those.  I also noted his comments about the expedition of correspondence and reports.  In terms of collaboration, the commission is very strident about this.  It talks about widening the definition of policing, how the policing mission is changing and about harm.  The commission makes specific recommendations on Departments working together and crisis intervention teams but also An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na working together with co-located social service and healthcare professionals.<\/p><p> I think we have a different vision for what the service to the public will look like going forward but underpinning that, we need to have the correct organisational strategies in place with our partners, and we also need to resolve the issues around appropriate information sharing as well.  Undoubtedly, more of our time is being spent dealing with mental health issues but, increasingly, our work also involves dealing with issues concerning drink and drug addiction.  Crimes against the vulnerable also seem to be increasing.  Certainly, reports to that effect are increasing as well.  That brings us in contact with our partners to have a more holistic and victim-centred approach to individuals and the dire circumstances in which they find themselves.

I thank the joint committee for the opportunity to address it on the matter of safety of the school transport fleet.<\/p> <p>  The responsibilities of the Road Safety Authority in respect of buses are confined to implementing and enforcing particular regulations for roadworthiness, drivers' hours, tachograph, operator licensing and driver certificate of professional competence.  We also provide high-quality and reliable information to inform decision making, positive development and so on, and we collaborate with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other State agencies to improve enforcement and advocate improved road safety.  From an institutional perspective, the school transport scheme is operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p>The institutional, funding and contractual arrangements for delivering school transport, including services for children with special needs, are matters between the Department of Education and Skills and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Aside from the Bus &Eacute;ireann transport scheme, there are also instances where school transport services are delivered through a private arrangement with parents or schools outside of the Department of Education and Skills scheme.<\/p><p> From a large public service vehicle licensing perspective, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the National Transport Authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na each administer particular regulatory functions in respect of passenger vehicles.  The role of the enforcement unit in the Road Safety Authority is to check the roadworthiness condition of buses at the side of the road in conjunction with the Garda and to act in an advisory capacity to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by providing mechanical and expert assistance where required.  In addition, we conduct inspections at operator premises to verify compliance with maintenance obligations for vehicles, driver and operator compliance with tachograph and driver hours and operator licensing as well as driver certificate of professional competence checks at the roadside and in premises.<\/p><p> RSA data for roadworthiness relates to buses generally rather than specifically buses involved with school transport because there is an overlap.  We have set out in table 1, which is before the committee, the results of the past four quarters in compliance rates and compliance at first visit at roadside and during premises inspections.  Committee members can see that for the year from July 2017 to the end of June 2018 there were 873 school bus inspections at the roadside.  This resulted in an average compliance rate, excluding minor items, of 68%.  Of the 873 inspections, 268 buses or 30% had a major defect and a further 37 buses or 4.3% were deemed to be dangerously defective.  These roadside inspections involve a visual examination of the vehicle without the use of equipment.  The most common defects detected related to tyres, brake lights and steering leakages.  In the same period, we undertook over 1,063 premises inspections looking at maintenance obligations and their compliance.  The average compliance on the first visit in these instances was 52% and this increased to over 63% at a follow-up inspection.  This compliance data is not indicative, and should not be taken as reflective, of compliance of the national fleet.  Rather it reflects our enforcement findings derived from applying a risk-based approach.  Effectively, we go after the riskier operators in cases where we deem vehicles require further attention.<\/p><p> In the determination of defects detected during inspections our inspectors use the EU classification of defects.  Under the EU classification a major defect is one that may prejudice the safety of the vehicle, one that has an impact on the environment, one that puts other road users at risk or where other significant non-compliance issues are at hand.  A dangerous defect is one constituting a direct and immediate risk to road safety or having a direct impact on the environment such that the vehicle should not be used on the road in any circumstances.  All our vehicle inspectors undertaking inspections are qualified mechanics and undertake continuing professional development.<\/p><p> In developing our strategic approach to enforcement we have a combination of regulatory tools to promote and encourage operators and drivers to improve compliance with legislation.  The efficiency of these tools is kept under constant review and some new instruments may be needed particularly in respect of options for fixed charges, which must be effective and dissuasive.  The tools available to us aim to put road safety first and encourage operators to apply good safety practices in their day-to-day activities.  Such practices include walk-around checks, regular preventative maintenance and other measures to prevent collisions and incidents where vehicles breakdown and cause delays at the roadside.<\/p><p> A key part of this strategy is the application of a risk-based enforcement approach, as I have already mentioned.  This operates at the roadside and at operator premises.  Effectively, this means we are targeting those operators thought to be most at risk of non-compliance based on previous encounters and encounters based on the annual check.  I have put together a table of the measures we operate in our toolbox with other stakeholders, including the Garda, the NTA, the Department of Education and Skills and the Health and Safety Authority.  By applying this risk-based approach, compliant operators are inconvenienced to the least extent possible and thus our scarce enforcement resources are used where they are most needed.  We are not stopping compliant operators on the roadside needlessly.  We apply a risk-based approach in line with European and international best practice.  Where defects are found in the course of roadside inspections, our inspectors, in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, may take steps taking account of the severity and nature of the defect.  The steps may include taking the vehicle off the road, requiring the operator to present the vehicle for an immediate commercial vehicle roadworthiness test or requesting evidence of repairs or potentially required repairs to be completed at the roadside before we permit the vehicle to continue on its journey.  Our inspectors highlight any major or dangerous defects detected to the garda attending the inspection so that consideration can be given to issuing a fixed charge or taking a prosecution against the vehicle operator concerned.  Issuing of fixed charges is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> Our testing data show over 14,057 buses were tested under our commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing regime during the period from 1 July 2017 to end June 2018.  The average pass rate of the vehicles was 59%.  This shows an improved trend but it is disquieting that during this period 307 buses or 2.2% were identified as being so defective as to be deemed to be dangerously defective.  Our data show that the older the bus, the higher the fail rate at the annual test.  Hence, the importance of ensuring a proper and adequate preventative maintenance regime is in place for school vehicles.<\/p><p> It is evident from the number of dangerously defective vehicles detected at the annual test that there are several unscrupulous operators who fail continually carry out preventative maintenance.  This is a systematic failure by the owners concerned.  It is unacceptable practice and clearly a blatant disregard for road traffic law.  It also reflects a failure to appreciate the potentially adverse road safety effects for the general public of using such a vehicle.  Operators have a clear obligation to ensure vehicles being used on the public road are roadworthy at all times and not only for the annual test.  It is an offence to use an unroadworthy vehicle on the public road.  We take a stepped approach to enforcement involving an advisory approach first of all followed by other enforcement tools such as direction notices.  That opens up the possibility of prosecution in cases of continued failure to comply with the legal obligation.  In the vast majority of cases operators respond positively but the authority will not hesitate to initiate proceedings in circumstances where there is evidence of continuing non-compliance.<\/p><p> We have continuously reviewed the measures we use to improve compliance.  I have set out eight such measures for the committee.  These include direct awareness campaigns on the importance of roadworthiness and preventative maintenance.  We have specific programmes on social media as part of the overall back-to-school awareness campaign.  We focus on those directly hiring buses, whether they are parents or young people.  We encourage them to seek assurance from the operator concerned about compliance and assurance that the operator is compliant with road transport law, including commercial vehicle roadworthiness law.  We have a continued high level of roadside roadworthiness enforcement.  We operate on a multiagency basis, including with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have continued enforcement at the premises.  Enforcement is targeted at those who we believe to be higher-risk.  We use this to the maximum effect by using our commercial vehicle operator risk indicator.  We have an enforcement presence in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to check the roadworthiness at key events, for example, at concerts and popular tourist destinations.  We have continued engagement with Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Department of Education and Skills to ensure all buses operating under the transport scheme are fully compliant with all relevant road transport and traffic law.<\/p><p> Arising from this engagement the RSA understands that Bus &Eacute;ireann has updated the tendering process for the school transport scheme and now requires all bus contractors to submit a detailed questionnaire that includes specific questions regarding that operator&rsquo;s maintenance regime.  It has also updated the tendering process to a centralised model rather than being completed by local and regional offices, which Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised should bring greater standardisation and consistency in the procurement of school bus services.  We have engaged with the road transport operator licensing unit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to agree a formal process for sharing of information by RSA with the road transport operator licensing unit.  This information may be useful to the Department in the ongoing work in the area of operator licensing monitoring.<\/p><p> Bus transport is generally recognised as being one of the safest modes of surface transportation.  The national bus fleet provides passengers with remarkably safe travel compared with other road vehicles.  The children and students who use buses every day to travel to school or other venues, either through the school transport scheme or other privately operated services, are precious cargo and parents, children and students deserve the safest possible transport system.  Every day parents and guardians put their trust in bus operators and drivers to get their children to and from school or other activities.  This is a heavy responsibility and one that the authority, as well as other agencies and bus operators and drivers, must take seriously.  We all remember the tragedies of the Kentstown and Clara crashes in 2005 and 2006, respectively, where young students were killed arising from issues relating to bus safety and maintenance.<\/p><p> Bus safety is a key part of our overall commitment to road safety and operators have specific responsibilities under road traffic legislation to operate safely and to use buses that are roadworthy all the time and not just on the first day of school and the day of the annual test.  The majority of school bus operators take their responsibilities seriously and implement good practices in respect of the maintenance and roadworthy condition of their vehicles but there is no room for complacency.  The authority encourages the public to tell it about any concerns they have about the standard of roadworthiness of buses.  Despite high standards for safety and statistics that indicate bus collisions are rare in Ireland, any collision or incident involving any bus is a cause for concern, whether the incident is a minor one or a more serious event resulting in injuries or fatalities.<\/p><p> We and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are working closely to improve bus operator compliance.  We will be continuing our enforcement campaign and making use of new powers available to Road Safety Authority vehicle inspectors to prohibit, detain, immobilise and seize dangerously defective vehicles.  Finally, the Road Safety Authority is dedicated to promoting improved standards of bus roadworthiness and improving overall compliance within the bus sector by collaborating with other agencies and stakeholders to achieve that objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018102400002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Moyagh Murdock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540369800,"counter":830,"content":"<p>I have a question on the statistics in the presentation.

We have to have regard to this because operators are entitled to have their good name with regard to how they conduct business.

That is fine.<\/p><p>Ms Murdock said there were 873 bus inspections carried out at the roadside and it was discovered that 268 vehicles had major defects and 4.3%, or 37 vehicles, were deemed to be dangerously defective.

That needs to be explained.<\/p><p>An article in today's edition of the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>states,<i><\/i>&quot;It is evident from the number of dangerously defective vehicles detected at the annual test that there were some unscrupulous operators who are failing to continually carry out preventative maintenance' the statement reads.&quot;  When a car, or a bus or whatever goes in for an NCT or other test, the owner corrects as much as he or she things is wrong with the vehicle.  It is tested and checked.  When it goes through the rigours of a test and something is discovered, the owner goes off and deals with whatever was identified and then comes back.

In the past, bus operators all over the country would have used the annual test as a diagnostic tool.  They would send in their vehicles and see what came out of it.  They would go off and fix what was picked up on that test.  In those days, buses would have come in with a lot of dangerous defects.  We have changed that culture now so that people realise they must keep their vehicle roadworthy at all times of the year.  That is still not hitting home at this point.  We have put in a table of statistics for the roadside compliance rate.  The results are always better in the third quarter than they are as the year goes on because that is the beginning of September when the schools are back.  Meetings would have been held over the summer.  There is a deterioration of the standard of the fleet on the road in the other three quarters of the year.  That is because operators get their vehicles ready tor the back-to-school operation and then take their eyes off the ball and it starts to deteriorate.  The operators then prepare again for their annual test, whatever time of the year that is.  We want them to be roadworthy at all times of the year.<\/p> <p>  There are some unscrupulous operators.  It is a small number, as we explained.  It is about 10%, so there are 90% that are better than that, either very good or there are other things that they can do to improve their performance.  We specify that there are a small number of unscrupulous operators.  We recognise we get great support from the vast majority of operators out there for this approach.  It levels the playing pitch.  There are guys who are cutting corners and putting cheaply kept vehicles on the road and hoping for the best, that it does not get picked up in an annual test.  We want to eradicate that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to someone who brings their vehicle in and it passes the test and fails a day or two later.  There is a concern as to why that would happen.

The RSA is constantly evolving.  It would like to be able to provide an online service for the vast majority of people.  That is dependent on the platform it will operate from and at the moment about 10% of people are eligible to apply online and can do so at any time up to three months from their licence renewal date.  Feedback shows it is going well and about 150 people a day apply.  There could be more applications if people realised they could do it online.  There is a lot of ongoing ICT work to develop it further and integrate the whole journey along the way.  If people get a learner permit or a theory test, we want to make it as seamless as possible for such people, when they eventually do their driving test and get their licence, not to have to come into an office but to be able to get it from the system.  The system will know that he or she has passed the test and the licence will be sent out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018102400002#L04100","nonspeaker":"Ms Moyagh Murdock"},{"type":"speech","time":1540369800,"counter":1085,"content":"<p>It raises concerns for our elderly population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018102400002#L04200","speaker":"1426"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540369800,"counter":1086,"content":"<p>We appreciate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018102400002#L04300","nonspeaker":"Ms Moyagh Murdock"},{"type":"speech","time":1540369800,"counter":1087,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses from the Road Safety Authority for coming here.

As members are aware, we scheduled a second part of a meeting this morning to discuss the recent decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to refuse permission for the proposed College Green plaza.  Deputy Troy in particular asked that we would discuss this.  We invited the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Mr. Owen Keegan, the chief executive officer of Dublin City Council to the meeting.  Ms Anne Graham of the NTA kindly said that she would attend.  Last Friday the committee received correspondence from Mr. Keegan stating he would be unable to attend.  He kindly nominated two staff members from Dublin City Council to attend but stated these individuals would not be in a position to advise the committee on the likely council response to the decision and furthermore, that the city council did not wish to make an opening statement to the committee.  <\/p> <p>  The committee considered this correspondence this morning.  I can speak for all members present and put on record that we view this response from Mr. Keegan as disappointing and unacceptable.  The committee feels there is no choice but to defer this important meeting until such a time as Mr. Keegan makes himself available to come into us, he will be more than welcome, and makes himself available to give a full and substantive response to the committee's concerns.  I have asked the clerk to contact Mr. Keegan to arrange this.  I apologise to Ms Graham and Mr. Hugh Creegan from the NTA for the short notice regarding today's meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018102400002#M00175","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1540369800,"counter":1093,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 11.22 a.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 7 November 2018.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
