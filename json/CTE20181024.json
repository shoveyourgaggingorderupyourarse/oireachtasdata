I look forward to working with the joint committee in a spirit of accountability, openness and transparency and a way that will improve the policing service we provide for society.  I have supplied written comments, on which I want to enlarge somewhat.  One of the themes on which I will pick up is how policing is changing, as identified by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  Policing is moving towards dealing with harm and vulnerability, as set out clearly by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  It is a recognised phenomenon across Europe.  The commission has set out the next steps for us as an organisation.  It will be a roadmap for us in the next three to five years for the policing service we will provide.  Within it, we need to have an understanding of the demands placed on us, how they might change in the next three to five years and how we will deploy our resources and what they will look like in terms of the people we employ and their skills to deliver a policing service.  These are big management problems, with which many police services are wrestling, but there are two particular strengths we have which I should highlight in the context of how policing is changing.  The first is that we still retain a strong link with local communities.  That has been very evident to me and we wish to retain and strengthen it.  As I visited Garda stations and offices throughout the country, I met high quality people.  It is clear from our own cultural audit that they, too, are fully committed to providing an excellent policing service for the people of Ireland and are determined to do so.<\/p> <p>  I have arrived against the backdrop of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, our own modernisation and renewal programme and cultural audit, as well as the report of the Charleton tribunal of two weeks ago and the tribunal's recommendations.  The first three documents set out what has to be done and a roadmap for how that work should be taken on.  I have read the Charleton tribunal's report and the last few pages, in particular, seem to have been written directly for me.  They are a clarion call for action.  We will take action to reform the policing service provided and reassure the people of Ireland that we are here to protect them and do our very best for them as public servants and that we are fully determined to do so.<\/p> <p>  Compared with any of my contemporaries, I am fortunate that I have arrived at a time of investment.  There is considerable investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is an organisation that is growing, which is almost unique among law enforcement agencies.  There is a responsibility on me and the rest of the organisation to use these resources efficiently and effectively and in such a way that will also promote confidence in the policing service we provide and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is important in the behaviours we exhibit both inside and outside the organisation.  At every opportunity I emphasise the importance of the code of ethics.  It is a living document which is there to guide us on the behaviours we expect internally but, more importantly, the public expects of us and which we must live and demonstrate to them every single day.<\/p> <p>  For my part, I am motivated by public service.  Policing is my public service.  I applied and have been appointed.  I am here to serve and lead An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the next stage of its development, all with a view to making sure we are doing our very best to protect the people of Ireland, the vulnerable in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#C00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Garda Commissioner on his appointment.

To pick one, there is a concentration on district policing.  We hope that district policing provides a local, community-focused service to the public but within a divisional structure.  A division should be self-sufficient for the majority of what it has to do.  Obviously at times the whole service may have to come in behind a district to assist it with big public events or a series of criminal outrages for instance, but by and large a division should be self-sufficient and should have sufficient resources so that the divisional commander and the chief superintendent have enough resources to provide a locally tailored service to the public.  That would be based on the district model but the divisions should be autonomous in terms of the provision of the local policing service.  They should have their own human resources, HR, and financial support for example, but all within a corporate framework.  If I set the corporate framework for how we go about our business it will then be for the divisional commanders, the chief superintendents and their staff to deliver on the service with all of the local characteristics that people will require.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Are there any other areas where the Commissioner would have that type of nuance or variation in interpretation compared to the report?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#D00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>We have picked out small nuances only.

Within the roadmap of the report there is a very strong emphasis on community policing.  I am interested in getting some concrete examples from the Commissioner.  My personal experience with this is that community policing delivered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works very well occasionally.  It works very well because somebody comes in, he or she is enthusiastic, is on the ground and working with the community but it is never envisaged as a career or a long-term posting.  That garda moves on and gets promotion.  It is the type of job that the young man or woman coming from Templemore does and then moves on from and therefore it is stop-start.  A gap arises when they move on and the post is not filled or it gets diverted.  Under the proposal that is there, the whole force re-emphasises and refocuses on community policing.  How does the Commissioner envisage that we would be changing structures in a more concrete manner to deliver that, as distinct from the way in which most communities would feel that it works at the moment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#D00400","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Community policing will undoubtedly be the ethos of the organisation but also, as the Deputy has said, we have to deliver on this structurally as well.  The particular characteristic of the service that we must deliver is that we have both urban and rural areas where there is deprivation, high crime and the problems attendant with those such as drug abuse, alcohol abuse and mental health issues - all of which require a multi-agency response.  Community policing should play its part there and in effect, the garda&iacute; who engage in that become specialists and should be regarded as such because skills are needed in order to work with other agencies and there are also community problem solving skills.  It is not just a post that a garda will fill for a period of time.  It is specialism but it depends on relationships as well.<\/p> <p>  The rural areas are somewhat different because there will be a more hybrid model.  Garda&iacute; in rural areas will not only have that problem solving, community responsibility, they will also have a response capability.  We are still working on this but I envisage dedicated community policing teams built up against the need that we see in critical areas where those interventions can make a real impact.  That can be clearly seen in urban areas and in areas of deprivation.  Those areas have a high demand for our services but a high demand for other services as well.  The commission of policing takes that on further in terms of widening the definition of policing and widening the scope for who may engage in policing.  Much of that is down to ensuring that the State's energies are focused on the right places and towards the right people at the right time.  There are areas and individuals with high demand and we need to collectively work together to see how we can best address that to improve the quality of their lives, along with the quality of the lives of the people who live around them and community policing is a big piece of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I have another question linking to that if the Chair will indulge me.  In the police service in which the Commissioner formerly served there was an extensive programme of the closing of police stations.  There is obviously a very contentious issue around the closing or potential reopening of Garda stations.  In the context of refocusing on communities, both in urban and rural areas and in the context of delivering the type of service the Commissioner described, what is his view on the need for additional Garda stations, the locations in which they might be needed, whether we need to radically increase the number of Garda stations and whether that type of community policing that the Commissioner described can be delivered with the Garda station profile that we have at the moment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#D00600","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I have not come to a final conclusion on that.  I certainly do not feel any particular pressure to close stations.  I should retain the stations that I have and then examine what is going on in terms of the demand they are meeting and the reassurance they are providing as well.  People take comfort from having a Garda station in their location and there is no doubt about that but I have to look towards where the new demands are and where the issues are in respect of which the intervention of the Garda will make a difference.  It also comes down to our resources and how we best use them.  I refer to my earlier comments on the demand that we are dealing with, how that demand is changing and how we are best placed to meet it.  It is not necessarily the case that building new stations and reopening stations is the way to go forward.  We want to be sure that our service is responsive, that people feel that it is approachable and that it is providing a local service.  That is undoubtedly true but at the same time stations are expensive and they draw on the public purse a lot.  I could not make any promises here today that there will be a wholesale reopening of stations because it depends on the need and the demand that it is filling as opposed to just making a promise that we will reopen stations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for his answer and I acknowledge his remarks on investment going into the Garda.

Obviously, where there is a station, there is reassurance for the community in seeing Garda patrols backwards and forwards and it feels there is visibility.  I can look to my last service, in which a lot of closures were driven by economics in keeping police stations open.  I do not feel the same pressure on me because we are in a time of investment.  I want to think about the divisional structure and the community policing structure before I come to conclusions on the reopening of Garda stations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#D00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for coming, in particular the new Garda Commissioner as it is his first time here.

The cultural audit flagged how committed they were to public service.  There is also the confidence people have in their local garda&iacute;, which is important.  There is probably less confidence in senior management.  It is for me and the rest of the senior leadership team to work on improving the leadership of the organisation.  Therefore, the second piece is that we have strong community contacts.  Beyond that, a process of digitisation and digital investment is required as a lot of time and effort are spent in dealing with paper.  When we talk about demand, it is very difficult in a paper based system to understand entirely what it is as we do not have the statistics we need to understand how much time we are spending on particular calls.  We are moving towards computer aided despatch, a system which will give us far more information on what we are spending our time on in patrolling and responding to incidents.  I require a lot more information and having a process of digitisation is the way to do it.  Beyond that, there is the training and development of our staff.  There are a lot of online systems coming on-stream that require training, but we also want to increase the focus on the human rights aspects of policing, as well as on the code of ethics and how central it is.  Everyone is undergoing training on the code of ethics and that process will be completed by the end of the year.  It has been a big commitment by the organisation to deliver it.  The people are good, as is the level of public support.  Some of the systems are old and antiquated, but there is a programme to bring them up to speed.  A paper based system in an organisation of our size, given the demands with which we are dealing, is just not sufficient in the 21st century.  That is what we have to concentrate on.<\/p> <p>  Some of the Garda stations I have visited are not of the standard I would expect.  Some look a bit tired and rundown.  Some are crowded and we have had to move outside the core premises and extend into other buildings.  I know that these issues receive attention all of the time.  <\/p> <p>  For my part, I also want to bring a degree of corporate governance and discipline - if I may use that expression - to what we are doing in order that we are working within a corporate framework while also providing for local autonomy and autonomy for operational commanders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>In comparison with the PSNI, with which the Commissioner worked before, are there weaknesses in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that stand out to him?

We are staffing that appropriately as we see the threats at this time.<\/p> <p>  There are three areas of concern.  The first is local policing and local reassurance and confidence for people.  I know the Police Service of Northern Ireland is also concerned about this.  People living close to the Border will be worried and will have a fear that their area could be raided from the other side, backwards and forwards, and there is the fear of crime and the travelling criminal crossing the Border.<\/p> <p>  There is also the reality of night life in Derry, where a lot of young people travel across the Border to engage in night life there but there is also attendant crime.  It is about managing those scenarios where a serious crime may be committed in one jurisdiction but the perpetrators are located in the other jurisdiction.  How do we manage the evidential issues that emerge from that?  We want to know how well the European treaties, particularly around criminal justice, are going to withstand Brexit or what will go in their place.<\/p> <p>  Organised crime is the third area of concern.  Any change in trading tariffs gives opportunity for smugglers to make illicit profits or to evade tax or duty.  There is an organised crime element to that and any organised crime element on the Border will also provide some additional element of funding to terrorist groups, dissident republicans in particular.  It has been suggested that they might use this as an emotional driver for their particular campaigns, and we want to avoid anything like that at all.  We want to avoid them being able to use this as a rallying call.  There is a lot of focus on a hard border in terms of the threat of terrorism but there are two other elements as well that are equally important.  We as an organisation have been engaging with the Police Service of Northern Ireland since the Brexit vote in respect of this.  We have plans in place but we are not yet quite sure what the nature of the Brexit is going to be, so there is an unknown element.  We have prepared as best we can for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Has the Commissioner ever heard of a place called Stepaside?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#F00400","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Yes, I have heard of Stepaside.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Would the Commissioner tell me what he knows about it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#F00600","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I believe it is one of six stations which we are in the process of reopening.

He is taking the position at a time of great change following on from several controversies, which unfortunately somewhat undermined public confidence in the institution as a whole.  Notwithstanding that, I believe that in the vast majority of cases the local garda still enjoys great trust from the people and the people have great faith in him or her.  People want to see more garda&iacute; in their community.<\/p> <p>  This is also a time that has a lot of potential.  While I do not agree with every single recommendation in the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland report, there are many positive elements which can modernise and transform policing.  One of the major priorities in the recommendations was the emphasis on community policing.  I am a big fan of the community policing model.  I may have a slightly contrary view to Deputy Brophy in that I think the model as it is works reasonably well where it is resourced correctly.  Unfortunately, the number of dedicated community garda&iacute; has fallen by about 40% since 2010 or 2011.  That has undermined the model.  Does the Commissioner intend to make policing in the community a core priority?

We will be an organisation that focuses on community policing.  All of us will have a community policing ethos.  I recognise what the Deputy says about local confidence in local garda&iacute;, and I want to build on that and make sure it is enhanced going forward.  One of the routes into that is community policing.  As we work out our new divisional and district structure, an integral part of that will be how we will police with the community in each particular district or division.  There will be a focus on local policing whereby service delivery will be focused on the district.  Part of that will be how we manage the community policing element within a particular district.  The Deputy can have assurance of that.  I have seen the initial plans about what divisions will look like going forward, and that is built into them in terms of how we manage local accountability, local responsiveness and dealing with people's concerns at a local level.  That is a given.<\/p> <p>  Community policing, as was said, will be a specialism in some areas depending on the demand.  We see that in the urban areas.  In rural areas, it may be more of a hybrid model where we will just regard all of our response officers as having a community responsibility but also having to attend calls as well.  I was privileged to be in one of our small towns two weeks ago.  The local guard also answered calls but he knew everybody we spoke to on first name terms and he introduced me to dozens of people.  That is community policing.  Everyone knew him by name and he knew and was able to identify and speak to many individuals.  That is what we want to build on.

There is very good work going on.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the overall question, when dealing with such determined organised crime groups, we must come at it on a number of levels.  One element is community policing.  In effect, organised crime always puts a foot down somewhere and leaves a bad trace in a local community.  In part when I speak of critical neighbourhoods where there is high demand, I mean areas where organised crime gangs may try to find shelter or impose their writ on the local community.  Much of our community policing will be about those areas and undermining, in effect, the legend and story of the gangs.

There have been some very significant convictions.<\/p> <p>  On the international aspect, we enjoy good relations with the international partners who engage with us.

To a large extent this relates to the decision in July 2017 in which Mr. Justice Treacy found in the High Court in Northern Ireland that Mr. Harris took decisions that were not compliant with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights and frustrated any possibility that there would be an effective and overarching investigation into the Glenanne gang cases.

The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland report has been discussed already, to an extent.

The Policing Authority has expressed serious concerns that the Garda renewal and modernisation programme is not fit for purpose, and that not only is the pace of reform too slow but that the vehicle set up by the Garda for reform is not delivering.  On 9 August it stated:<\/p><blockquote>If the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not at this juncture pause ... to reconsider in a determined and focused way the end to which its efforts and resources are being directed, as well as what key enablers and levers it needs to achieve that change, then it is the authority's view that a continuation of the current activity and effort, however well-intentioned, will not deliver the fundamental reform envisaged.<\/blockquote> <p>Essentially, this questions whether the Garda is properly set up with the vehicle it set out to deliver reform, both in terms of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate reports that are a few years old now and the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland document.

These are big information technology projects that are being landed into a public organisation with multiple complex systems.  It would be a challenge for anybody to deliver.<\/p> <p>  Just looking at the digital strategy, there is much under way.  Beyond that there is a human resources piece, which very much relates to workforce modernisation.  It is a major project as well in terms of expanding the organisation and having the required training, in effect, for every new garda who comes in.  There is training and investment in the individual while Garda staff are brought in to displace others at the front line.  There are many plates spinning.  We need more support in financial and human resources skills and we are working up what that would look like.  It is well recognised within the organisation that we need more expertise.<\/p> <p>  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland has described an end point for us and what the model of policing should be.  It is now for us to deliver on that.<\/p><p>It is not at variance with the modernisation and renewal programme, MRP.

While one needs to be realistic about what is in one's way and what problems need to be solved, if one has a clear idea of where one is going, one can be optimistic about what can be done.  It has become clear to us and the Policing Authority what needs to happen to make these changes, acknowledging that it is complex.  We have staff and skills issues to deal with, including training, and we have to look at our own structures and how we deliver policing and at the style of that policing.

My question on this is threefold.  First, what is the Commissioner's understanding of the security responsibilities he has within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Second, how does he respond to concerns expressed by persons such as Michael C.

That vetting, which was under constant renewal, was still in place for me and still live.

What happened is that the Chief Constable provided an assurance in respect of that vetting and, indeed, my vetting certificates were provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a demonstration of that.  The vetting is there to ensure that one is not open to coercion or blackmail or whatever it might be and that there are no issues surrounding one's private life or affiliations which could give rise to concern.  It is a very thorough process, including both financial and private life checks.  I have undergone that vetting process and been subject to it.  One does not do it once, but is subject to it constantly.  There is no issue about the level to which I have been vetted and that was resolved through the normal channels.<\/p> <p>  The obligations I have under the Official Secrets Act here are similar to those I had under the UK's Official Secrets Act.

The tribunal also found that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs a complete turnaround in its attitude which must be led by senior management.  I ask the Commissioner to respond to that.  How does he intend to lead that complete turnaround?  He referred in his opening statement to the code of ethics.

My behaviour and that of my senior leadership team has a dramatic impact on the organisation, of that there is no doubt.

There is no point in me saying one thing and doing another.  I cannot talk to sergeants or inspectors about their behaviour if they are able to say that it is hypocrisy on my part to do so because I did X, Y or Z.  It is very clear that the code of ethics is the bedrock of our behaviours.  I take every opportunity to emphasise that and to stress that people need to live those behaviours.<\/p> <p>  We intend to follow through and completely overhaul our discipline code.  The current code creates an atmosphere in which people fear being disciplined.  Instead of proper management intervention, guidance and an organisation that promotes learning, they see an organisation that is punitive towards its staff.

People were really shocked at the strength of the finding against the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, and the fact that someone in his position could be responsible for a campaign of that nature.  It is vitally important that such behaviour is never repeated and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na becomes an organisation that supports whistleblowers.<\/p> <p>  My final question is on overtime, which I have raised with the Minister for Justice and Equality on a number of occasions.  Mr. Harris has introduced a moratorium or an effective ban on overtime as I understand it, between now and the end of this year.  Any overtime request must now be sanctioned by two of the most senior garda&iacute; in the State.  A similar ban was introduced at Christmas last year but this ban is a much lengthier one.  There is also a reduced budget, I believe, for overtime for 2019.  I recognise that Garda budgets are under severe pressure and that in the abstract, too much is being spent on overtime but that is caused by the very real gaps that exist across a number of districts.  According to replies to various parliamentary questions, most Garda districts are still at or below 2011 staffing levels.  It is because of staffing gaps that districts are relying overtime to deliver essential policing services.  I was canvassing yesterday on the south side of Dublin and two issues were flagged to me in terms of the problems this is causing at an operational level.  Problems arose in Inchicore with an operation that was targeting a number of people involved in what appeared to be racially motivated attacks.  In Drimnagh, a call was made to a Garda station on foot of serious anti-social behaviour but the call was not responded to because there were not adequate numbers of garda&iacute; to safely respond.  The Commissioner will not be aware of the specific details of these incidents and I do not expect him to respond in that regard.  I am merely giving some examples of what was flagged with me.  My question is whether Mr. Harris is confident that the overtime ban will not have a very significant impact on the quality of policing and the ability of garda&iacute; to respond to crime between now and the end of the year, particularly with any potential spike in crime, public order issues, or increases in burglaries that often arise around the Christmas period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#J00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Overtime is sometimes an emotive topic but it should not be thus.  We received a budget at the start of the year.  We overspent the budget and corrective action had to be taken.  That is my responsibility as Accounting Officer.  This is public money and I have to show good management of it.  There is still per roster, which is every four weeks, approximately &euro;7.2 million to &euro;7.3 million available for overtime, so it is not an absolute moratorium.  We have covered what we believe are essential areas but have kept a small pool in the middle for emergencies or pre-planned operations.  People bid in to my colleague, the deputy commissioner, in terms of releasing overtime funds for those operations.  Regrettably, overtime has grown quite considerably over recent years.  I feel an obligation now to get a rope around it, to understand what the money is being spent on and what we are getting for that overtime.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation and the number of staff hours for policing is growing all the time with each release of individuals from the training college.  I have to think carefully about overtime because it can quickly suck dry the ability of the organisation to be proactive in other areas and to spend money on things like training, equipment and other vital areas.  I am not apologising for the cut in overtime.  I regret if it is having an impact on operations but at the same time, that has not been conveyed to me.  Our managers are living within the overtime that is being provided to them.  It will probably be a feature going forward but we have not finalised the budget for 2019 yet.  Overtime will remain in and around the figures outlined but we will have to manage it going forward.  Hopefully, we will have an overtime budget of over &euro;90 million next year but we can quickly overspend that.  Then overtime starts to suck money out of other projects that we want to push forward and that is not where we want to be.  We need to be managing it because not doing so takes away my ability to do other things which are also very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I thank the Garda Commissioner for his responses.

I wish the Commissioner well going forward.<\/p> <p>  My first question relates to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland report, which the Commissioner referenced in his opening statement.  Having been in his post for two months now, what is his view of the current policing oversight architecture?  One of the issues raised in the aforementioned report and other reports on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that there are many bodies through which the force is held to account.  The Commissioner has said that public accountability is important to him.  New offices have been proposed, including an independent office of the police commission and a policing and community safety oversight commission.  The Policing Authority, the Garda Inspectorate and GSOC are in the mix already and there is also the potential for a new board.  Where does the Commissioner see this going?  I know that ultimately it is a Government decision as to the architecture surrounding An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but does the Commissioner believe it is too complicated at present?  Would he like to see it simplified, while still upholding the principle of public accountability?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#J00700","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Undoubtedly, the landscape at the moment is complex.  As a chief officer, I spent a long time - 12 years - being held to account by the Northern Ireland Policing Board in Belfast.  I worked with the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and I was subject to investigation by that office.  I am well used to vigorous and rigorous public accountability and investigation.  That brings a lot of benefits in terms of public confidence and dealing with difficult issues.  It brings an objectivity when dealing with complaints.  It means that the policing service itself is subjective in its view on how to go forward.<\/p> <p>  As I said, I do not want to comment specifically on the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  We will make our views known as part of our commentary to the Government.  We still have the Policing Authority, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.  The responsibilities of those bodies are set out in legislation.  We have to be responsible as we work with them into the future.  I can say without any equivocation that our position is that accountability, independent investigation and oversight are very important for the role we provide and are central not only in the performance of what we do but also in promoting public confidence in what we do.  All this serves as a very useful sounding board and acts as a route for getting the opinions of the public on various matters.  Regardless of what happens, we wish to see rigorous accountability that adds to public confidence in what we do and provides us with good and viable feedback that we can use to improve the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Mr. Harris has mentioned that public accountability is important.

My view is that there should be some streamlining so that Mr. Harris is not getting direction from 20 different places and so that oversight can work.  That was something that came out of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.

I know PULSE gets a bad press.  Like any big IT system, it has started to evolve.  PULSE 7.3 will be very different from the version of PULSE that was used several iterations ago.  We can already see that some of the systemic issues that were encountered with earlier editions of PULSE have started to fade away and diminish.  We have put a lot of effort into the quality of our data.  We have a great deal of work to do in that respect.  This is a point of emphasis for me and for the rest of the organisation because the data determine how best we should use our resources.  It has been said to me that PULSE, in itself, is unwieldy and difficult.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as an important organisation that uses PULSE, is always thinking about the next iteration of PULSE and about how we should improve and expand it.  We have other systems coming online.  I think the investigation management system will be of particular assistance.  Reference has been made to computer-aided despatches as well.  The challenge is to get these systems to communicate with one another and start to populate things on through.  These are complex programmes.  It is inevitable that any time we buy a product, we are not the only user of it.  We have to work with others when new editions are coming out and new changes are being made.

The report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland refers a good deal to the rise of the work we are doing in respect of harm and it put that in the context of a multi-agency response, critical intervention teams and perhaps a co-location between us and other primarily healthcare and social service professionals.

I wish him the best.  To me, what I see is what I get.  The Commissioner seems to be a very honest person.  He seems to be a person who wants to get the job done.  What I like about him is that the first point he made was that he had confidence in the force.  It means that the people working under the Commissioner note there is a man coming here and he means business.<\/p> <p>  One of the biggest challenges the Commissioner mentioned from day one when he got the job was the Border after Brexit.  Coming from the Dundalk area, I am aware the Border plays a big part in the life of the community.  As an ex-member of the 27th Battalion in Dundalk, an Army man, I know what it is like to patrol the 34 Border crossings from Cullaville to Omeath.  During the troubled time, it was not a nice time to be involved.  We also have a lot of illicit trade there at present.  I refer to the fuel smuggling, the cigarettes and everything else.  It is just not a nice time.<\/p> <p>  I am a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  I spent the past two days in London and the main topic was Brexit.  The British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, has said that she has 95% of Brexit sorted out.  The last 5% is the Border.  The Taoiseach has said that if the Border situation is not sorted out, violence will return.  These are statements that we do not want to hear.  The bottom line is that it is important that the Commissioner has a plan of action.<\/p> <p>  I have been very lucky in recent months.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, visited Dundalk recently and met Superintendent Gerard Curley.  I would like to record that I find Superintendent Curley approachable, honest and upfront.  In fairness, he gives the Garda a good name in the area.<\/p> <p>  We visited Dundalk Garda station.  Given the amount of stuff they are taking in and the level of investigation they are doing, my main concern about the Garda station is that there does not seem to be an inch of space left.  They are doing a good job.  I can see a presence of the Garda on the beat, which is good there.<\/p> <p>  We also visited Dromad Garda station, which is a prefab building at present.

We are not sure of the drivers that there may be behind any of those issues, but certainly we have identified properly the concerns of the local population and how we should address those.  We emphasise that because in many ways people's local concerns about robbery, very bad driving or anti-social behaviour through bad driving, etc. are somewhat missed in the big political debates around Brexit, but those are of concern to us.  We will be there for the local communities.<\/p> <p>  In terms of organised crime and terrorism, we will be watching those very closely.  We will be in a position to react should the climate change in terms of the threat posed by either of those, but we are particularly concerned in respect of how organised crime will use the difference in tax tariffs, as I have said, to try to build up revenue.  We will work with other partners in respect of that.  Two weeks from now, we have the annual cross-Border organised crime conference.  That always has a focus on the various forms of criminality that we see right across the island of Ireland, not only smuggling but also other areas of organised crime that we can co-operate on, and not only in the Border area.  I am meeting the Chief Constable before that to agree further areas that we can develop.

I presume this is not only looking ahead but includes historical inquiries.  Mr. Harris has alluded to a number of ongoing murder inquiries and we wish those well.  There was an earlier reference to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings on 17 May 1974, a day that I will never forget.  With no reference to a hierarchy of victimhood, it was the single greatest atrocity through all the years of conflict we have known on this island in relatively recent times.  The Houses of the Oireachtas, this Parliament, have on three occasions unanimously passed motions appealing for full co-operation with the appointed inquirers into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.<\/p><p>We have appealed to the British Government and its agencies to co-operate fully in the provision of all documentation, information and files relevant to the respective inquiries into those matters that took place north of the Border, and elsewhere if that be the case.  Deputy Commissioner Twomey responded earlier to one of my colleague's inquiries on this particular matter.  The Commissioner himself earlier indicated a willingness to meet victims and the representatives of victims.  In this particular instance, that is the Justice for the Forgotten organisation, heroically led by a lady called Ms Margaret Irwin.  Will the Commissioner facilitate an opportunity to meet Ms Irwin and with victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the survivors and bereaved families?  There were 33 deaths in those bombings.  <br\/><br\/>Commissioner Harris is unquestionably highly qualified for the position he has undertaken.  His experience is a significant factor in that.  Can the Commissioner, because of his previous roles, responsibilities and exposure, bring something more to the call, the wish and the cry for justice?  Despite the passage of time since 1974, here we are heading for 44 years later and that cry for truth and justice in respect of those particular atrocities has not faded.  Can the Commissioner, given his experience, knowledge, contacts, communications <i>et al.<\/i>, offer any hope for a better position than maintains currently?  As Deputy Commissioner Twomey indicated, this is not an area where there has been a flow of communications.  That is something we all too sadly know very well.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#R01300","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":190,"content":"<p>These atrocities are now my responsibility to investigate.

I appreciate the reply from the Commissioner and I look forward to hearing from him in due course on this topic.  I welcome his willingness to meet the Justice for the Forgotten group.

Commissioner Harris was talking about internal communications in the first instance as a priority.  With no specific reference, I have to say as Chair of this committee that I hope communications with the committee will also improve in the future.  There have been inordinate delays in responses to specific questions this committee has posed to former holders of the post of Garda Commissioner.  I am saying this on behalf of all of those present and all those elected members who make up this committee.  It has vexed us in the past and it is unnecessary.  I would greatly appreciate a significant improvement in that area.<\/p> <p>  My final question is on something that came up only last week.  We met with Assistant Commissioners Leahy and Finn and Commissioner Harris's former colleague, Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd.  They were before us in these very seats.  We talked about the importance of partnership in addressing issues that very often present almost wholly and solely to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am speaking about areas such as mental health and, as the Commissioner referred to earlier, youth crime and reducing recidivism.  It came out in the engagement last week that there might be - this might be a point of opinion - a better degree of interaction and co-operation between the different agencies north of the Border than may be the case here.  <\/p> <p>  That may be a moot point and perhaps the Commissioner might have a different view.  That is neither here nor there.  The point is that we need to see that level of co-operation across the board.  As elected public representatives, we are very much aware that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na find themselves having to deal with situations that present that are not their primary responsibility in respect of community safety.  I refer particularly to the area of mental health.  Some of the difficulties relate to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being a 24-7 hour organisation.  Some of the other services concerned are not and that is a huge problem.  <\/p> <p>  Even in my years of public service, I have had to strive to find where one can get help in a given situation after 5 p.m. in the evening and at weekends when, very often, these problems present.  It is an important area for the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and societally.  I would like to conclude by asking the Commissioner to elaborate on building this interaction perhaps in a more structured way.  I know it is early days for the Commissioner, and I do not mean to put him on the spot.  It is, however, an area he has reflected on.  I welcome that and I would like to underscore the importance of it.  Could he offer any additional commentary on this important area? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#S00700","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I will address that last point but I will start with the Chair's first point on communication.  As I said at the start and in my comments as well, I want to have open and transparent communication with the committee.<\/p><p>I was struck by Senator Conway's remarks.  He asked me to identify what issues I have seen in the organisation.  As I see them and as they crystallise, the committee, along with the Policing Authority, will be briefed properly on those.  I also noted his comments about the expedition of correspondence and reports.  In terms of collaboration, the commission is very strident about this.  It talks about widening the definition of policing, how the policing mission is changing and about harm.  The commission makes specific recommendations on Departments working together and crisis intervention teams but also An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na working together with co-located social service and healthcare professionals.<\/p><p> I think we have a different vision for what the service to the public will look like going forward but underpinning that, we need to have the correct organisational strategies in place with our partners, and we also need to resolve the issues around appropriate information sharing as well.  Undoubtedly, more of our time is being spent dealing with mental health issues but, increasingly, our work also involves dealing with issues concerning drink and drug addiction.  Crimes against the vulnerable also seem to be increasing.  Certainly, reports to that effect are increasing as well.  That brings us in contact with our partners to have a more holistic and victim-centred approach to individuals and the dire circumstances in which they find themselves.  The commission has specific recommendations and we are very much alive to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#S00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":198,"content":"<p>We have sat in this session for more than two and a half hours so without further ado, on behalf of the committee, I thank Commissioner Harris and wish him well in his new role.
