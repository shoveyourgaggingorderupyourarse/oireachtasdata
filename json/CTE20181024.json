The Houses of the Oireachtas are being asked to approve the following regulations in draft: Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (Section 95(3)) (Variation of Title: Physical Therapist) Regulations 2018.  These regulations are being made pursuant to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, which provides for the protection of the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct, education, training and competence through statutory registration of the health and social care professionals designated under the Act.  Regulation under the Act is primarily by way of registration of practitioners and the statutory protection of professional titles.  The use of protected titles is restricted to practitioners granted registration under the Act.<\/p><p>The registrants must comply with a code of professional conduct and ethics and are subject to fitness to practise rules similar to those applying to nurses, midwives and doctors.  The structure of the system of statutory regulation comprises registration boards for the professions, a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters, and the Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system.  These bodies are collectively known as CORU.<\/p><p> The Act prohibits a person whose name is not on the register from using the title of a designated profession and provides that CORU may initiate a criminal prosecution summarily to enforce the prohibition on a designated title's misuse.  The title of physiotherapist is specified under section 79 of the 2005 Act for the exclusive use of qualified professionals registered with the Physiotherapists Registration Board.  The board first met in June 2014.  One of the first items on its agenda was protection of title and how best to address the question of protecting the title of physical therapist.  In other English-speaking countries physiotherapists often use the title of physical therapist interchangeably with that of physiotherapist.  In Ireland, however, in the absence of regulation and of title protection, the title of physical therapist has been used by other providers of musculoskeletal therapies practising in the private sector.  Those using the title of physical therapist are predominately members of the Irish Association of Physical Therapists.  This association has approximately 300 members, most of whom are degree level graduates of the Institute of Physical Therapy and Applied Science in Dublin.  Like physiotherapists, graduates of the institute provide musculoskeletal therapies.  Physiotherapists, however, are also trained to provide cardio-respiratory and neurological therapies.<\/p><p> In 2016, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, concluded extensive consultations with the registration board and other relevant organisations concerning the protection of title.  He decided that protecting the title of physical therapist under the Act as a variant of the title of physiotherapist would be the best way to eliminate the risk of title confusion and the consequent risks to public safety.  The Physiotherapists Registration Board established its register on 30 September 2016.  The two-year transitional period ended in September 2018, at which time entitlement to use the title of physiotherapist was confined to members of the register.<\/p><p> The Health and Social Care Professionals (Amendment) Act 2017 provided for the registration in the register of physiotherapists on a once-off basis and for a limited period, ending in December 2018, of certain qualified users of the title physical therapist.  The Act facilitates the Minister in making regulations to prescribe the title of physical therapist as a variant title of physiotherapist.  Section 95(3) of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides that the Minister for Health, after consulting the registration board of a designated profession and any organisations that he or she considers appropriate, may by regulation prescribe one or more than one title that is a variant of the title designated in the Act for the profession.  Section 95(7) provides that a regulation may be made under section 95(3) only if a draft of the proposed regulation has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.  The effect of prescribing the title of physical therapist as a variant of the title of physiotherapist will be to protect both titles under the Act by confining their use solely to registrants of the Physiotherapists Registration Board.<\/p><p> The regulation was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in June this year.  The motions to approve the regulation were moved in both Houses of the Oireachtas on 16 October.  It is proposed that the regulations will come into operation in December 2018.  I am happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Walsh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#H00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>My understanding in layperson's language is that essentially physiotherapy and physical therapy will now be interchangeable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#H00300","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Yes, in respect of the title.

Now on the Physiotherapists Registration Board we have physiotherapists who are qualified in three streams, namely, cardio-respiratory, neurological and musculoskeletal.  A limited number of registrants are on the same register with an interchangeable title and who only practise in the field of musculoskeletal therapy.  They practise in one stream and the others practise in three streams.  There is a once-off provision to ensure there is no risk to the public.  No more physical therapists of the one-stream category will be registered.

The Minister, having considered the matter, is transposing the directive for those professionals already covered under the older directive, so he is modernising it.  They are not being included at this point but this concerns the wider exercise.  These people were party to one from a number of professions that sought to be included under the basic safety standards directive.  It goes to the heart of scope of practice and extended scope of practice.  Within the Department they are looking at workforce planning and within that strategic framework they are looking at scope of practice for a range of health and social care professionals.  The matter is in that basket and it is not appropriate to these regulations.

For 2018, the Government approved gross expenditure of &euro;15.332 billion for the health services - &euro;14.839 billion for current funding and &euro;493 million for capital funding - representing a 4.9% increase on the original Vote allocation for 2017.  The improving economy has enabled the health service to achieve much-needed budget increases in each of the past three years.  We are very aware that there are areas where further improvements are required, and the Department will continue to work with the HSE to optimise service provision within the constraints of available funding.  Demographic pressures, including a rise in chronic diseases and an ageing population, mean that we face challenges into the future in implementing our strategic responses to these developments while continuing to focus on effective management of resources to ensure that services are delivered in line with the national service plan and within budget.  Not only has our population over the ages of 65 and 85 increased significantly, but due to the continuous improvements in health delivery more people are also living longer with more illnesses, requiring increased ongoing support from the health system.<\/p> <p>  In considering the drivers of expenditure in any given year, it is important to recognise the interdependencies that exist.  For example, a policy goal seeking to improve client safety, underpinned by improved regulation, can be delivered through a range of interventions which may drive a requirement for increased staffing and new roles.  Almost 1,100 designated centres in disability services need to be registered by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  In addition, 790 individuals were identified nationally in 2017 as requiring an immediate service response in terms of residential placement.  Notably, death or incapacity of the main carer was the main driver, accounting for 29.5% of these requirements.  In the case of drug spending, the main drivers are new high-tech drugs expenditure in areas such as cystic fibrosis, rheumatology and cancer and increased spend on drugs under the long-term illness scheme for conditions such as diabetes, cystic fibrosis and epilepsy.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that a number of service areas are purely demand-driven, and spending can exceed the budgeted allocation, where forecast assumptions on demand levels differ from those experienced.  Health is one of the few public services which has its pension costs reflected in its Vote.  Changes to pension rates and the fact that pensioners are living longer have resulted in a significant increase in the share of the health Vote attributable to pensions.  Similarly, the inclusion of the costs associated with the State Claims Agency has an impact on the health Vote annually.  While an assessment is undertaken each year, it can be difficult to forecast.  The increasing cost of settlements is determined by the court system and is a matter which does not fall not within the remit of the health sector.<\/p> <p>  The nature of the health services is such that the normal budget management levers available to other sectors, such as reduction of services, are simply not available to the HSE in some areas.  The winter of 2018 was very difficult for our health services.  During February, there was a 7.7% increase in attendances and a 5% increase in emergency department, ED, admissions compared to February 2017.  This growth in demand is well ahead of population growth and reflects international evidence that emergency department demand is driven by more than demographic factors.  This increased demand was further exacerbated in March by the impact of Storm Emma and the associated severe weather experienced across the country.  Other external factors, such as the actions of the private health insurers, are also driving the need for additional funding.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the financial position and the 2018 outturn, while it is still too early to forecast accurately the year-end position, significant deficits are emerging, driven in large part by the issues referred to above.  I refer, for example, to: a private patient income shortfall of around &euro;100 million, arising from the campaign by the insurers to dissuade their policyholders from using their insurance when admitted through an ED; a higher level of State Claims Agency payouts than budgeted for, approximately &euro;50 million; a primary care reimbursement service driven by costs and demand for drugs, especially high-tech and long-term illness, in the range of &euro;95 million; a higher level of spend on national reform projects, in the range of &euro;40 million; a higher level of spend on service areas, acute and social care, in the range of &euro;220 million; and non-achievement of tranche 3 of the value improvement programme, in the range of &euro;150 million.<\/p><p> The overspend in the service areas is driven by a number of factors, including the non-achievement of value improvement programme, VIP, targets, higher levels and higher complexity of demand, costs associated with meeting national standards and emergency placements beyond the level funded.  Based on spending this year to date, it is clear that there will be an overrun in 2018.  In that context, the announcement by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, that he intends to allocate an additional &euro;700 million to the health service in 2018 by way of a Supplementary Estimate is most welcome, particularly bearing in mind that it has been possible to carry this additionality into the base for 2019.<\/p><p> In drafting the capital plan for the period 2018 to 2022, the HSE identified a deficit in construction capital funding for 2018 of &euro;109 million.  During 2018 extensive measures to actively manage the capital budget have been applied.  This has involved balancing, as much as practicable, the fulfilment of contractual commitments, delivery of projects and managing equipment and infrastructural risk issues such that capital expenditure remains within profile.  Following this extensive engagement and management of issues, capital spending to September 2018 remains within profile.  Nevertheless, there are limits to which such a level of funding shortfall in the year can be managed.  As the end of the year approaches and following implementation of the measures I have outlined in the past 12 months, the projected year-end deficit has been managed down, with no further viable options available to meet this gap.  However, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has approved a further &euro;20 million to be allocated to bridge a proportion of this gap in 2018 as part of the overall Supplementary Estimate amount.<\/p><p> Despite welcome increases over recent years, a financial challenge remains as we deal with a larger and older population, more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and the rising costs of health technology.  The costs of payments under the State Claims Agency are also rising, adding to the overall cost of health above the operational costs funded to meet the health demands of a growing and ageing population.  The HSE is reporting significant overruns in the year to date and the Department continues to work closely with it to identify measures to reduce the projected deficit through mitigating actions, without impacting service levels.  It is now anticipated that the bulk of VIP 1 savings for the year will be achieved in 2018, as well as a small amount of savings under VIP 2.<\/p><p> We must maintain our focus on improving the way services are organised and delivered, and on reducing costs, in order to maximise the ability of the health service to respond to growing needs.  It is essential that those managing and delivering the service demonstrate good practice by delivering the best possible healthcare within the limits of resources that have been made available by Government each year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Desmond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Desmond and invite Mr. Mulvany to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#L00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I thank committee for the invitation to attend.  The HSE spent &euro;14.3 billion on the provision of health and social care services in 2017.  This excludes capital spending.  The 2018 budget for the provision of these services is &euro;14.6 billion, which is &euro;224 million, or 1.6%, above what was spent in 2017.  The 2018 budget is &euro;608 million, or 4.4%, higher than the 2017 budget.  This is made up of pay rate funding for existing staffing levels at &euro;278 million, funding support for the existing level of services, including demographics, at &euro;134 million and funding for new developments at &euro;195 million.  To the end of August 2018 the HSE has spent &euro;10 billion on the provision of health and social care services to service users, patients and their families.  This is &euro;485 million, or 5.1%, above the level of budget available to the end of August.  Some 43%, or &euro;206 million, of this &euro;485 million overrun relates to unfunded cost growths in 2018 that are outside of the areas of spend which are amenable to normal management control efforts or relate to exceptional costs such as those associated with Storm Emma.  This includes the primary care reimbursement service at &euro;50 million, the State Claims Agency at &euro;32 million, local demand led schemes and overseas treatment at &euro;24 million, pensions at &euro;9 million, acute hospital income issues related to the actions of insurers at &euro;63 million and exceptional items, including Storm Emma, at &euro;28 million.  Some 37%, or &euro;180 million, of this &euro;485 million overrun relates to a shortfall in the target savings necessary to offset the unfunded costs of services that were running throughout 2017.  Despite this, &euro;37 million of savings under the value improvement programme are being reported by our community healthcare organisations and hospital groups at the end of August.  This figure is indicated to be approximately &euro;60 million in savings by year end.  In addition to this, there are significant centrally generated drugs and medicine related savings being delivered by the primary care reimbursement service, for example, &euro;27 million on a clinical protocol driven access initiative and in acute hospitals &euro;12 million on the framework agreement with suppliers.<\/p> <p>  Finally, 20% or &euro;99 million of this &euro;485 million overrun relates to other unfunded cost growths in 2018 within our operational service areas.  The provision of disability services to services users with intellectual and physical and sensory disabilities accounts for &euro;29 million of this residual &euro;99 million - emergency residential places at &euro;19 million, costs associated with HIQA registration of residential services at &euro;7 million and home support at &euro;3 million.  Behind these numbers there are many individual stories of service users with intellectual disabilities requiring residential care on a crisis basis due to a breakdown in their family caring arrangements.  On a positive note, very substantial progress has been made in achieving HIQA registration of residential centres.  The provision of services to older persons accounts for &euro;22 million of this residual &euro;99 million overrun, that is, home support at &euro;5 million, transitional care beds at &euro;2 million and public residential units at &euro;15 million.  Ireland's population aged 85 years and older is growing at approximately 4.3% per annum, which is significantly above than the EU average.  The provision of acute hospital services accounts for &euro;50 million of the residual &euro;99 million with this being partly attributable to additional activity levels and the growing complexity and cost of care as the age of the average patient increases.  In addition, bed occupancy levels in our acute hospitals, at 94%, are the second highest in the OECD and are well above the OECD average of 77%.  Levels consistently above 85% are indicative of a system operating under considerable stress, with knock-on implications for efficiency, quality and cost.<\/p> <p>  Based on the data to the end of August, it is clear that the full year cost of providing essential health and social care services in 2018 will significantly exceed the available funding.  In that context, the HSE very much welcomes the announcement by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that he intends to allocate an additional &euro;700 million to the health service in 2018, by way of a Supplementary Estimate.  It is particularly welcome that it has been indicated that this additional allocation will remain in the base funding of the health service going into 2019.  It is understood that &euro;625 million of this &euro;700 million will be allocated to the HSE to offset overruns in operating costs, with &euro;20 million being allocated to support ongoing HSE capital investment.<\/p> <p>  HSE national directors and their teams, as part of the ongoing performance management process, have been working throughout the year reviewing current costs with a view to reducing the level of overrun and this will continue and be intensified to year end where this is practical.  This is necessary to minimise the amount of any residual 2018 overrun.<\/p> <p>  That concludes my opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mulvany.

Obviously, the overrun this year, at &euro;700 million, is huge.  We will see what it reaches by the end of the year.  Not only is it a vast amount of money that we must vote through this year, it also has serious implications for next year and the following years.  The budget documentation has provisioned &euro;625 million for all future years based on this year's overrun.  The health budget is going to increase by nearly &euro;1.7 billion.  Over &euro;600 million of that will be for the overrun, and there are demographics and pay agreements.  When one strips it all out there is not enough left to get serious about Sl&aacute;intecare and the modernisation and scaling up of the system.  The overrun does not just affect the Exchequer this year but the &euro;625 million that must be allocated to cover the overrun essentially means Sl&aacute;intecare is not happening next year.  Sl&aacute;intecare requires approximately &euro;1 billion per year, although one could probably pare it down a little.  The implications of these overruns are enormous.<\/p> <p>  There have been overruns for a long time.  However, between 2008 and 2011, they were between &euro;70 million and &euro;200 million, which is still significant, but then they jumped to over &euro;300 million.<\/p><p>By 2014, they were at &euro;500 million, then &euro;600 million, &euro;660 million and now &euro;700 million this year.  While, obviously, there may be overruns in the health sector for unforeseen events, there has been a massive leap.  We are tipping along at a figure of &euro;700 million a year and have been for the past few years, with 2017 being an outlier.  What has gone on in the past few years that is different from happened in previous years?  We were looking at much more modest overruns, whereas now they are enormous.  Notwithstanding the fact that there are always crises and storms in the health sector, with expenditure on drugs that was unanticipated and inevitably a certain amount of unanticipated activity, why are the overruns now approximately three times what than they were a decade ago?

As explained, the position on overruns is that they are mainly driven by demographics and unforeseen events which require a Supplementary Estimate.  Historically, the position has varied to a fair degree and it has not necessarily been for technical reasons.  In recent years, for instance, a significant additional allocation of &euro;500 million was made in one year and it was not technically a Supplementary Estimate.  The nature of the health sector is such that there is a degree of unpredictability in service requirements but also in other areas which are not service related such as those I mentioned in my opening statement.<\/p> <p>  I can also answer the questions about Sl&aacute;&iacute;ntecare, if the committee so wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Desmond"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":90,"content":"<p>No; I wish to stay on this topic.  <\/p> <p>  With the greatest of respect, that is not a reasonable answer.  Demographics are predictable and should never lead to overruns.  We know how many people are living in the country and have quite a good idea of how many will be in it next year.  Demographics are not unforeseen and are planned for in any budget.  Therefore, demographic changes cannot be the issue.  While there have been overruns, based on the 11 years of information we have available, the trend has been significantly upwards.  There are always unanticipated events in healthcare, but there are unanticipated events in everything, including transport or in running a coffee shop.  Anyone who budgets for the year, be it for a coffee shop or a &euro;17 billion healthcare system, makes provisions.  One includes discretionary amounts of money to deal with unforeseen events such as storms, flu outbreaks or whatever else.  Therefore, I do not think it is reasonable to say demographic changes are the reason for an overrun as they are entirely predictable and can be budgeted for.  My question is: why are the overruns twice to three times more than what they used to be in the past four years?  The wheels are coming off.

We have set out where the deficits have occurred in the year to date and people can form a judgment on which of them was anticipated.  In looking at the performance at the end of last year, if one adds the Supplementary Estimate at the time for &euro;208 million and the residual deficit with which we were left of &euro;166 million, one ends up with a &euro;374 million problem.  It is a larger deficit than in other years such as when the health service broke even, but one must bear the components in mind.  About which parts of that &euro;374 million could one realistically say it was a performance issue or potentially a performance issue?  There was a central Government decision to make a pay award on 1 October 2017, but the Government decided to bring it forward to 1 April.  The first part of the Supplementary Estimate was a &euro;75 million increase in the allocation to allow for this.  Is that a performance issue?  No; it was simply a decision made by the Government, which was entirely appropriate.  <\/p> <p>  The cost in respect of the State Claims Agency is &euro;50 million.  It is a difficult area in which to predict expenditure.  It is difficult to come up with the actual figure between actuarial and run-rate estimates.  The key point from a performance management perspective, as people in this room know, is that the State Claims Agency is not the HSE's lawyer but its insurer.  It has its own statutory powers.  While the money we pay to the agency is in respect of HSE-related claims, it is in respect of claims made a number of years ago.  Is the figure of &euro;50 million related to a performance management issue in the health service?  I think that is the root of the question, to which the answer is no. <\/p> <p>  In 2017 the Government decided to make an access-winter investment plan, following the national service plan.  That is not unusual.  It accounted for &euro;35 million of the overall Supplementary Estimate and the residual deficit.<\/p> <p>  People can form a judgment on the next big item.  In 2017, &euro;121 million of the overall &euro;374 million is the impact on the income of acute hospitals.  It includes bad debts as a result of what we refer to as the actions of private insurers.  Leaving aside the question as to whether what they are doing is appropriate, the reality is they are doing it.  Despite the fact that hospitals have improved their income processes, there is an element with which they cannot deal.  The sum of &euro;121 million is in the performance management space because we must manage income and seek to management the budget we have rather than the one we would like to have, but we are satisfied that the sum of &euro;121 million does not broadly constitute a performance management issue for hospital groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting.

Governments make decisions to do things in particular years.

I am not asking for specific details in any one year.  Why have the overruns more or less tripled since 2014 and remained at that level?

Anyone in Ireland who is running a business, a nursing home or a charity would ask himself or herslef that question.  He or she would say he or she was overspending by a bit, but now we are overspending by a huge sum and it has stayed there.  Something has changed and we need to understand it.<\/p> <p>  I want to go through the chronology to understand how it happened.  In 2017 the D&aacute;il voted through a health budget, on the basis of which the HSE produced a national service plan which under legislation needs to fall within the budget allocated.  In fairness to the HSE, at the front of that service plan it raised serious concerns about the risk of a potential overspend and here we are with an overspend of &euro;700 million.  When the national service plan was presented to the Minister for Health with all of the associated risks flagged, did he go back to ask the HSE to revise it to one that would deal with and make provision for the risks identified?  Anyone watching this debate who is running a business, a charity or a GAA team anywhere in the country knows that when someone is budgeting and dealing with a chaotic world where unforeseen things happen, as they do in the health sector and everywhere else, they make provision for this.  Anyone running a hospital knows that it is necessary to make provision for a certain amount of overtime to cover emergencies and so forth.  The D&aacute;il voted through a budget of over &euro;14 billion.  The national service plan produced for the Minister mentioned serious risks about the potential for an overspend.  We now have that overspend.  Was the HSE instructed to go back and come up with a budget that would make appropriate provision for the risks it had foreseen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#N00200","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Desmond to comment, but, first, while I am not trying to be difficult, unfortunately, the public health care system does not hold to the Deputy's analogy of someone running a coffee shop, a GAA club, a charity or a business.

I am not saying the Deputy's question is not valid in the sense that there are questions that need to be answered, but the analogy does not really hold.  He would have to compare us with other public healthcare systems.  He mentioned a specific point several times which is called out in the service plan, that we do not have, nor do we ever hold, a contingency provision.  We are not in a position to do so.  In the private sector a contingency provision for an organisation with a budget of &euro;17 billion would be something in the order of 2% to 4%, which for us would be a sum in the order of between &euro;300 and &euro;600 million.

We can certainly show the movement of staff over any period, but the Deputy's general point is absolutely correct.  It is possible to predict, or make estimates of the required staffing level to retain the existing level of staff and demographics.  The Estimates and planning process has two large components across the public sector.  The first runs up to budget day, where Departments and agencies like the HSE set out a view of what is required for the following year.  The second then is budget day, which tells one what is available.  The planning piece is then about how one fits the demands as best one can within what is available.<\/p> <p>  The HSE can make estimates and assumptions about what the costs will be in the following year on both sides of that process.  Without looking to offer excuses, the health service is large and complex.  Its system challenges are well documented and we are working on that.  Progress is being made, albeit slowly because of the scale of the system.  We rely on more than 2,000 organisations - 50 of them very large - to deliver the overall service.  We do not ask them all to feed into the forecasting estimates process, but we do ask a number of them.  Any future-focused exercise carries risk.  Typically when the service plan is made, data are available for August and September, so we are looking 15 or 16 months ahead.  One makes assumptions.  Given the scale of our budget, every margin of error of 0.1% is about &euro;15 million.  That is a big margin.<\/p> <p>  In the context of all that, for the HSE preparing bids and service plan estimates, and obviously for those in the Department and other colleagues who review them, one is looking at a set of estimates and assumptions.  In terms of calculating the value improvement programme target of &euro;346 million in the service plan, we went through an iterative process which looked at what was the level of service it could currently provide with the available funding, what level of activity within that could be tailored to fit the funding and what level of activity was almost entirely driven by demand.  The health service, as the committee knows, is complex.  It is the provider of last resort, the provider of 24-7 services and the place of safety.  There are a number of areas, including emergency departments in hospitals, disability, residential placements and similar areas in which a level of activity will happen even if there is not specific funding for it.  Through that iterative process, we determined there was a need for savings of about &euro;346 million.  It was set out in three tranches.  The first was the more immediate and urgent priority, that was about &euro;77 million.  As I said in the opening statement, we would expect to deliver about &euro;60 million of that.

One of the issues about which I am very concerned in the HSE is the growth in staff numbers since December 2014.  My understanding is that there are now 12,000 additional people working in the HSE, of whom over 2,600 of them are working in the area of administration and management.  In the past three to four years I have not seen a clear plan being set out by the HSE for where it needs to increase its workforce.  Yes, we have heard about increasing the numbers of nurses and doctors, but in the area of administration generally I have not seen an overall plan.  If we take it that there are an extra 12,000 people working in the HSE, the additional cost is roughly &euro;600 million per annum, but I am open to correction on that figure.  I am not clear on the stage at which there was a plan set out for the key areas in which personnel were required.  It seems to have been very much hit and miss and a case of whoever shouted the loudest got additional staff.  The number of staff in the area of administration and management has jumped from 15,000 to 17,600.  I am concerned about the lack of planning in that regard.  I have not seen any overall plan for how it is going to progress in the next few years.<\/p> <p>  When we are talking about planning, are we still only working on a one or two-year basis without having an overall objective?  In the area of computerisation we have focused on employing additional staff, while we do not appear to have an overall plan, or certainly it is very vague.  We are way behind other health services throughout Europe.  In Denmark they worked out that their computerisation programme was saving a huge amount of money each year and they have been at it since 1996.  I have not seen one coming from the HSE.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the State Claims Agency, Mr. Mulvany has said it is an additional cost.  The agency is able to predict the value of cases well in advance of being settled.<\/p><p>As such, it should be able to flag well in advance of drafting a budget what will be paid out in the coming year.  It has already made out for the next five to six years what it predicts the level of claims will be.  I am a little surprised that the figure is &euro;32 million for the agency.  It is a huge figure.  I imagine it has not got its figures that wrong in predicting the value of claims.  As such, when the HSE corresponds with the agency before it prepares its budget, the agency is surely able to provide a good guideline for what is needed.  Mr. Mulvany might clarify the issue.<\/p><p> I am not sure if any effort is being made by the HSE to deal with the following.  There is a lack of capacity to make decisions.  A huge amount of time and effort is wasted which results in the waste of a huge amount of money.  I gave the recent example to the committee of 12 people within the HSE having to have a meeting in Dublin about an issue which had been raised 18 months earlier.  That meeting was cancelled two days beforehand because one person had moved to a new job within the HSE and could not, therefore, attend.  The meeting was cancelled which resulted in a huge loss of time in planning for it and everyone organising for it.  I find that it is consistently the case in the HSE that people are not able to make decisions and that a huge amount of time is wasted.  How can the organisation be made more efficient?  We do not seem to have done any major work on that issue in the past few years.<\/p><p> Deputy Donnelly referred to the sudden increase in figures in the past few years.  We are all concerned about this continuing into the future.  If we are planning a 12-month budget, we should be able to plan carefully in order that there will be no overrun.  We have the figures for changing demographics and the number of people with disabilities.  We also have the figures for the huge numbers of elderly parents looking after people with disabilities, which will mean a huge demand on services in the next few years.  Another issue I encounter a great deal is the lack of access to respite care for carers once their children with disabilities reach 18 years of age.  We have known for ten years how many are in that cohort and would reach the age of 18 years, but no planning seems to have been done to make provision for them.  These are issues about which I am concerned.<\/p><p> Mr. Mulvany referred to savings in healthcare organisations and hospital groups of &euro;37 million under the value improvement programme.  Can we have detailed figures for savings within the HSE?  I have not seen a huge amount in savings.  It is easy to impose savings on healthcare groups and voluntary organisations by simply setting a budget and providing it.  However, I do not see the same effort being made to make savings in sections of the HSE.  It is an issue about which I am concerned.  There are over 2,500 organisations which rely on HSE funding.  While it is very easy for the HSE to dictate and important that we get value for money from these organisations, the same set of rules does not appear to apply to internal sections of the HSE.  I seek clarification in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#P01900","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I will take the Senator's questions in reverse order.  On the figure of &euro;37 million in savings, when I refer to community healthcare organisations and hospital groups, I mean the HSE.  The community health care organisations are part of the statutory HSE, of which hospital groups are also part, albeit 16 involve large voluntary hospitals which are funded under section 38.  The figure of &euro;37 million is across the HSE and some of it will also be across certain voluntary organisations.<\/p> <p>  With reference to administration, planning and ICT, the HSE has set out an e-health Ireland strategy which is very clear on how to develop and invest in both clinical and non-clinical ICT, with a view to obtaining all of the returns from it, including efficiencies.  That plan is in place and we are making progress with the Department's assistance in seeking to have it funded.  It was announced not that long ago that there would be an EIB loan to assist in its funding.  There is a long-term ICT plan.  We also prepare three-year corporate plans.  It is not just about relying on the annual service plan, albeit that is also in place.  It is probably fair to say we do not yet have a single overarching plan for the workforce setting out specifically where we want to go with administration and management staff.  That is something that needs to be closed.  However, I do not accept that it is simply a matter of he who shouts the loudest.  We must remember that administrative staff categories include everyone from the grade 3 personnel one meets at reception in one's clinic all the way up to people at my level and some staff we would otherwise count as technical or professional, including engineers, HR staff and accountants.  It is not just all senior general managers, albeit the system, clearly, must be managed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":137,"content":"<p>The argument was put to me about additional administrative staff in clinics.

Certainly, we can set out the movement at all grades in the area of administration, if that would be of help.<\/p> <p>  On the State Claims Agency, I am not for one minute suggesting it does not predict its costs.  Those costs can be somewhat difficult to predict and, depending on which actuarial assumptions are used, can vary a great deal.  There were periods during which there was uncertainty about some costs.  The fundamental issue with the State Claims Agency which is a part of the NTMA concerns when the Government will fund the costs which arise.  Will they be funded at the start of the year or through the Supplementary Estimates process?  It is accepted that it is a cost which is funded by central government.  In other cases the equivalent amount would not actually be included in the main operational Vote.  For example, the figure for public sector pensions might not be included in the main operational Vote.  In the health service they just are.<\/p> <p>  On the lack of capacity to make decisions, I do not have the details of the specific example given by the Senator, but I am not saying it did not occur.

It is a huge problem, particularly for parents who are now entering into the last part of their lives.  If things could be planned together and with a guarantee that their children would be looked after when they either pass away or get too ill to mind them, it would give them great comfort.  I ask the witnesses to look at this.<\/p> <p>  In Mr. Mulvany's first point, he talked about the overrun relating to unfunded cost growths.  Does he have an exact cost for the cross-Border initiative?  I know it is an EU incentive and, obviously, plans are up in the air now with Brexit.  Even though this is a good scheme, I often wonder, if the HSE must pay anyway, is there any way around planning for this such that the money could be made available to people who are unable to travel, say, to Belfast or particularly from Cork South-West - it is a long journey to Belfast - to have their cataracts treated in the South?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#R01200","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":152,"content":"<p>To take the Deputy's last question first, I will provide her with some figures as to the total.

How can this be adjusted, and is the process fit for purpose?<\/p> <p>  My second question concerns health insurance, which, I think, will be estimated this year to be down &euro;100 million.  Is that &euro;100 million from &euro;621 million of a previous year?  In Sl&aacute;intecare, there is a proposal that private care be removed from public hospitals and it is outlined how the Department and the HSE would fill that gap.  However, that gap is getting smaller now, by &euro;100 million this year.  Is that the case?<\/p> <p>  Finally, I think there is a &euro;50 million increase in funding to the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS.

The Department and the HSE strive to achieve what is feasible and realistic within the allocation provided by the Government.<\/p> <p>  As for the examples in the disability sector and other sectors, many challenges are continuous in terms of the ongoing upward demand in such areas - for instance, to create enough space to provide the services at community level in order that the dependency on the placements and the residential component can gradually over time be reduced while at the same time recognising that this latter area is the subject of significant regulation, as it should be, and presents its own challenges in terms of catering for people's need to have placements in residential settings.  The objective is to frame the service plan in 2019 from the point of view of the most efficient use of the resources available to the health sector and to have an examination from the beginning across all these areas.  Mr. Mulvany alluded to this in the context of the value improvement programme as it relates to where funding needs to be spent on an ongoing basis and the possibilities and the capacity to achieve greater efficiencies in this area.  This would guide the development of the service plan.  As part of that, it would be accepted in all health services that there should be an objective of achieving efficiency savings in any event.<\/p><p>It is certainly challenging but at the same time the legislation requires a service plan and it provides a significant over-arching framework and discipline within which the HSE presents to the Minister as required.  That is the structure as it exists now along with the other objectives.<\/p><p>  Mr. Mulvany might give some detail on health insurance.  Similarly, on the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, we may be able to provide the Chairman with some details on the composition of that figure.  The matter of private health insurance is now being examined by the De Buitl&eacute;ir group.  There are legal and other issues which come to bear on that which are also being considered by the HSE and the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#R02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Desmond","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>On PCRS, that figure is the variance at the end of August and is an overrun on its costs.  Typically about 70% to 80% of costs in that area are the various drug-related schemes, despite the huge work and savings in the base level costs that the PCRS makes on an ongoing basis.  The scheme drives value in the price of drugs and use of generics and biosimilars.  We can set it out the figures across the schemes for the Chairman.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Desmond covered health insurance.  At its high point, the acute hospital income from private insurance was about &euro;630 million.  That will be less for last year.  We have not closed that gap and the service planning process will have to try to do so.  However, to be clear, if we have a &euro;100 million gap in that area and we close that, that represents a &euro;100 million cost that must come from elsewhere or money that cannot be invested in something else.

I am somewhat concerned about some of the answers.  It is bad budgeting practice to repeatedly fall short of the target on either side, unless there is some serious explanation.  Take the PCRS.  Drug costs can and will impact.  We need a counterbalance such as a reduction in the costs through the things this committee has discussed so many times, such as the power of European Union as a procurement lever.  Over the course of any year, drugs come on the market and cause problems.  There will be patients for whom those drugs are suitable.  A practice should be established whereby an immediate assessment is done as to how the budget will be affected, rather than waiting until the end of the year to see how much of an overrun there is, or if there is a surplus.<\/p> <p>  I have been around the health services for a long time.  I remember the health boards and the overruns during that period.  There were overruns as far back as 2000.  There must be a time when we identify what practice is repeatedly causing this problem, and deal with it.  If we do not deal with it, it goes on forever and in 20 years' time, someone will be sitting here talking about the same thing.  <\/p> <p>  I remember the American politician who spoke of known knowns and unknown unknowns.  At a certain point, we need to know where the particular bodies are buried so that we can navigate our budget accordingly.  Take the issue of finding accommodation for certain people who require it after their parents have passed on.  The HSE deals with that.  Crooksling has the capacity to cater for up to 100 people, yet the HSE wants to close it and is undermining it and slowly strangling it to do so.  That accommodation is already there and there would be no capital costs involved at all.  However, the HSE says it wants a different system in a different place but to what benefit?  I do not know.  I was on the visiting committee of that nursing home many years ago.  It is still structurally sound.  An engineers report might say that is not the case but it is.  We must sometimes dispute the opinions of engineers as well as economists and financial controllers.  However, there is no use in saying on the one hand that we have a budgetary overrun and that we are providing alternative accommodation when we already have accommodation that is built and paid for.  I would like clarification on that.<\/p> <p>  The greater incidence of treatment for an ageing population was raised and I accept that but it must be possible to budget for it accurately.  The information is already there.  Unless there is a particular issue that we are not being told about something must be done.<\/p> <p>  There is a simple way to deal with matters relating to the State Claims Agency.  How are the overruns of its expenditure monitored?  Is this in line with neighbouring jurisdictions?  If not, if they are above or below, then we must ask the reason.<\/p> <p>  Private insurance and providers' reluctance to deal with emergency cases was raised.  I would like to know more on this.  It looks as though the public health sector could be subsidising the private health sector, if we are to assume what I think that means.<\/p> <p>  It must be possible within the public health sector to take a hospital, for instance, and compare it with the private sector.  It must be possible to make a comparison on a like for like basis.  I do not accept that it cannot be done and it is like comparing chalk and cheese or apples and strawberries.  It is possible and needs to be done as a matter of urgency because otherwise we will continue to embarrass ourselves by suggesting that something is wrong that we cannot identify it.<\/p> <p>  My last point relates to my own hobby horse of how the chain of command operates within the health services.  If a consultant wants access to facilities in a theatre or to radiography, for instance, and cannot avail of those services, that represents a loss of money and potential lost revenue.  If one holds up the facilities that are there, and does not use them for any period over a working day, that is a financial loss and a liability on the system.  I would like to see someone identify those blockages once and for all.  They may be explainable and it may be possible to explain them away, but I have not heard anyone do so yet.  I am concerned that we continue on with the same issue year after year, and we are no closer to getting to the bottom of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#S00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Mulvany or Mr. Desmond care to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#S00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":165,"content":"<p>There are several questions which span both agencies.

Within that there is necessarily a management process throughout the year to ensure that, as much as possible, those services are provided within the overall allocation provided by the Government.  In addition, as I mentioned earlier, the efficiencies which necessarily should be a part of any service moving forward are built into the system.

Some &euro;60 million can be accounted for in terms of targeted savings.<\/p><p>There appear to be opportunities for savings across the system.  For example, I spoke with a senior consultant recently who prescribes very expensive drugs and who produced a paper stating that he could change his way of working and save approximately &euro;5 million on the prescribing that is being done but that he could not get anyone from the Department or the HSE to meet him and take it seriously.  I see examples of savings across the system all the time.  I also see examples of process improvements that would ultimately lead to savings.  For example, clinicians at Tallaght Hospital wanted to introduce a triage room.  Such rooms are part of standard practice in emergency medicine.  It took five years to get the room commissioned, which gives rise to issues regarding patient safety and also funding.  The issues relating to funding arise because there are missed savings in such circumstances.  What is being done to try to tap into the efforts of administrators, doctors, nurses, porters and managers?

The HSE is trying to promote a culture that allows people to interact in respect of some of these issues.  However, an aspect of this is a cultural matter relating to values rather than value for money.  Are the different parts of the team - cleaner, porter or consultant - in a hospital all able to speak frankly to each other?  There is a piece around that and how that is changed over time.  Work is under way on that.  A values and action programme is under way.  It is not about money, it is the overall culture.<\/p> <p>  People have different views about what constitutes a saving.  There are savings that simply take cash out while others are valuable but what they mean is that we can get extra for less than would be the case.  Some of those savings will actually increase the cost.  I take the point that we must pursue the stuff that is safety or quality driven in any event .  That must happen.<\/p> <p>  We are going to continue the value improvement programme.  It is accepted that we need to energise it more.  It is clearly set out in the service plan that this ought to identify additional levels of savings beyond those that our system generates on an ongoing basis throughout country at hospital and ward level and in the community and psychiatry, not all of which we can capture, cost, measure or report.  Part of our system is about continuously making improvements at individual team level.  That is something to be encouraged.  We cannot report on all of that and some of it gets swallowed up because something else happens or costs grow and they are not funded for one or the other.  We have a substantial amount of work to do in the context of trying to develop and promote savings initiatives, but significant savings are already being driven in parts of the health service.  The &euro;60 million we will get this year in value improvement is not insignificant.  It is a problem when we compare it with the overall target.  Hundreds of millions of euro in savings are being delivered by our primary care reimbursement service every year to try to contain drug costs so that we can allow more new drugs in that are needed.  Those savings are built into the base.  Their targets are driven by the base so they do not close any of the gaps.  We would be wrong to say that there is only &euro;60 million worth of savings in clinical service.

If we are talking about controlling costs and getting value for money, if we do not have a funded workforce plan for the single biggest grade within the health service at this point in the proceedings, that figure of &euro;346 million was never likely to be achieved, as there is no plan in place for the number of staff and, therefore, there is no capacity to control agency staff numbers, overtime or any of the other steps that have to be taken to make up the shortfall.

We considered those previously and, as I recall, it was brought to our attention by the chief executive of one of the hospital groups - do not quote me on that as I cannot remember exactly who it was but it was stated in a submission that was made to us - that individual hospitals and hospital groups were given targets to collect money from private sources - I assume from health insurers and whatever else - and that stretch targets had been added to those targets, whereby if the target was &euro;5 million it was stretched out by a certain percentage.  Is the HSE still doing that?  Does it still impose that requirement on chief executives?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#X00400","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":281,"content":"<p>The Deputy has raised a few points.  We have not increased the income target for private maintenance income, which is the target that is set for all the hospitals, in the past two years, partly because it would not be prudent to do so given the difficulties we are having with private insurers and their campaigns, and other actions.  It is important to note that the private income charge is a legislation-based charge.  Once somebody is covered by the charge, the hospital has to levy it and pursue it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#X00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I am aware of that.  I am not talking about the actual charge.  I am talking about stretch income targets, the target versus the figure.  There is a difference.  Mr. Mulvany knows that.  There is a difference between collecting all the money which HSE is obliged to do, and that is separate, but setting a target for the amount of money causes a problem with regard to how the HSE is going to plan, as a bizarre incentive is imposed on public servants to impose a target on other public servants to collect money out of the private sector.  If those stretch income targets are still in place, I would be worried because it is not a prudent way to plan and because of various other reasons that I will not go into here.  If Mr. Mulvany is saying the targets have not changed in the past two years, I can only assume they include the stretch income targets.  We reviewed this less than a year ago and the stretch income targets were included.  If the HSE is aiming to hit a figure of savings and it is massively wide of the mark, which it is, and it is counting in the stretch income targets in that figure, that brings me back to the point that the witnesses have not been able to provide an explanation as to where that figure came from, which is worrying.  If stretch income targets are part of it, is it not time that the HSE acknowledged that it is not working and that it should try to figure out another way to proceed?<\/p> <p>  Various initiatives took place a number of years ago and Professor Drumm was one person who initiated them.  They included having a conversation with staff.  We spent a long number of days in Government Buildings where we were given the use of a room and health service workers came in and talked about the way on-the-ground savings could be achieved.  It was around the time the moratorium on recruitment was imposed.  Much of what we heard were simple changes and how the staff envisaged such simple changes could be made.  I am not talking about the big issues, such as the out-of-control agency staff bill, but some changes that could be achieved at the level of the ward or the primary care centre.  Suggestions were made by staff but they were not followed up on.<\/p> <p>  That might be something the HSE would consider ensuring is followed up in the context of a plan.  If, say, a staff nurse in Letterkenny General Hospital has an idea for the way she would improve the running of a ward, that might not be a feasible consideration as we would all have the idea that if more staff were brought in, we would not have to deal with constant crises, but if she or, say, a porter in Tallaght Hospital has a worthwhile idea, how could they realistically feed that into the organisation and how would it be taken on board?  The top-down approach was tried and, with respect, failed.  Perhaps Mr. Mulvany would reflect on that and consult the representative organisations as many people have good ideas.  The target is quite ambitious.  Mr. Mulvany has just admitted that and he might need all hands to the pump.  The organisation has missed it for this year but there is always next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#X00600","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":283,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's question on whether we would reflect and consider better ways to engage with staff at the coalface around what savings are practical, that sounds very sensible.  To the extent that hospitals and community services are not already doing that, that is something we will take away from this meeting.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the stretch income targets, and perhaps it is a language issue, but the point I am trying to get across is that there is an obligation to levy the charge once the individual meets certain criteria.  It is not as if people should be levying a charge in some way that is a stretch.  Their task is to levy the charge when it is appropriate to do so.  When I said we have not changed the target, I mean the &euro;345 million is not dependent on somebody achieving a stretch target.  If we were to lower the income targets, we would have to find more savings because the income targets and the income that has been raised support the costs of providing the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#X00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":284,"content":"<p>It is not the income targets, it is the stretch target.

That gives rise to what happens if there are two patients in an accident and emergency department and only one bed is available where both patients have similar levels of acuity and one patient has private health insurance but the other patient does not.<\/p><p>When there are two identical patients, there is a perverse incentive for the patient with private health insurance or the means to pay privately to go into that bed because the stretch income target will then be met.  This is not about whether people are collecting money at local level.  That money is being collected.  This is about the setting of targets and the stretching of those income targets, which creates a perverse incentive for people to prioritise.  I am not suggesting that clinicians do it on any basis other than clinically, but in a situation where there are two people, both at the same level of acuity, and one bed, a perverse incentive has been created by the finance side of the house for people on the other side of the house to give that bed, in that scenario, to the patient who has private health insurance.

Once there is any charge, there is a potential, all other things being equal, for the private patient to get into the public room.

There have been many decades when we would have been behind that.  I mentioned the &euro;3 billion or &euro;4 billion that we spend on social care and to what extent that is equally reported with other countries.  With some of these measures, one is often measuring total spend on health.  We are well down the league with regard to publicly funded healthcare expenditure versus total healthcare expenditure.  Part of the question is whether we spend too much on health for what we get back.<\/p><p>I refer to two of the most expensive things in a healthcare sector.  The same OECD data - data have to be used carefully - says that we have significantly fewer doctors per 1,000 population than the OECD average.  We rank somewhere around 26 out of 34 on that.  We have significantly fewer hospital beds, which is the single most expensive resource in any healthcare system.  We rank 24 out of 34 on that.  We also have the lowest increase over an eight year period which puts us at 31.  That is using the same OECD data.  I am not saying that means we do not get sufficient resources.  We get more than &euro;15 billion but I am saying that one cannot simply rely on OECD figures to provide the answer.  Again when one looks at the hospitals, the OECD figures say that Ireland had a consistent bed occupancy of 94%.  We are well ahead of the 77% OECD average.  The doctors will tell one that at more than 85% bed occupancy on a consistent basis, one is demonstrating a system that is under stress.  That is in the Department's capacity review document and that is a recipe for both efficiency, cost, and potential quality issues.  That is all OECD data.  Is it consistent?  I do not know.  It is not simple to settle that question.  I agree with Deputy Durkan that it is something that a proper body, such as the ESRI, if it is not doing it already, should seek to answer.

How have we come to a situation where we have fewer hospital beds per 1,000 population than most European countries?  Experts, including medical experts, have told us that we have too many hospital beds and we have been told that for a number of years.  The Chairman knows that as well as I do.  I remember being involved in the initial stages of planning for a hospital some years ago.  I thought at the time that we did not need beds given the expert opinion that was made available.  I had to make a decision that that was not going to work and I was right.<\/p> <p>  It is all very well telling mere D&aacute;il Deputies that this is not comparing like with like, that it is apples and oranges and that it is very difficult to solve it.  As long as we keep on that route, we will never provide a health service that is efficient, effective and accessible.  We need to drill down into the issues, find out where the problem exists, make the comparisons and solve the issues.<\/p> <p>  What is regularly trotted out is the demographics and the significant increase in the number of older people.  I am not sensitive about this topic, although the Chairman may think I am.  Nobody ever mentions the significant increase in the younger population, which is at least comparable and counter-balances the increase in the older population.  If somebody tells me there is no increase in the young population, that person is wrong.  One does not have to go into the statistics to find out that information because it is readily available.  We have a growing young population because of the cohort of people who returned to this country or came into the country.  They are counter-balancing in a positive way the expenditure on health.<\/p> <p>  Somebody needs to tell us what the situation is, instead of making excuses and saying this is the cause of all our problems.  It is not.  Drugs are an issue that needs to be dealt with effectively now.  On the question on the State Claims Agency claims, I do not accept the notion that we cannot compare like with like in that regard.  It is quite simple to check with the neighbouring jurisdictions.  There are norms and averages.  We can get those averages, even if we have to do it ourselves, and find out exactly how they have lower costs than we have.  What is the cause of the problem?  Deputy O'Connell referred to that matter as well.<\/p> <p>  I note the growth in staff numbers following the lifting of the moratorium.  If we are to get to where we can provide a reasonable health service, we have to pay staff and so on.  We accept all that but there are other issues that are virtually a diversionary tactic in that they just come up.  I remember them from when I was on a health board years ago.  The same old story would come up time and again.  I do not accept that.<\/p> <p>  My final point is on emergency residential places.  I will never understand why it is more efficient and effective to demolish a building.  Over the past number of years several older buildings were demolished in this city and replaced with newer buildings.  These new buildings are no more efficient and, in some case, the structures are worse.<\/p> <p>  Let us not forget that a building was leased for the Department of Health for a period of time during which it was not occupied.  I know how that can happen but we are back to the old story of projections.  It should not happen.  If anybody in  business rented a building in anticipation of being in it by a particular time, that is the only time for which the person will pay.  That person will not rent a building and keep it until such time as her or she has enough money to pay for it.  It does not work that way.  We need to break down the barriers that are there.  <\/p> <p>  I believe we are told what happens to be available at the time and we walk away.  At a certain time, one gets tired of walking away.  If one has been around for a long time, one remembers all these things and hearing the same points made.  One asks oneself where did I hear that before?  Why do I not want to hear it again?  It is because it does not work and it does not tally.  The health service is an organisation which has a significant budget and we need to deal with such situations as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#Z00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Durkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018102400002#Z00300","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I will respond to a number of factual points raised by Deputy Durkan.

Absolutely, the ageing population brings with it the great benefits of what the health sector has achieved in recent years with longevity but that longevity brings certain costs, as we have explained.  With younger people, the shift towards a primary care delivery and care in the community, which is underpinned and reaffirmed by Sl&aacute;intecare, has to be the basis on which we try to develop a service that is closer to people in the community and prevents another generation of people moving into services which are more costly and not appropriate.

I look forward to working with the joint committee in a spirit of accountability, openness and transparency and a way that will improve the policing service we provide for society.  I have supplied written comments, on which I want to enlarge somewhat.  One of the themes on which I will pick up is how policing is changing, as identified by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  Policing is moving towards dealing with harm and vulnerability, as set out clearly by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  It is a recognised phenomenon across Europe.  The commission has set out the next steps for us as an organisation.  It will be a roadmap for us in the next three to five years for the policing service we will provide.  Within it, we need to have an understanding of the demands placed on us, how they might change in the next three to five years and how we will deploy our resources and what they will look like in terms of the people we employ and their skills to deliver a policing service.  These are big management problems, with which many police services are wrestling, but there are two particular strengths we have which I should highlight in the context of how policing is changing.  The first is that we still retain a strong link with local communities.  That has been very evident to me and we wish to retain and strengthen it.  As I visited Garda stations and offices throughout the country, I met high quality people.  It is clear from our own cultural audit that they, too, are fully committed to providing an excellent policing service for the people of Ireland and are determined to do so.<\/p> <p>  I have arrived against the backdrop of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, our own modernisation and renewal programme and cultural audit, as well as the report of the Charleton tribunal of two weeks ago and the tribunal's recommendations.  The first three documents set out what has to be done and a roadmap for how that work should be taken on.  I have read the Charleton tribunal's report and the last few pages, in particular, seem to have been written directly for me.  They are a clarion call for action.  We will take action to reform the policing service provided and reassure the people of Ireland that we are here to protect them and do our very best for them as public servants and that we are fully determined to do so.<\/p> <p>  Compared with any of my contemporaries, I am fortunate that I have arrived at a time of investment.  There is considerable investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is an organisation that is growing, which is almost unique among law enforcement agencies.  There is a responsibility on me and the rest of the organisation to use these resources efficiently and effectively and in such a way that will also promote confidence in the policing service we provide and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is important in the behaviours we exhibit both inside and outside the organisation.  At every opportunity I emphasise the importance of the code of ethics.  It is a living document which is there to guide us on the behaviours we expect internally but, more importantly, the public expects of us and which we must live and demonstrate to them every single day.<\/p> <p>  For my part, I am motivated by public service.  Policing is my public service.  I applied and have been appointed.  I am here to serve and lead An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the next stage of its development, all with a view to making sure we are doing our very best to protect the people of Ireland, the vulnerable in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#C00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Garda Commissioner on his appointment.

To pick one, there is a concentration on district policing.  We hope that district policing provides a local, community-focused service to the public but within a divisional structure.  A division should be self-sufficient for the majority of what it has to do.  Obviously at times the whole service may have to come in behind a district to assist it with big public events or a series of criminal outrages for instance, but by and large a division should be self-sufficient and should have sufficient resources so that the divisional commander and the chief superintendent have enough resources to provide a locally tailored service to the public.  That would be based on the district model but the divisions should be autonomous in terms of the provision of the local policing service.  They should have their own human resources, HR, and financial support for example, but all within a corporate framework.  If I set the corporate framework for how we go about our business it will then be for the divisional commanders, the chief superintendents and their staff to deliver on the service with all of the local characteristics that people will require.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":341,"content":"<p>Are there any other areas where the Commissioner would have that type of nuance or variation in interpretation compared to the report?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#D00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":342,"content":"<p>We have picked out small nuances only.

Within the roadmap of the report there is a very strong emphasis on community policing.  I am interested in getting some concrete examples from the Commissioner.  My personal experience with this is that community policing delivered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works very well occasionally.  It works very well because somebody comes in, he or she is enthusiastic, is on the ground and working with the community but it is never envisaged as a career or a long-term posting.  That garda moves on and gets promotion.  It is the type of job that the young man or woman coming from Templemore does and then moves on from and therefore it is stop-start.  A gap arises when they move on and the post is not filled or it gets diverted.  Under the proposal that is there, the whole force re-emphasises and refocuses on community policing.  How does the Commissioner envisage that we would be changing structures in a more concrete manner to deliver that, as distinct from the way in which most communities would feel that it works at the moment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#D00400","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":344,"content":"<p>Community policing will undoubtedly be the ethos of the organisation but also, as the Deputy has said, we have to deliver on this structurally as well.  The particular characteristic of the service that we must deliver is that we have both urban and rural areas where there is deprivation, high crime and the problems attendant with those such as drug abuse, alcohol abuse and mental health issues - all of which require a multi-agency response.  Community policing should play its part there and in effect, the garda&iacute; who engage in that become specialists and should be regarded as such because skills are needed in order to work with other agencies and there are also community problem solving skills.  It is not just a post that a garda will fill for a period of time.  It is specialism but it depends on relationships as well.<\/p> <p>  The rural areas are somewhat different because there will be a more hybrid model.  Garda&iacute; in rural areas will not only have that problem solving, community responsibility, they will also have a response capability.  We are still working on this but I envisage dedicated community policing teams built up against the need that we see in critical areas where those interventions can make a real impact.  That can be clearly seen in urban areas and in areas of deprivation.  Those areas have a high demand for our services but a high demand for other services as well.  The commission of policing takes that on further in terms of widening the definition of policing and widening the scope for who may engage in policing.  Much of that is down to ensuring that the State's energies are focused on the right places and towards the right people at the right time.  There are areas and individuals with high demand and we need to collectively work together to see how we can best address that to improve the quality of their lives, along with the quality of the lives of the people who live around them and community policing is a big piece of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I have another question linking to that if the Chair will indulge me.  In the police service in which the Commissioner formerly served there was an extensive programme of the closing of police stations.

In the context of refocusing on communities, both in urban and rural areas and in the context of delivering the type of service the Commissioner described, what is his view on the need for additional Garda stations, the locations in which they might be needed, whether we need to radically increase the number of Garda stations and whether that type of community policing that the Commissioner described can be delivered with the Garda station profile that we have at the moment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#D00600","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I have not come to a final conclusion on that.  I certainly do not feel any particular pressure to close stations.  I should retain the stations that I have and then examine what is going on in terms of the demand they are meeting and the reassurance they are providing as well.  People take comfort from having a Garda station in their location and there is no doubt about that but I have to look towards where the new demands are and where the issues are in respect of which the intervention of the Garda will make a difference.  It also comes down to our resources and how we best use them.  I refer to my earlier comments on the demand that we are dealing with, how that demand is changing and how we are best placed to meet it.  It is not necessarily the case that building new stations and reopening stations is the way to go forward.  We want to be sure that our service is responsive, that people feel that it is approachable and that it is providing a local service.  That is undoubtedly true but at the same time stations are expensive and they draw on the public purse a lot.  I could not make any promises here today that there will be a wholesale reopening of stations because it depends on the need and the demand that it is filling as opposed to just making a promise that we will reopen stations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for his answer and I acknowledge his remarks on investment going into the Garda.

Obviously, where there is a station, there is reassurance for the community in seeing Garda patrols backwards and forwards and it feels there is visibility.  I can look to my last service, in which a lot of closures were driven by economics in keeping police stations open.  I do not feel the same pressure on me because we are in a time of investment.

The cultural audit flagged how committed they were to public service.  There is also the confidence people have in their local garda&iacute;, which is important.  There is probably less confidence in senior management.  It is for me and the rest of the senior leadership team to work on improving the leadership of the organisation.  Therefore, the second piece is that we have strong community contacts.  Beyond that, a process of digitisation and digital investment is required as a lot of time and effort are spent in dealing with paper.  When we talk about demand, it is very difficult in a paper based system to understand entirely what it is as we do not have the statistics we need to understand how much time we are spending on particular calls.  We are moving towards computer aided despatch, a system which will give us far more information on what we are spending our time on in patrolling and responding to incidents.  I require a lot more information and having a process of digitisation is the way to do it.  Beyond that, there is the training and development of our staff.  There are a lot of online systems coming on-stream that require training, but we also want to increase the focus on the human rights aspects of policing, as well as on the code of ethics and how central it is.  Everyone is undergoing training on the code of ethics and that process will be completed by the end of the year.  It has been a big commitment by the organisation to deliver it.  The people are good, as is the level of public support.  Some of the systems are old and antiquated, but there is a programme to bring them up to speed.  A paper based system in an organisation of our size, given the demands with which we are dealing, is just not sufficient in the 21st century.  That is what we have to concentrate on.<\/p> <p>  Some of the Garda stations I have visited are not of the standard I would expect.  Some look a bit tired and rundown.

We are staffing that appropriately as we see the threats at this time.<\/p> <p>  There are three areas of concern.  The first is local policing and local reassurance and confidence for people.  I know the Police Service of Northern Ireland is also concerned about this.  People living close to the Border will be worried and will have a fear that their area could be raided from the other side, backwards and forwards, and there is the fear of crime and the travelling criminal crossing the Border.<\/p> <p>  There is also the reality of night life in Derry, where a lot of young people travel across the Border to engage in night life there but there is also attendant crime.  It is about managing those scenarios where a serious crime may be committed in one jurisdiction but the perpetrators are located in the other jurisdiction.  How do we manage the evidential issues that emerge from that?  We want to know how well the European treaties, particularly around criminal justice, are going to withstand Brexit or what will go in their place.<\/p> <p>  Organised crime is the third area of concern.  Any change in trading tariffs gives opportunity for smugglers to make illicit profits or to evade tax or duty.  There is an organised crime element to that and any organised crime element on the Border will also provide some additional element of funding to terrorist groups, dissident republicans in particular.

Notwithstanding that, I believe that in the vast majority of cases the local garda still enjoys great trust from the people and the people have great faith in him or her.  People want to see more garda&iacute; in their community.<\/p> <p>  This is also a time that has a lot of potential.  While I do not agree with every single recommendation in the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland report, there are many positive elements which can modernise and transform policing.  One of the major priorities in the recommendations was the emphasis on community policing.  I am a big fan of the community policing model.  I may have a slightly contrary view to Deputy Brophy in that I think the model as it is works reasonably well where it is resourced correctly.  Unfortunately, the number of dedicated community garda&iacute; has fallen by about 40% since 2010 or 2011.  That has undermined the model.

We will be an organisation that focuses on community policing.  All of us will have a community policing ethos.  I recognise what the Deputy says about local confidence in local garda&iacute;, and I want to build on that and make sure it is enhanced going forward.  One of the routes into that is community policing.  As we work out our new divisional and district structure, an integral part of that will be how we will police with the community in each particular district or division.  There will be a focus on local policing whereby service delivery will be focused on the district.  Part of that will be how we manage the community policing element within a particular district.  The Deputy can have assurance of that.  I have seen the initial plans about what divisions will look like going forward, and that is built into them in terms of how we manage local accountability, local responsiveness and dealing with people's concerns at a local level.  That is a given.<\/p> <p>  Community policing, as was said, will be a specialism in some areas depending on the demand.  We see that in the urban areas.  In rural areas, it may be more of a hybrid model where we will just regard all of our response officers as having a community responsibility but also having to attend calls as well.  I was privileged to be in one of our small towns two weeks ago.  The local guard also answered calls but he knew everybody we spoke to on first name terms and he introduced me to dozens of people.  That is community policing.  Everyone knew him by name and he knew and was able to identify and speak to many individuals.  That is what we want to build on.

There is very good work going on.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the overall question, when dealing with such determined organised crime groups, we must come at it on a number of levels.  One element is community policing.  In effect, organised crime always puts a foot down somewhere and leaves a bad trace in a local community.  In part when I speak of critical neighbourhoods where there is high demand, I mean areas where organised crime gangs may try to find shelter or impose their writ on the local community.  Much of our community policing will be about those areas and undermining, in effect, the legend and story of the gangs.

There have been some very significant convictions.<\/p> <p>  On the international aspect, we enjoy good relations with the international partners who engage with us.

The Policing Authority has expressed serious concerns that the Garda renewal and modernisation programme is not fit for purpose, and that not only is the pace of reform too slow but that the vehicle set up by the Garda for reform is not delivering.  On 9 August it stated:<\/p><blockquote>If the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not at this juncture pause ... to reconsider in a determined and focused way the end to which its efforts and resources are being directed, as well as what key enablers and levers it needs to achieve that change, then it is the authority's view that a continuation of the current activity and effort, however well-intentioned, will not deliver the fundamental reform envisaged.<\/blockquote> <p>Essentially, this questions whether the Garda is properly set up with the vehicle it set out to deliver reform, both in terms of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate reports that are a few years old now and the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland document.

These are big information technology projects that are being landed into a public organisation with multiple complex systems.  It would be a challenge for anybody to deliver.<\/p> <p>  Just looking at the digital strategy, there is much under way.  Beyond that there is a human resources piece, which very much relates to workforce modernisation.  It is a major project as well in terms of expanding the organisation and having the required training, in effect, for every new garda who comes in.  There is training and investment in the individual while Garda staff are brought in to displace others at the front line.  There are many plates spinning.

What happened is that the Chief Constable provided an assurance in respect of that vetting and, indeed, my vetting certificates were provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a demonstration of that.  The vetting is there to ensure that one is not open to coercion or blackmail or whatever it might be and that there are no issues surrounding one's private life or affiliations which could give rise to concern.  It is a very thorough process, including both financial and private life checks.  I have undergone that vetting process and been subject to it.

When I worked there, we had very much, if not exactly, the same outlook on dealing with terrorism and organised crime.  I worked very closely with my colleagues in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout my time as assistant chief constable with responsibility for crime.  Information was shared constantly, in fact daily, backwards and forwards all the time.  We enjoyed good relationships.  I did not have a responsibility for national security in Northern Ireland, however, whereas I have responsibility for national security here and for securing the State not only from the threat of terrorism but also from the threat of espionage.  I have a responsibility also for counter-espionage.  Those two latter responsibilities are new to me compared with the role I had in the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  I undertake them very seriously and am briefed on ongoing operations almost daily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I do not know if the Commissioner has answered the final question.

The Commissioner has responded to the publication of the disclosures tribunal report, which, it is fair to say, contains some extraordinary conclusions.  To enumerate them briefly, the tribunal was convinced that there was a campaign of calumny by former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, against Maurice McCabe, in which he was actively aided by former Garda press officer, Superintendent David Taylor, they being in it together, and that Maurice McCabe was repulsively denigrated for being no more than a good citizen and police officer.  The tribunal also found that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs a complete turnaround in its attitude which must be led by senior management.  I ask the Commissioner to respond to that.  How does he intend to lead that complete turnaround?  He referred in his opening statement to the code of ethics.

My behaviour and that of my senior leadership team has a dramatic impact on the organisation, of that there is no doubt.  The first place one looks to is the standards I set and the standards I expect from the senior leadership team and how they spread that throughout the organisation.  There is no point in me saying one thing and doing another.  I cannot talk to sergeants or inspectors about their behaviour if they are able to say that it is hypocrisy on my part to do so because I did X, Y or Z.  It is very clear that the code of ethics is the bedrock of our behaviours.  I take every opportunity to emphasise that and to stress that people need to live those behaviours.<\/p> <p>  We intend to follow through and completely overhaul our discipline code.  The current code creates an atmosphere in which people fear being disciplined.  Instead of proper management intervention, guidance and an organisation that promotes learning, they see an organisation that is punitive towards its staff.  There are structural, systemic changes that we need to make in terms of how the organisation is run.  I have also emphasised the fact that if any individual in the organisation wishes to come forward and whistle blow or make a disclosure, that will be treated with the utmost seriousness.  Indeed, my door is open to individuals should they wish to speak to me in terms of being whistleblowers.<\/p> <p>  People talk about cultural change and the place to start is with the behaviours one expects in an organisation.  We have been very clear, through the introduction of the code of ethics, about what those behaviours should be.

People were really shocked at the strength of the finding against the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, and the fact that someone in his position could be responsible for a campaign of that nature.  It is vitally important that such behaviour is never repeated and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na becomes an organisation that supports whistleblowers.<\/p> <p>  My final question is on overtime, which I have raised with the Minister for Justice and Equality on a number of occasions.  Mr. Harris has introduced a moratorium or an effective ban on overtime as I understand it, between now and the end of this year.  Any overtime request must now be sanctioned by two of the most senior garda&iacute; in the State.  A similar ban was introduced at Christmas last year but this ban is a much lengthier one.  There is also a reduced budget, I believe, for overtime for 2019.  I recognise that Garda budgets are under severe pressure and that in the abstract, too much is being spent on overtime but that is caused by the very real gaps that exist across a number of districts.  According to replies to various parliamentary questions, most Garda districts are still at or below 2011 staffing levels.  It is because of staffing gaps that districts are relying overtime to deliver essential policing services.  I was canvassing yesterday on the south side of Dublin and two issues were flagged to me in terms of the problems this is causing at an operational level.  Problems arose in Inchicore with an operation that was targeting a number of people involved in what appeared to be racially motivated attacks.  In Drimnagh, a call was made to a Garda station on foot of serious anti-social behaviour but the call was not responded to because there were not adequate numbers of garda&iacute; to safely respond.  The Commissioner will not be aware of the specific details of these incidents and I do not expect him to respond in that regard.  I am merely giving some examples of what was flagged with me.  My question is whether Mr. Harris is confident that the overtime ban will not have a very significant impact on the quality of policing and the ability of garda&iacute; to respond to crime between now and the end of the year, particularly with any potential spike in crime, public order issues, or increases in burglaries that often arise around the Christmas period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#J00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":392,"content":"<p>Overtime is sometimes an emotive topic but it should not be thus.  We received a budget at the start of the year.  We overspent the budget and corrective action had to be taken.  That is my responsibility as Accounting Officer.  This is public money and I have to show good management of it.  There is still per roster, which is every four weeks, approximately &euro;7.2 million to &euro;7.3 million available for overtime, so it is not an absolute moratorium.  We have covered what we believe are essential areas but have kept a small pool in the middle for emergencies or pre-planned operations.  People bid in to my colleague, the deputy commissioner, in terms of releasing overtime funds for those operations.  Regrettably, overtime has grown quite considerably over recent years.  I feel an obligation now to get a rope around it, to understand what the money is being spent on and what we are getting for that overtime.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation and the number of staff hours for policing is growing all the time with each release of individuals from the training college.  I have to think carefully about overtime because it can quickly suck dry the ability of the organisation to be proactive in other areas and to spend money on things like training, equipment and other vital areas.  I am not apologising for the cut in overtime.  I regret if it is having an impact on operations but at the same time, that has not been conveyed to me.  Our managers are living within the overtime that is being provided to them.  It will probably be a feature going forward but we have not finalised the budget for 2019 yet.  Overtime will remain in and around the figures outlined but we will have to manage it going forward.  Hopefully, we will have an overtime budget of over &euro;90 million next year but we can quickly overspend that.  Then overtime starts to suck money out of other projects that we want to push forward and that is not where we want to be.  We need to be managing it because not doing so takes away my ability to do other things which are also very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I thank the Garda Commissioner for his responses.

Having been in his post for two months now, what is his view of the current policing oversight architecture?  One of the issues raised in the aforementioned report and other reports on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that there are many bodies through which the force is held to account.  The Commissioner has said that public accountability is important to him.  New offices have been proposed, including an independent office of the police commission and a policing and community safety oversight commission.  The Policing Authority, the Garda Inspectorate and GSOC are in the mix already and there is also the potential for a new board.  Where does the Commissioner see this going?  I know that ultimately it is a Government decision as to the architecture surrounding An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but does the Commissioner believe it is too complicated at present?  Would he like to see it simplified, while still upholding the principle of public accountability?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#J00700","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":397,"content":"<p>Undoubtedly, the landscape at the moment is complex.  As a chief officer, I spent a long time - 12 years - being held to account by the Northern Ireland Policing Board in Belfast.  I worked with the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and I was subject to investigation by that office.  I am well used to vigorous and rigorous public accountability and investigation.  That brings a lot of benefits in terms of public confidence and dealing with difficult issues.  It brings an objectivity when dealing with complaints.  It means that the policing service itself is subjective in its view on how to go forward.<\/p> <p>  As I said, I do not want to comment specifically on the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  We will make our views known as part of our commentary to the Government.  We still have the Policing Authority, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.  The responsibilities of those bodies are set out in legislation.  We have to be responsible as we work with them into the future.  I can say without any equivocation that our position is that accountability, independent investigation and oversight are very important for the role we provide and are central not only in the performance of what we do but also in promoting public confidence in what we do.  All this serves as a very useful sounding board and acts as a route for getting the opinions of the public on various matters.  Regardless of what happens, we wish to see rigorous accountability that adds to public confidence in what we do and provides us with good and viable feedback that we can use to improve the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Mr. Harris has mentioned that public accountability is important.

My view is that there should be some streamlining so that Mr. Harris is not getting direction from 20 different places and so that oversight can work.

We can already see that some of the systemic issues that were encountered with earlier editions of PULSE have started to fade away and diminish.  We have put a lot of effort into the quality of our data.  We have a great deal of work to do in that respect.  This is a point of emphasis for me and for the rest of the organisation because the data determine how best we should use our resources.  It has been said to me that PULSE, in itself, is unwieldy and difficult.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as an important organisation that uses PULSE, is always thinking about the next iteration of PULSE and about how we should improve and expand it.  We have other systems coming online.  I think the investigation management system will be of particular assistance.  Reference has been made to computer-aided despatches as well.  The challenge is to get these systems to communicate with one another and start to populate things on through.  These are complex programmes.

In some ways, the manner in which I have been received has been very moving for me.  For instance, I felt really welcomed and well received at the National Ploughing Championships.  I have to say that within the organisation, I feel very welcome and I have been well received.

All I have seen of him has been in the newspapers and on the television.  I am impressed.  Even though the Commissioner says he is not an outsider, he has come from a different part of the country.  I wish him the best.  To me, what I see is what I get.  The Commissioner seems to be a very honest person.  He seems to be a person who wants to get the job done.  What I like about him is that the first point he made was that he had confidence in the force.  It means that the people working under the Commissioner note there is a man coming here and he means business.<\/p> <p>  One of the biggest challenges the Commissioner mentioned from day one when he got the job was the Border after Brexit.  Coming from the Dundalk area, I am aware the Border plays a big part in the life of the community.  As an ex-member of the 27th Battalion in Dundalk, an Army man, I know what it is like to patrol the 34 Border crossings from Cullaville to Omeath.  During the troubled time, it was not a nice time to be involved.  We also have a lot of illicit trade there at present.  I refer to the fuel smuggling, the cigarettes and everything else.  It is just not a nice time.<\/p> <p>  I am a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  I spent the past two days in London and the main topic was Brexit.  The British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, has said that she has 95% of Brexit sorted out.  The last 5% is the Border.  The Taoiseach has said that if the Border situation is not sorted out, violence will return.  These are statements that we do not want to hear.  The bottom line is that it is important that the Commissioner has a plan of action.<\/p> <p>  I have been very lucky in recent months.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, visited Dundalk recently and met Superintendent Gerard Curley.  I would like to record that I find Superintendent Curley approachable, honest and upfront.  In fairness, he gives the Garda a good name in the area.<\/p> <p>  We visited Dundalk Garda station.  Given the amount of stuff they are taking in and the level of investigation they are doing, my main concern about the Garda station is that there does not seem to be an inch of space left.  They are doing a good job.  I can see a presence of the Garda on the beat, which is good there.<\/p> <p>  We also visited Dromad Garda station, which is a prefab building at present.

We are not sure of the drivers that there may be behind any of those issues, but certainly we have identified properly the concerns of the local population and how we should address those.  We emphasise that because in many ways people's local concerns about robbery, very bad driving or anti-social behaviour through bad driving, etc. are somewhat missed in the big political debates around Brexit, but those are of concern to us.  We will be there for the local communities.<\/p> <p>  In terms of organised crime and terrorism, we will be watching those very closely.  We will be in a position to react should the climate change in terms of the threat posed by either of those, but we are particularly concerned in respect of how organised crime will use the difference in tax tariffs, as I have said, to try to build up revenue.  We will work with other partners in respect of that.  Two weeks from now, we have the annual cross-Border organised crime conference.  That always has a focus on the various forms of criminality that we see right across the island of Ireland, not only smuggling but also other areas of organised crime that we can co-operate on, and not only in the Border area.  I am meeting the Chief Constable before that to agree further areas that we can develop.

It is very important for us that we are placed as an employer of choice in the employment market because we are competing in a busy market for the talent that is out there, and we want to be one of people's first options when they are thinking of what their employment is going to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1540368000,"counter":498,"content":"<p>As I said, it is very important for the Commissioner to keep Garda staff happy.

I presume this is not only looking ahead but includes historical inquiries.  Mr. Harris has alluded to a number of ongoing murder inquiries and we wish those well.  There was an earlier reference to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings on 17 May 1974, a day that I will never forget.  With no reference to a hierarchy of victimhood, it was the single greatest atrocity through all the years of conflict we have known on this island in relatively recent times.  The Houses of the Oireachtas, this Parliament, have on three occasions unanimously passed motions appealing for full co-operation with the appointed inquirers into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.<\/p><p>We have appealed to the British Government and its agencies to co-operate fully in the provision of all documentation, information and files relevant to the respective inquiries into those matters that took place north of the Border, and elsewhere if that be the case.  Deputy Commissioner Twomey responded earlier to one of my colleague's inquiries on this particular matter.  The Commissioner himself earlier indicated a willingness to meet victims and the representatives of victims.  In this particular instance, that is the Justice for the Forgotten organisation, heroically led by a lady called Ms Margaret Irwin.  Will the Commissioner facilitate an opportunity to meet Ms Irwin and with victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the survivors and bereaved families?  There were 33 deaths in those bombings.  <br\/><br\/>Commissioner Harris is unquestionably highly qualified for the position he has undertaken.  His experience is a significant factor in that.  Can the Commissioner, because of his previous roles, responsibilities and exposure, bring something more to the call, the wish and the cry for justice?  Despite the passage of time since 1974, here we are heading for 44 years later and that cry for truth and justice in respect of those particular atrocities has not faded.  Can the Commissioner, given his experience, knowledge, contacts, communications <i>et al.<\/i>, offer any hope for a better position than maintains currently?  As Deputy Commissioner Twomey indicated, this is not an area where there has been a flow of communications.

Commissioner Harris was talking about internal communications in the first instance as a priority.  With no specific reference, I have to say as Chair of this committee that I hope communications with the committee will also improve in the future.  There have been inordinate delays in responses to specific questions this committee has posed to former holders of the post of Garda Commissioner.  I am saying this on behalf of all of those present and all those elected members who make up this committee.  It has vexed us in the past and it is unnecessary.  I would greatly appreciate a significant improvement in that area.<\/p> <p>  My final question is on something that came up only last week.  We met with Assistant Commissioners Leahy and Finn and Commissioner Harris's former colleague, Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd.  They were before us in these very seats.  We talked about the importance of partnership in addressing issues that very often present almost wholly and solely to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am speaking about areas such as mental health and, as the Commissioner referred to earlier, youth crime and reducing recidivism.  It came out in the engagement last week that there might be - this might be a point of opinion - a better degree of interaction and co-operation between the different agencies north of the Border than may be the case here.  <\/p> <p>  That may be a moot point and perhaps the Commissioner might have a different view.  That is neither here nor there.  The point is that we need to see that level of co-operation across the board.  As elected public representatives, we are very much aware that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na find themselves having to deal with situations that present that are not their primary responsibility in respect of community safety.  I refer particularly to the area of mental health.  Some of the difficulties relate to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being a 24-7 hour organisation.  Some of the other services concerned are not and that is a huge problem.  <\/p> <p>  Even in my years of public service, I have had to strive to find where one can get help in a given situation after 5 p.m. in the evening and at weekends when, very often, these problems present.  It is an important area for the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and societally.  I would like to conclude by asking the Commissioner to elaborate on building this interaction perhaps in a more structured way.  I know it is early days for the Commissioner, and I do not mean to put him on the spot.  It is, however, an area he has reflected on.  I welcome that and I would like to underscore the importance of it.  Could he offer any additional commentary on this important area? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018102400002#S00700","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1540368000,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I will address that last point but I will start with the Chair's first point on communication.  As I said at the start and in my comments as well, I want to have open and transparent communication with the committee.<\/p><p>I was struck by Senator Conway's remarks.  He asked me to identify what issues I have seen in the organisation.  As I see them and as they crystallise, the committee, along with the Policing Authority, will be briefed properly on those.  I also noted his comments about the expedition of correspondence and reports.  In terms of collaboration, the commission is very strident about this.  It talks about widening the definition of policing, how the policing mission is changing and about harm.  The commission makes specific recommendations on Departments working together and crisis intervention teams but also An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na working together with co-located social service and healthcare professionals.<\/p><p> I think we have a different vision for what the service to the public will look like going forward but underpinning that, we need to have the correct organisational strategies in place with our partners, and we also need to resolve the issues around appropriate information sharing as well.  Undoubtedly, more of our time is being spent dealing with mental health issues but, increasingly, our work also involves dealing with issues concerning drink and drug addiction.  Crimes against the vulnerable also seem to be increasing.  Certainly, reports to that effect are increasing as well.  That brings us in contact with our partners to have a more holistic and victim-centred approach to individuals and the dire circumstances in which they find themselves.

I thank the joint committee for the opportunity to address it on the matter of safety of the school transport fleet.<\/p> <p>  The responsibilities of the Road Safety Authority in respect of buses are confined to implementing and enforcing particular regulations for roadworthiness, drivers' hours, tachograph, operator licensing and driver certificate of professional competence.  We also provide high-quality and reliable information to inform decision making, positive development and so on, and we collaborate with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other State agencies to improve enforcement and advocate improved road safety.  From an institutional perspective, the school transport scheme is operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p>The institutional, funding and contractual arrangements for delivering school transport, including services for children with special needs, are matters between the Department of Education and Skills and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Aside from the Bus &Eacute;ireann transport scheme, there are also instances where school transport services are delivered through a private arrangement with parents or schools outside of the Department of Education and Skills scheme.<\/p><p> From a large public service vehicle licensing perspective, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the National Transport Authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na each administer particular regulatory functions in respect of passenger vehicles.  The role of the enforcement unit in the Road Safety Authority is to check the roadworthiness condition of buses at the side of the road in conjunction with the Garda and to act in an advisory capacity to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by providing mechanical and expert assistance where required.  In addition, we conduct inspections at operator premises to verify compliance with maintenance obligations for vehicles, driver and operator compliance with tachograph and driver hours and operator licensing as well as driver certificate of professional competence checks at the roadside and in premises.<\/p><p> RSA data for roadworthiness relates to buses generally rather than specifically buses involved with school transport because there is an overlap.  We have set out in table 1, which is before the committee, the results of the past four quarters in compliance rates and compliance at first visit at roadside and during premises inspections.  Committee members can see that for the year from July 2017 to the end of June 2018 there were 873 school bus inspections at the roadside.  This resulted in an average compliance rate, excluding minor items, of 68%.  Of the 873 inspections, 268 buses or 30% had a major defect and a further 37 buses or 4.3% were deemed to be dangerously defective.  These roadside inspections involve a visual examination of the vehicle without the use of equipment.  The most common defects detected related to tyres, brake lights and steering leakages.  In the same period, we undertook over 1,063 premises inspections looking at maintenance obligations and their compliance.  The average compliance on the first visit in these instances was 52% and this increased to over 63% at a follow-up inspection.  This compliance data is not indicative, and should not be taken as reflective, of compliance of the national fleet.  Rather it reflects our enforcement findings derived from applying a risk-based approach.  Effectively, we go after the riskier operators in cases where we deem vehicles require further attention.<\/p><p> In the determination of defects detected during inspections our inspectors use the EU classification of defects.  Under the EU classification a major defect is one that may prejudice the safety of the vehicle, one that has an impact on the environment, one that puts other road users at risk or where other significant non-compliance issues are at hand.  A dangerous defect is one constituting a direct and immediate risk to road safety or having a direct impact on the environment such that the vehicle should not be used on the road in any circumstances.  All our vehicle inspectors undertaking inspections are qualified mechanics and undertake continuing professional development.<\/p><p> In developing our strategic approach to enforcement we have a combination of regulatory tools to promote and encourage operators and drivers to improve compliance with legislation.  The efficiency of these tools is kept under constant review and some new instruments may be needed particularly in respect of options for fixed charges, which must be effective and dissuasive.  The tools available to us aim to put road safety first and encourage operators to apply good safety practices in their day-to-day activities.  Such practices include walk-around checks, regular preventative maintenance and other measures to prevent collisions and incidents where vehicles breakdown and cause delays at the roadside.<\/p><p> A key part of this strategy is the application of a risk-based enforcement approach, as I have already mentioned.  This operates at the roadside and at operator premises.  Effectively, this means we are targeting those operators thought to be most at risk of non-compliance based on previous encounters and encounters based on the annual check.  I have put together a table of the measures we operate in our toolbox with other stakeholders, including the Garda, the NTA, the Department of Education and Skills and the Health and Safety Authority.  By applying this risk-based approach, compliant operators are inconvenienced to the least extent possible and thus our scarce enforcement resources are used where they are most needed.  We are not stopping compliant operators on the roadside needlessly.  We apply a risk-based approach in line with European and international best practice.  Where defects are found in the course of roadside inspections, our inspectors, in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, may take steps taking account of the severity and nature of the defect.  The steps may include taking the vehicle off the road, requiring the operator to present the vehicle for an immediate commercial vehicle roadworthiness test or requesting evidence of repairs or potentially required repairs to be completed at the roadside before we permit the vehicle to continue on its journey.  Our inspectors highlight any major or dangerous defects detected to the garda attending the inspection so that consideration can be given to issuing a fixed charge or taking a prosecution against the vehicle operator concerned.  Issuing of fixed charges is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> Our testing data show over 14,057 buses were tested under our commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing regime during the period from 1 July 2017 to end June 2018.  The average pass rate of the vehicles was 59%.  This shows an improved trend but it is disquieting that during this period 307 buses or 2.2% were identified as being so defective as to be deemed to be dangerously defective.  Our data show that the older the bus, the higher the fail rate at the annual test.  Hence, the importance of ensuring a proper and adequate preventative maintenance regime is in place for school vehicles.<\/p><p> It is evident from the number of dangerously defective vehicles detected at the annual test that there are several unscrupulous operators who fail continually carry out preventative maintenance.  This is a systematic failure by the owners concerned.  It is unacceptable practice and clearly a blatant disregard for road traffic law.  It also reflects a failure to appreciate the potentially adverse road safety effects for the general public of using such a vehicle.  Operators have a clear obligation to ensure vehicles being used on the public road are roadworthy at all times and not only for the annual test.  It is an offence to use an unroadworthy vehicle on the public road.  We take a stepped approach to enforcement involving an advisory approach first of all followed by other enforcement tools such as direction notices.  That opens up the possibility of prosecution in cases of continued failure to comply with the legal obligation.  In the vast majority of cases operators respond positively but the authority will not hesitate to initiate proceedings in circumstances where there is evidence of continuing non-compliance.<\/p><p> We have continuously reviewed the measures we use to improve compliance.  I have set out eight such measures for the committee.  These include direct awareness campaigns on the importance of roadworthiness and preventative maintenance.  We have specific programmes on social media as part of the overall back-to-school awareness campaign.  We focus on those directly hiring buses, whether they are parents or young people.  We encourage them to seek assurance from the operator concerned about compliance and assurance that the operator is compliant with road transport law, including commercial vehicle roadworthiness law.  We have a continued high level of roadside roadworthiness enforcement.  We operate on a multiagency basis, including with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have continued enforcement at the premises.  Enforcement is targeted at those who we believe to be higher-risk.  We use this to the maximum effect by using our commercial vehicle operator risk indicator.  We have an enforcement presence in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to check the roadworthiness at key events, for example, at concerts and popular tourist destinations.  We have continued engagement with Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Department of Education and Skills to ensure all buses operating under the transport scheme are fully compliant with all relevant road transport and traffic law.<\/p><p> Arising from this engagement the RSA understands that Bus &Eacute;ireann has updated the tendering process for the school transport scheme and now requires all bus contractors to submit a detailed questionnaire that includes specific questions regarding that operator&rsquo;s maintenance regime.  It has also updated the tendering process to a centralised model rather than being completed by local and regional offices, which Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised should bring greater standardisation and consistency in the procurement of school bus services.  We have engaged with the road transport operator licensing unit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to agree a formal process for sharing of information by RSA with the road transport operator licensing unit.  This information may be useful to the Department in the ongoing work in the area of operator licensing monitoring.<\/p><p> Bus transport is generally recognised as being one of the safest modes of surface transportation.  The national bus fleet provides passengers with remarkably safe travel compared with other road vehicles.  The children and students who use buses every day to travel to school or other venues, either through the school transport scheme or other privately operated services, are precious cargo and parents, children and students deserve the safest possible transport system.  Every day parents and guardians put their trust in bus operators and drivers to get their children to and from school or other activities.  This is a heavy responsibility and one that the authority, as well as other agencies and bus operators and drivers, must take seriously.  We all remember the tragedies of the Kentstown and Clara crashes in 2005 and 2006, respectively, where young students were killed arising from issues relating to bus safety and maintenance.<\/p><p> Bus safety is a key part of our overall commitment to road safety and operators have specific responsibilities under road traffic legislation to operate safely and to use buses that are roadworthy all the time and not just on the first day of school and the day of the annual test.  The majority of school bus operators take their responsibilities seriously and implement good practices in respect of the maintenance and roadworthy condition of their vehicles but there is no room for complacency.  The authority encourages the public to tell it about any concerns they have about the standard of roadworthiness of buses.  Despite high standards for safety and statistics that indicate bus collisions are rare in Ireland, any collision or incident involving any bus is a cause for concern, whether the incident is a minor one or a more serious event resulting in injuries or fatalities.<\/p><p> We and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are working closely to improve bus operator compliance.  We will be continuing our enforcement campaign and making use of new powers available to Road Safety Authority vehicle inspectors to prohibit, detain, immobilise and seize dangerously defective vehicles.  Finally, the Road Safety Authority is dedicated to promoting improved standards of bus roadworthiness and improving overall compliance within the bus sector by collaborating with other agencies and stakeholders to achieve that objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018102400002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Moyagh Murdock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540369800,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I have a question on the statistics in the presentation.

That report raised legitimate concerns among parents and it is only right and proper that these concerns are addressed, alleviated and removed.  One of the issues raised at the time was through the freedom of information request for a letter sent by the chairperson of the RSA to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  While the figures quoted in the RSA's presentation today account for all buses they are not specifically for school transport.  A letter was sent by the chairperson to Bus &Eacute;ireann that pulled out school transport and specifically addressed the RSA's safety concerns about school buses.  Is the RSA satisfied these concerns have been addressed satisfactorily?  Why does the RSA not share its risk index with Bus &Eacute;ireann?  The witnesses have indicated it is because of GDPR.

It is tested and checked.  When it goes through the rigours of a test and something is discovered, the owner goes off and deals with whatever was identified and then comes back.

In the past, bus operators all over the country would have used the annual test as a diagnostic tool.  They would send in their vehicles and see what came out of it.  They would go off and fix what was picked up on that test.  In those days, buses would have come in with a lot of dangerous defects.  We have changed that culture now so that people realise they must keep their vehicle roadworthy at all times of the year.  That is still not hitting home at this point.  We have put in a table of statistics for the roadside compliance rate.  The results are always better in the third quarter than they are as the year goes on because that is the beginning of September when the schools are back.  Meetings would have been held over the summer.  There is a deterioration of the standard of the fleet on the road in the other three quarters of the year.  That is because operators get their vehicles ready tor the back-to-school operation and then take their eyes off the ball and it starts to deteriorate.  The operators then prepare again for their annual test, whatever time of the year that is.  We want them to be roadworthy at all times of the year.<\/p> <p>  There are some unscrupulous operators.  It is a small number, as we explained.  It is about 10%, so there are 90% that are better than that, either very good or there are other things that they can do to improve their performance.  We specify that there are a small number of unscrupulous operators.  We recognise we get great support from the vast majority of operators out there for this approach.  It levels the playing pitch.  There are guys who are cutting corners and putting cheaply kept vehicles on the road and hoping for the best, that it does not get picked up in an annual test.  We want to eradicate that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to someone who brings their vehicle in and it passes the test and fails a day or two later.  There is a concern as to why that would happen.

The RSA is constantly evolving.  It would like to be able to provide an online service for the vast majority of people.  That is dependent on the platform it will operate from and at the moment about 10% of people are eligible to apply online and can do so at any time up to three months from their licence renewal date.  Feedback shows it is going well and about 150 people a day apply.  There could be more applications if people realised they could do it online.  There is a lot of ongoing ICT work to develop it further and integrate the whole journey along the way.  If people get a learner permit or a theory test, we want to make it as seamless as possible for such people, when they eventually do their driving test and get their licence, not to have to come into an office but to be able to get it from the system.

As members are aware, we scheduled a second part of a meeting this morning to discuss the recent decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to refuse permission for the proposed College Green plaza.  Deputy Troy in particular asked that we would discuss this.  We invited the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Mr. Owen Keegan, the chief executive officer of Dublin City Council to the meeting.  Ms Anne Graham of the NTA kindly said that she would attend.  Last Friday the committee received correspondence from Mr. Keegan stating he would be unable to attend.  He kindly nominated two staff members from Dublin City Council to attend but stated these individuals would not be in a position to advise the committee on the likely council response to the decision and furthermore, that the city council did not wish to make an opening statement to the committee.  <\/p> <p>  The committee considered this correspondence this morning.  I can speak for all members present and put on record that we view this response from Mr. Keegan as disappointing and unacceptable.  The committee feels there is no choice but to defer this important meeting until such a time as Mr. Keegan makes himself available to come into us, he will be more than welcome, and makes himself available to give a full and substantive response to the committee's concerns.  I have asked the clerk to contact Mr. Keegan to arrange this.  I apologise to Ms Graham and Mr. Hugh Creegan from the NTA for the short notice regarding today's meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018102400002#M00175","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1540369800,"counter":805,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 11.22 a.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 7 November 2018.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
