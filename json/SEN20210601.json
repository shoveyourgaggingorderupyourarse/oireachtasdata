This is a matter I have raised on a number of occasions.  It relates to the lack of playing field and sports facilities generally across the Dublin Bay South area, although I have asked a specific question today.  There is a serious lack of publicly accessible playing fields and sports pitches in Dublin Bay South, in particular Dublin 6 and 6W.<\/p> <p>My question relates to the allocation of funding for the construction of an AstroTurf playing pitch at Harold's Cross Educate Together Secondary School.  As I said, it also relates to the broader context of the lack of playing fields more generally.  I have written to the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, most recently in late April, regarding the planning application for permanent accommodation for the new Educate Together secondary school in my local area in Harold's Cross.  This followed representations made to me by the school's principal, Mr. Padraig Conaty, on behalf of the board.  The school has very much welcomed positive updates on the planning application for permanent accommodation but concerns remain, most notably regarding outdoor play areas.<\/p> <p>In particular, the school community is very disappointed to learn the schedule of accommodation has no provision for an AstroTurf playing surface.  This will seriously hamper the ability of the school to offer a full range of sports opportunities to children and pupils.  As the Minister of State will be well aware, this development is part of a much bigger campus development, including the site acquisition and construction of the Harold's Cross Educate Together Secondary School and an Educate Together primary school.  Harcourt Terrace Educate Together primary school is also located there in temporary accommodation.<\/p> <p>As part of the overall development of what was the Greyhound Stadium in Harold's Cross, the State is committing a significant amount of funding to deliver the important project.  It seems to me and to the school community that it would be a shame, therefore, if, on full development, the campus would still have no space for pupils to play Gaelic football, hurling, soccer or rugby, the four most popular team sports in Ireland for children.  Given the lack of public playing fields available in the local area, the school would be very limited in what provision it can make for pupils to play, train and exercise outdoors.<\/p> <p>We know there are costings from the Department to convert two of the basketball courts provided for into one large divisible AstroTurf playing area.  However, the Department has requested that the schools would have to pay for this and this is not financially feasible.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I ask the Minister of State to consider allocating funding for the AstroTurf finish and to ensure this will be done in one or two of the ball courts.  This will provide greater flexibility and enhanced delivery of the curriculum.  School officials tell me that at minimal additional cost they could use a dividing mesh curtain to separate and use the two ball courts simultaneously for physical education, PE, activities, outdoor lessons and so on.  This would be cost-effective and is standard for many schools and sports facilities around Ireland.  The AstroTurf finish, in particular, would enable the school to provide a full PE curriculum involving a full range of contact sports and individual athletic events.  <\/p><p>The school is very concerned that without the AstroTurf finish, it will be unable to offer any team sports in a meaningful way, aside from basketball.  Its athletic lessons would also be limited.  It is concerned about having to rent facilities in the area, which are not readily available locally.  This will have a negative impact, even if the school was able to find such facilities, because there would clearly be a great deal of time involved travelling to and from such off-site locations.<\/p><p>The Department has told the school it is not a feasible proposition to provide an AstroTurf finish on one or two of the ball courts.  I ask the Minister of State whether it would be possible to find a way to do this that would be feasible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#A00500","speaker":"1631","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I have discussed this matter with the Senator previously and I am happy to set out the position today from my perspective and the perspective of the Department and Minister.<\/p> <p>Harold's Cross is a co-educational, second level school, which will provide 1,000 post-primary places with four classroom special education needs units to serve the two school planning areas of Dublin 6 Clonskeagh and Dublin 6 west.  The school opened its doors for its first intake of pupils in September 2020 in interim accommodation on the site of the former greyhound racing stadium at Harold's Cross.  This will be the permanent location of the school.  The site will also form a campus accommodating the permanent school for Harold's Cross Educate Together National School, which is also currently in interim accommodation on this site.<\/p> <p>The joint building project for both schools is currently in advanced architectural planning and I am pleased to advise the House that the planning application is being lodged with Dublin City Council this week.  In advance of lodging the planning application, officials from my Department met the school's representatives on 1 April last to share the plans for their new school.  The brief for the school was discussed and it was confirmed that five hard court play areas were being provided.  While the standard brief for post-primary schools is six, we are pleased to say that five will be provided in this instance.  The school indicated an interest in potentially converting one or two of the ball courts, as the Senator indicated, to an AstroTurf pitch as part of the upcoming project or in the future.  It was confirmed that the Department would not be providing this under the building contract as it does not provide funding for AstroTurf pitches.  This approach is not particular to this school but is generally the case.<\/p> <p>In subsequent correspondence with the school and notwithstanding the question of funding, it was outlined to the school that the possible replacement of a hard play area standard finish with an AstroTurf finish on one or two of the ball courts on this site is not a feasible proposition, as such a development would reduce the area of the available hard play space on what is a constrained urban site and would provide less flexibility in terms of student use and accessibility, potentially compromising the delivery of the curriculum.  The Department provides hard play areas as per the standards outlined in the schedule of accommodation insofar as this can be accommodated within the relevant site and having regard to the particular requirements of the planning authority.  <\/p> <p>By virtue of the fact that there is a scarcity of land in urban areas, it is not always possible to achieve the ideal site size for school buildings.  Where some of the elements required for a school site can be provided outside the designated site area, for example, traffic management, parking and playing fields, where it is possible to provide multistorey - above two-storey - buildings and where separation areas can be reduced due to the nature of permitted development on and adjacent to the site, smaller sites can be considered.  Constraints in site sizes in urban areas mean that the full suite of external accommodation may not be provided in all cases.  In such circumstances, priority is given to the provision of accommodation and services specific to the pedagogical requirements of the school.<\/p> <p>I note what the Senator said and I intend to convey her comments to the Minister.  I note what she said about a divided mesh curtain being cost-effective and about play, training and exercise.  The Department's perspective is that these activities can take place on the five hard play areas.  As the Senator said, the State is giving a significant amount of funding to this particular school and we hope it will work out advantageously for all concerned. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#B00200","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for that very full response.

That is clearly very welcome, not just for the school community but for the local community too.<\/p> <p>It is also very welcome that an indoor sports hall and five hard court play areas will be provided and I acknowledge that.  However, the lack of provision for an AstroTurf playing area will hamper the provision of a full sports curriculum.  I am grateful to the Minister of State for saying she will convey to the Minister the comments I made, in particular around the provision of a mesh curtain, to explore whether there is some way of creating greater flexibility for play areas for the school.  If there could be further consultation on this, that would be really welcome.<\/p> <p>The standard brief is to provide six playing areas in a school, whereas the new school is only being provided with five.  It will be located in a very constrained area where there is a serious shortage of accessible playing pitches for children and sports clubs in the area generally.  I think in particular of Ranelagh Gaels, a rapidly growing local sports club which lacks any permanent home to play in.  I raised this issue previously with the Minister for Defence, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Colm Brophy.

The Department does not provide funding for AstroTurf for any school so an exception cannot, unfortunately, be made for this school in the context of 4,000 schools across the country.  To do so would set a precedent in that regard and there is only so much funding that can be made available.

I am delighted to speak about schools in my area of Moycullen, County Galway.  Some people describe Moycullen as a village but in reality it is a small town at this stage.  It was certainly identified as such in the draft county development plan.  It is close to Galway city but has its own community close to the amenities of the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, University Hospital Galway, UHG, Galway Bay, and the theatre, nightlife and everything else in the city.  It is, therefore, a very popular place to live.  The growth projections and patterns are going one way, that is, increasing.<\/p> <p>Moycullen has a growing population with four schools in the community, Scoil Mhuire, Scoil Cholm&aacute;in Tuair&iacute;n&iacute;, Tullykyne and Scoil Bhaile Nua.  There are, however, nearly 700 children from the community attending secondary school outside the area.  The majority go to Galway city, some to An Spid&eacute;al and a small number to Oughterard.  For historical reasons and by virtue of its Gaeltacht status, Moycullen is included in the An Spid&eacute;al-Indreabh&aacute;n school planning area.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is despite the vast majority of students not attending secondary school in that school planning area.  Is it normal that the majority of pupils in a village do not attend a school in the school planning area in which the village is situated?  It makes no sense to me.  Is this preventing the development of a post-primary school?<\/p><p>The present requirement to travel outside the community to attend a post-primary school means buses and cars on the road.  It means a minimum travel time of one hour a day, which is five hours per week, for the students.  Bus tickets are an added cost that parents would not incur if there was a second level school in their community.  If there are two kids in a family, the parents might be paying &euro;600 a year for those two pupils.  Most of all, it is a right of children living in an area to be educated in their own community, a right never afforded pupils in Moycullen.  It is an example of a community that was once just a crossroads and has, from the 1980s when the first two housing estates were built until today, seen an explosion of growth.  <\/p><p>T&aacute; &eacute;ileamh m&oacute;r ar mhe&aacute;nscoil i Maigh Cuilinn.

It is a fast-growing area with capacity for growth in its sewerage system.  The sewerage plant is at 50% capacity so there is capacity for additional growth and development.  The construction of a bypass, starting this autumn, will make the community safer and more popular.  I know the Department is conducting an ongoing study, an updated demographic exercise, on school needs across the country.  It was at an advanced stage last year so I am wondering if there is an update on that.  <\/p><p>As I said, the community of Moycullen wishes to have its own school and it deserves one.  Growth patterns are only going one way, as I have said, that is, towards an increase in population.  It is only right and proper that rather than having, as I said, up to 700 students a day travelling mostly to Galway city - and that number is only going to grow - a school should be provided in our area.  I look forward to the reply from the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#B00500","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter of school places in Moycullen.  It gives me an opportunity to set out my Department's position on school place requirements in the area.  The Senator may be aware that in order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data in a way that takes account of the significant local and regional variations in demographic trends and enrolment projections, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas.  As the Senator correctly pointed out, Moycullen is in the Spiddal-Inverin school planning area.<\/p> <p>In most places, school planning areas were based on traditional school catchment areas where all primary schools were assigned to a post-primary feeder area which was typically a population centre or town containing one or more post-primary schools.  The school planning areas were developed for use with my Department's geographic information system in 2008 and, with the introduction of small areas in census 2011, these areas were amended to align with census small areas.  The current school planning areas take account not only of local groupings of schools but also of natural boundaries, census small areas and other local conditions.<\/p> <p>My Department's anticipation of post-primary school place requirements within each school planning area is based on the level of enrolment at each standard class in primary schools and the historical transfer patterns between primary and post-primary schools.  Information supplied by the local authorities in respect of current or planned residential development activity is also considered.  Where data indicate that school place requirements are increasing, the availability of existing or planned unused capacity within existing schools is considered in the first instance.  If sufficient unused capacity is not available, provision may be made by extending the capacity of an existing school or by providing a new school.<\/p> <p>An analysis of the transfer patterns from primary schools in the wider Moycullen area to post-primary schools indicates that the majority of such pupils enrol in post-primary schools in the Galway city school planning area, which is immediately adjacent to the Spiddal-Inverin school planning area.  The Department has identified a significant volume of current or planned unused capacity in schools in Galway city.  This includes a number of major capital projects which are providing additional capacity.  This capacity across schools in Galway city is expected to be sufficient to address projected emerging requirements in that school planning area as well as to facilitate a continuation of the enrolment patterns from primary schools in the Moycullen area.  In that context, my Department has determined that there is currently no identified requirement for the establishment of a new post-primary school in Moycullen.  Nevertheless, it will continue to keep school place requirements across the country, including in the Spiddal-Inverin and Galway city school planning areas, under review.  Furthermore, my officials will continue to engage with officials in Galway County Council and Galway City Council in the context of their development plans.<\/p> <p>It may be interesting for the Senator to note that according to the demographics about which he inquired, there is an anticipated population increase of approximately 18,655 for the general Galway area between 2021 and 2028.  The 2016 population of Moycullen, as the Senator is probably aware, was 1,704.  There is an anticipated growth of 350 by 2028.  There are, according to Galway County Council, 272 housing units with planning permission in the Moycullen area but they are not yet complete.  It is not expected that the full number of these will be delivered in the short term and their impact on school place requirements should be considered in the context of a distinct downward trend in demographics at planning level which will roll forward to post-primary level over the medium term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#C00200","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.

This is the issue and problem.  Moycullen has always sent its students to Galway city because there has been no other option.  A small number of students go to An Spid&eacute;al and a small number to Oughterard.  The population is continuing to grow and people have to pay the added cost of bus tickets into Galway city to attend the secondary school, a distance of 6, 7 or 8 miles, depending on the family's location in the parish.  That is not fair.<\/p> <p>I ask the Department to look again at the growth projections because I believe they underestimate the levels of development and planning permission and, as I said, the capacity for growth in the community.  It is only going to go in one direction and we need to plan now to ensure there will be a secondary school in Moycullen.

An increase of approximately 1,000 post-primary pupils by 2024 is projected in Galway city.  In summary, over the longer term, it is anticipated that Galway city will be a primary centre for growth whereas future demand for school places in Moycullen is not likely to increase significantly.

I am seeking to discover the timeline for the second track and the position with regard to commuter trains for the area.  This matter needs to be prioritised.  Naturally, in the current climate, we need to continue to invest in public transport.  I know from occasionally using the train from Oranmore that it is an excellent way to transport a large volume of people into the city.  There is a huge willingness on the part of people in the Oranmore electoral area, whether it is in Maree, Clarenbridge or Oranmore itself, to use public transport.  As Senator Kyne said earlier in connection with Moycullen, there has been a major increase in the population.  I am well aware that the census has been postponed until next year but I am sure it will show a further increase in population, so we need to plan for the next number of years.  A train service is essential.<\/p><p>Finally, I ask the Minister for Transport to come back to me with the information.  Like Senator Kyne, I think it would be great if I could get the written response when I conclude.  Also, there are a number of trains for people to travel to Dublin and Limerick but the problem is that in the evening, the second last and last trains do not stop in Oranmore.  That is another issue for the people who live in the Oranmore electoral area because there is no point getting the first train to Dublin in the morning and then having to go into Galway city because one's car will have been parked in Oranmore.  The logistics need to be worked out and there needs to be better communication with the public.  Overall, the train service is excellent but it needs to be enhanced and further investment is required.  Can I have a copy of the written response, please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#C00600","speaker":"1646","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I am here on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to answer the Senator's questions on transport, particularly in the context of the Oranmore and Ceannt stations in Galway.<\/p> <p>The Government recognises the importance of expanding sustainable mobility in the Galway area.  I am glad to say that this recognition has been backed up by funding to ensure that this translates into reality.  We want to deliver expanded active travel networks across the city.  We want to improve bus services and infrastructure through the delivery of a BusConnects Galway programme.  We also want to deliver improved rail services and infrastructure.<\/p> <p>The good news is that there have been positive developments on all fronts in recent months.  We want to see that development continue in the coming years.  Under the national development plan on active travel, Galway will benefit from the increased funding now available to support working and cycling.  Funding of almost &euro;12 million was announced earlier this year to support projects in the city during 2021, and another &euro;6 million has been allocated to Galway County Council also in 20201.<\/p> <p>On bus transport, we have seen welcome progress on two of the Galway BusConnects corridors with both the cross-city link and the Dublin Road corridor out to public consultation towards the end of last year.  Both of these corridors are hugely important for the city's transport future and the cross-city link in particular is fundamental to improving public transport in the city.  I understand that the cross-city link will move into statutory planning process later this year, which will be a really important milestone.<\/p> <p>Finally, the Senator highlighted two current rail projects.  First, there is the proposed redevelopment of Ceannt station.  This will expand the capacity of the station and improve passenger experience at the station itself.  The project will be co-funded by the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, and the Department of Transport as part of the National Transport Authority's regional cities investment programme.  I am informed that a multidisciplinary design team has been appointed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, and that the team is currently undertaking detailed design development and the preparation of tender documentation for the construction stage.  It is expected that tenders for the redevelopment work will be sought in the final quarter of this year with the contractor expected to be appointment mid-2022 and construction should finish during 2024.  As the Senator will be aware, full planning permission for the project is in place.<\/p> <p>Second, in terms of rail, there is the proposed improvement to Oranmore station.  This project will see a new 1 km passing loop constructed at Oranmore.  This will mean that trains will be able to pass each other and a new second platform will be constructed at the station.  As with the Ceannt station project, these works will be co-funded through the URDF and the Department of Transport.  I am informed that design work for the project is still at a relatively early stage and a full project timeline is under development.  However, it is expected that all works will be completed during 2024.<\/p> <p>The Senator is likely aware that the new Athenry to Galway rail corridor is being examined generally in terms of what other improvements might be necessary to expand its capacity up to and including, possibly, double-tracking into the city.  As he conceded, there is significant activity under way to improve sustainable mobility in Galway.  It is important that this activity translates into delivery on the ground and that Galwegians begin to see projects move from planning to construction.  The latter is a move that I believe we will see emerge over the next 12 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#D00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has delivered welcome news.

People start at the age of eight or younger, and there is no upper age limit.  It is good for people's well-being.  It creates a great love of animals by many young people.  It is not just people from the farming community who enjoy horse and pony racing.  Many families from urban areas enjoy this wonderful sport.  All of the people involved in it are volunteers.  We all know of the race meets around the countryside that bring so much enjoyment each year, for example the races in Loughrea, the Dingle races, Frenchpark in Roscommon, and Geesala in Mayo.  The meets are huge for the local communities.  Of course, because of the pandemic this has all been hit.  The volunteers who run these race meets are now looking forward to getting it all up and running again.  They do not get any funding.<\/p><p>Horse Racing Ireland has a budget of &euro;76 million.  I understand, however, that it cannot fund them.  Brian Kavanagh and Denis Egan from the Jockey Club sympathise with these small racing volunteers but, as far as I am aware, they cannot fund them.  We need to look at this to see if there is some way we can get some funding for groups like the midlands horse and pony association, the north-west racing committee, the southern racing committee, the Dingle races, and the people in Frenchpark in my county.  Sponsorship has disappeared because of the Covid close down.<\/p><p>The aspect of well-being is a very important point in all of this, and especially for young people.  It is an open air sport, which is very important when we are moving out of Covid restrictions and being told to get outdoors as the safe way to go.  For those people to get up and running and to re-establish themselves, they need funding now.  They have very little money left in their accounts.  Many of the people involved are using their own money to get much of the work done.  There are huge costs involved with insurance and the chipping of animals.  All of this is being done very well and is very well looked after by the people in control.  One can imagine, however, all of the cost there.<\/p><p>This sport is really the foundation that opens up avenues for the likes of Rachael Blackmore, Barry Geraghty, Bryan Cooper, Nina Carberry and Katie Walsh.  It goes on and on.  Just look at the successes those people have had.  Look at the pride they have brought to Ireland.  They all started at those pony and horse races up and down the country.  The Minister of State will understand this very well.  I believe it is vital and important that we as a Government look at this issue and that we try to organise a funding stream that will back this up.  Again, I put it to the Minister of State that all of the people involved are volunteers.  It does not just open up avenues for jockeys.  It also opens up opportunities for owners of horses and for stable people to go on and make a good career.  This is the training ground and the base.  This is the rock on which our racing business is founded and we must support it.  If we do not, then these volunteers will disappear and the ability of people to enjoy this outing will be gone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#D00600","speaker":"1674","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Murphy.

I am happy to take this Commencement matter on the Minister's behalf.<\/p> <p>Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, is a commercial State body established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, and is responsible for the overall administration, promotion and development of the horse racing industry.<\/p> <p>The Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB, is the regulatory body for all horse racing in Ireland.  The board is a company limited by guarantee.  The Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee transferred their regulatory functions, together with related assets and liabilities, to the company under a business transfer agreement on 1 January 2018.<\/p> <p>Under Section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, my Department provides funding to HRI on an annual basis.  My Department has allocated &euro;76.8 million to HRI to assist the horse racing and wider thoroughbred industry in 2021.  This is an increase of &euro;9.6 million or 14% on the 2020 allocation of &euro;67.2 million.  HRI has informed me that it has never provided funding to pony racing as the sport does not fall within its remit, the equines involved are not thoroughbreds, and these meetings have not been recognised by the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB.<\/p> <p>Horse Racing Ireland and the IHRB have indicated that they are in dialogue with the various pony racing organisations.  The issue of pony racing was also discussed at a recent HRI board meeting.  HRI and the IHRB are due to meet with representatives of pony racing organisations again in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>To date, HRI has had a number of virtual meetings with representatives of various pony racing organising committees around the country in response to requests for a closer and more formal relationship than exists at present.  Such a relationship would involve some form of recognition by the IHRB, including the removal of the ban on attendance at pony racing for licensed individuals and some form of financial assistance through Horse Racing Ireland.<\/p> <p>Before Covid-19, approximately 40 pony race meetings were held mainly between the months of June and September.  The pony racing circuit has been a fruitful source of talented jockeys, as Senator Murphy has outlined.  The Senator has named many of the famous jockeys who now grace the largest of international stages and who represent Ireland extremely well at Cheltenham and all of the big race meetings across the world.  I accept that many of those riders started in pony racing.  It is acknowledged that, historically, many top riders have had their first experience of race riding on the pony racing circuit.<\/p> <p>The board of HRI has informed the Minister that discussions on the matter will continue, but it must be stated that ultimately pony racing is outside HRI's remit, which is confined to activities on authorised racecourses.  Any involvement will be limited to a discussion and advisory role only.<\/p> <p>I have attended pony racing in Dingle while there on a family holiday.  I have seen the excitement and the enthusiasm of the people.   I do not for one minute discount the passion that Senator Murphy has displayed on the matter.  Pony racing has a long history where it has stood on its own two feet.  This is always a challenge for such an organisation that has survived for such a long period, notwithstanding the role it has played in providing jockeys to us.<\/p> <p>I very much welcome the engagement by HRI and the IHRB with the pony racing associations for the discussions and advisory support they can provide into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#E00300","speaker":"1586"},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I appreciate that the Minister of State has given such a comprehensive reply.  I am delighted there will be discussion and a recognition of how important the matter is.<\/p> <p>If we do not support the sport now it will die out.  It will affect Irish racing hugely.  No young talent will get the chance to become a jockey.  No disadvantaged child will get the necessary training he or she would need, unless they can all afford to own their ponies, which is impossible.  I know where the Minister of State's heart is on this.  I know the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, will deal with this.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, to go back to ensure that in some way we can get a  small amount of funding for this group.<\/p> <p>I have done some research on this.  David Egan, who started out pony racing earlier this year won the &euro;20 million Saudi Cup.  Only a few short weeks ago Rory Cleary from the Athlone region, won the 2,000 Guineas on a horse called Mac Swiney.

As the Minister of State knows, in 2020 Mr. Vivian Geiran carried out a scoping exercise in Drogheda as a direct result of the gang feud that had terrorised the town.  He spoke to all relevant agencies and bodies directly and indirectly involved with the feud.  The comprehensive report was finalised and submitted to the Department in January 2021.  The report put forward over 70 recommendations to improve the community safety and well-being of the citizens of the town.  The report was publicly released by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, on 26 March, when she stated that, \"Over the next few weeks engagement will continue with relevant departments with a view to finalising the implementation plan by the end of April.\"  Councillor McQuillan is very disappointed that there has been no real move on this implementation plan.  We are now at the first day of June and I would be grateful if the Minister of State could update me on the current status of the report and its lengthy list of recommendations.<\/p> <p>The implementation of this report is essential to improving the safety, well-being and development of Drogheda.  The first and most important recommendation of the report is that the high-level oversight group, consisting of members of seven Departments, is responsible for signing off on an agreed plan of action.  I would like to know if it has been signed off and an agreed action plan put in place.  I understand that the chief superintendent has stated that he has a team in place ready to go but has not had any contact from the Government to date.  Other agencies directly involved are also anxiously waiting to engage on the recommendations.<\/p> <p>While the commissioning of the report was welcomed by the people of Drogheda, it will have been a wasted exercise if it is not acted upon soon.  I have been assured that the people of Drogheda do not want to see this report sitting in the Department gathering dust while people&rsquo;s lives continue to be seriously affected by the ongoing problems.  With the summer recess getting closer there is real concern locally that failure to implement the very first recommendation augers badly for the remaining 69 recommendations.  As the Minister of State can appreciate, local groups are really anxious to get going on this report and its recommendations.  We must remember this activity is seriously affecting citizens' everyday life, safety and well-being.  Time is of the essence and I hope in all sincerity the Minister of State will have answers to the three questions that I have posed today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#F00200","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this very important matter concerning Drogheda.  The Scoping Report into Community Safety and Well-being in Drogheda was commissioned by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, in 2020 following a number of violent incidents in Drogheda.  The purpose of the scoping report was to gather and assess information relating to ongoing challenges and community needs in Drogheda, and to identify actions to support communities and connect relevant services.  Mr. Vivian Geiran, a former director of the Probation Service, was engaged to prepare the report, which makes over 70 recommendations on short- and long-term responses to challenges the community faces, including around crime prevention, youth services, drug addiction, education, infrastructure and community development.  The recommendations highlight the need for improved interagency co-operation in the administration and delivery of State services in Drogheda, as well as the need to resource public services or provide additional services in certain areas in particular.<\/p> <p>The scoping report was approved for publication by the Government on 13 March 2021 and published on 26 March.  Briefings were organised by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, the following week for community groups and services that had met with Mr. Geiran, as well as for Deputies, Senators and councillors from County Louth.  The implementation plan for the key recommendations arising from the report is currently being developed and will identify the relevant stakeholders for each recommendation and outline next steps for engagement.  Engagement with all relevant Departments, agencies and the Louth County Council is ongoing to ensure a comprehensive implementation plan.  For example, early action has been taken to engage with the Department of Education on the provision of additional supports to the three schools identified in the report.  Engagement has taken place at official level and the Department of Education is positive about providing additional supports to schools in the area, including those identified in the report.  Additionally, engagement has taken place with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage with regard to addressing the impact on Drogheda of the county boundaries of counties Louth and Meath.  My officials are also in direct contact with Red Door, the HSE, the Department of Health and the local drugs and alcohol task force to advance the recommendations around funding to addiction-related support services in the community.  This engagement is necessary to ensure funding is maximised and to avoid duplication in the delivery of services.<\/p> <p>With regard to the co-ordination mechanism proposed by Mr. Geiran in his report, the Department is currently in discussions with relevant Departments and agencies, as well as Louth County Council, to develop a proposal for a co-ordination structure that will enable engaged participation from relevant stakeholders while being in line with the Government's wider approach to community safety and community development.

I am the treasurer of my local club, with which I have been involved for the past 30 years.  I have also been involved in a number of successful applications for the sports capital programme.  The programme was launched in 1998 and more than 10,000 projects have benefited from funding, bringing total allocations to approximately &euro;1 billion.  This year, the programme closed on Monday, 1 March, and by the closing date more than 3,000 applications had been made seeking more than &euro;200 million in funding.  This is the highest number of applications since the programme began.<\/p><p>The sports capital programme is the Government's primary vehicle for supporting and developing sports facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment.  Increasing participation in sport is a central aim of our national sports policy and forms part of the programme for Government, which sets a target of 60% adult participation in sport.  To achieve this objective we have to have the appropriate sports facilities in place.  The vision of the national sports policy is a country where everyone can regularly enjoy taking part in sport and physical activity for life.  This is now more important than ever as recent findings, according to data published by Sport Ireland, have noted that the gender gap in active participation in sport is now at its lowest level.  If we are to achieve our ambitious targets on sports participation we need to continue to invest in facilities, and in particular target areas with low levels of participation and areas with huge increases in population.<\/p><p>The sports capital programme has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland, with improvements in the quality and quantity of sporting facilities in virtually every town and village.  The facilities that have been funded range from sports equipment for the smallest clubs to national centres of sporting excellence.  The vast majority of grants go to voluntary organisations and I take this opportunity to thank all those volunteers associated with these clubs for their tireless work and commitment to improving their facilities for the benefit of all their members.  Significant changes to the programme have been implemented to make the process more user-friendly, including the simplification of the application form, giving applicants an opportunity to correct applications during the assessment stage and the introduction of an appeals system for unsuccessful applicants.<\/p><p>The programme aims to foster an integrated and planned approach to developing sport and physical recreation facilities throughout the country.  In particular, its objectives are to assist voluntary and community organisations, prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities and encourage multi-use of local, regional and national facilities.  In 2019, &euro;37 million of public money was allocated and 37 different sports benefited.  Dublin received the highest amount, at &euro;7.5 million, and my county of Longford received the lowest, at &euro;290,000.  Over the past three programmes, Longford has received the lowest average <i>per capita<\/i>funding in the country of &euro;20.99.  County Westmeath received funding of &euro;25 <i>per capita<\/i>over the same three years.  This compares with an average of &euro;33 <i>per capita<\/i>throughout the country.  This is why when decisions are being made we need to ensure this imbalance is addressed.<\/p><p>We know it has been a tough year for sports clubs as a result of Covid-19.  Clubs have been unable to do their normal fundraising.  This new round of the programme will provide opportunities for clubs to make improvements.  I understand it would be impossible to fund all applications received in 2021.  Given the large number of applications received, I ask the Department to prioritise in 2022 or 2023 any validated unsuccessful application made this year.  If this were done, it would enable applicants to begin planning for 2022, whether through fundraising or finalising planning applications in anticipation of receiving funding in the following year.  This would reduce the delay in projects being completed, and the Department has to give a large number of extensions.<\/p><p>Everybody involved knows the importance of the sports capital programme and the Covid-19 pandemic has emphasised how important sport is to our society.  As well as the pleasure and excitement of watching sport, actively engaging is critical for our physical and mental well-being.  I dealt with a number of application for this year's programme.  Longford Tennis Club had to apply because its facilities were overused during Covid-19.  Longford Rugby Club brought in all the children every Sunday morning, including my young lad, for training during the off-season.  However, there is always more that can be done to make sure everyone, no matter their age or background, and whether male or female, has an opportunity to participate in sport in some capacity.  This is why the funding is vital this year and will be important in the years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#G00100","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I apologise on behalf of the Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Chambers, and the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, who are caught at a Cabinet meeting and unfortunately cannot be here.  I thank the Senator for raising this very important matter.  We are acutely aware of the importance of sports capital grants to our local communities.<\/p> <p>The sports capital and equipment programme is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country.  More than 13,000 projects have benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to more than &euro;1 billion.<\/p> <p>The programme has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland, with improvements in the quality and quantity of sporting facilities in virtually every village, town and city in the country.  The programme is also an important element of the national sports policy in delivering increased participation in sport.  Grants are available to voluntary, not-for-profit sports clubs, community groups, national governing bodies of sport and local authorities.  Third level colleges, education and training boards and schools may only apply for funding jointly with sports clubs or organisations.<\/p> <p>The programme's objectives are to assist sporting organisations to develop high quality, accessible, safe, well-designed and sustainable facilities in appropriate locations and to provide appropriate equipment to help maximise participation in sport and physical recreation, to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas and groups, such as people with disabilities, in the provision of sports facilities, and to encourage the sharing and maximum use of sports facilities.  The programme for Government commits to continuing the sports capital programme and prioritising investment in disadvantaged areas.<\/p> <p>On 30 November last, the Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, announced that a new 2020 round of the programme was opening, with applications being accepted from 11 December until 1 March 2021.  By this closing date, 3,106 applications had been submitted seeking more than &euro;200 million in funding.  This is the highest number of applications ever received.<\/p> <p>The scoring system and assessment procedures have been finalised and published.  All applications are now being assessed in accordance with these procedures.  Given the large number of applications received, this assessment process is likely to take a number of months.  As soon as this process is complete all applicants will be informed of the outcome of the assessment of their application.  The sports capital and equipment programme only funds projects that are sporting in nature, whether competitive or recreational.  All applications are assessed against six published criteria.  These criteria are the likelihood of increasing participation, including female participation, and improving performance, whether the proposed facilities will be shared with other users, the level of socioeconomic disadvantage in the area, using the Pobal deprivation index, the technical merits of the project, the level of own funding available, and the amount of funding previously allocated under the programme.  At least &euro;40 million is being made available and it is planned to make allocations in tranches throughout 2021 as batches of applications are assessed, starting with applications for sports equipment in the summer followed by applications for capital works later in the year.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Senator's genuine and passionate interest in the programme.  However, the suggestion that allocations to applications under this year's round of the programme could be made over a three-year period is problematic for a number of reasons.  The sports capital programme assessment process is competitive and rewards the projects that are more likely to deliver on the programme's objectives of increasing participation, prioritising disadvantaged areas and groups and encouraging the sharing of facilities.  The Senator's proposal could be seen to reward inferior projects that do not score sufficiently high marks this year to secure funding.  The proposal would disadvantage new and worthwhile projects that intend to apply for funding under future rounds of the programme and it would effectively mean no new applications for the next three years.<\/p> <p>For these reasons, while I thank the Senator for raising this important matter, I am not in favour of making the changes to the programme that he has proposed.  As demonstrated by the number of applications this year, there is very strong ongoing interest in developing local sports facilities throughout the country and it is important that the opportunity to apply is not curtailed and that investment continues to be made in the best projects that will make the most impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#G00200","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Department officials would spend months going through the same application again.  If we knew that we had a validated project and our funding application would be successful, we could be much better prepared and far more fundraising could be done.  The officials in the Department will confirm that the reality is that they often have to grant extensions of a number of years to projects because many clubs are struggling to finish the projects due to a lower percentage in funding being awarded.  My point is that we should award a higher percentage of funding, particularly during the Covid pandemic, to ensure that those projects are delivered.  That will mean that the clubs can prepare themselves, get the funding put in place and know that the applications for future projects will be successful, so that they will not have to go through the process all over again with all the red tape involved.<\/p><p>Fair enough, updated bank statements, etc., will be needed.  However, I would not place restrictions on applications being submitted for new projects.  To be honest, we are creating more bureaucracy in a system that is already clogged up.  There are over 3,000 applications in the system.  That is five times over the limit of the fund.  There will be a significant number of unsuccessful applications.  If we are going to hit the targets that we have set as a Government, we need to put more funding into sport.

We are still waiting for it to be enacted, so that parents would have more of a statutory role in terms of consultation in everything that goes on within their school.

It is more important now than ever.<\/p> <p>Today there has been an announcement of a summer play initiative, which is very welcome.  There is significant funding to encourage and support outdoor play areas.  Hopefully this lovely weather will continue during the summer.  Because of Covid-19 restrictions, there is a strong message to people to spend time outdoors.  That is wonderful for those who have appropriate play and recreational areas.   However, we need to do an audit on what is available and what is needed.  For example, in the town of Newbridge, we only have one tiny playground for a population of almost 30,000.  It was developed almost 30 years ago.  We need a new playground in Newbridge.  This is something my colleagues and I in Kildare will be taking up.

This makes a really big difference.  PDFORRA had a wonderful campaign in relation to this.  It was great to see it signed off during the week.<\/p> <p>On the consultation on the Curragh, 3,700 people made submissions.  Their biggest issues were around the level of waste and damage that is being done to the Curragh.  That is a big wake up call.  This is a terrific amenity people use, in particular during the Covid-19 pandemic.  It has been great to have it on our doorstep.  However, no more than any other area, it needs to be managed in relation to waste and illegal encampments and have places for cars to park appropriately.  There is a big piece of work for the Office of Public Works, OPW, there in looking at areas such as the Curragh to ensure people enjoy it in appropriate and practical way and ensure there is constant monitoring and a management system for waste and illegal encampments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#K00500","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

In an age where we rely on technology more and more in our daily lives, the cyber attack is a wake-up call to all organisations, State and private, that store sensitive data on behalf of people.  As we in the House know, the ability to be able to get answers to representations from the HSE and Department of Health has been severely curtailed as a result of the cyber attack. <\/p><p>The issue I would like to raise today is the knock-on effect of this and the inability of patients to be able to get the required medical documentation that they need for appeals for applications such as disability and carer's allowance.  As we know, reviews have to be submitted within 21 to 28 days.  However, due to the cyber attacks I am dealing with a couple of constituents who are close to the expiry date for submitting a review but they cannot get access to the required medical documentation they need because the system is obviously not backed up and operational.  Given the exceptional circumstances that we find ourselves in, it is necessary to extend that deadline for reviews and appeals until the system is fully up and running.  We cannot and should not have a situation where people, through no fault of their own, have to submit new applications as a result of the system attack. <\/p><p>I ask that the Leader organise a debate where the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, could come to the House to discuss this and associated matters.

No doubt if James Joyce was here he would say, &quot;Viking me Aarhus&quot;.<\/p><p>On to more serious matters.  There is light at the end of the tunnel regarding Covid, but there has been no let up in how aspects of it are being mishandled by official Ireland.  I spoke last week about how outrageous it was for the Government to seek an extension of its emergency powers until next February, some five months after it told us everyone in the country would have been vaccinated.  As we know, on Saturday Dr. Tony Holohan tweeted about crowds socialising in Dublin city centre.  As has been the pattern for 12 months or more, within 12 hours of the tweet the usual competition started.  The Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Minister of State for European affairs, among others, all scrambled to issue statements agreeing with Dr. Holohan in ever more solemn and foreboding tones.  Within 24 hours of that tweet the T&aacute;naiste was threatening local knockdowns and talking about a possible fourth wave of the virus.  <\/p><p>Exactly what had changed between the announcement of the easing of restrictions at teatime on Friday and Sunday morning when the T&aacute;naiste made this threat?  What new knowledge had emerged to justify that change?  If the Government seriously fears a fourth wave, why did it sign off on an easing of restrictions on Friday night?  The answer to all of this is, of course, that nothing new had emerged.  All that had changed was Dr. Holohan's tweet.  I do not like the dynamic that a tweet from the Chief Medical Officer sends the country and its leadership into a spiral of activity of this kind. <\/p><p>It used to be the case that backbench Deputies and Senators were the ones scrambling to curry favour with Ministers and the Taoiseach.  These days, it is the Taoiseach and Ministers who are scrambling to curry favour with the Chief Medical Officer.  He is a civil servant who works for, and is supposed to be answerable to, them.  Important policy statements made in response to tweets is no way to run a country.  <\/p><p>I heard Senator John McGahon speak eloquently about the impact of the pandemic on young people and the associated restrictions.

The extreme overreaction to people socialising in the first proper weekend of sunshine this year shows that civil servants and Ministers cannot get their heads around the fact that as restrictions are eased people will have more freedom and will expect to exercise that freedom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#L00200","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Today is a very important day because the Government's national economic recovery plan has been published.

The report is now a year overdue.  Current reduced rates of jobseeker's allowance for young people are far too low to support even a minimum standard of living, which is set at &euro;250.  That the Government is dragging its heels suggests that the poverty impact assessment has underlined what we already know.<\/p> <p>The pandemic has affected young workers most.  Recent Central Statistics Office, CSO, results show that 59% of young people aged from 15 years to 24 years were unemployed in March.  This represents one of the highest levels of youth unemployment we have ever seen.  It is not good enough that young people are also subject to shocking rates of social welfare support.  I call on the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, to publish that poverty impact assessment.  The National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, has consistently stated that the imposition of a lower rate of jobseeker's allowance on people under the age of 24 years is contrary to Article 40.1 of the Constitution.  It must be restored immediately.  We cannot exit the pandemic with young people on lower rates of social welfare.  They have the same cost of living, same cost of food and the same cost of transport.  It is even more for housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#M00200","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 19 be taken before No. 1.  I am introducing the Employment Equality (Amendment) (Non-Disclosure Agreements) Bill 2021 in the Seanad.  If passed, the Bill will restrict the use of legal non-disclosure agreements, NDAs, in the workplace following incidents of sexual harassment or discrimination under the equality legislation.  It would ensure that the only NDAs that would be legally enforceable after such incidents would be those that were requested by the victim to protect the victim's confidentiality.  No other NDAs after workplace sexual harassment or discrimination would be permitted.  There will always be a need for ensuring legal confidentiality, for example, to protect sensitive information in the commercial or legal sectors, but the main legal effect of a NDA following sexual harassment is to silence the victim of the perpetrator from speaking out and to release employers from their obligation to hold perpetrators properly accountable for the actions.  With the growth of the #MeToo movement and Ireland's continued reckoning with a shameful history and culture of silencing the vulnerable, these agreements should not be an option to force victims of harassment and discrimination to remain silent.  They should be banned.  I ask all Members to give the Bill their support.<\/p><p>Members will have received an email notifying them that I will hold an event about the Bill next Thursday.  We have also carried out some research, and there will be a motion before the House in the coming months on the use of NDAs especially in the university sector.  This Bill applies to all NDAs.  The research has provided us with a massive amount of insight into how widespread the use of NDAs is in Ireland.  However, many people are afraid to speak up and will only speak anonymously because they are afraid of losing their livelihood and mortgages.  Some women have been paid off with as little as &euro;5,000 in severance and told they can never speak about the abuse, bullying or discrimination they endured in the workplace.  Then it is framed as if it is in the best interests of the victim.  Anybody who wishes to attend the briefing can register on <i>Eventbrite.com<\/i>.  We will have four amazing women who have been challenging NDAs around the world: Zelda Perkins, who was the first to challenge the Harvey Weinstein NDA; Professor Julie Macfarlane, who was successfully sued for defamation for refusing to give false character references for a serial abuser in a university in Canada; Georgina Calvert-Lee, who is a senior counsel in the UK and has been challenging NDAs there; Ifeoma Ozoma, another amazingly brave woman who has been challenging the NDA culture in the United States and who challenged the NDA she signed with Pinterest.

While I welcome the reopening of aviation on 19 July, I still believe that the lack of antigen testing - and the prospect of being aligned with all European countries or becoming an outlier - is a real concern.  The fact that we are not reopening until 19 July is a concern in terms of job losses.<\/p> <p>I would also like the Minister to make a statement on the incident in Belarus.  While I welcome the investigation by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, I believe most people would agree that the blame for everything that happened lies solely with Belarus and the authorities there.  Everything I say today does not take away from the fact that the blame totally lies in Belarus.  I welcome the sanctions imposed by the EU on Belarus.  We need to look at ourselves and what we can do differently to make sure that something like this does not happen again, however.  The transcript of the air traffic controller's communications with the plane was released last week.  One can read the conversations between the air traffic controller and the pilot.  One can get the sense from the pilot that there were concerns, and certainly scepticism, about the information being relayed to him.  The time from when he was told there was a bomb on the plane to when he actually turned around and went to Minsk was 18 minutes.  That is a lifetime in the air before a person actually makes the decision to turn around.<\/p> <p>On all Ryanair flights, there is no satphone in the cockpit.  It is important to say that there is no requirement in law to have satphones in the cockpits of planes on short-haul flights.  There is a requirement in law to have such phones on long-haul flights.  Most airlines have them but Ryanair does not.  Satphones are extremely costly pieces of equipment.  I recommend that the Minister exerts as much pressure as possible, when a review is being carried out by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, to ensure that a requirement is put in place to have a satphones on all short-haul and long-haul flights.  In this day and age, a pilot should be able to contact base to say he or she has been informed of a bomb on board and tell Dublin Airport what is happening, and that an email could be sent.  They would have been able to find out immediately that no email was sent.  We have since found out that the email was sent after the fact and they would have been able to determine very quickly that there was an individual at risk on the flight.

First, I request a debate on the urgent need for the Government to provide further supports to our sports clubs and to support the reopening of our youth clubs that are struggling to reopen their doors.  I am sure we were all excited to see our sports clubs reopening and by the prospect of attending live games again.  However, behind the reopening and the associated excitement, a great deal of financial expense and headache is involved for many clubs in trying to conform to public health guidelines and alleviating concerns in that regard.  Most clubs have been shut since early in this pandemic, with no way to fundraise or collect weekly subscriptions or membership dues.<\/p> <p>Alongside our sports clubs, our youth clubs and scout troops are also seeking financial assistance to get them back to some sort of normality.  Our children are really excited about returning to their sports clubs and-or looking forward to getting back to their youth clubs or scout troops.  The many thousands of volunteers who run these clubs are struggling, however, to put together the finances required to get these great clubs up and running again while adhering to the public health guidelines.  I would welcome if the Leader could organise a debate on youth services, youth clubs and sports clubs.<\/p> <p>I also support my colleagues who have raised concerns regarding what is happening to family homes in Donegal and Mayo due to the severe problems with mica in those areas.

Recovery is in sight now, however.  Passenger numbers week on week have started to recover, albeit slowly and from a low base.  Projections now suggest passenger traffic will take until 2024 to return to 2019 levels.  Airlines are planning for that recovery by looking at closing bases, and they have already done so in Shannon, laying off staff and not reopening some routes.  That is happening notwithstanding the provision of supports by states.  Ireland has already put significant resources into Aer Lingus in the form of a loan of &euro;150 million and other supports.  We understand more support will be required, perhaps again to the tune of &euro;150 million.<\/p> <p>Consolidation is now the buzzword once again, however, and this means routing many flights through just one base.  More than likely that base will be Dublin, much to the loss of Shannon, the west, the mid-west and probably Cork.  While such consolidation may help to return airlines to future viability and profitability, it will also have a devastating impact on connectivity.  If the regions of this country are to have some chance of recovering from the impact of the pandemic, then drastic action must be taken to protect vital, strategic connectivity into those regions, especially into the mid-west and Shannon areas.<\/p> <p>I call for a debate about a decision the Government must take, namely, to take a strategic investment stake in Aer Lingus.  The Government has already invested in the form of a loan provided from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, of approximately &euro;150 million, and perhaps up to another &euro;150 million will be provided by way of other loans.  I believe those loans should be converted into shares and that State representatives should take a seat, or several seats, on the board of Aer Lingus to ensure and protect strategic connectivity to Ireland's regions and guarantee the country as a whole is prepared and ready to go the hard yards in helping our society and businesses recover from the awful crisis we have come through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#O00300","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Two important dates are approaching, namely, 2 June and 7 June, when the hospitality industry reopens.

As long as the Government imposed barriers in the form of public health restrictions preventing people from working, then there would be supports for people to get by.  However, many people will be anxious this morning having woken up to the news their supports will be cut, despite the restrictions persisting.  There were many sound bites from the Government in the last year regarding all of us being in this together and that there would be no cliff edge to the PUP.  However, those words will bring little comfort to the thousands of workers in the aviation, event management, hospitality and other sectors still facing restrictions.  Those sectors need a roadmap from the Government and continued supports which will run in parallel with it.<\/p> <p>The PUP has been a source of security to hundreds of thousands of people in turbulent times.  In recent months, however, recipients have had to live with serious uncertainty as they listened to kite flying by the T&aacute;naiste and others in Government regarding threatening to remove their supports.  Now, as Deputy Pearse Doherty said this morning, \"The Government has pulled the rug from under these people\".  The Government's move to reduce the PUP will result in serious negative consequences for families relying on it.  Let us not forget the PUP payments are circulating in the economy.  People receiving PUP have already expended their savings and they are spending the money they receive from the PUP in the economy.  There will be a natural tapering of the PUP payment as the country continues to reopen and people return to employment.  Last year, for example, when restrictions were lifted, 400,000 people came off the payment, while this year 125,000 people have so far come off the payment.  The numbers coming off the PUP will continue to rise, but in the meantime the Government is duty-bound to support workers who have been forced out of work through no fault of their own.  We of course support the public health measures, but we must continue to target supports for workers and businesses that remain impacted by restrictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#O00600","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":74,"content":"<p>There has been much debate in these Houses in recent months concerning the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2020.

European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, tweeted at the weekend that she had received Ireland's recovery and resilience strategy without it ever having been debated in the Oireachtas and without the input of good ideas from all sides.  While it would be somewhat later than it should have been, I ask for a discussion on the recovery and resilience strategy and the good ideas on digitalisation and the environment from across the House. <\/p> <p>I will formally second the Employment Equality (Amendment) (Non-Disclosure Agreements) Bill 2021 later.  I am delighted to co-sponsor and support this initiative by my colleague, Senator Ruane.  What is important about this is that it moves from an individual justice point, which is key, to the kind of systemic change we want to see.  We know from the #MeToo movement and all of the different sectoral storytelling we have seen that it is when we lay stories alongside each other that we see the kinds of systemic changes we need in society.  It is difficult for people who have gone through harassment and abuse when they are pressed into signing non-disclosure agreements, which mean they will potentially see the same patterns of behaviour happen to others.  It causes many people great distress to feel they cannot help others by taking actions and those who have had experiences of fear then have the fear that they may breach a non-disclosure agreement inadvertently or, indeed, in the interests of justice.  This is an issue in the higher education area but it also, as the research from my colleague has shown, cuts right across many areas of Irish society.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#P00500","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I call the Leader to respond on the Order of Business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#P00600","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I am happy to accept the amendment to the Order of Business to take No. 19 before No. 1.

It goes to show that Irish companies are world leaders in excellent new technologies.  As the Senator pointed out this morning, it is an awful pity that we are selling that technology to foreign countries without taking advantage of it ourselves.  I commend the Minister of State for visiting yesterday.  I wish the company continued success.<\/p><p>Senator Boylan brought up the announcement that was made after the Cabinet meeting yesterday.  The extension of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, until the autumn will be formally announced today.  It is interesting that the Sinn F&eacute;in leader, Deputy McDonald, called for an extension to the PUP until autumn and Sinn F&eacute;in now seems to be giving out about the extension.  That is a bit ironic but there you go.<\/p><p>Senator Maria Byrne talked about two very important dates.  This ties in to the plans for the PUP in the coming months.  Between 200,000 and 250,000 people are expected to go back to work in the next number of weeks.  That will take a significant chunk of the 309,000 people who remain on the PUP.  By Jove, they want to go back to work.  The employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, will continue long after the PUP has tapered off to ensure we support those businesses to keep those jobs.  Nobody in this House should want to see anybody left on a PUP, regardless of its value.  Every single person whose job has been suspended because of, or affected by, Covid-19 over the past 14 to 16 months should be supported by the State to go back to that job, not to languish on the PUP or to be moved to a social welfare payment.  That should be our aim.<\/p><p>Senators Dooley and Ahearn asked for a debate on the aviation industry.  I will certainly organise that, probably for the week after next.  We should not be putting barriers in front of businesses when we allow them to reopen, and aviation, as we are all aware, is going to reopen on 19 July.  We seem to have taken two steps forward with the relatively quick adoption of the digital green certificate.  I thank the Government, the Department of Health and the Minister for Transport for supporting that.  However, we are going to take four steps backwards by putting in obstacles to stop people from travelling.  The European Union allows for the use of antigen tests and we in this country have not been given a valid or scientific reason for not using them.  That is an absolute disgrace.  It needs to be clarified and put on the table.  What scientific evidence is being supported by our scientific advisors that has arrived at the conclusion that we should not be supporting the use of antigen tests, like every other European country and other international countries?  Antigen tests would allow people to travel for the essential purpose of reunification of a family or, indeed, to allow people who have been cocooning and locked in their houses for the past 14 to 16 months to go to a European city or a beach if that is what they want to do.  We should not be putting obstacles in those people's way.  I will arrange that debate as soon as I can after next week.<\/p><p>Senator Ahearn also mentioned something that is very important.  Not only do we need an international investigation into the actions by the Belarusian Government in the past couple of weeks, we also need to know why Ryanair acted as it did.  I would go one step further and say that we need to bring representatives of the Commission for Aviation Regulation before the relevant Oireachtas committee to have a conversation about the events of that night and, in particular, how we are going to use satellite phones to make sure that the advantage that was used by the Belarusian Government is never again afforded the opportunity to be advanced.<\/p><p>Senator Wall talked about sports and youth clubs.  We must ensure that those clubs recover quickly from the financial restraints they have been under for the past 14 to 16 months.  That will involve State support.<\/p><p>Senator Ardagh talked about the Chinese-made vaccine the WHO has approved.  I am not sure what is causing the delay with the European Medicines Agency but I will try to find out today and come back to the Senator.  She and Senator Clifford-Lee also raised the topic of the Department of Justice and its public consultation.  It is welcome.  We need a new national domestic and gender-based violence policy, particularly because the past 14 months have highlighted just how prevalent an issue it is and how silent an operation it has been in many people's lives.  That needs to be brought out and talked about in public.<\/p><p>Senator Seery Kearney asked for statements on the national recovery plan which, as I said, I will arrange.  Senator Craughwell talked about a debate on Irish neutrality which I will also try to arrange.<\/p><p>Senator Ruane will introduce her Bill this morning and I have accepted her proposed amendment to the Order of Business.  Senator Warfield welcomed the passing of Senator Boylan's Bill and the support of the housing assistance payment last night.  It is not up to the Opposition to force the Government's hands.  Representatives of the Opposition are here to provide opposition but also to bring forward their own legislation.  That is welcome and I look forward to the passage of the legislation.<\/p><p>Senators Pauline O'Reilly and O'Loughlin talked about childcare facilities.  I agree with Senator O'Loughlin when she calls for an audit to be done by the Minister.  That audit should be conducted in every single town and village where we have a responsibility to provide outdoor play facilities for our children.  I would go one step further and say that we should have minimum requirements by population in law through guidelines from our local authorities to ensure that when local authorities develop towns and the population grows suddenly from 800 to 8,000, all of the amenities that are required for those children, young adults and, indeed, adults are developed.  I welcome that debate.  We will come back to it.<\/p><p>Senator Sherlock asked for statements on the economic recovery plan, which I will organise.  She also asked me to write a letter to the Minister with regard to a local school building in her area.  I would suggest that submitting a Commencement matter on the topic would probably get a response much more quickly, but I will write that letter today.  <\/p><p>Senator Cummins raised a matter that is incredibly important.  Most of our appeals for applications for Government services have a 21-day deadline.  That has been affected by the cyberattack on the HSE in recent weeks.  The very least that we can do and expect is for Departments with those 21-day deadlines to extend them.  I will write to the Minister for Social Protection today and ask her to address that immediately.  I will also organise a debate on social welfare in the next couple of weeks.<\/p><p>The outdoor strategy has been a considerable part of the advice that the Government and its agencies have been marketing for the past couple of weeks.  That came in for a stark critique over the weekend.  Without wanting to add to the argument, there is a responsibility on State agencies.  When we have decided that the safest place for our people to be is outdoors, State agencies must provide the services to ensure that the outdoor activity can occur.  Those agencies should not state that if those services are provided it will create a bigger problem because more people will come.  That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard from any official from Dublin City Council and he should be admonished for it.  I feel strongly about this matter.  Our officials are there to provide advice to the Government.  Nobody in this country is responsible for lecturing the Irish people as to how they behave.  If one has a problem or an issue with how people are behaving, then one advises again through the normal channels.  If one thinks people are not listening, one comes together with a campaign to support the activities one is encouraging and educates people as to the activities they should not be doing.  The lecturing tones in which the Irish people have repeatedly been admonished for what they have been doing lately leaves an awful lot to be desired.  All they have been doing is what they have been asked to do, that is, to meet each other safely outside.  We all need to check ourselves, whether we are Government advisors, health advisors, members of the Garda or politicians.  We all need to be incredibly cautious about how we talk to our Irish citizens because we certainly should not be talking down to anybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#P00700","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Senator Ruane has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, \"That No. 19 be taken before No.1.\"  The Leader has accepted the amendment.

This amendment aims to future-proof the legislation so that other relevant items of law might be incorporated in the future.

This is intended to ensure that, in accordance with the Convention on the Law of the Sea, a prosecution of a foreign national on a foreign vessel should be taken only in limited circumstances.  These include circumstances where the consequences of the offence extend to the State or if the offence is of a kind to disturb the peace of the country or the good order of the territorial sea.

This is all in the context of the kind of limbo we are in, where many of the planning measures are pushing ahead in the marine planning framework.  Perhaps we should not have put the cart before the horse and had marine protected areas with proper legislation before all these suites of measures.  I am very concerned by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage's powers in respect of planning - a check or balance in the planning area - being removed last week when two powers were consolidated.  A number of checks and balances have been eroded around marine protected areas.  Currently, we have very few protected marine areas, including the special areas of conservation that are Natura 2000 sites.  There is a concern in this regard about the erosion of some of the measures we have for protection and the lack of a new and proper mandate for marine protection.

I mention the special areas of conservation that are Natura 2000 sites.  I am looking at, for example, the Natura 2000 sites within Galway Bay.  We had a check and balance in our legislation whereby if the Minister with responsibility for planning wished to allow for development in a way that would be damaging to a Natura 2000 site, which would include those marine sites, he or she would need to get agreement from the Minister with responsibility for heritage.

In that context, it would be appropriate that we use any tool we can, including this maritime legislation, to strengthen the visibility of responsibilities in respect of restoration, protection and conservation of marine biodiversity.

It might be useful, as this Bill goes to the D&aacute;il, to clarify that the waters are incorporated in that sense because that issue must be clarified.  This is not an area that is outside the remit of the State.  The Wildlife Act very much sits within the remit, as do the territorial seas.  This is again part of the raising of ambition that I was trying to impose in some of the other areas and which is entirely within our scope.  Given the sustainable development goal on life in water, we should be aiming to strengthen that.  Perhaps it could be looked at in respect of this.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 20 simply proposes to delete a number of words.  I am happy to withdraw it for now and allow the issue to move forward.  I should clarify that my amendment would have the effect of effectively widening the application of the Dumping at Sea Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#X02200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Is the amendment being withdrawn?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#X02300","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":207,"content":"<p>No, I will press it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#X02400","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1622534400,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1622534400,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Section 27 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1622534400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Sections 28 to 33, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1622534400,"counter":211,"content":"<p>Schedules 1 and 2 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1622534400,"counter":212,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1622534400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>Bill reported without amendment.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":214,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Report Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#X03100","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021060100002#X03200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1622534400,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?
